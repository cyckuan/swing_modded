European envoys leave East Timor early after protester shot dead With UN-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ A three-member European Union diplomatic
team left troubled East Timor earlier than scheduled Tuesday, a day
after security personnel shot one pro-independence protester to
death and wounded four others.
	   The shootings, outside a Roman Catholic cathedral in the town of
Baucau, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili, took place as the
team held talks with the local bishop.
	   Clashes between rival groups of East Timorese, for and against
Indonesia rule, had also marred the three-day fact-finding tour of
the former Portuguese colony.
	   Large demonstrations were held by both sides to impress the
Jakarta-based ambassadors of Britain, the Netherlands and Austria,
who arrived Saturday.
	   Monday's slaying of a pro-independence protester was the second
in three days.
	   Indonesian military officials in Dili, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the diplomats left early Tuesday morning, several
hours ahead of schedule, fearing that more demonstrations would be
held.
	   A spokesman for the British embassy in Jakarta confirmed that
the ambassadors had left East Timor on an Indonesian military
aircraft and had arrived back in Jakarta.
	   The situation in Dili was calm Tuesday morning.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over
the half-island territory, which has endured years of guerrilla
warfare and human rights abuses.
	   Pro-independence groups want a referendum on Indonesian control
over East Timor and the release of imprisoned rebel leader, Xanana
Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian
forces.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered to free the prisoner and to
grant special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory.
	   But Habibie, who replaced longtime Indonesian autocrat Suharto
as president in May, says there will be no referendum on Indonesian
control.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's largest public sector
trade unions have voted to launch a general strike to support
telephone workers protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone
company.
	   The General Committee of Labor Organizations, an umbrella group
whose Spanish acronym is CAOS, said its member unions will strike
on July 7. Members include more than 12,000 workers with the state
water and electricity unions.
	   Monday's vote raised the stakes in the battle between the
unions, which are fighting to save their government jobs, and Gov.
Pedro Rossello, who has sought to privatize utilities, health care
and the sugar industry.
	   Sabotage by telephone workers protesting the telephone company
sale has caused more than dlrs 1.5 million in damage, the company's
president said Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, Carmen Ana Culpeper said.
	   Two telephone workers' unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9
billion sale to a consortium led by a U.S. company, GTE Corp. Labor
leaders say the sale will eliminate many jobs.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.
	   Also Monday, GTE announced that Citibank had agreed to finance
dlrs 1.5 billion of the purchase.
	   Talks on transfer of control of Puerto Rico Telephone operations
will begin ``in the coming weeks,'' GTE said in a statement.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale.

Hyundai to sell chip plant to LSI Logic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Electronics Industries Co.
said Tuesday it was selling Symbios Logic Corp., a computer chip
maker, to LSI Logic Corp. of Milpitas, California, for dlrs 760
million.
	   In February, Hyundai agreed to sell Symbios to another
California firm, Adaptec. But the deal was cancelled after the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission opposed it on grounds it might create a
market monopoly.
	   Symbios competes in some of its products with Adaptec, which
makes hardware, software and chips that help information move
through computers and telecommunications more quickly.
	   The Federal Trade Commission will review the new deal as well,
but Symbios does not compete with LSI Logic, Hyundai said.
	   Symbios employs 781 people in research and development, assembly
and testing in Fort Collins, Colorado, and 867 people in wafer
fabrication and engineering in Colorado Springs.
	   It had revenues of dlrs 614 million last year. Its products go
into computers sold by Compaq Computer Corp., Sun Microsystems
Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
	   LSI specializes in advanced non-memory chips that can offer
several functions. Most current chips offer only one function.
	   Hyundai expects to ease a cash crunch caused by South Korea's
economic crisis through the sell-off.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Attackers fired mortar shells at a
provincial capital early Tuesday, killing five people, injuring 11
and stopping the inauguration of the governor, the military said.
	   Officials suspected candidated defeated in May 11 elections
fired the shells, one of which landed near the residence of Sulu
province Gov. Sakur Tan, injuring a government worker.
	   Three shells also damaged an abandoned marine barracks,
according to Southern Command spokesman Col. Horacio Lapinit. More
than 10 shells in all were fired.
	   Sulu is on Jolo island, about 950 kilometers (590) miles south
of Manila. It is the stronghold of the Moro National Liberation
Front, the main Muslim secessionist group, which signed a peace
pact with the government in 1996.
	   Many MNLF members, however, still carry their weapons.
	   Lapinit said the military suspects that those responsible for
the shelling include a former town mayor who lost re-election and
joined forces with former MNLF commander Yusuf Jikiri, who lost the
gubernatorial race.

Central Chinese city threatened by floods 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Parts of Wuhan, a major industrial city along the
Yangtze River in central China, are flooded and waters are expected
to rise further as the river swells, state-run media reported
Tuesday.
	   Torrential rains upriver have caused the worst flooding in 50
years in Changsha, another major city to the east, the Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   It said some 200,000 people had been stranded, as parts of the
city and much of its outlying suburbs were inundated. Losses were
estimated at 4 billion yuan (dlrs 481 million).
	   About 400 people have died this year in floods triggered by
unusually heavy and early torrential rains.
	   The newspaper China Daily said 15 people had died in floods last
week in southern Guangdong province, raising an earlier death toll
of seven.
	   The report said another 64 people were injured and 50,000 people
made homeless by floods along the Pearl River, although the waters
were beginning to recede.
	   In a separate report, Xinhua said the army had rescued 100,000
people and delivered 250,000 tons of supplies to flood victims in
three southern provinces: Guangxi, Guangdong and Hunan.
	   Deadly floods caused by seasonal rains hit China each summer.
Since March, at least 21 of China's 30 provinces, regions and major
cities have been hit by flooding and storms, including usually arid
areas in the north and northwest.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Answering questions from callers on a
radio talk show, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that
China has been ``a force of stability'' in Asia's financial crisis.
He said it is now vital to restore economic growth in Japan.
	   ``We cannot see growth restored in Asia unless it is restored in
Japan,'' Clinton told a Shanghai businessman who phoned in to the
show.
	   It was a fast-talking, animated show with Clinton sitting at the
microphones of a radio studio talking to Chinese listeners through
an interpreter.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is set to join the select circle of
interplanetary spacefaring nations with the scheduled launch this
weekend of its Planet-B probe to Mars.
	   If all goes as planned, the half-ton unmanned craft will begin
beaming back photographs and experimental data from the Red Planet
in October 1999.
	   It will be the first effort by a nation other than the two
former Cold War superpowers, the United States and Russia, to visit
another world.
	   ``We've worked a long time to get this level of self-sufficiency
in space,'' Yasunori Matogawa, director of Japan's Kagoshima Space
Center, said as preparations entered their final stages Tuesday.
	   The probe is scheduled for launch from the Kagoshima center, in
southern Japan, early Saturday morning.
	   The 11 billion yen (dlrs 80 million) probe will begin its
mission atop a newly developed M-5 four-stage rocket, Japan's most
powerful launch vehicle.
	   After two swings around the Earth, the probe should gather
enough speed to make the 700 million-kilometer (440 million-mile)
voyage to Mars in 10 months.
	   Matogawa said one objective of the Planet-B program is to
examine the Martian atmosphere, both to see how it reacts to solar
winds and measure the rate at which life-giving oxygen escapes into
space.
	   While in orbit around Mars, Planet-B will also photograph the
planet's massive sand storms and use high-frequency pulses to
search for traces of water beneath its surface.
	   While the probe was designed and built in Japan, four of the
craft's 14 experiments were provided by the United States, Canada,
Sweden and Germany.
	   Japan will also rely on the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's deep space tracking network to receive the probe's
transmissions.
	   Matogawa said the probe is designed to use Japan's expertise in
atmospheric and space plasma research to compliment data collected
from U.S. probes, such as the Mars Global Surveyor currently
mapping the planet's surface.
	   Photographs from the Mars Global Surveyor last month showed a
dark patch at the bottom of a crater that could be ice _ the latest
evidence the frigid planet may once have been warm enough to
sustain life.
	   Japan's next planned missions include a robot probe in 2002 to
bring back rock samples from one of the solar system's thousands of
asteroids.
	   Matogawa said Japan's next visit to an alien planet will likely
be a probe to Mercury launched early in the next millennium.

Two weeks after Queensland success, One Nation Party wracked by schisms

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Only two weeks after a stunning defeat
in local elections, Pauline Hanson's right-wing, populist One
Nation Party is showing signs of internal division over one of its
outspoken leaders.
	   One Nation partisans on Tuesday turned on each other, with
loyalists accusing the group's organizer, David Oldfield, of being
a Rasputin who has hijacked Hanson's movement.
	   Oldfield had called party donors ``losers'' and had called many
members who had submitted policy ideas ``half-wits,'' said Hanson's
secretary, who announced her resignation Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday, Oldfield said he had ordered Hanson's biographer,
Helen Dodd, locked out of One Nation's main Queensland office until
allegations that she was conspiring with people to undermine the
party were investigated.
	   ``She was told she would have to leave the office and not be
allowed back in the office until those matters had been cleared
up,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Dodd, the author of ``Pauline _ The Hanson Phenomenon,'' said
she still did not know why Oldfield wanted her out of Hanson's
office.
	   The party is barely a year old, and it was only two years ago
that Hanson was elected to the nation's Parliament as a Queensland
independent who wanted to end Asian immigration and cut off welfare
programs for Aborigines.
	   Two weeks ago, the party changed Australia's political landscape
by capturing 11 seats in Queensland's state Parliament and
threatening a similar feat in the upcoming national election.
	   Meanwhile, Hanson's personal secretary Barbara Hazelton resigned
from her post, citing Oldfield's ``overwhelming influence'' on
Hanson.
	   She said Hanson had allowed herself to be manipulated by
Oldfield, and that One Nation had become ``David Oldfield's One
Nation,'' the Australian newspaper reported.
	   Hazelton said Hanson had often been distressed by Oldfield's
influence, and that some One Nation members were seeking legal
advice on whether he and the party's federal director David
Ettridge could be removed.
	   Oldfield rejected Hazelton's claims as petty jealousy.
	   ``She's a disgruntled person who didn't get her way,'' Oldfield
told ABC radio.
	   Oldfield also said her allegation that he had referred to party
donors as losers and members who had submitted policy ideas as
``half-wits'' were ``lies intended to besmirch me and make the
story more inflammatory and make people upset towards me.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ As their team bowed out of soccer's World
Cup, Mexicans watched with pride _ and disturbances that left one
youth gravely injured.
	   More than 10,000 people watched the game Monday on a
giant-screen television in Mexico City's main plaza, the Zocalo,
cheering wildly as Mexico took a 1-0 lead over Germany early in the
second half.
	   But most of the crowd quickly dissolved after the match ended in
a 2-1 victory for the European team, and the crowds in general were
much tamer than the bottle-throwing mobs that turned out after
Mexico's previous World Cup matches.
	   Still, police arrested some 53 people, and Oscar Rivas Medina,
19, suffered skull injuries when a small explosive struck him in
the head. He underwent several hours of surgery.
	   Dozens of youths, some in school uniforms, looted newsstands and
soft-drink trucks in the Zocalo before order was restored.
	   Television Azteca reported that a youth depressed over the loss
tried to hang himself in the northern city of Monterrey, but rescue
workers arrived in time to save his life.
	   Most, however, found plenty to celebrate. Few had expected
Mexico to advance to the World Cup's second round, and there was
little disgrace in losing to Germany, one of the best teams.
	   ``They gave some extremely cool moments to the entire nation. As
athletes, they demonstrated a world-class quality,'' Mario Sosa,
23, said after watching the game in the Zocalo. ``We think we
should be really proud of the team.''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo called the team after the game to
offer congratulations. He said its performance ``has been an
example not only of its extraordinary athletic capacity, but also
of its enormous character, its extraordinary spirit and, above all,
its desire to win.''
	   Police boosted security after celebrations of last week's 2-2
tie with Belgium resulted in 164 arrests and more than 90 injuries
_ four of them severe. Hundreds of police in riot gear surrounded
the Angel of Independence Monument or were posted nearby, but they
appeared to have few problems with the many fans who gathered there
to honor the fallen team.
	   ``I saw that they gave their best effort and did all they
could,'' said Alejandro Jimenez Escobar, 19, at the Zocalo. ``It
was a good game, wasn't it? Someone has to lose.''

	   Other questions from Chinese listeners covered a wide range of
issues _ education, promotion of libraries, relations with Iran and

World Cup, Clinton said Brazil would be ``hard to beat.''
	   On the Asian financial crisis, he said, ``China has done a very
good job in holding its currency stable.''
	   Brining up Japan, he noted the upcoming legislative election and

Marshall back in All Blacks squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Scrum half Justin Marshall won a
recall to the All Blacks squad Tuesday ahead of the opening
tri-nations test against Australia on July 11.
	   Marshall snapped his Achilles tendon during a match for his
Super 12 team Canterbury in March. He was expected to be sidelined
until August but made a successful return for New Zealand A on
Sunday.
	   Marshall was captain of the All Blacks during last year's tour
of Britain when Sean Fitzpatrick was injured. He missed out on
replacing Fitzpatrick in the long term with Taine Randell taking
over the job.
	   The selectors named 25 players to prepare for the tri-nations
series, with two newcomers in Auckland lock Royce Willis and hooker
Mark Hammett.
	   Veteran flanker Michael Jones also returns after missing the
second test victory against England through injury suffered in the
first test.
	   Hammett has come in for Norm Hewitt, who has been ruled out for
the rest of the year by the cruciate ligament injury he picked up
in Saturday's test.
	   New Zealand was disappointing in beating England 40-10 on
Saturday after winning the first test 64-22. Australia has won all
three of its tests convincingly while South Africa, the other
tri-nations team, posted a record score in thrashing Wales last
weekend.
	   New Zealand squad: Taine Randell (captain), Christian Cullen,
Jeff Wilson, Joeli Vidiri, Jonah Lomu, Scott McLeod, Caleb Ralph,
Walter Little, Mark Mayerhofler, Carlos Spencer, Andrew Mehrtens,
Justin Marshall, Ofisa Tonu'u, Josh Kronfeld, Mark Carter, Michael
Jones, Isitolo Maka, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Royce Willis, Olo
Brown, Craig Dowd, Carl Hoeft, Anton Oliver, Mark Hammett.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Answering questions from callers on a
radio talk show, U.S. President Bill Clinton praised China on
Tuesday as ``a force of stability'' in Asia's financial crisis. He
said it is now vital to return economic growth to Japan.
	   ``We cannot see growth restored in Asia unless it is restored in
Japan,'' Clinton told a Shanghai businessman, one of several
callers to the show.
	   It was a fast-talking, animated program with Clinton sitting at
the microphones of a radio studio talking to Chinese listeners
through an interpreter.
	   ``China has done a very good job in holding its currency
stable,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton raised the concern about Japan, noting the upcoming
legislative election and government plans to announce steps for
financial reform.
	   ``If it is a good proposal and the confidence of investors ...
is raised, then I believe you will see the situation turn around''
in Asia, Clinton said. This, he said, would ease pressure on China
and also would be important for the United States.
	   Other questions from Chinese listeners covered a wide range of
issues _ education, promotion of libraries, relations with Iran and
sports.
	   Asked to make a prediction on what country would win the World
Cup, Clinton said Brazil would be ``hard to beat.''
	   In Shanghai, Clinton turned his attention to dramatic changes in
communist China, both on the radio program and at an earlier forum
where he was told that democracy is growing, that churches should
cooperate with the government and that Chinese parents worry about
children getting chubby on American-style fast foods.
	   Clinton said there is an emerging new China ``that is more
prosperous, more open and more dynamic.''
	   ``I hope that you will help us to understand what is going on
and to speak with us frankly and openly,'' the president said at a
forum which covered a number of technical and social issues but
touched only lightly on politics.
	   America's first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invited roundtable
panelists to talk about ``the good, the bad, the hard, the easy.''
	   Zuo Xuejin, an economist and expert on migrant research, said
America has a big influence on China's young generation.
	   ``Today there are not many people who have the chance to go
abroad, but they know there are many popular American stars and
they know those popular stars' names better than I do,'' Zuo said.
``And many of the kids in China love Kentucky Fried Chicken or
McDonald's and their parents are worrying about whether there will
be problems of obesity'' _ a problem that regularly draws attention
in America.
	   Responding to one politically sensitive question, Clinton
carefully spelled out U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which China
considers a renegade province.
	   ``We don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas ...
And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any
organization for which statehood is a requirement,'' Clinton said.
	   Another participant, Bishop Jin Luxian, said religious leaders
should cooperate more with the government rather than challenge its
control of churches.
	   ``I believe, Mr. President, you are here to have more dialogue
with us, with the Chinese government, not to contend with us,''
said Jin, who belongs to an officially recognized Catholic church.
	   Part of the president's message was that the dynamic forces of
change propelling the booming economy in Shanghai, China's
high-rise financial capital, can spread prosperity throughout
China.
	   Clinton flew here late Monday from Beijing where he addressed
students at Peking University. He urged political reforms and was
challenged _ pointedly but politely _ by the youthful audience
about America's own human rights record, arm sales to Taiwan and
U.S. perceptions of China.
	   State-run television sent out Clinton's university speech live
after trying _ but failing _ to get an advance look at his address.
The American side did suggest beforehand that Clinton would not
bring up again the sensitive subject of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, as he did in a televised news conference Saturday with
President Jiang Zemin.
	   Shanghai's dazzling lights and bustling downtown were a dramatic
change from the bureaucratic capital of Beijing. Clinton and his
family got a brief look at the city's harbor from their limousine
and rode past thousands of people gawking on the streets.
	   The third stop on a five-city tour, Shanghai boasts one of the
world's most technologically advanced stock exchanges, opened last
summer, and is the headquarters in China for scores of
multinational banks from around the world.
	   Clinton on Tuesday meets with leaders from business, law, the
arts, media and the religious community _ agents of change who are
helping transform life in China and opening this country to the
world.

<TEXT>
	   MALOLOS, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former B-movie
star loved by the masses, took his oath Tuesday as the Philippines'
13th president at a church where Asia's first republic was
inaugurated a century ago.
	   Estrada, who won an overwhelming victory in elections on May 11,
has pledged to devote his six-year term to narrowing the gap
between the country's rich and poor.
	   But his presidency, which Estrada says will be his ``greatest
performance,'' is off to a rocky start after many Filipinos reacted
angrily to his decision to permit the burial of former dictator
Ferdinand Marcos at a heroes' cemetery.
	   The bitter opposition forced Estrada, a former Marcos supporter,
to reverse his decision.
	   ``No previous president has assumed office with as much
dissonance in the air,'' says political scientist Alex Magno.
	   In a symbol, however, of a remarkably smooth political
transition, Estrada rode together with outgoing President Fidel
Ramos in a horse-drawn carriage to historic Barasoain Church for
his oath taking. Ramos did not run for re-election because of a
constitutional term limit, but backed Estrada's main rival in the
polls.
	   Arrangements for Estrada's inauguration highlighted this year's
centennial of the country's declaration of independence from 333
years of Spanish colonialism.
	   Hundreds of men and women in native costumes lined the road
leading to the church, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
Manila, which was guarded by soldiers wearing revolutionary
uniforms.
	   The church, decorated with white orchids and chrysanthemums, was
where the first Philippine constitution was drafted a century ago
and where Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president, was proclaimed.
	   Estrada says he will continue most of Ramos' economic reform
policies but will focus on helping the poor and agriculture.
Police, however, prevented about 500 leftist demonstrators,
including workers, farmers and students, from approaching him
before and after the oath taking.
	   Estrada has also pledged to crack down on official corruption
and solve the country's severe crime problem within six months.
	   The new president, a college dropout with a swagger, mustache
and bouffant hairstyle, gained a devoted following among the
country's many poor during several decades as an actor in B movies,
playing tough guys who stood up against injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   He won the May 11 polls by one of the largest margins ever in a
free Philippine election. The polls were also among the
Philippines' most peaceful, although at least 45 people were
killed.
	   Many in the traditional Philippine elite have looked askance at
Estrada, considering him an undereducated buffoon with little
ability to lead the country's economy through the murky waters of
Asia's devastating currency crisis.
	   Estrada freely admits little proficiency in economics and says
he will depend on a stable of 30 economic advisers who range from
leftist academics to conservative bankers.
	   He also openly acknowledges a history of womanizing, heavy
drinking and gambling, but insists he now has given up all vices _
including cigarette smoking, which he quit several weeks ago.
	   His landslide victory prompted many to predict a long political
``honeymoon'' as president. But in addition to the divisive
decision to allow Marcos' burial, Estrada also has taken on much of
the Philippine Congress with a pledge to eliminate ``pork barrel''
funds often misused by congressmen.
	   All three unions at beleaguered Philippine Airlines _ owned by
an important Estrada backer _ also plan a demonstration Wednesday
demanding that Estrada take action in response to the carrier's
recent massive layoffs.
	   And Estrada faces a revolt from the popular head of the Subic
Bay special economic zone, who refuses to step down after being
fired by the new president over personal differences.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Attackers fired mortar shells at a
provincial capital early Tuesday, killing at least five people,
injuring 11 and stopping the inauguration of the governor, the
military said.
	   Officials suspected candidates defeated in May 11 elections
fired the shells, one of which landed near the residence of Sulu
province Gov. Sakur Tan, injuring a provincial government employee,
Southern Command spokesman Col. Horacio Lapinid said.
	   Three shells also damaged an abandoned marine barracks, Lapinid
said. More than 10 shells in all were fired.
	   Sulu is on Jolo island, about 950 kilometers (590) miles south
of Manila. It is the stronghold of the Moro National Liberation
Front, the main Muslim secessionist group, which signed a peace
pact with the government in 1996.
	   Many MNLF members, however, still carry their weapons.
	   Lapinid said the military suspects that those responsible for
the shelling include a former town mayor who lost re-election and
joined forces with former MNLF commander Yusuf Jikiri, who lost the
gubernatorial race.

Clinton sounds American campaign themes in China An AP News Analysis AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Half a world from home, U.S. President
Bill Clinton is campaigning again _ for change in China, with
themes and words echoing those he used in seeking to persuade
American voters to choose his path into the 21st century.
	   This campaign is for ideas, and for an enhanced relationship
with Beijing, because ``the way the world is changing ... our two
nations will be far better off working together than apart.''
	   So he talks of economic security, of the jobs that can flow from
efforts to act against environmental pollution, of the vital role
of education in the new millennium and of freedom as a linchpin for
progress.
	   American liberty and freedom are a given in any U.S.
politician's rhetoric. But this is China, where Clinton's calls for
human rights have gained something _ controversy _ in the
translation.
	   Clinton imported the tested techniques of American politics for
his nine-day journey through China, the round-table talks with
citizens, a stint on a Shanghai radio call-in show, speeches that
stayed on message, usually human rights, even a Beijing version of
a nationally televised debate with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Clinton vs. Jiang was not an argument to match the Kitchen
Debate of 1959, when then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev disputed their rival systems _ and
their weapons _ using a model American kitchen on display in Moscow
as a backdrop. That was a Cold War argument, a different time.
	   Far from brandishing weaponry, Clinton and Jiang did their
debating after announcing an agreement to turn the targeting
systems of their nuclear weapons away from one another, a largely
symbolic gesture, but a step closer in a relationship they had said
in 1997, prematurely, would become a constructive strategic
partnership.
	   For Clinton, the pressure on human rights is both a
philosophical commitment and a political necessity, given the
complaints he got from Congress about coming here and, especially,
about appearing at Tiananmen Square, for the symbolism of it.
	   To counter those critics, from congressional Republicans to
liberals and human rights groups, Clinton pressed the issue with
officials and raised it in his public pronouncements.
	   China gave him a TV audience, on Saturday and again with a live
broadcast of his speech on Monday. White House press secretary
Michael McCurry said it demonstrated the greater willingness of the
Chinese government to open the society to political debate. Despite
technical glitches and apparent hitches in the U.S. translation
into Chinese, it was seen by the White House as an opening to get
Clinton's message to hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese
citizens, unprecedented because it was live, without editing.
	   And while the focus was, as intended, on human rights, Clinton
spoke also of an array of issues that had been aspects of his own
campaigns, for election and for his programs in Congress.
	   He said a changing China will need new systems to train workers,
to provide social security, to deal with health care costs and with
the environment.
	   A generally stolid audience at his university speech cheered
critical student questions _ seven were asked _ more often than
they applauded Clinton during his set speech. Clinton said that was
OK, he learned more by listening to critics than when he was
talking himself.
	   But the mood changed and they cheered him when he called for
new, youth-driven efforts to improve the environment, a grave
problem in China, as evident as the gray smog that clouds Beijing.
	   He said the young must take the lead, in China and other lands,
``because political leaders will never be willing to do anything
about it if they believe it will lead to large-scale unemployment
or more poverty.''
	   It need not, he said, as he had in rebuking Republicans on the
same issue in his 1992 campaign and since. Done right, he said,
environmental projects can spur economic growth and better-paying
jobs.
	   So, too, he said, human rights can foster progress and order an
information age, when ideas flow freely and no government can
prevent it.
	   ``We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability and helps nations to change,'' he said.
	   Clinton may not be persuading them. But campaigning is trying
to, and that's what he is doing.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ American first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton cut the ribbon Tuesday to open a high-tech children's
hospital built with U.S. help.
	   ``This is a very impressive hospital for anywhere in the
world,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Certainly the relationship between
our two peoples has no greater objective than improving conditions
for the children of both countries.''
	   Project Hope, a U.S. health-oriented charity, and the Shanghai
government spent some dlrs 100 million equipping the Shanghai
Children's Medical Center and sending doctors, nurses and other
staff abroad for training.
	   U.S. specialists are to visit for seminars at the hospital with
Chinese doctors from throughout the country.
	   Mrs. Clinton participated in the ceremonies with Guo Huanchen,
deputy mayor of Shanghai.
	   The hospital began treating patients June 1. It grew out of a
1980s Project Hope training program for Chinese pediatric heart
surgeons run by Dr. Richard Jonas, a specialist at Boston
Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. After training, the
surgeons raised their patients' survival rate from 65 percent to 97
percent and began taking on harder cases, Project Hope says.

Howard evades early election with deal on Aboriginal land rights 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to updates with some details of the deal
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trailing badly in opinion polls,
Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday avoided calling an early
election by apparently reaching a deal on an Aboriginal land rights
bill deadlocked in the Senate.
	   The bill, which has angered the country's 386,000 Aborigines, is
still being negotiated with Tasmanian independent Brian Harradine,
who holds the balance of power in the upper house.
	   But Harradine told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that a
compromise was reached in principle, and the details were being
ironed out.
	   ``All things are practically settled except there's a few dead
cats being thrown in into the ring at the moment,'' Harradine told
the domestic news agency Australia Associated Press.
	   A government official said on condition of anonymity that the
terms of the deal include the government agreeing to remove a
so-called sunset clause which sets a deadline for registration of
native title claims.
	   In return, Harradine will agree to remove a clause that gave
native title claimants the right to negotiate with miners on ranch
leases.
	   Howard declined to confirm the deal and said meetings with
Harradine were continuing.
	   Howard told a meeting of his party he was ``hopeful'' of
reaching a deal, but ``we're not prepared to reach an agreement
that won't stand the test of time.''
	   Howard's plan to restrict native title rights on government
lands leased to farmers, ranchers and miners, recognized by the
country's most powerful judicial body, the High Court, had been
blocked by the Senate.
	   He has been planning to break that stalemate by taking both
houses of Parliament to an early election in a procedure called a
double dissolution.
	   With Parliament due to go into recess this week, that would have
meant calling the election within days and holding it in August.
	   Such a move would have been political suicide for Howard,
according to a new public opinion poll published Tuesday in The
Australian newspaper.
	   The Newspoll survey showed the opposition Labor Party poised to
win back government after conservative support slumped to the
lowest level _ 34 percent _ on record during its term of office.
	   Conservative voters appeared to be continuing to defect to
Pauline Hanson's new right-wing, populist One Nation Party, as they
did in the Queensland state election in June, the newspaper said.
	   That split the conservative vote in Queensland and resulted in
the opposition Labor Party capturing the government there.
	   ``The government has dropped from an election-winning lead of 7
percentage points to trail by an election-losing 11 points in six
weeks that have been dominated by One Nation's campaign and
electoral success in Queensland,'' the paper said.
	   The Newspoll, taken last weekend, showed that at 45 percent,
Labor is back to its highest level of support since the March 1996
election and One Nation's 13 percent is a new national high, The
Australian said.
	   The margin of error was not provided, but Newspoll's results
usually have a plus-or-minus margin of 2 to 3 percent.
	   Aborigines reacted angrily to news of a deal on the native title
bill. Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation spokeswoman
Jennifer Tannoch-Bland said Harradine would become the ``instrument
of national disgrace'' if he allowed the bill to pass.

Ramos leaves legacy of working democracy in Philippines 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Philippines-Estrada
By OLIVER TEVES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ When Fidel Ramos took office as
president in 1992, his predecessor, Corazon Aquino, had survived
seven coup attempts and democracy was barely intact.
	   As he stepped down Tuesday, Ramos left a legacy of democracy
that can work for a poor country in a region with a long history of
strongman rule.
	   At times during his six-year term, the 70-year-old former
general appeared tempted to abandon some of the democratic
institutions that were restored after dictator Ferdinand Marcos was
ousted in a 1986 ``people power'' revolt that Ramos helped lead.
	   More often, however, he supported the ``rowdy'' Filipino brand
of democracy that other Asian leaders said was a hindrance to
growth.
	   Referring to Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew's advice that
Filipinos should give up some freedoms to develop economically,
Ramos said, ``We're proud that we did not have to tamper with the
Filipino's freedom-loving nature.''
	   ``We have proven that democracy and development are not only
compatible but reinforce one another,'' he told businessmen last
week.
	   His administration succeeded in establishing relative political
stability after years of turmoil, economic growth, and a reduction
of poverty _ officially from 41 percent of the population when he
took office to about 30 percent now.
	   The Philippines ``has become a model of democracy in this part
of the world ... enjoying political stability and economic
viability unlike many of our neighbors,'' Ramos said.
	   He said he wants to be remembered primarily for forging peace
accords with military and Muslim rebels and bringing Marxist
guerrillas to the negotiating table, laying the ground for economic
growth.
	   ``Peace is the foundation of everything we have gained under my
watch,'' Ramos said. ``With peace, we have been able to devote more
of our attention and resources to the tasks of development.''
	   Soon after taking office, Ramos sent representatives to meet
communist rebels and Muslim secessionist leaders living abroad to
initiate peace talks.
	   Although both the communist insurgency and the separatist
rebellion have waned over the years due to factionalism, surrenders
and battle losses, the talks established a general atmosphere of
peace welcomed by everyone.
	   In September 1996, the main Muslim rebel group, the Moro
National Liberation Front, signed a peace accord with the
government. Small gains have been made in talks with the
communists, but no major agreement has been approved by Ramos.
	   He also ended military unrest, which had erupted into coup
attempts against former President Aquino, with peace agreements
with army rebels.
	   Continuing the Aquino administration's policy of ``getting
government out of business,'' Ramos pursued privatization of state
assets and the liberalization and deregulation of the economy,
dismantling monopolies in key industries such as
telecommunications.
	   Business leaders say such policies are paving the way for the
Philippines' entry into the new global trading system and enhancing
its competitiveness in the world market.
	   ``For his administration's efforts, we are no longer the sick
man of Asia, but are alive, well, jogging, and kicking,'' says
Prof. Chito Salazar of the Manila-based Asian Institute of
Management.
	   Despite the gains, serious problems remain.
	   The financial crisis which has been battering Asia since July
1997 and the El Nino-induced drought created rising unemployment
and food shortages, particularly in the southern Philippines.
	   A 10-year land reform program, which started under the Aquino
government, has only been partly completed. Critics say the Ramos
government's agriculture policy of promoting high-value crops has
undermined both land reform and food security.
	   The ballooning number of urban slum dwellers and housing
shortages have not been solved despite the Ramos administration's
mass housing projects.
	   And despite Ramos' military and police training, major crimes _
particularly kidnappings _ still plague the country.
	   After stepping down, Ramos says he plans to give both solicited
and unsolicited advice to the new government of President Joseph
Estrada after establishing a think-tank that will focus on
governance, economic diplomacy and security.

Report: South Pacific nuclear tests not threatening to human health 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS to ADD details, background.
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French nuclear tests in the South Pacific over the
past three decades have left ``extremely modest radiation levels''
that pose no threats to people, the International Atomic Energy
Agency said Monday.
	   A 2,000-page IAEA study compiled by dozens of scientists from 18
countries was requested by the French government after testing
stopped in French Polynesia in 1996.
	   The testing had made France a virtual pariah on the world stage,
especially to nations of the South Pacific, a region it led and
shaped for 200 years.
	   Australia and New Zealand, as well as several tiny island-states
claimed the atomic tests could have harmed the fragile environment.
The last tests ending early in 1996 drew especially strident
protests from these nations as well as environmental groups.
	   France maintained the tests caused no lasting harm and requested
the independent analysis.
	   The study, released Monday, said radioactive material in the
earth and sea around Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls was ``at
generally very low concentrations,'' and ``of no radiological
significance.''
	   The study _ which will be presented to a June 30-July 3 congress
in Vienna of government officials and scientists _ found that
lingering nuclear contamination was unlikely to damage the natural
environment.
	   IAEA officials said they arrived at their conclusions by
studying marine life and vegetation, and water and air samples.
	   But the study also said there were four small zones in remote
areas with excessive plutonium levels as a result of earlier
atmospheric tests in the 1960s.
	   IAEA spokesman David Kyd said there would be no danger posed to
human life even if there was a ``catastrophic scenario'' such as a
landslide under lagoons where explosions were carried out.
	   France exploded at least 123 nuclear bombs in the volcanic rock
underneath Mururoa Atoll between 1975 and 1996 and eight under
nearby Fangataufa Atoll.
	   The report added that there would be ``no change'' in cancer
incidence rates in the region attributable to radiation exposure
caused by radioactive material at and around the sites.
	   In 1996, France announced it would stop nuclear tests, sign the
nuclear test ban treaty, and return the islands to the civil
authorities of French Polynesia in pristine condition by 1998.
	   France said the last series of tests was necessary to ensure the
viability of its nuclear arsenal and develop simulation technology.

Howard evades early election with deal on Aboriginal land rights 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: DELETES extraneous word in 4th graf
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trailing badly in opinion polls,
Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday avoided calling an early
election by apparently reaching a deal on an Aboriginal land rights
bill deadlocked in the Senate.
	   The bill, which has angered the country's 386,000 Aborigines, is
still being negotiated with Tasmanian independent Brian Harradine,
who holds the balance of power in the upper house.
	   But Harradine told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that a
compromise was reached in principle, and the details were being
ironed out.
	   ``All things are practically settled except there's a few dead
cats being thrown into the ring at the moment,'' Harradine told the
domestic news agency Australia Associated Press.
	   A government official said on condition of anonymity that the
terms of the deal include the government agreeing to remove a
so-called sunset clause which sets a deadline for registration of
native title claims.
	   In return, Harradine will agree to remove a clause that gave
native title claimants the right to negotiate with miners on ranch
leases.
	   Howard declined to confirm the deal and said meetings with

Man-eating crocodile killed with help of witch doctor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)_ Using a lethal combination of magic
and skill, a village witch-doctor in eastern Malaysia killed a
crocodile that had devoured a fisherman, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Nyalih ak Nengalie, medicine man in the village of Sri Aman, put
a spell on the dead fisherman's dog and then set it out as bait for
the crocodile, the Star daily said.
	   The reptile was captured by villagers when it came to eat the
dog. They then quickly hacked the crocodile into several pieces to
be cooked and served at a feast in the village, located in remote
Sarawak state on the island of Borneo.
	   The 6-meter- (19.8-feet-) long crocodile had attacked the
27-year-old fisherman June 15 while he was mooring his boat to a
pier on a lake.
	   Villagers sought help from the magician, called ``bomoh'' in
Malay, after they failed to kill the crocodile with bullets.

Auckland electric blackout causes company loss 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) - Auckland electricity supplier
Mercury Energy says it faces losses of U.S. dlrs 64 million (128
million New Zealand dollars) for the power failures that plunged
the center city into blackouts for five weeks in February and
March.
	   Mercury chairman Jim Macaulay said the company had set the
amount aside to cover ``all known and expected'' costs associated
with the central business district power failures.
	   The figure only covers the direct liability of Mercury to power
users.
	   Downtown businesses earlier estimated their collective losses at
U.S. dlrs 50 million (100 million NZ dollars) a week during each of
the five weeks of the blackout.
	   That amount was considered conservative by economists, since it
didn't account for long-term losses in tourism or international
investment and trade, or personal losses by those who lived
downtown.
	   While Mercury has paid some compensation to some affected
businesses and reduced power bills for others, at least one group
of central city business owners say they will soon sue Mercury to
claim their losses.
	   The group, which claims the support of at least 200 local
business owners, has dismissed the company offer of compensation as
completely inadequate.
	   Mercury on Tuesday reported a net loss of U.S. dlrs 12.7 (25.3
million NZ dollars) for the year to March 31 as a result of the
blackout.
	   The company last year reported an after-tax profit of U.S. dlrs
41 million (82.1 million NZ dollars).
	   A government inquiry into the power crisis, which was resolved
with the construction of emergency twin overhead supply cables into
the city, is expected to report its findings shortly.
	   Macaulay said the company was prepared for the findings,
whatever they were.
	   The company firmly believed the successive failure of the four
major supply cables feeding the central city had been due to a
combination of factors, triggered by record hot and dry conditions.
	   It has consistently rejected any claims of negligence or poor
management of the power supply into the heart of the country's
largest commercial center.

European envoys leave East Timor early after protester shot dead With UN-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ A three-member European Union diplomatic
team left troubled East Timor earlier than scheduled Tuesday, a day
after security personnel shot one pro-independence protester to
death and wounded four others.
	   The shootings, outside a Roman Catholic cathedral in the town of
Baucau, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili, took place as the
team held talks with the local bishop.
	   Clashes between rival groups of East Timorese, for and against
Indonesia rule, had also marred their three-day fact-finding tour
of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Large demonstrations were held by both sides to impress the
Jakarta-based ambassadors of Britain, the Netherlands and Austria,
who arrived Saturday.
	   Monday's slaying of a pro-independence protester was the second
in three days.
	   Indonesian military officials in Dili, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the diplomats left early Tuesday morning _ several
hours ahead of schedule _ fearing that more demonstrations would be
held.
	   A spokesman for the British embassy in Jakarta confirmed that
the ambassadors had left East Timor on an Indonesian military
aircraft and had arrived back in Jakarta.
	   The situation in Dili was calm Tuesday morning. Even so dozens
of riot police armed with sticks and shields erected barbed wire
barricades around the territory's main government office, which had
been attacked by stone-throwing mobs during the weekend.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over
the half-island territory, which has endured years of guerrilla
warfare and human rights abuses.
	   Pro-independence groups want a referendum on Indonesian control
over East Timor and the release of imprisoned rebel leader, Xanana
Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian
forces.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered to free the prisoner and to
grant special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory.
	   But Habibie, who replaced longtime Indonesian autocrat Suharto
as president in May, says there will be no referendum on Indonesian
control.
	   East Timor is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic in mostly Muslim
Indonesia.
	   The territory's spiritual leader Bishop Carlos Belo, the
co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, condemned Monday's
shootings.
	   ``These were young people who only wanted to make known their
aspirations. So why were they shot? Why wasn't a warning shot fired
into the air first?'' he said to reporters Tuesday.

Japan health officials investigate Viagra magazine story 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese weekly magazine is being investigated
for offering to take orders from readers for the impotency drug
Viagra, a government official said Tuesday.
	   The magazine, Shukan Gendai, is suspected of having broken
Japanese pharmaceutical laws. Viagra has not yet been approved by
the Health and Welfare Ministry and sales in Japan are banned.
	   ``If there's been any violation, we will take appropriate
measures,'' said ministry official Toru Yamamoto.
	   The investigation comes as the ministry is moving to speed up
the approval of the drug by using U.S. scientific data rather than
relying on tests in Japan, officials said Tuesday.
	   Shukan Gendai's July 11 edition includes postcard-sized order
forms that readers can fill out and send to the publisher, Kodansha
Ltd. The magazine offers to forward the orders to a company that
could get 10 pills for dlrs 190.
	   An article in the same issue details the booming black market
for the drug in Japan, where a single Viagra pill reportedly can
sell for 50,000 yen (dlrs 355).
	   The magazine also describes the various ways Japanese can buy
the drug _ mail-order companies, the Internet or special Viagra
shopping trips to the United States arranged by a Japanese travel
agency.
	   ``We're happy to help our readers obtain Viagra at the proper
price, and find a solution to a problem they've had for a long
time,'' the magazine said in the article.

Hong Kong Newspaper editor jailed for contempt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In what a judge called an unprecedented case of
contempt, a former newspaper editor was sentenced Tuesday to four
months in jail for ordering paparazzi-style surveillance of a
senior judge and printing ``abusive and scurrilous'' attacks on the
judiciary.
	   Wong Yeung-ng, former chief editor of the Chinese-language
Oriental Daily News, one of Hong Kong's largest and raciest, was
found in contempt of court last week for launching a ``campaign
against the court.''
	   High Court Judge Patrick Chan said the campaign undermined
public confidence in the justice system. He said the case, the
first case in the territory involving the harassment of a judge,
was probably ``the most serious case of contempt ever encountered
in the common law world.''
	   Chan also fined Oriental Daily Press, the paper's holding
company, 5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 641,025) for
publishing the articles. However, the court had determined that the
holding company was not responsible for the surveillance.
	   The high-profile case has attracted extensive media attention.
On Monday, TV footage showed journalists who were trying to talk to
Ma Ching-fat, chairman of Oriental Daily Press, scuffling with the
group's staff members outside the courthouse.
	   An executive of the newspaper was later arrested after a
photographer accused him of assault, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   To avoid further scuffles, Chan allowed Ma to leave the
courthouse Tuesday through a special corridor reserved for judges.
	   Ma was acquitted last week of the same charges because of a lack
of evidence.
	   The newspaper has frequent brushes with the law over its racy
contents. Early this year, Oriental Daily had reporters mount a
paparazzi-style round-the-clock watch on Justice Gerald Godfrey
after he ruled against the paper in a battle with a rival
newspaper.
	   The paper said it was dissatisfied that Godfrey had likened a
senior Oriental Daily reporter, who spotted and photographed a
pregnant Hong Kong pop star, to a paparazzo. It said it wanted to
teach the judge ``a lesson'' about how true paparazzi behave.
	   In a series of articles, the paper called judges and members of
a tribunal policing pornography ``swinish white-skinned pigs'' and
``mangy yellow-skinned dogs,'' and warned that it would ``wipe them
all out.''
	   Chan said Tuesday he reduced Wong's original eight-month jail
term to four because he believed Wong ``might have been instructed
or encouraged'' to launch the campaign by others, such as Ma or the
company's other directors.
	   Wong had told the court he was solely responsible for the
campaign, but Chan said he was ``skeptical'' of his claim. Chan
said he suspected there might be a deal for Wong to take full
responsibility ``to enable others to be exonerated.''
	   The newspaper's behavior has been roundly criticized in Hong
Kong, even by groups that have campaigned for press freedoms.
	   The Hong Kong Journalists Association had described the action
of the Oriental Daily as harmful, saying that it had damaged the
reputation of journalism.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action suit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
suit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action suit, representing five victims of the
Holocaust, asks U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to award
compensatory and punitive damages from the Swiss National Bank, the
country's central bank.
	   The bank has said any obligations arising from World War II
dealings have been settled in a 1946 treaty and it rejects the
jurisdiction of any U.S. court to handle such a case against a
sovereign country.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate,
multibillion suit in New York against Swiss commercial banks.
	   A independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The suit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the suit
said.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private

Three people injured in Punjab bomb explosion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb exploded Tuesday outside a
vegetable market on the western edge of the Punjab provincial
capital, injuring three people, police officials said.
	   They said two unidentified men left a bag at the entrance to the
vegetable market in Lahore after asking the owner to keep an eye on
it while they shopped nearby.
	   Within minutes a bomb hidden inside the bag exploded, Police
Chief Ahmed Raza said.
	   The owner of the vegetable market, Mohammed Ramazan, lost his
right arm in the explosion and two customers were hurt, Raza said.
	   He also blamed the explosion on a neighboring country _ a common
reference in Pakistan to its uneasy neighbor India.
	   In recent weeks several bombs have rattled Pakistan's eastern
Punjab province, which borders India. The government here has
repeatedly accused Indian agents of planting the explosive devices
in an attempt to destabilize the government.
	   Both India and Pakistan routinely accuse each other of terrorist
activities.

South Korea proposes joint probe into captured North Korean sub 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung proposed
Tuesday that South and North Korea jointly investigate the deaths
of nine crewmen of a captured North Korean submarine.
	   The offer was to be extended to North Korea later Tuesday at a
meeting between generals from the North and the American-led U.N.
Command at the border village of Panmunjom.
	   After the submarine was towed to shore last week, nine bodies
were found inside. South Korean officials said all had been shot,
apparently to avoid capture.
	   But North Korea said the sub had drifted into southern waters
because of mechanical problems and questioned South Korea's
explanation of the cause of death of the crew.
	   ``We need to deal aggressively with the North's unreasonable
arguments,'' the president was quoted as saying by his spokesman,
Park Ji-won.
	   On Monday, South Korea said the submarine was on a spying
mission, briefly landing three agents on the South's eastern coast,
which is dotted with airfields, naval bases and other key military
facilities.
	   What those agents did on shore was not clear, but the Defense
Ministry said they may have contacted North Korean spies already on
land, before returning to the submarine.
	   The nine bodies were discovered when the sub's hatches were
opened Friday, four days after the 70-ton craft was found tangled
in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast.
	   An analysis of gunshot wounds indicated that five of the North
Koreans were killed by the sub's captain and the three agents, who
then killed themselves, South Korean officials said.
	   President Kim asked North Korea to admit the incursion and
prevent a recurrence, but said the episode would not end civilian
exchanges and increasing cooperation to open the North's reclusive
communist society.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. The countries are still technically
at war, since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a
peace treaty.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Only two weeks after a stunning victory
in local elections, Pauline Hanson's right-wing, populist One
Nation Party is showing signs of internal division over one of its
outspoken leaders.
	   One Nation partisans on Tuesday turned on each other, with
loyalists accusing the group's organizer, David Oldfield, of being
a Rasputin who has hijacked Hanson's movement.
	   Oldfield had called party donors ``losers'' and had called many
members who had submitted policy ideas ``half-wits,'' said Hanson's
secretary, who announced her resignation Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday, Oldfield said he had ordered Hanson's biographer,
Helen Dodd, locked out of One Nation's main Queensland office until
allegations that she was conspiring with people to undermine the
party were investigated.
	   ``She was told she would have to leave the office and not be
allowed back in the office until those matters had been cleared
up,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Dodd, the author of ``Pauline _ The Hanson Phenomenon,'' said
she still did not know why Oldfield wanted her out of Hanson's
office.
	   The party is barely a year old, and it was only two years ago
that Hanson was elected to the nation's Parliament as a Queensland
independent who wanted to end Asian immigration and cut off welfare
programs for Aborigines.
	   Two weeks ago, the party changed Australia's political landscape
by capturing 11 seats in Queensland's state Parliament and
threatening a similar feat in the upcoming national election.
	   Meanwhile, Hanson's personal secretary Barbara Hazelton resigned
from her post, citing Oldfield's ``overwhelming influence'' on
Hanson.
	   She said Hanson had allowed herself to be manipulated by
Oldfield, and that One Nation had become ``David Oldfield's One
Nation,'' the Australian newspaper reported.
	   Hazelton said Hanson had often been distressed by Oldfield's
influence, and that some One Nation members were seeking legal
advice on whether he and the party's federal director David
Ettridge could be removed.
	   Oldfield rejected Hazelton's claims as petty jealousy.
	   ``She's a disgruntled person who didn't get her way,'' Oldfield
told ABC radio.
	   Oldfield also said her allegation that he had referred to party
donors as losers and members who had submitted policy ideas as
``half-wits'' were ``lies intended to besmirch me and make the
story more inflammatory and make people upset towards me.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is set to join the select circle of
interplanetary spacefaring nations with the scheduled launch this
weekend of its Planet-B probe to Mars.
	   If all goes as planned, the half-ton unmanned craft will begin
beaming back photographs and experimental data from the Red Planet
in October 1999.
	   It will be the first effort by a nation other than the two
former Cold War superpowers, the United States and Russia, to visit
another world.
	   ``We've worked a long time to get this level of self-sufficiency
in space,'' Yasunori Matogawa, director of Japan's Kagoshima Space
Center, said as preparations entered their final stages Tuesday.
	   The probe is scheduled for lift off from the Kagoshima center,
in southern Japan, early Saturday morning.
	   The date was chosen partly because it's the first anniversary of
the landing on Mars of the U.S.-built Mars Pathfinder.
	   But unlike the Pathfinder, which broadcast dramatic images from
the Martian surface, Japan's Planet-B will conduct its experiments
from orbit high above the planet.
	   The 11 billion yen (dlrs 80 million) probe will begin its
mission atop a newly developed M-5 four-stage rocket, Japan's most
powerful launch vehicle.
	   After two swings around the Earth, the probe should gather
enough speed to make the 700 million-kilometer (440 million-mile)
voyage to Mars in 10 months.
	   Matogawa said one objective of the Planet-B program is to
examine the Martian atmosphere, both to see how it reacts to solar
winds and measure the rate at which life-giving oxygen escapes into
space.
	   Planet-B will also photograph the planet's massive sand storms
and use high-frequency pulses to search for traces of water beneath
its surface.
	   While the probe was designed and built in Japan, four of the
craft's 14 experiments were provided by the United States, Canada,
Sweden and Germany.
	   Japan will also rely on the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's deep space tracking network to receive the probe's
transmissions.
	   Matogawa said the probe is designed to use Japan's expertise in
atmospheric and space plasma research to compliment data collected
from U.S. probes, such as the Mars Global Surveyor currently
mapping the planet's surface.
	   Photographs from the Mars Global Surveyor last month showed a
dark patch at the bottom of a crater that could be ice _ the latest
evidence the frigid planet may once have been warm enough to
sustain life.
	   Japan's next planned missions include a robot probe in 2002 to
bring back rock samples from one of the solar system's thousands of
asteroids.
	   Matogawa said Japan's next visit to an alien planet will likely
be a probe to Mercury launched early in the next millennium.

Government soldiers overrun rebel bases in eastern Sri Lanka 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Sri Lankan military censor held this story
for a day but cleared it without making any changes.
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government soldiers captured several
rebel camps in eastern Sri Lanka and killed at least seven Tamil
Tiger separatists in the fighting, the military said.
	   The soldiers took over the rebel camps at dawn Monday and
captured a large haul of weapons in eastern Batticaloa district,
the military said in a statement on Monday.
	   ``A terrorist court complex, political office and police station
were completely destroyed,'' the statement added.
	   The Tamil Tiger rebels control pockets of land in eastern Sri
Lanka and administer them with their own police force and courts.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's
minority Tamils, claiming they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese who control the government and military. More
than 52,000 people have been killed in the civil war that began in
1983.
	   The military said one policeman was wounded during Monday's
offensive but didn't say if government forces suffered any
fatalities. Independent confirmation of reports is not possible
because journalists are barred from battle zones. The government
also censors all military-related reports.
	   The fighting occurred 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of
Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital. Three rebel boats were also destroyed
in the raid, the statement said.

Australia's doctor death seeks seat in national Parliament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Philip Nitschke, the doctor who
helped four people die under Australia's defunct assisted suicide
law, announced Tuesday he will stand for national Parliament.
	   Nitschke said he will try to tap into voter dissatisfaction with
the major political parties to win the electorate of Menzies from
conservative government member Kevin Andrews at the next federal
election, expected later this year.
	   Nitschke has moved from the northern capital of Darwin to
suburban Melbourne to stand against Andrews, who was responsible
for federal legislation which overrode a territorial law which
remains the world's only legislation sanctioning active assisted
suicide.
	   The Northern Territory's Voluntary Euthanasia Act operated for
nine months from July 1996 before federal Parliament passed
Andrews' bill overriding it. The law remains on the Territory's
statute books, but its operation is effectively frozen.
	   Before the law was overturned, Nitschke followed its guidelines
and in four cases hooked up terminally ill people to a machine he
built which allowed them to self-administer a massive lethal dose
of drugs.
	   Nitschke said Tuesday he felt compelled to stand as an
independent in the federal election to register public
dissatisfaction with Andrews' bill.
	   Nitschke said opinion polling by pro-euthanasia organizations
indicated about 80 percent of voters in the Menzies electorate
supported voluntary euthanasia and disagreed with Andrews' actions.
	   ``It would be a failing of the voluntary euthanasia movement not
to run in Menzies,'' Nitschke said.
	   Andrews has declined to comment on Nitschke's candidacy. Menzies
is considered a conservative stronghold, and Andrews has held it
for the governing Liberal party since 1992.
	   Voter dissatisfaction with the major political parties is born
out by the result of the June 13 Queensland state election, which
saw about 23 percent of the vote go to the new, right-wing populist
One Nation party.
	   Independents and non-mainstream parties hold the balance of
power in nearly all Australian state and the federal parliaments.

Clinton likes Brazil in World Cup, praises Iranian players With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ When a Chinese radio listener asked him
to play sports forecaster on the World Cup soccer tournament, U.S.
President Bill Clinton hedged and went with the odds.
	   ``It's hard for me to predict,'' Clinton began telling the
caller on Shanghai People's Radio today. Then he added: ``I'm not
an expert on soccer, but the Brazilians are always hard to beat.''
	   ``I've watched them play a lot, and they're always very good,''
Clinton said. Brazil is a four-time Cup winner and a perpetual
favorite.
	   Clinton, during the live radio interview, admitted that ``soccer
came rather late to Americans because we had football and
basketball,'' but now it is catching on.
	   ``Now, more and more of our children are playing soccer,''
Clinton said. ``And I think the World Cup is a great way of
bringing people together.''
	   The tournament currently is underway in France. The United
States was eliminated June 21 in a 2-1 loss to Iran that Clinton
called ``heartbreaking for Americans.''
	   ``The United States has been estranged from Iran for a long
time, but we had this great soccer game, and they beat us fair and
square,'' Clinton said. ``The Iranians had two fast breaks, and
they played with such passion ... and they capitalized on both of
them, and we respect that.''

Thousands of workers protest in Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of workers protested in
Central Java on Tuesday for higher salaries and better social
welfare, police said.
	   In a separate incident on Sunday police opened fire on a mob
looting a timber warehouse. One man was killed and the slaying
triggered a riot in the town of Blora, about 550 kilometers (340
kilometers) east of Jakarta, the Antara news agency reported.
	   Tuesday's demonstration by workers was the second consecutive
day of protest by the workers from P.T. Tyfontex, a textile company
in Sukoharjo, about 520 kilometers (325 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Police said about 2,000 took part in the rally.
	   One officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the workers
planned to march 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the nearby city of
Solo. There were no reports of trouble.
	   Antara reported that about 6,000 workers at the factory went on
strike Monday.
	   Indonesia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis
in 30 years and has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Unemployment is rising dramatically. Prices of basic foodstuffs
are soaring. The official inflation rate is now running at 46
percent and is expected to climb to over 80 percent by the end of
the year.
	   Some fear that economic hardship and growing poverty might
trigger civil unrest in the wake of riots last month that resulted
in as many as 1,200 deaths.
	   The violence helped force former President Suharto to quit,
ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   New President B.J. Habibie last week struck a deal with the
International Monetary fund to restart a dlrs 43 billion bailout
for the battered economy.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police refused to allow the wife of a dissident
to return to China from Germany, and in a separate case forced the
mother of another dissident to cut short a visit to Beijing, a
human rights group said Tuesday.
	   Chinese citizens should have the right to travel freely and
return to their country, New York-based Human Rights in China said
in a statement. It called on President Clinton, who is visiting
China, to do more to support better rights protection in China.
	   The family of jailed Chinese journalist Gao Yu also appealed to
Clinton to press for her release.
	   During a visit to her prison outside Beijing on June 9, Gao's
son and father found that her heart trouble had worsened and her
skin was covered with red, festering sores, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   Gao, 55, is 4 1/2 years into a six-year prison term. Once a
deputy editor-in-chief of an economics weekly, she was convicted in
a secret trial in 1994 for leaking state secrets, apparently for
writing about Communist Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.
	   Dissidents around China have used Clinton's nine-day visit to
press for democratic change. Police have detained at least six
democracy campaigners in the past week, although four have been
released. The actions against family members, although routine by
the repressive standards of China's police, were the first to be
reported during the Clinton visit.
	   Tao Li, whose husband is a democracy activist in north China's
Inner Mongolia, arrived at Beijing airport on Sunday and was turned
away from customs and sent back to Germany despite her travel
documents, Human Rights in China said in a statement.
	   She was trying to return to visit her 74-year-old father, who
suffers from cancer, it said.
	   Hu Suchan of central China's Hubei province, whose son was
involved in the 1989 democracy protests that swept the country,
arrived in Beijing on July 22 to buy medicine and collect a
business debt. Police detained her and escorted her back to her
home in Jingnan City two days later, the statement said.
	   Mrs. Hu's son, Yu Zhuo, was sentenced to two years in prison in
1992 for putting up posters calling for a re-evaluation of the
military attack on protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989. He died
in a car accident in which a police officer accompanying him was
unhurt, according to the rights group.

Dollar slips, stocks higher in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon dollar, bond, closing stocks
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
Tuesday afternoon after a top Japanese politician suggested a
permanent tax cut. Tokyo stocks ended sharply higher.
	   The dollar bought 140.40 yen at mid-afternoon, down 1.72 yen
from late in Tokyo on Monday and below its late New York level of
141.69 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent, to 15,830.27. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 155.69
points, or 1.02 percent.
	   Also supporting the yen was growing speculation that Japan and
the United States may again intervene to prop up the Japanese
currency, traders said.
	   The Japanese economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported Tuesday
that Taku Yamasaki, a top official in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, said that the party will study the possibility of
implementing permanent tax cuts when it begins policy deliberations
after an election for Parliament's upper house on July 12.
	   In a separate Nihon Keizai report, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto was quoted as hinting that Japanese and U.S. monetary
authorities could once again jointly step in to stabilize the yen.
	   The Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve intervened on June
17, after the dollar hit an eight-year high against the Japanese
currency.
	   On the stock market, share prices rose sharply on hopes for
further government steps, including permanent tax cuts, to
stimulate the economy and clean up the nation's ailing banking
system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, to 1,230.38
points. The TOPIX closed up 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, the day
before.
	   Investors also looked ahead to the expected announcement
Thursday of a government plan to clean up the banking system.
Hashimoto said Tuesday that the plan would be based on U.S.
experience.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.310 percent from Monday's finish of 1.275
percent, driving its price down to 111.14 yen from 111.39 yen.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action lawsuit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
lawsuit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action lawsuit, representing five victims of the Nazi
genocide against Europe's Jews, asks the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., to award compensatory and punitive damages from
the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank.
	   The bank has said any obligations arising from World War II
dealings have been settled in a 1946 treaty and it rejects the
jurisdiction of any U.S. court to handle such a case against a
sovereign country.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate,
multibillion-dollar lawsuit in New York against Swiss commercial
banks.
	   An independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The lawsuit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the
lawsuit said.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private
and government assets during the war.
	   An earlier U.S. report said Swiss banks handled dlrs 400 million
of Nazi gold, some dlrs 300 million of it looted from European
banks.

Clinton likes Brazil in World Cup, praises Iranian players With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ When a Chinese radio listener asked him
to play sports forecaster on the World Cup soccer tournament, U.S.
President Bill Clinton hedged and went with the odds.
	   ``It's hard for me to predict,'' Clinton began telling the
caller on Shanghai People's Radio today. Then he added: ``I'm not
an expert on soccer, but the Brazilians are always hard to beat.''
	   ``I've watched them play a lot, and they're always very good,''
Clinton said. Brazil is a four-time Cup winner and a perpetual
favorite.
	   Clinton, during the live radio interview, admitted that ``soccer
came rather late to Americans because we had football and
basketball,'' but now it is catching on.
	   ``Now, more and more of our children are playing soccer,''
Clinton said. ``And I think the World Cup is a great way of
bringing people together.''
	   The tournament currently is underway in France. The United
States was eliminated June 21 in a 2-1 loss to Iran that Clinton
called ``heartbreaking for Americans.''
	   ``The United States has been estranged from Iran for a long
time, but we had this great soccer game, and they beat us fair and
square,'' Clinton said. ``The Iranians had two fast breaks, and
they played with such passion ... and they capitalized on both of
them, and we respect that.''

South Korea vows to punish employees of closed banks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors vowed Tuesday to arrest
bank employees interfering with a government takeover of five shaky
financial institutions.
	   Employees who changed computer codes and destroyed documents and
other bank property will be charged with interference with
government work, prosecutors said.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the closure of five
banks Monday as part of the government's effort to restore the
confidence of foreign investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   Five bigger commercial banks will absorb their assets.
	   But bank regulators have failed to enforce the order because
workers refuse to cooperate with them _ in some cases reportedly
changing computer codes and destroying documents.
	   Despite a government promise of job security for most employees,
thousands of workers continued to stage sit-downs or did not report
for work Tuesday.
	   Operations are stalled at the five banks and officials said
further interruption of banking operations could cause massive
defaults on bonds and checks issued by the banks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung supported the prosecutors.
	   ``The closing of the banks was inevitable to avoid spreading
their financial troubles to the whole nation. ... While enforcing
the measure, law and order should be protected in any case,''
President Kim was quoted as saying by his spokesman Park Ji-won.
	   South Korea is undergoing radical reforms under stiff conditions
that came with a dlrs 58 billion bailout by the International
Monetary Fund in December.
	   The government previously had shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies, and named 55 heavily indebted
companies subject to liquidation.

Sudanese army recaptures Red Sea port of Aqiq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese troops have recaptured a small Red
Sea port from rebels, the official news agency says.
	   The general command of the Sudanese armed forces said troops had
``liberated the port of Aqiq on the Red Sea coast ... from the
forces of mutiny and agents,'' the Sudan News Agency reported late
Monday.
	   The command pledged to ``liberate every inch of the nation's
territory.''
	   Rebels of the National Democratic Alliance captured Aqiq in
April 1997. The port lies 720 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.
	   The alliance _ which goups a number of opposition parties
including the main guerrilla movement, the Sudan People's
Liberation Army _ is based in neighboring Eritrea. Its forces are
believed to hold parts of eastern Sudan and large parts of the
south.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting the government for the past
two years in the east and since 1983 in the south, where the mainly
Christian and animist population seeks autonomy from the Muslim
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war and
ensuing famines.

U.S. Treasury chief says Japan main risk for global crisis 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos BK101-105
By PATRICK McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
stressed Wednesday that the risk of the Asian crisis turning into a
global depression remains low, but the most likely trigger would be
the perilous state of Japan's economy.
	   Rubin told reporters that a recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to
approve dlrs 18 billion for the International Monetary Fund sought
by the Clinton administration so it can quickly respond to new
outbreaks of economic upheaval.
	   Otherwise, a new phase of the crisis ``could result in a very
substantive impact on the American economy,'' until now largely
spared except for agricultural exports, Rubin said.
	   Rubin stopped in Thailand after China and Malaysia on a
pulse-taking trip a year after the crisis erupted July 2, 1997,
when Thailand allowed the baht to depreciate, touching off an
epidemic of currency turmoil. He is to end the tour with a visit to
South Korea.
	   Rubin repeated his message that Japan's failure to reverse
economic stagnation since the bubble economy collapsed eight years
ago was delaying regional recovery and posed the chief threat of
the crisis spreading outside Asia.
	   ``I think the probability of global contagion is always low,''
Rubin said. ``What Japan does is very important. The immediate
focus on Japan is to develop effective responses in their banking
sector that win respect in international markets.''
	   Rubin said earlier in an address to business students at
Chulalongkorn University that Japan needed to create an economy
``led by domestic demand and a healthy currency.''
	   ``It is critical to the economic health of Thailand, the region
and the rest of the world,'' Rubin said.
	   The Japanese yen was recently propped up by U.S. intervention,
and Rubin did not rule out such action again if ``appropriate.'' It
was the first sale of dollars by Washington in financial markets
since 1992.
	   The United States has stressed that Japan needs to implement a
range of structural economic reforms and particularly deal with bad
loans troubling its banking sector.
	   Rubin met Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and said the United States stands ready to
back additional demands for credit by Thailand from the IMF, but
neither he nor Tarrin indicated that would be required.
	   The Thai government has shut down 56 finance companies and taken
over four small banks to sort out its financial sector. Rubin said
he had reviewed banking sector reforms with Thai officials but
refused to disclose details.
	   Rubin responded to a student's question about whether banks
should be nationalized by saying it was up to Thai authorities.
	   Rubin defended the IMF, which is leading bailouts totaling some
dlrs 120 billion for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, for
demanding tight monetary policies that critics say are making the
crisis worse by killing businesses.
	   Lowering interest rates would only divert attention from the
real reforms that need to be made and delay ``getting back to solid
growth and financial stability,'' Rubin said.
	   Asia's recovery will be rooted in values he said had created
growth in the first place: a strong work ethic, high savings rate
and focus on education. But he gave no time-frame for recovery.
	   Rubin said that financial speculators, blamed by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad for causing the crisis, were only minor
culprits.
	   The main causes were capital flight because of fear over poor
policies and corporations shielding against unstable domestic
currencies by buying dollars, Rubin said.

Hyundai workers go on strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Workers at Hyundai Motors Co. put down
their tools Tuesday to protest layoffs, halting assembly lines at
South Korea's largest automaker, union leaders said.
	   The one-day strike came shortly after Hyundai notified the Labor
Ministry of its plans to lay off 4,800 workers. By law, Hyundai
must notify the government 30 days in advance of layoffs.
	   In Hyundai's main plant in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, at least 10,000 workers walked off the assembly
lines, union officials said.
	   ``The management is not trying hard enough to limit layoffs,''
said union spokesman Kim Kun-soo, repeating a demand that Hyundai
cut work hours rather than shed workers.
	   Kim said the walkout would continue until Wednesday afternoon,
with further strike plans to be announced thereafter.
	   Also Tuesday, the Korean Metal Workers' Federation, a militant
nationwide umbrella group of auto and other heavy industry workers,
said it will urge its member unions to strike in support of Hyundai
employees.
	   In May, Hyundai announced plans to lay off 8,200 _ or 27 percent
_ of its 30,000 workers, citing domestic car sales that have
dropped to less than half of those last year.
	   Since then, some 3,400 workers have volunteered for early
retirement.
	   Hyundai was the first conglomerate to resort to mass layoffs in
a country where the custom long was to employ a worker for life _ a
custom now threatened by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Other big businesses are expected to follow Hyundai in layoffs
soon.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to bail out its economy. In exchange for a dlrs 58 billion
rescue package, South Korea promised to make its labor market more
flexible.
	   Hyundai produced 1.24 million cars last year, making it the
world's 13th-largest auto maker. It exported half of its products.

Embattled city brings in 3,000 more policemen to stop violence 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The Sindh provincial government on
Tuesday ordered an additional 3,000 police into this violent city
after another night of relentless bloodletting left six people
dead, the authorities said.
	   The violence shut down entire neighborhoods of Karachi, as rival
factions of a militant ethnic group waged fierce and bloody battles
in several parts of the city, said eyewitnesses and police
officials.
	   Sindh Chief Minister Liaqat Jatoi said 3,000 additional
policemen were being deployed in Karachi from elsewhere in the
province. They will arrive with their armored personnel carriers to
patrol some of the hardest hit areas of the city, like Korangi in
the east and Liaqatabad in central Karachi.
	   In both neighborhoods, gunmen with automatic rifles have perched
on rooftops for the last two days and exchanged fire with each
other.
	   ``Many people are getting out of here and moving in with
relatives in other parts of the city, at least until the shooting
stops,'' said Mohammed Idrees, a resident of Liaqatabad, who was
contacted by telephone.
	   In the past 24 hours, police, eyewitnesses and hospital
officials say 23 people have been killed in ethnic bloodshed.
	   In a statement issued Tuesday, Jatoi ordered his police force to
put an end to the month-long violence that has terrorized Karachi
and left more than 200 people dead. He gave policemen a 48-hour
deadline.
	   The combatants are rival factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement,
a militant ethnic group representing Indian Muslims who came to
Pakistan in 1947. The movement accuses successive governments of
discriminating against mohajirs or refugees, who settled in
southern Sindh province.
	   The movement has split into at least three different factions,
all of whom are heavily armed, and who routinely wage violent
territorial battles for control of areas of Karachi.
	   In Liaqatabad overnight Tuesday a gun battle left two people
dead, one a small boy caught in the crossfire, said police and
residents in the area.
	   In a separate incident in Korangi, gunmen in a car sprayed
bullets at four young men sitting outside of a restaurant, killing
them all.

all the tours. He has been toasted and cheered, even before trying
a single jump shot in Dallas. He even got a new suit _ the first of
his life.
	   Now the German wunderkind must deliver an answer, and Dallas
Mavericks general manager-coach Don Nelson wants it by Tuesday:
Will Nowitzki play in the NBA this season or stay in Europe?
	   The 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) forward planned to fly back to
Germany Tuesday on the eve of an NBA lockout that will rule out any
further negotiations with the team until it's over.
	   Nelson fears that will only open the door for Nowitzki to
negotiate with European suitors.
	   ``I would feel very uncomfortable if he would go back to Germany
without making a commitment and have all summer to entertain other
offers, talk to other teams,'' Nelson said Monday.
	   He then turned up the heat by hinting that Dallas might have to
look elsewhere for help if Nowitzki can't make up his mind.
	   ``I am going to assume that we'll have to play without him,''
Nelson said. ``And then we'll have to look to fulfill that need
that we have in another way.''
	   Nowitzki, who wore his new suit to meet reporters, said the
pressure doesn't bother him.
	   ``I don't feel any pressure,'' he said. ``I'll just call my
parents ... and speak with Holger (agent Holger Geschwinder) over
it. I want to sleep over it.''
	   There were reports that Nowitzki's decision would come down to a
Monday night barbecue at Nelson's house, where he met with his
prospective new teammates, including Michael Finley and Shawn
Bradley.
	   The German arrived in Dallas on Sunday following a three-day
European recruiting trip by a Mavericks contingent that included
owner Ross Perot Jr.
	   Nelson cleared one hurdle during the trip when he assured
Nowitzki he would be allowed to leave the team in the fall and
winter to help Germany's basketball team qualify for the Olympics.
	   On Monday, Nowitzki said he isn't concerned about money _ he
could probably earn more money in Europe _ and is now considering
only whether he has enough bulk on his 237-pound (108-kilo) frame
to play in the NBA.
	   Nelson's mantra over the past two days has been that Nowitzki,
acquired after he was picked ninth overall in last week's draft, is
ready for the NBA and has star potential.
	   ``I told him not to worry about his reservations of the NBA or
his skill level,'' Nelson said. ``That's our job. We evaluate
talent all the time. We know that he's good enough, that he can
play at age 20.''
	   And if Nowitzki decides to play in Europe next season?
	   ``The wrong commitment and I'm getting the suit back,'' Nelson
joked. ``It also fits me. Well, almost.''

Sumitomo Bank sued over housing loans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The corporation cleaning up Japan's mountains of
housing loan debts sued Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Tuesday in a first step
to force commercial banks to take responsibility for the debacle.
	   The Housing Loan Administration suit, filed at Tokyo District
Court, demands 4.83 billion yen (dlrs 34.3 million) in damages and
accuses Sumitomo of knowingly introducing the lenders to unsound
borrowers.
	   Seven mortgage lending companies _ known as ``jusen'' _
collapsed in 1995, forcing the government to allocate 680 billion
yen (dlrs 4.8 billion) in public funds to help clean up their bad
debts.
	   The Housing Loan Administration Corp. was created to handle the
cleanup.
	   The suit against Sumitomo follows months of unsuccessful talks
on settling the issue out of court. The corporation said it could
take similar action against as many as 10 more banks.
	   The Sumitomo suit could set a precedent for legal action against
banks and their management in a broader cleanup of Japan's
debt-ridden banking system. The government is expected to announce
an outline of the cleanup this month.
	   ``Banks think they can do whatever as long as they abide by the
law, which is only a minimum requirement in their business,'' said
Kohei Nakabo, president of the Housing Loan Administration Corp.
	   ``This attitude is at the core of the current vast problems
facing the nation's financial system and the economy,'' he told
reporters.
	   Nakabo said the corporation had established that Sumitomo alone
accounted for 72 of 134 cases of dubious loans introduced to
mortgage lenders.
	   Sumitomo said in a statement that it could not comment on
details of the suit because it had not seen a copy of it, but that
it would tell the court it had no legal responsibility for
introducing the loans.

Thailand's call for ASEAN policy change wins support 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's call for the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to reconsider its policy of
non-interference in the affairs of member states is supported by
the regional grouping's chief, the Thai Foreign Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino expressed his support
for a policy of ``constructive intervention'' after his meeting
with Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan on Monday, said ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul.
	   Severino was quoted by a Thai newspaper as saying that
circumstances in the international community do not allow any
country to live in isolation. He said member countries affected by
events in another country should speak out about the problems,
citing the regional financial crisis and pollution from forest
fires as two examples.
	   ``These stress the nature of interconnection among us,'' he was
quoted as saying.
	   Kobsak said Severino's support is significant as he holds a
non-partisan position representing the interests of the grouping as
a whole.
	   Hopes of modifying the policy, used over the years to discourage
criticism of human rights abuses in Myanmar _ also called Burma -
and East Timor, have been raised since one of its main supporters,
Suharto, was forced out as Indonesia's leader in May.
	   The calls were already building as ASEAN's mechanisms proved
woefully inadequate to address Southeast Asia's economic crisis.
	   Severino, who came to his ASEAN job from the Philippine Foreign
Ministry and whose post is ministerial-level, is the first major
ASEAN figure to support Thailand's constructive intervention
policy.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two people were killed when a war-era
artillery shell went off as they were taking it apart, local police

	   In the incident June 17 in the southern province of Dong Nai,
Chau Thai Thuan, 38, and his wife Nguyen Thi Nga, 44, were trying
to extract explosives from the shell for use in his work as a well
digger.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Qatari emir arrived in Khartoum Tuesday,
making the first visit by a Gulf head of state to Sudan since the
1991 Gulf War.
	   Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani told reporters his one-day
visit would allow for an exchange of views with Sudanese President
Omar el-Bashir, who met him at Khartoum airport, the official Sudan
News Agency reported.
	   Shortly after his arrival, Sheik Hamad attended a military
parade marking the ninth anniversary of the coup that brought
el-Bashir's Islamic government to power.
	   Sudan's relations with Gulf Arab countries deteriorated sharply
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 as the Khartoum government
was seen as supporting Baghdad.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action lawsuit 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from Swiss National Bank.
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
lawsuit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action lawsuit, representing five victims of the Nazi
genocide against Europe's Jews, asks the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., to award compensatory and punitive damages from
the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank.
	   The bank has said any obligations arising from World War II
dealings have been settled in a 1946 treaty and it rejects the
jurisdiction of any U.S. court to handle such a case against a
sovereign country.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate,
multibillion-dollar lawsuit in New York against Swiss commercial
banks.
	   An independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The lawsuit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the
lawsuit said.
	   Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said that the bank
has not yet officially been informed of the lawsuit.
	   He restated the bank's position that it does not consider a U.S.
court has jurisdiction in such cases and that it will fight any
suits against it vigorously.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private
and government assets during the war.
	   An earlier U.S. report said Swiss banks handled dlrs 400 million
of Nazi gold, some dlrs 300 million of it looted from European
banks.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police captured an army deserter in Russia's far
northwest, completing a manhunt for four soldiers who fled from a
prison stockade, a military prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   Two of the other deserters were shot dead and one was captured
on Monday.
	   The four men escaped from the stockade Sunday night in the town
of Pechenga, near Russia's border with Norway.
	   The men fled with stolen AK-47s and pistols, but by Monday
morning a search party had tracked them down. When the deserters
refused to give up their weapons, two were killed in a shootout and
a third was detained.
	   The fourth man was captured at midnight Monday, the district's
military prosecutor Col. Anatoly Novozhilov was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.

Chinese president arrives for handover ceremonies 
</HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fresh from high-profile summitry in Beijing,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday to help
celebrate the territory's handover _ an event that has boosted
China's prestige as a reliable global partner.
	   With Hong Kong suffering economically, Wednesday's anniversary
ceremonies will be muted compared to the 1997 extravaganza that
ended more than a century and a half of British colonial rule.
	   A year ago, Hong Kong saw off Prince Charles and the last
British colonial governor, Chris Patten, while Jiang presided over
the re-establishment of Chinese sovereignty.
	   Only one day later, Asia's economic woes broke open in Bangkok.
While Hong Kong's economic power kept it immune for months, it now
is being dragged into recession along with much of the region.
	   However, China largely has been given high marks for standing by
its pledges to keep hands off the territory, and allow it to run
its own affairs.
	   China's handling of Hong Kong has won praise from Western
governments, and grudging respect even from its foes in Hong Kong,
who acknowledge that changes have been relatively small.
	   A survey released Monday indicated people believe the economic
and social conditions have deteriorated in the past year. Even
though the government of the Hong Kong chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, is coming under criticism, relatively few worries have
surfaced over China's role.
	   The presence of Beijing officials for the handover anniversary
``is a demonstration of their great support and true concern for
Hong Kong,'' Tung said in a statement.
	   Jiang's white Boeing 747 glided over Hong Kong's cityscape
before touching down at venerable Kai Tak airport, which closes
Sunday night after 73 years in service. On Thursday, the Chinese
president officially opens new Chek Lap Kok airport on outlying
Lantau island.
	   Jiang will depart from the new airport. U.S. President Bill
Clinton, with whom he met in Beijing, is expected at the new
airport just hours later for a short visit that concludes his tour
of China.
	   Military bands and schoolchildren waving flags greeted Jiang as
he stepped from his plane. He was accompanied by Tung, and made no
statement at the airport.
	   Anniversary celebrations in Hong Kong on Wednesday, which is a
public holiday, will include a flag-raising ceremony, a gala show
at Hong Kong's coliseum and a banquet. News reports said this
year's celebration will cost only about 10 million Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 1.3 million), compared to the 250 million Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 32 million) spent last year.
	   In the University of Hong Kong survey released Monday, 48.6
percent of those who responded said their confidence in Hong Kong's
future had decreased since the handover.
	   Almost 95 percent said they thought economic conditions were
worse. Only 34 percent thought the political situation was worse.
	   Hong Kong's 4.2 percent unemployment is the highest in 15 years,
the stock market has fallen sharply, and the government has had to
take drastic steps to try to limit the economic damage. Last week,
it froze sales of government land to try to stabilize the
all-important property market.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After calling for a temporary freeze on
all talks concerning the legal status of East Timor in light of the
recent upheaval in Indonesia, an East Timor independence activist
predicted a lack of cash may soon force Indonesia to relax its grip
on the former Portugese colony.
	   Speaking Monday at a press conference, Jose Ramos-Horta also
said any referendum on the Indonesian-occupied territory should not
occur for another three to five years.
	   At a separate luncheon with diplomats and journalists,
Ramos-Horta said Indonesia does not have the resources to pay for
the soldiers who have been occupying East Timor since Indonesia
invaded 23 years ago. Indonesia has been hard hit by Asia's
financial meltdown, and it is now battling its worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Meanwhile, a three-member European Union diplomatic team left
East Timor on Tuesday earlier than scheduled. On Monday, Indonesian
security forces fatally shot one pro-independence protester and
wounded four others in Baucau.
	   Indonesian military officials in Dili, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the diplomats left several hours ahead of schedule,
fearing that more demonstrations would be held.
	   Large demonstrations for and against Indonesian rule were held
to impress the Jakarta-based ambassadors of Britain, the
Netherlands and Austria, who arrived Saturday.
	   The situation in Dili was calm Tuesday morning, but dozens of
riot police armed with sticks and shields erected barbed wire
barricades around the territory's main government office, which had
been attacked by stone-throwing mobs during the weekend.
	   Speaking at the United Nations, Ramos-Horta said he was trying
to show some flexibility in East Timorese independence demands,
considering the ``political, psychological earthquake'' in
Indonesia this spring that culminated with deadly riots and the
ouster of President Suharto last month.
	   Ramos-Horta, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, urged
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to show similar
flexibility _ particularly in Indonesia's demand that it receive
world recognition of its sovereignty over East Timor in exchange
for increased autonomy on the island and freedom for jailed rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``Indonesia should not insist on preconditions,'' Ramos-Horta
said at the press conference. ``This is not the way to start
negotiations.''
	   But Ramos-Horta said East Timor activists will not relinquish
their position that East Timor be independent.
	   Ramos-Horta suggested the two sides negotiate more immediate
issues _ the release of more political prisoners, including Gusmao,
and the reduction of Indonesian troops on the island _ before
launching into a protracted debate over the future of the
territory.
	   ``There is a solid consensus between us, Portugal, the European
Union and the U.S. position today that the only way to resolve the
problem is to move step by step along these lines,'' Ramos-Horta
said.
	   At the lunch, Ramos-Horta said that after a transitional period
of about five years, ``the East Timorese might want to stay with
Indonesia, or the Indonesians might want to accept Timorese
independence.''
	   Officials at Indonesia's mission to the United Nations did not
return a phone call seeking comment on his remarks.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering a
long-running guerrilla war.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty and accuse the Indonesian
government of human rights abuses.
	   Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with Bishop
Carlos Belo for their efforts to bring peace to their homeland. The
bishop is the spiritual leader of East Timor, which is
predominantly Roman Catholic in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia.

Aid workers may leave Kabul if forced to relocate to dormitories 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Several international aid groups
threatened Tuesday to leave the beleaguered Afghan capital if the
Taliban religious army forces them to relocate to abandoned
dormitories once used by students of war-damaged technical
institutes.
	   Radio Shariat on Monday announced the Taliban decision to
relocate an estimated 38 international aid groups into the
Soviet-built dormitories within the next month.
	   Western aid workers, who didn't want to be identified because
they still were negotiating with the Taliban, warned that several
humanitarian groups would leave Kabul.
	   The Taliban cited security reasons for the forced relocation.
	   The Taliban control roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan where they
have imposed a harsh version of Islamic law that bans women from
working and girls from going to school. It also requires men to
grow a beard, publicly beating any man who shaves.
	   The dormitories, seven cement block buildings, are set among
other buildings ruined by rockets in fighting between rival Islamic
factions that took control of Kabul in 1992 from the communists
then in power.
	   While electricity is available, it's not clear whether the
dormitories are equipped with either running water or sewage
facilities.
	   ``The situation is very critical . . . we want to help the poor
people of Kabul, but we have made it clear that we do not want to
move and we will stop our operations,'' said one aid worker, who
wouldn't give his name.
	   The aid groups were holding emergency meetings in the Afghan
capital on Tuesday to try to plan a course of action. Aid workers
said the Taliban ordered them to relocate both their offices and
their homes to the dormitories.
	   It wasn't immediately known whether the Taliban order also
applied to the International Red Cross and the United Nations.

European Central Bank inaugurated, chief denies deal for him to quit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As leaders gathered Tuesday to
inaugurate the European Central Bank, the institution's new chief
reiterated that no deal had been made for his early departure from
the top job.
	   Still, Wim Duisenberg hinted in an interview with German
television that he would not serve his entire eight-year term.
	   Duisenberg's appointment in May followed a bitter squabble that
pitted his supporters, led by Germany, against France, which wanted
its own candidate to head the bank, which will set European
monetary policy and oversee the historic switch to a common
currency.
	   The row was defused after French officials said they won a
promise from Duisenberg that he would quit in 2002 _ halfway
through the eight-year term _ to make way for the current Bank of
France governor, Jean-Claude Trichet.
	   Duisenberg, in an interview with ZDF television, again insisted
that he was named central bank president for an eight-year term.
But he said he would stay in the job at least ``until the national
currencies have totally disappeared.''
	   That is supposed to happen in the 11 inaugural countries in
2002.
	   Duisenberg was to deliver the welcoming address Tuesday for the
grand opening of the bank.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern and Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima were among the
dignitaries expected.
	   The ECB governing council and executive board took up their work
at the beginning of June, but Tuesday will celebrate a grand
opening. The Maastricht Treaty called for the ECB's establishment
no later than July 1.
	   The ECB won't start setting monetary policy for the single
currency zone before Jan. 1, 1999. In the meantime, it will decide
on monetary instruments and strategies, and make other policy
decisions.

City tense after clashes involving riot police, English and local youths With France-World Cup-Violence AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   ST. ETIENNE, France (AP)_ A sudden show of force by riot troops
seeking to avoid violence before a World Cup playoff between
England and Argentina triggered insults, scuffles and wild baton
charges early Tuesday in the center of this industrial city.
	   Police arrested several English football fans and local toughs.
There were some minor injuries, mostly caused during crowd
stampedes.
	   In a separate incident by the stadium, local French-Tunisian
youths insulted and attacked English fans, apparently in
retaliation for skirmishes in Marseille two weeks ago, and English
fans fought back. Police intervened, arresting about nine locals
and an Englishman. Local youths burned several cars.
	   Trouble downtown began shortly after 11 p.m. Monday night, when
a huge outdoor screen that showed the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game
went blank. Its last image was a message saying it would not show
the England-Argentina match Tuesday night.
	   Also at 11 p.m., bars and restaurants shut their doors. Hundreds
of police with riot helmets and shields moved in to clear the area.
	   Until then, hundreds of Englishmen, scores of Argentines, and a
number of French youths had been drinking peacefully together in
the balmy open air. A band played on a makeshift stage, and stands
served up beer and hotdogs.
	   But the mood was already tense. Only 2,000 tickets had been made
available in England for perhaps 30,000 people who are coming for
the game. Scalper prices approach 500 pounds each (dlrs 800).
	   Some English fans yelled at the police and began singing what
has become their World Cup trademark in the face of police and
local opposition: ``No surrender, no surrender to the IRA'' _ a
reference to troubles in Northern Ireland. Within minutes, there
were scuffles in the streets.
	   Police officials had no immediate comment, but all sides _
including British police hooligan spotters _ faulted the French
police.
	   ``Why did they do that?'' asked Ben Murphy, 22, an English
engineering student from Lincoln, as he watched columns of nervous
police in riot gear, backed by burly plainclothes officers, tighten
cordons around the brightly lit City Hall square.
	   ``This was ridiculous, just looking for trouble,'' said Mariano
Recalde, 26, a lawyer who flew from Buenos Aires to watch Argentina
play. ``We're just trying to get to our hotel, but we're blocked in
on all sides. The cops panic easily here, don't they?''
	   Farid Belaid, 22, a French-Algerian printer from a working class
suburb of St. Etienne, blamed the police for overreacting against
young Arabs and English fans who, he said, they assumed were all
troublemakers.
	   As police charged, some of the English threatened television
cameramen, photographers and reporters, blaming them for the
trouble.
	   An Englishman with shaved head and earrings threw beer on one
French photographer. Among obscenities, he shouted: ``It's because
of you they call us hooligans.''
	   Shortly after, another English told the same photographer:
``Take your cameras and leave. You're not welcome here.''
	   Two British policemen in football-fan dress, who spoke only on
the condition of anonymity, said that French police might have
avoided trouble by quietly isolating potential troublemakers ahead
of time, while keeping their main force out of sight.
	   He confirmed that Scotland Yard had lent experts to spot fans
likely to incite trouble. But, he added with a laugh, ``Who's to
say the French will listen?''
	   The British agreed that a match between England and Argentina,
with their 30-year-old football grudge and the Falklands War of
1982, had serious potential for violence.
	   Local authorities are allowing beer and alcohol to be sold up
until 11 p.m. tonight, which is just as the match ends. Then bars
close, and police hope for the best.
	   Nigel Bobroff, a young company director from London, is taking
no chances. He left his wife and 4-month-old daughter in Lyon, 60
kilometers (36 miles) away, while he sees the game.
	   With a laugh, he explained why: ``England has the best football
fans in the world, but the trouble is that it also has the worst.''

Central Chinese city threatened by floods 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Inserts graf 4 to UPDATE with Beijing hit by heavy rains
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Parts of Wuhan, a major industrial city along the
Yangtze River in central China, are flooded and waters are expected
to rise further as the river swells, state-run media reported
Tuesday.
	   Torrential rains upriver have caused the worst flooding in 50
years in Changsha, another major city to the east, the Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   It said some 200,000 people had been stranded as parts of the
city and much of its outlying suburbs were inundated. Losses were
estimated at 4 billion yuan (dlrs 481 million).
	   Severe thunderstorms that struck Beijing beginning late Monday
night left many commuters stranded as cars and buses stalled along
roads flooded knee-deep. Officials in one district reported they
had been asked to repair 600 buildings damaged by the rain.
	   About 400 people have died this year in floods triggered by
unusually heavy and early torrential rains.
	   The newspaper China Daily said 15 people had died in floods last
week in southern Guangdong province, raising an earlier death toll
of seven.
	   The report said another 64 people were injured and 50,000 people
left homeless by floods along the Pearl River, although the waters
were beginning to recede.
	   In a separate report, Xinhua said the army had rescued 100,000
people and delivered 250,000 tons of supplies to flood victims in
three southern provinces: Guangxi, Guangdong and Hunan.
	   Deadly floods caused by seasonal rains hit China each summer.
Since March, at least 21 of China's 30 provinces, regions and major
cities have been hit by flooding and storms, including usually arid
areas in the north and northwest.

Restaurant workers join strike by technicians, costumed characters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Restaurant workers at Disneyland
Paris on Tuesday joined technicians and parade performers in a
strike by a union demanding pay raises, a union spokesman said.
	   Dozens of strikers with signs and banners gathered at the
entrance of the park 30 kms (18 miles) east of the capital, on the
sixth day of a walkout that began with the parade performers.
	   Sound the light technicians joined the walkout Monday, and
restaurant workers began walking out Tuesday, but it was not clear
what percentage of the work force was affected. The park said the
daily parade continued as scheduled.
	   ``We have miserable salaries,'' said Michel Balliwech, a local
organizer for the Communist-led General Labor Confederation.
	   The CGT was demanding a minimum 8,500-franc (dlrs 1,400) monthly
salary, or a 7 percent increase. Balliwech, who prints park
tickets, said he earns 7,300 francs (dlrs 1,200) per month after
seven years on the job.
	   Balliwech said he felt no qualms about striking in the middle of
the tourist season.
	   ``Striking is a right,'' he said. ``We're not changing the
atmosphere,'' he insisted.
	   About 70 people who participate in the daily Main Street parade
_ nearly half the performers _ went on strike at first. But park
officials said the performers were beginning to return to work.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co. based in Burbank, California, opened the park's
doors in April 1992. It reported annual profit since 1995, in part
by imposing tougher cost controls that have triggered occasional
strikes.

Council president urges UNITA to fulfill envoy's wish ambassador, other details; DELETES outdated material and raises context. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS with new quotes from council president, Angolan
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Former Angolan rebels should honor the
legacy of the late U.N. Angola envoy by complying with Security
Council demands _ and a Wednesday deadline _ to work towards
completing the peace process, the council president said.
	   Antonio Monteiro of Portugal joined others at the United Nations
in expressing their sadness Monday over the death in a plane crash
Friday of Alioune Blondin Beye.
	   The council reaffirmed its dedication to Beye's mission by
extending the mandate of the U.N. observer mission to Angola until
Aug. 15.
	   A charter plane carrying Beye, 59, two pilots and five other
members of the U.N. observer mission for Angola crashed Friday
night east of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Beye was traveling in the
region seeking support for the peace process from African leaders.
	   The crash of Beye's plane came just days before the council's
Wednesday midnight deadline for the former rebel movement UNITA to
hand over their strongholds to government control. Failure to do so
would result in sanctions that would freeze UNITA's foreign bank
accounts and ban its diamond exports, which give the movement
hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
	   ``I hope very much that UNITA will meet this deadline,''
Monteiro said. ``It was the wish of Maitre Beye and I think now the
best tribute that it can make to Maitre Beye is just to do what he
asked the leaders in Angola to do.
	   ``I hope very much that UNITA will have a positive answer to
what was the last will of Maitre Beye.''
	   Beye was remembered Monday by Monteiro and others as a tireless
worker for peace. At the U.N. headquarters, the sky blue U.N. flag
flew at half-mast. The Security Council held a moment of silence.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking in Vienna, called
the Mali-born Beye ``a dedicated and dynamic peacemaker, and a
great son of Africa whom the Angolans dubbed `the Messiah of
Peace.'''
	   Angola's U.N. ambassador, Alfonso Van Dunem Mbinda, called
Beye's death ``not only a loss for the peace process in Angola, but
also for Africa and for the entire humanity.''
	   He called Beye's work an ``example of sacrifice without any
precedence in the history of African diplomacy.''
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the joint commission. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Angola since April.
	   The United Nations has long complained that UNITA has stalled in
fulfilling terms of the agreement, signed four years ago in Lusaka,
Zambia, to end the two-decade civil war.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.
	   Earlier this month, Beye asked the council to crack down on
UNITA because of its continued delays. Diplomatic sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said he threatened to resign if the
council failed to take strong action.
	   Beye had reported that UNITA was hiding armed men in remote
areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the movement's
pledge that it had demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla army.
UNITA has denied the allegation.
	   The council responded by threatening new sanctions, which will
go into effect on Wednesday unless Annan declares UNITA has
complied with terms of the 1994 peace accord.
	   Under the 1994 peace agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the entire 50 percent of the country it
seized during the civil war.
	   UNITA also agreed to demobilize its fighters and integrate them
into the national army in return for a role in the government.
	   UNITA fought a civil war for nearly two decades against the
government after Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal.

Sudanese army recaptures Red Sea port of Aqiq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese troops have recaptured a small Red
Sea port from rebels, the official news agency said.
	   The general command of the Sudanese armed forces said troops had
``liberated the port of Aqiq on the Red Sea coast ... from the
forces of mutiny and agents,'' the Sudan News Agency reported late
Monday.
	   The command pledged to ``liberate every inch of the nation's
territory.''
	   Rebels of the National Democratic Alliance had captured Aqiq in
April 1997. The port lies 720 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting the government for the past
two years in the east and since 1983 in the south, where the mainly
Christian and animist population seeks autonomy from the Muslim
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war and
ensuing famines.
	   The alliance _ which groups several opposition parties including
the main guerrilla movement, the Sudan People's Liberation Army _
is based in neighboring Eritrea.

Dollar falls, stocks higher in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Wraps up with late afternoon dollar, closing bond, comments
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar fell sharply against the yen Tuesday as
traders grew wary about possible U.S.-Japan joint market
intervention and hopeful about government steps to lift Japan's
economy. That hope also sent Tokyo stocks into a steep climb.
	   The dollar bought 139.95 yen in late afternoon, down 2.17 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
141.69 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent, closing at 15,830.27. On Monday, the Nikkei had gained
155.69 points, or 1.02 percent.
	   The economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported Tuesday that Taku
Yamasaki, a senior official in the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, said the party will study the possibility of permanent tax
cuts after elections for Parliament's upper house on July 12.
	   Recently adopted temporary tax cuts have not been enough to
build confidence in Japan's prospects for pulling out of recession.
	   In a separate Nihon Keizai report, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto was quoted as hinting that Japanese and U.S. monetary
authorities might step into exchange markets again to support the
slumping yen.
	   The Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve intervened on June 17
after the dollar climbed above 146 yen, an eight-year high.
	   ``Everybody thinks the trend is for the yen to weaken and the
dollar to strengthen,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange
manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ``However, Japanese
corporations are scared of more intervention, which is holding the
dollar back some.''
	   The dollar's slip Tuesday below 140 yen was the first since June
24, a week after the U.S.-Japan joint intervention. The dollar
ranged between 139.80 yen and 142.42 yen in Tuesday's trading.
	   On the stock market, share prices rose sharply on hopes for
further government steps, including permanent tax cuts, to
stimulate the economy and clean up the nation's ailing banking
system.
	   Investors looked ahead to the expected announcement Thursday of
a government plan to heal the banking system. Hashimoto said
Tuesday that the plan would be based on U.S. experience.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, to 1,230.38. It
had climbed 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 576 million shares,
up from 398.8 million Monday. Advances overwhelmed retreats 1,041
to 137, with 82 issues unchanged.
	   Shares in major banks were among the advancers.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.330 percent from Monday's finish of 1.275
percent, driving its price down to 110.99 yen from 111.39 yen.

	   ``I was hoping you would offer me a position here,'' Clinton
quipped Tuesday when law professor Zhu Lanye asked about his future
plans. Zhu is vice dean of the international department at East
China University of Politics and Law, Shanghai's main law school.
	   Clinton, who taught constitutional law at the University of
Arkansas during the 1970s, said he has no firm plans beyond
building a presidential library in Arkansas to house his papers
``and to tell the story'' of his two terms in office.
	   ``I'll be about 54 when I leave office and I don't want to take
a retirement. I haven't decided what to do yet or where to do it,''
Clinton said. ``So maybe I will apply for a visiting
professorship.''
	   The president and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, took part in
a roundtable discussion with leaders from business, law, religion
the arts and the media in Shanghai, China's commercial capital.
	    &UR; ___
	   Mrs. Clinton used a Chinese reporter's question on how her life
has changed since she became first lady to vent a little steam at
the media.
	   ``It is a constant challenge ... to make clear who you are, as
opposed to society's expectations as to who you should be because
you hold a position of woman novelist, woman law professor, first
lady or any of the other positions women hold,'' she said during
the roundtable at the Shanghai Library.
	   Pointing to dozens of television cameras, photographers and
reporters, Mrs. Clinton complained that ``when you're in a position
like this, people, particularly all these people with their pencils
and their cameras, try to record everything you do and then they
try to put meaning to that.''
	   ``I often refer to my life before the White House as when I was
a real person,'' she said.
	    &UR; ___
	   Much of Shanghai may have been listening Tuesday as Clinton
fielded questions on a popular radio talk show, but at least two
people weren't: his wife and daughter.
	   Mrs. Clinton had another engagement on her schedule, Clinton
told his hosts during pre-show banter, ``and my daughter is out
doing something of interest to her.''
	   ``Normally she says, `Dad, I've heard all your answers before.
I'd rather do something else now,''' Clinton said.
	    &UR; ___
	   Minutes before the radio show began, one of the hosts noted that
Clinton is left-handed _ like his predecessor, George Bush _ and
asked if this meant that in America everyone is left-handed.
	   Clinton responded by saying he refused to become right-handed
when he was a 13-year-old stock boy in a store back in Arkansas.
	   ``The man who ran the store, he was old-school,'' Clinton said.
``He thought it was bad luck for a child to be left-handed. So he
made me do all my work in the store with my right hand.
	   ``Then I began to break the merchandise. And then he would make
me pay for it, so that I was working for nothing,'' Clinton said.
``So I told him that he could have a left-handed stock boy for a
dollar an hour. But he could not have a right-handed stock boy for
free.''

Fear stops Turkish quake survivors from returning to normal life 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of people, afraid to re-enter
homes damaged by a strong earthquake three days ago, were shaken
from an uncomfortable sleep by fresh jolts on Tuesday.
	   Three more bodies were pulled late Monday and early Tuesday from
the rubble of five multi-story buildings leveled by the 6.3
magnitude quake, officials said.
	   The death toll from Saturday's temblor in and around this
southern town remained at 129, apparently because some of the
victims had been counted twice.
	   Rescue operations continued around the clock, but workers had
little hope of finding survivors.
	   ``We are no longer hearing any voices,'' Erol Malacanli told The
Associated Press. ``But who knows.''
	   Only a 45-year-old woman was saved Monday. Emine Bitirgec
anxiously awaited news of her three relatives still buried in the
debris.
	   ``When I close my eyes, I see the little beautiful faces of
Sinem and Gizem'' she said, referring to her two nieces. ``Maybe,
they are still alive. Maybe they found a place to hide.''
	   Other residents have been unable to resume normal life, with as
many as 70 aftershocks registered since Saturday in this town 250
miles (400 kilometers) south of the capital, Ankara.
	   Some 1,500 people were injured, and 300 of them needed hospital
care. Half of Ceyhan's 80,000 residents fled immediately after the
quake.
	   ``I sent my wife and two children to my father's house in a
nearby village,'' said Omer Aykan, a tax officer, sitting in front
of an improvised tent he set up for the night.
	   Although some restaurants re-opened, no customers were visible
inside them.
	   Ufuk Akdag opened his grocery Monday but only because he feared
thieves would loot his shop by entering through a broken window.
``I'm here basically to protect my goods,'' he said.
	   Sahin Sever planned to sleep under a nylon sheet in his family's
melon field outside Ceyhan.
	   ``Nobody is helping us,'' he said. ``We are very anxious.''
	   Many people were told not to re-enter their homes until
authorities could make safety checks.
	   The nearby city of Adana suffered less damage, most of it
concentrated in slum areas inhabited largely by Kurds who had fled
a war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
	   The quake shook Turkey's entire southern coast and was felt as
far as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

Peru urges top economies to act on Asian crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori urged the
world's top economies Tuesday to act decisively to solve the Asian
economic crisis before it spreads to other regions.
	   Fujimori, speaking at a two-day symposium on ties between Latin
America, the Caribbean and Japan, said Asia's financial problems
have had a limited effect so far on Peru and its neighbors.
	   But that could change, he said, if the world's strongest
economies do not move quickly to limit the damage.
	   ``No country or region will be safe because, as we are all
aware, modern crises travel through commercial and financial
channels that embrace the whole world,'' Fujimori said.
	   The Peruvian did not mention Tokyo directly, but Japan _ the
world's second-largest economy _ has come under intense
international pressure to fix its own weaknesses and help rescue
its troubled neighbors.
	   Fujimori said the Asian crisis has hurt Peru somewhat by driving
down the prices of raw materials like copper, tin, gold, lead and
zinc, which comprise nearly 40 percent of the country's exports.
	   A senior Japanese official, meanwhile, said Asia can learn
lessons from Latin America about handling financial crises.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international
affairs, said Asian financial institutions ``need to catch up''
with Latin America in areas like ``transparency and disclosure.''
	   Sakakibara praised the quick response of Latin America and
Mexico in particular during Mexico's peso devaluation crisis in
1995.
	   He said Asia needs to adjust the way it responds to financial
crises and that there are also lessons that Asia can learn from
Latin America's regional cooperation efforts.
	   Sakakibara said the Asian crisis is a problem of global
capitalism and called for better procedures on the part of
international financial authorities to respond to the quick flows
of capital in and out of countries.
	   The two-day symposium was co-sponsored by the Washington-based
Inter-American Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of
Japan.

Eds: UPDATES with Sampson quote
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   U.S. soccer players got their wish: Steve Sampson has resigned
as coach of the national team.
	   The first American-born coach to lead the United States at a
World Cup, Sampson oversaw an 0-3 flop and a last-place finish in
the 32-team field.
	   Veteran players, angered at their lack of playing time, were
calling for Sampson's head since the team was eliminated with a 2-1
loss to Iran on June 20.
	   ``We were naive to think an inexperienced coach would see the
value of experienced players,'' forward Eric Wynalda said. ``We
should never let this happen again.''
	   U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg met Sampson for
breakfast in Paris on Monday morning, then announced Sampson's
resignation.
	   ``This was my decision, my decision only,'' Sampson said early
Tuesday in Paris, before heading back to California. ``My mind was
made up when I met with him yesterday morning. I felt it was best I
reacquaint myself with my family and allow Alan Rothenberg the
freedom to select someone else that could give this national team a
fresh start.''

Compaq lays off 400 in Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As part of a global restructuring, U.S.-based
Compaq Computer Corp. will lay off 400 workers in Singapore, a
company spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.
	   On Monday, Compaq in the United States announced it would cut
5,000 jobs worldwide as it consolidates operations following the
acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp.
	   Included in the restructuring, the Digital factory in Singapore
will be consolidated with the Compaq plant here.
	   Layoffs in Singapore this year will likely rise to an all-time
high as the country sinks further into the economic doldrums.
	   Minister without Portfolio Lim Boon Heng said earlier the number
of workers losing their jobs will probably exceed the peak of
20,000 hit during the 1985-86 recession.

Russia receives IMF loan disbursement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After months of waiting, Russia's cash-strapped
government has finally received dlrs 670 million as part of an
International Monetary Fund loan, according to a report Tuesday.
	   The IMF decided last Thursday to release the money after
delaying it for months and pressing the Russian government to do
more to balance its budget.
	   The funds arrived Tuesday at the Russian Finance Ministry's
account, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a ministry
official.
	   The money is part of an IMF loan for dlrs 9 billion that is
spread over three years. But the IMF has on several occasions
delays the installments because it was not satisfied with the
government's financial performance.
	   The money will not be enough to pull Russia out of its current
financial tailspin, but it should give President Boris Yeltsin's
government a bit more breathing space.
	   Russian financial markets have been falling sharply in recent
weeks, due to a combination of factors that include government
budget problems, a drop in revenues from oil exports, and the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new
lending from the IMF as part of an economic package aimed at
preventing a devaluation of the ruble. An IMF is considering the
loan request.
	   Also on Tuesday, Russian commercial banks were allowed to
restart gold exports, only days after they were suspended on
grounds of a legal dispute, officials said.
	   The trouble was apparently caused by a lack of regulations on
whether gold is to be classified as a commodity _ and therefore out
of bounds for banks _ or as a monetary item.
	   The Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade intends to
draft corrections to export rules to classify gold as a monetary
item and avoid similar problems in the future, ministry officials
said, according to Interfax.

France renews support for U.N.-backed military intervention 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Tuesday renewed his
country's support for U.N.-sanctioned NATO intervention to stop the
fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Hubert Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``It must happen with
a decision by the Security Council'' of the United Nations.
	   All options must be looked at, he said, because ``the potential
for destabilization of the situation in Kosovo could become a
powder keg for Europe.''
	   But the French position has contrasted with Washington's stand
that action may not require Security Council approval, which would
imply Russian backing. The Russians have opposed military action
against Serbian-led Yugoslavia.
	   The foreign minister called for an autonomy that is ``the
largest possible, real and substantive for Kosovo.'' But he
cautioned against independence that ``could lead to a movement of
destabilization in this Balkan region that has already suffered
very much.''
	   Independence would be ``a solution that would continue to
fragment the Balkan region into micro-states,'' Vedrine said.
	   He called for unity among the so-called Contact Group of
countries concerned with the former Yugoslavia, in which he said
``a few biased nuances were made in the last few days.'' He did not
elaborate.

Malaysia's finance minister welcomes new economic czar 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister on
Tuesday rejected the possibility that a newly appointed economic
czar could scuttle his efforts to refloat the nation's economy.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim denied that his influence had
been neutralized by the appointment of Daim Zainuddin, a former
finance minister, as a special minister of economic affairs.
	   ``I view it positively as all this while we have worked as a
team,'' said Anwar, when reporters asked whether Daim's appointment
to the Cabinet had weakened his own position.
	   ``We can't stop others from making interpretations (about the
appointment),'' he was quoted by the national news agency Bernama
as saying. Anwar is also Malaysia's deputy prime minister.
	   Daim has backed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's calls for a
softer monetary policy that will allow viable businesses greater
access to loans. Anwar had favored high interest rates and a
tighter policy.
	   Some analysts saw Daim's appointment as a reproof to Anwar, who
introduced an austerity program in December to curb inflation and
protect the Malaysia's currency, the ringgit.
	   Mahathir favors high-growth policies and looser interest rates
to help revive the economy, which shrank by 1.8 percent in the
first quarter of 1998.
	   But more recently Anwar has said that he too favored lower
interest rates. On Monday, he said ``excessively high'' interest
rates were bad for business.

Ukrainian police looking for bar killer

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Police in Ukraine's Black Sea port of
Odessa were looking for a man who shot dead three people in a bar
fight, newspapers said Tuesday.
	   The attacker went into the ``To and From'' bar early Sunday as
the owners were celebrating at a private party. Enraged by their
refusal to serve him, the drunken fishing company worker,
identified only as Vyacheslav, 32, threatened the owners with a
pistol.
	   Bar employees seized the man's weapon and threw him out, but
Vyacheslav went to his nearby home and soon returned with another
pistol, the dailies Kievskiye Vedomosti and Fakty reported.
	   The assailant then began firing indiscriminately, killing the
bar owner, his 18-year-old son and another relative.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ South African flanker Andre Vos has
knocked back a second season with Australian Super 12 team
Queensland on the advice of Springbok coach Nick Mallett.
	   Vos had an oustanding season for the Reds this year and they
wanted him back in 1999.
	   But Mallett told Vos that he was part of South Africa's plans
for next year's World Cup and should play for a South African-based
Super 12 team.
	   ``I was born in South Africa and want to play for South Africa
in the World Cup, so there was no other choice for me,'' Vos said
Tuesday. ``If I don't stay in South Africa I would have no
chance.''

With Clinton out of Beijing, China declares trip success 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Even with 3 1/2 days still left in U.S. President
Bill Clinton's China trip, Beijing evaluated the visit Tuesday as a
complete success.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang pointed to a string of
agreements Clinton reached with President Jiang Zemin on Saturday _
from not targeting each other's territory with nuclear missiles to
cooperating on environmental protection and legal reforms.
	   ``Thanks to the efforts of both sides, President Clinton's China
visit achieved full success,'' Tang told reporters at a twice
weekly media briefing.
	   It ``expanded the exchanges and cooperation in a wide range of
fields, deepened the American understanding of China, increased the
friendship between the two peoples and brought about new progress
toward the goal of a constructive strategic partnership,'' he
added.
	   Beyond the substantive agreements, Tang suggested that the trip
yielded an important intangible benefit _ mutual understanding _
that could help maintain the momentum in Chinese-U.S. relations.
	   Clinton toured the monuments of ancient China and, Tang said,
gave students and teachers at Peking University on Monday a lesson
in American views on human rights and democracy.
	   ``President Clinton had the opportunity to appreciate the long
history and splendid culture of China and witness the achievements
of China's reform, opening and modernization construction and
experience the friendly feeling of the Chinese for the American
people,'' Tang said.
	   President Jiang needed a successful Clinton trip to strengthen
his hand inside the Communist Party leadership, to silence critics
of China abroad and maintain confidence among foreign investors.
	   He has given Clinton unprecedented access to live broadcasts,
business executives and even farmers so that the U.S. president can
sell his messages of American cooperation to Chinese and a changing
China to Americans.
	   Clinton met with community leaders and answered questions on a
radio talk show in Shanghai on Tuesday, his first of two full days
in China's flashy financial capital. He will briefly tour scenic
Guilin in the south on Thursday before heading to Hong Kong.

Italian premier's visit expected to improve Iran-EU relations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Prodi expected to arrive Tuesday evening, about 1530 GMT

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians were hailing the expected visit of
the Italian prime minister late Tuesday as a first step to
improving relations with the European Union, which were severely
strained after a German court implicated the Tehran government in
an assassination.
	   The visit by Romano Prodi, the first by an EU head of government
since Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis in 1992, ``will
result in an immediate thaw in relations between Tehran and the
European Union,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Ahani told the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   For Italy's part, Prodi's trip shows that Rome is taking the
lead among EU governments in bolstering relations with Iran, which
has significant trade with several European countries.
	   The Italian minister of foreign trade is accompanying Prodi.
Iran's Ahani said his government hopes to do more business with
Italy, which is Tehran's fourth biggest trading partner in the
world. Their volume of trade reached dlrs 2.3 billion last year,
IRNA reported.
	   During his three-day visit, Prodi is expected to hold talks with
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and business leaders.
	   Prodi will also address a cultural conference at Tehran
University called ``Look to the East,'' IRNA reported.
	   The 15-nation EU broke off regular meetings with Iranian
officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after a German
court accused Iranian leaders of ordering the 1992 assassination of
four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
	   The ambassadors returned late last year and in March the EU
agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Relations have long been strained by Iran's 1989 death sentence
against the British author Salman Rushdie for his allegedly
blasphemous book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Britain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the
EU, said recently it was encouraged by the political changes in
Iran since Khatami took office in August. But London said it still
had serious concerns about Iran's support for extremist groups and
its opposition to the Middle East peace process.
	   Iran supports the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and the Hamas
militant group in the Palestinian territories.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West. He has promoted
cultural and sporting exchanges with the United States and has
eased social restrictions imposed by the clergy after the 1979
Islamic revolution.

U.S. Treasury chief says Japan main risk for global crisis 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
stressed Tuesday that the risk of the Asian crisis turning into a
global depression remains low, but the most likely trigger would be
the perilous state of Japan's economy.
	   Rubin told reporters that a recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to
approve dlrs 18 billion for the International Monetary Fund sought
by the Clinton administration so it can quickly respond to new
outbreaks of economic upheaval.
	   Otherwise, a new phase of the crisis ``could result in a very
substantive impact on the American economy,'' until now largely
spared except for agricultural exports, Rubin said.
	   Rubin stopped in Thailand after China and Malaysia on a
pulse-taking trip a year after the crisis erupted July 2, 1997,
when Thailand allowed the baht to depreciate, touching off an
epidemic of currency turmoil. He is to end the tour with a visit to
South Korea.
	   Rubin repeated his message that Japan's failure to reverse
economic stagnation since the bubble economy collapsed eight years
ago was delaying regional recovery and posed the chief threat of
the crisis spreading outside Asia.
	   ``I think the probability of global contagion is always low,''
Rubin said. ``What Japan does is very important. The immediate
focus on Japan is to develop effective responses in their banking
sector that win respect in international markets.''
	   Rubin said earlier in an address to business students at
Chulalongkorn University that Japan needed to create an economy
``led by domestic demand and a healthy currency.''
	   ``It is critical to the economic health of Thailand, the region
and the rest of the world,'' Rubin said.
	   The Japanese yen was recently propped up by U.S. intervention,
and Rubin did not rule out such action again if ``appropriate.'' It
was the first sale of dollars by Washington in financial markets
since 1992.
	   The United States has stressed that Japan needs to implement a
range of structural economic reforms and particularly deal with bad
loans troubling its banking sector.
	   Rubin met Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and said the United States stands ready to
back additional demands for credit by Thailand from the IMF, but
neither he nor Tarrin indicated that would be required.
	   The Thai government has shut down 56 finance companies and taken
over four small banks to sort out its financial sector. Rubin said
he had reviewed banking sector reforms with Thai officials but
refused to disclose details.
	   Rubin responded to a student's question about whether banks
should be nationalized by saying it was up to Thai authorities.
	   Rubin defended the IMF, which is leading bailouts totaling some
dlrs 120 billion for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, for
demanding tight monetary policies that critics say are making the
crisis worse by killing businesses.
	   Lowering interest rates would only divert attention from the
real reforms that need to be made and delay ``getting back to solid
growth and financial stability,'' Rubin said.
	   Asia's recovery will be rooted in values he said had created
growth in the first place: a strong work ethic, high savings rate
and focus on education. But he gave no time-frame for recovery.
	   Rubin said that financial speculators, blamed by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad for causing the crisis, were only minor
culprits.
	   The main causes were capital flight because of fear over poor
policies and corporations shielding against unstable domestic
currencies by buying dollars, Rubin said.

Independent newspaper editor attacked 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unknown assailants attacked and seriously wounded
the editor of an independent newspaper in central Russia, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Sergei Bachinin, editor of the Vyatsky Nablyudatel (Vyatka
Observer), was hospitalized after sustaining skull and brain
injuries Monday night in Kirov, 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of
Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Bachinin is known as an independent journalist critical of local
and regional officials. In a 1996 election, he was the main
opponent of the present mayor.
	   The motive for the attack was not known. But journalists at the
newspaper said they believed that people opposed to Bachinin's work
were responsible for the attack, ITAR-Tass said.

Six drown in suspected clandestine crossing to Spain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ Coast guards pulled six bodies out of the
sea on Tuesday off the coast of the north African Spanish enclave
of Ceuta, authorities said
	   The six men were probably would-be immigrants who drowned while
making the dangerous crossing from neighboring Morocco to mainland
Spain, Interior Ministry spokesman Ricardo Franca said.
	   Franca stressed that an attempted clandestine sea crossing was
only a first hypothesis. Coast guards had not located either the
boat that the six are thought to have been traveling in, or any
survivors of a shipwreck, he said.
	   Every year thousands of people fleeing poverty and unemployment
in north Africa make the overnight sea journey to southern Spain in
makeshift boats. The Strait of Gibraltar separating Morocco from
Spain is as narrow as 12 miles (20 kilometers) in some places.
	   Coast guards from the southern province of Cadiz, where most of
the immigrants are heading, arrested 691 would-be immigrants from
January to June 28 this year.
	   They were arrested as their boats approached the shore or soon
after they reached land.
	   Authorities are expecting an increase in the number of crossings
with improved summer weather. Over 100 people were intercepted by
Cadiz coast guards last weekend alone.

Thai stocks watchdog suspends licenses of mutual fund executives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's biggest mutual fund company
on Tuesday defended activities that led to the suspensions of four
of its fund managers, saying they were caused by problems of
interpretation of stock trading rules.
	   The Mutual Fund company gave its statement to the Stock Exchange
of Thailand after the Securities and Exchange Commission suspended
four traders accused of breaches of professional ethics and poor
investment decisions.
	   Punishment for trading infractions on the Thai market is not
common, and under the approach taken by the commission, violators
are usually not named.
	   Among the four executives suspended in the Mutual Fund case is
the company's president, Damrongsuk Amatayakul.
	   The exchange said the suspension, effective June 17, will last
for six months and can be appealed.
	   In one case, it said in a statement, three executives ``decided
to invest in bills of exchange issued by a company with which they
appear to have conflicts of interests.
	   ``They did not consider return on investment, and that was
considered careless investment management, and a breach of
professional ethics.''
	   In a second case, three managers ``decided to invest in bills of
exchange issued by a company without considering its financial
status and earnings performance, which have significantly
deteriorated,'' the exchange said.
	   ``The act reflected their careless investment ... which is
considered a breach of professional ethics,'' it added.
	   The exchange did not say which company issued the promissory
notes, but said the executives invested in the company ``despite
their knowledge that it suffered losses continually... (and) that
it was unable to repay loans.''
	   In response to the suspension, the company said it ``has
strictly complied with SEC rules.
	   ``The damage incurred was the result of the country's economic
and financial crisis. The company sees that professional ethics and
practices as set by the SEC are broad and do not contain clear-cut
details, posing problems of interpretation,'' the company said in a
filing with the exchange.

Marshall back in All Blacks squad 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Australian reaction
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Scrum half Justin Marshall won a
recall to the All Blacks squad Tuesday ahead of the opening
tri-nations test against Australia on July 11.
	   Marshall snapped his Achilles tendon during a match for his
Super 12 team Canterbury in March. He was expected to be sidelined
until August but made a successful return for New Zealand A on
Sunday.
	   Marshall was captain of the All Blacks during last year's tour
of Britain when Sean Fitzpatrick was injured. He missed out on
replacing Fitzpatrick in the long term with Taine Randell taking
over the job.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen said he expected Marshall would be
brought straight back into the team to replace Ofisa Tonu'u.
	   ``He's been missed but Tonu'u is no slouch either,'' Macqueen
said. ``Between the two of them I'm sure they will get a good 80
minutes.
	   ``Marshall works so well with (fly-half) Andrew Mehrtens, that's
a significant factor.''
	   Wallaby skipper John Eales said Marshall's return was more
significant given the heavy losses through retirements of
Fitzpatrick, Zinzan Brooke and Frank Bunce.
	   ``He's a world class player, there's no doubt about that but
when you think of a New Zealand team generally they all are,''
Eales said.
	   The selectors named 25 players to prepare for the tri-nations
series, with two newcomers in Auckland lock Royce Willis and hooker
Mark Hammett.
	   Veteran flanker Michael Jones also returns after missing the
second test victory against England through injury suffered in the
first test.
	   Hammett has come in for Norm Hewitt, who has been ruled out for
the rest of the year by the cruciate ligament injury he picked up
in Saturday's test.
	   New Zealand was disappointing in beating England 40-10 on
Saturday after winning the first test 64-22. Australia has won all
three of its tests convincingly while South Africa, the other
tri-nations team, posted a record score in thrashing Wales last
weekend.
	   New Zealand squad: Taine Randell (captain), Christian Cullen,
Jeff Wilson, Joeli Vidiri, Jonah Lomu, Scott McLeod, Caleb Ralph,
Walter Little, Mark Mayerhofler, Carlos Spencer, Andrew Mehrtens,
Justin Marshall, Ofisa Tonu'u, Josh Kronfeld, Mark Carter, Michael
Jones, Isitolo Maka, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Royce Willis, Olo
Brown, Craig Dowd, Carl Hoeft, Anton Oliver, Mark Hammett.

Rights group slams U.N. over girls' education, health care 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A U.S. human rights group accused the
United Nations on Tuesday of reaching an agreement with the Taliban
religious army that denies adequate health care and education to
women and girls in Afghanistan.
	   Taliban troops have imposed a harsh version of Islamic law since
taking control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, in 1996 and
consolidating their hold over 85 percent of the war-weary country.
	   They have shut down schools for girls, thrown women out of work,
forced them to wear an all-enveloping robe called a burqua and
publicly beat women who defied them.
	   Under an agreement signed with the Taliban in May, the United
Nations accepted that access to clinics and classrooms for
Afghanistan's women and girls ``will need to be gradual.''
	   The American group Physicians for Human Rights said this
situation was unacceptable, calling it a ``betrayal of
international human rights standards and of the female population
of Afghanistan.''
	   The U.N. disagreed.
	   A spokesman in neighboring Pakistan, Rupert Coleville said it
was a significant step forward to persuade the Taliban to commit in
writing to educating girls and granting equal access to health care
for women.
	   Coleville said agreeing to ``gradual'' equality of access was
``only realistic'' in a country where many women have never had the
opportunity of an education.
	   The agreement ``is a negotiating process,'' he said. ``We never
pretended that it was some dramatic breakthrough.''
	   But since signing that agreement on May 13, the Taliban appears
to have backtracked.
	   Two weeks ago the Taliban shut down more than 100 privately run
schools for children, including girls. The Taliban also shut down
vocational schools that were teaching women a trade.
	   Last week the Taliban issued a new order forbidding doctors to
treat women unaccompanied by a close male relative.
	   In a strongly worded attack on the U.N. agreement with the
Taliban, the Physicians for Human Rights demanded that the world
body break off the agreement.
	   ``And make it clear that the international body finds the
Taliban's policy of extreme discrimination and segregation by
gender abhorrent in every way and a violation of human rights
standards,'' the statement said.
	   On Tuesday the United Nations sent representatives to Kabul to
negotiate with the Taliban and try to persuade them to follow the
terms of the agreement.

Trial begins for for Kurdish rebel commander in Turkey 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ The trial of the captured No. 2
commander of Kurdish guerrillas began here Tuesday.
	   Semdin Sakik, captured by Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq in
April, appeared before a state security court along with his
brother, Arif, who is also being tried on charges of murder and
Kurdish separatism.
	   Conviction can bring the death penalty.
	   The trial in Diyarbakir, the main city in the southeast, where
the guerrilla war has been carried out since 1984, was immediately
adjourned until Sept. 3, to give more time to defense lawyers who
contended they were denied access to him until Monday, when they
were given an hour to meet.
	   Sakik masterminded the operations of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, inside Turkey. He is accused of killing 113
local Kurds and 125 soldiers.
	   Sakik told investigators, according to press leaks, that several
media members and a prominent human rights activist worked with the
PKK. The activist was shot and seriously wounded by
ultra-nationalists gunmen in reaction to the allegations last
month.

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon for second straight day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in south Lebanon for a second straight day on
Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah guerrilla
group fired at the two Israeli jets but missed, the officials said.
	   The planes fired four missiles at hide-outs in the hills of
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the sites of the attack, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately known whether there were any casualties.
	   On Monday, two Israeli jets fired missiles at guerrilla
positions in south Lebanon in apparent retaliation for a roadside
bomb that killed two Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
bombing. There were no casualties in Monday's air raid.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the
occupied zone.
	   The zone covers about 10 percent of Lebanese territory and was
established in 1985 in an attempt to protect Israel's northern
towns from guerrilla attacks.

Hong Kong share prices close higher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher
Tuesday, boosted by a firmer Japanese currency and an overnight
rally on Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 82.39 points, or 1.0 percent, closing at 8,543.10. On Monday,
the index had fallen 147.15 points.
	   Turnover slipped to 4.47 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
573 million) from Monday's 6.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 797 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened higher and continued to rise
for most of the session in reaction to the rise in the Japanese
yen, which was quoted at 139.95 to the dollar in late trading.
	   ``The strength of the Japanese yen is clearly supporting the
market,'' said Alex Tang, research director at Core
Pacific-Yamaichi International (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   The Hong Kong market was also helped by Monday's gains on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 52.82 points to
8,997.36.
	   All financial institutions will be closed in Hong Kong on
Wednesday for observances marking the first anniversary of the
handover of the territory to Chinese sovereignty.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 30 Hong Kong cents to 38.10,
and Sun Hung Kai Properties was unchanged at 32.90.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 4.50 dollars to
189.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 30 cents to 43.80.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 40 cents to 40.90, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' rose 30 cents to 29.25.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces maintained a blockade
around a Kosovo mining village on Tuesday as they tried to dislodge
ethnic Albanian separatists. Amid the fighting, a human rights
group accused the Serbs of rape and other war crimes.
	   Serb police blocked access to the besieged area around
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, an indication that their assault was continuing.
	   On Monday, a three-pronged Serbian attack sent more than 8,000
people streaming away from their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade. By evening police and other
paramilitary Serb forces had advanced within 200 meters (yards) of
Belacevac.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to AP offices in the Balkans, the respected
private watchdog group said it had ``powerful evidence'' that Serb
police ``summarily executed an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said the
KLA siege of Kijevo town ``affects civilians and other
non-combatants in the town.''
	   Suspicions of war crimes and less grave rights violations have
led to demands from foreign capitals that international observers
be allowed into Kosovo _ something that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic recently agreed to.
	   In Pristina, western diplomats said observers had begun
trickling into the Serbian province and were looking for
accommodations in and around the provincial capital.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded the withdrawal of Serb
special forces and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday on the Shanghai stop of President Bill
Clinton's China visit.
	   The fighting came as international envoys urged the two sides to
seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic and
moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders to try to find a solution to the
conflict, while another U.S. diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in negotiations for peace in the region.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It increasingly is
supported by the ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Tensions were remained high at Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main hot
spot _ with rebels bracing for a new attack after Yugoslav
helicopters strafed them over the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen were estimated to be
in the village, cut off from supplies and other support by a ring
of Albanian fighters. The KLA holds large areas north and south of
the road that passes through Kijevo and connects Pristina and the
main city of Pec.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Monday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the U.N.
Security Council must approve any military action.
	   The United States says the Security Council's blessing is not
needed for NATO intervention, but Russia disagrees.
	   In Paris Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine renewed
his country's support for U.N.-sanctioned NATO intervention to stop
the fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for
Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``It must happen with a
decision by the Security Council.''

More funds urged to help stem Vietnam's teacher shortage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More money should be set side to train
university teachers and pay them better to overcome Vietnam's
severe shortage, a prominent professor says.
	   Student enrollment at the more than 100 universities and
colleges has nearly quadrupled in the past seven years to 700,000,
Luong Xuan Quy, rector of Hanoi Economics College, said in an
article for the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan on Tuesday.
	   At the same time, the number of teachers has risen only 5
percent to more than 21,000.
	   Quy said the shortage of teachers and an increase in overloaded
instructors _ some of whom have to teach 35-40 periods a week _ has
led to degradation in the quality of teaching and training.
	   Few students choose a teaching career, which carries a salary of
just dlrs 60 to dlrs 90 per month.
	   The shortage also is evident at the primary and secondary
levels, where Vietnam is short some 200,000 teachers. Their average
monthly salary is dlrs 40, leading many to quit for better-paying
professions.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The corporation cleaning up Japan's mountains of
housing loan debts sued Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Tuesday in a first step
to force commercial banks to take responsibility for the debacle.
	   The Housing Loan Administration suit, filed at Tokyo District
Court, demands 4.83 billion yen (dlrs 34.3 million) in damages and
accuses Sumitomo of knowingly introducing the lenders to unsound
borrowers.
	   Seven mortgage lending companies _ known as ``jusen'' _
collapsed in 1995, forcing the government to allocate 680 billion
yen (dlrs 4.8 billion) in public funds to help clean up their bad
debts.
	   The Housing Loan Administration was created to handle the
cleanup.
	   The suit could set a precedent for legal action against banks
and their management in a broader cleanup of Japan's debt-ridden
banking system. The government is expected to announce an outline
of the cleanup this month.
	   ``Banks think they can do whatever as long as they abide by the
law, which is only a minimum requirement in their business,'' said
Kohei Nakabo, president of the Housing Loan Administration Corp.
	   ``This attitude is at the core of the current vast problems
facing the nation's financial system and the economy,'' he told
reporters.
	   Sumitomo said in a statement that it could not comment on
details of the suit because it had not seen a copy of it, but that
it would tell the court it had no legal responsibility for
introducing the loans.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of jobless in Japan rose in May to a
record high of 2.93 million, the government said Tuesday. The
unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent.
	   The jobless figures come as Japan is struggling with its worst
recession since World War II and is under increasing pressure from
allies to repair its troubled financial system.
	   The number of unemployed in May rose by 490,000 from the same
month a year earlier to hit the highest level since the government
began measuring it in 1953, the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   The unemployment rate, also at a record high, was the same as
the previous month. The steady jobless rate follows three
consecutive months of increases.
	   The employment situation in Japan is grim, and layoffs are
increasing for workers at all ages, an agency official told
reporters. Previously, job losses had been common only for older
workers.
	   The number of people employed, meanwhile, dropped by 350,000, or
0.5 percent, from the same month a year ago to 65.97 million,
marking the fourth straight month of year-on-year declines.
	   The unemployment situation was particularly severe for men from
younger and older generations. The jobless rate for men between the
age of 15 and 24 came to 8.5 percent in May, up 1.4 percentage
points from the year-earlier month.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Workers at Hyundai Motors Co. put down
their tools Tuesday to protest layoffs, halting assembly lines at
South Korea's largest automaker, union leaders said.
	   The one-day strike came shortly after Hyundai notified the Labor
Ministry of its plans to lay off 4,800 workers. By law, Hyundai
must notify the government 30 days in advance of layoffs.
	   In Hyundai's main plant in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, at least 10,000 workers walked off the assembly
lines, union officials said.
	   ``The management is not trying hard enough to limit layoffs,''
said union spokesman Kim Kun-soo, repeating a demand that Hyundai
cut work hours rather than shed workers.
	   Kim said the walkout will continue until Wednesday afternoon,
with further strike plans to be announced thereafter.
	   In May, Hyundai announced plans to lay off 8,200 _ or 27 percent
_ of its 30,000 workers, citing domestic car sales that have
dropped to less than half of those last year.
	   Since then, some 3,400 workers have volunteered for early
retirement.
	   Hyundai was the first conglomerate to resort to mass layoffs in
a country where the custom long was to employ a worker for life _ a
custom now threatened by Asia's economic crisis.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Daewoo Electronics Co. announced plans
Tuesday to build a dlrs 200 million television plant in Casablanca,
Morocco.
	   Construction is to begin in early July, with completion set for
early next year. Daewoo plans to finance the project with
syndicated loans from Morocco banks.
	   The plant will produce one million 14-, 20-, 21- and 25-inch
color television sets annually for sale in Africa, Europe and the
Middle East.
	   Daewoo's 13 plants at home and abroad produced 10.1 million
television sets last year, grabbing an 8.4 percent share of the
world's 120-million television market.
	   Daewoo Group is South Korea's third largest conglomerate in net
assets.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As part of a global restructuring, U.S.-based
Compaq Computer Corp. will lay off 400 workers in Singapore, a
company spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.
	   On Monday, Compaq in the United States announced it would cut
5,000 jobs worldwide as it consolidates operations following the
acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp.
	   Included in the restructuring, the Digital factory in Singapore
will be consolidated with the Compaq plant here.
	   Layoffs in Singapore this year will likely rise to an all-time
high as the country sinks further into the economic doldrums.
	   Minister without Portfolio Lim Boon Heng said earlier the number
of workers losing their jobs will probably exceed the peak of
20,000 hit during the 1985-86 recession.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors on Tuesday vowed to arrest
bank employees interfering with a government takeover of five shaky
financial institutions.
	   Employees who changed computer codes and destroyed documents and
other bank property will be charged with interference with
government work, prosecutors said.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the closure of five
banks Monday as part of the government's effort to restore the
confidence of foreign investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   Five bigger commercial banks will absorb their assets.
	   But bank regulators have failed to enforce the order because
workers refuse to cooperate with them _ in some cases reportedly
changing computer codes and destroying documents.
	   Despite a government promise of job security for most employees,
thousands of workers continued to stage sit-downs or did not report
for work Tuesday.
	   Operations are stalled at the five banks and officials said
further interruption of banking operations could cause massive
defaults of bonds and checks issued by the banks.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) - Auckland electricity supplier
Mercury Energy says it faces losses of U.S. dlrs 64 million (128
million NZ dollars) for the power failures that plunged the center
city into blackouts for five weeks in February and March.
	   Mercury chairman Jim Macaulay said the company had set the
amount aside to cover ``all known and expected'' costs associated
with the central business district power failures.
	   The figure only covers the direct liability of Mercury to power
users.
	   Downtown businesses earlier estimated their collective losses at
U.S. dlrs 50 million (100 million NZ dollars) a week during each of
the five weeks of the blackout.
	   That amount was considered conservative by economists, since it
didn't account for long-term losses in tourism or international
investment and trade, or personal losses by those who lived
downtown.
	   While Mercury has paid some compensation to some affected
businesses and reduced power bills for others, at least one group
of central city business owners say they will soon sue Mercury to
claim their losses.
	   The group, which claims the support of at least 200 local
business owners, has dismissed the company offer of compensation as
completely inadequate.
	   Mercury on Tuesday reported a net loss of U.S. dlrs 12.7 (25.3
million NZ) for the year to March 31 as a result of the blackout.

Thatcher says Asian crisis highlights flawed capitalism 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Asia's economic crisis highlighted flaws in its
version of capitalism _ corruption, lack of transparency in the
financial sector and a failure to develop the necessary political
framework, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote in a
newspaper article publishing Tuesdsay.
	   Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Lady Thatcher, Conservative
Party prime minister from 1979-90, said the Japan's economic model
consisted of a relatively small state sector married with a large
amount of corporatism and a complex government intervention.
	   ``Compromises of this sort are never attractive,'' she wrote.
	   ``We know that it is free enterprise capitalism that works best
to foster innovation and create jobs,'' she added. ``We know that
the more statist economies of continental Europe are not so
successful. And we know that the Asian brand of quasi-capitalism
has even greater flaws.''
	   Japan needed to cut taxes, open its financial affairs to more
transparency and competition, complete re-capitalization of its
banking and financial system, and introduce political changes, she
said.
	   During the 80s, Lady Thatcher wrought big changes in Britain
with policies that included emasculating the labor unions and
selling loss-making state-run enterprises.
	   She described criticism as ``faintly absurd'' criticism of
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests by the United States, Russia,
China, Britain and France, the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
	   ``No amount of huffing and puffing about test bans and
nonproliferation is going to stop major regional powers and
possible future superpowers such as India also becoming nuclear
powers.''
	   On China, she said the West, while doing business, had a ``moral
duty to dissidents, persecuted Christians and slave laborers in the
prison camps that must not be shirked.''

Singapore passes act detailing illegal use of computers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A day after passing legislation to promote the
use of electronic commerce, Singapore passed an amendment Tuesday
to keep pace with the fast-evolving world of cyber crime.
	   Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told Parliament that ``the
increase in the number of computer crimes and the serious
implications of these offenses'' requires broader, tougher and more
modern measures.
	   The amended Computer Misuse Act seeks to enhance security, deter
computer criminals with harsh penalties, and broaden powers to
investigate such misdeeds.
	   New penalties for tampering with ``protected computer'' systems
include fines of up to 10,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 5,850) and 20
years imprisonment.
	   This would apply to computers used by important institutions:
the police, civil defense force, national utilities and
telecommunications companies, transportation services, major banks,
the military, and various emergency services.
	   High-tech Singapore aims to bring information technology into
most homes in this affluent but resource-poor island republic. It
has created a high-speed national network, and hopes to reap the
benefits of increased trade on the Internet.
	   Wong said ``the legislative framework must keep pace with
developments to ensure the integrity of our computer systems
against would-be cyber criminals and hackers.''
	   With the greater use of computers at home and work, Wong said
that cyber crime has become more sophisticated and the number of
cases has jumped in Singapore.
	   The law also increases punishment for unauthorized access to or
modification of computer material, including computer viruses;
unauthorized use or interception of computer services, such as
phone cloning; and sabotage of industrial computer systems.
	   The amendment targets new electronic transgressions not
addressed in the original law, and cases where individuals with
authorized access to a computer system commit disruptive acts.
	   This covers so-called ``e-mail bombing,'' where enormous amounts
of e-mail are sent to a victim. It also includes more recent
developments that disrupt a network or user's computer, and the
illegal use of someone else's password to gain access to a computer
or network.
	   The amendment also gives the police additional powers of
investigation, including access to encrypted data and the right to
compel computer administrators to help retrieve required
information.

China says Hong Kong little changed in first year of Chinese rule 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Hong Kong-Handover
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hong Kong has changed little in its first year
under Chinese rule, proving that Beijing has been a good sovereign,
China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said Beijing had kept
its promise to give Hong Kong autonomy after 156 years of British
rule ended July 1, 1997.
	   ``Hong Kong enjoys social and psychological stability. Its
social system and living style remain unchanged. Its laws remain
basically unchanged, and the vast number of Hong Kong people
continue to enjoy various rights and freedoms, and the tradition of
rule of law was well maintained,'' Tang said.
	   President Jiang Zemin flew into Hong Kong Tuesday to preside at
Wednesday's anniversary celebrations. On Thursday, he is to open a
new airport on one of the territory's outlying islands.
	   ``What happened over the past one year in Hong Kong eliminated
the various suspicions over Hong Kong's return,'' Tang said at a
twice-weekly media briefing.
	   He did not specifically mention Hong Kong's lackluster economy
and rising unemployment, but cited ``current difficulties'' that he
called ``temporary.'' Nor did Tang mention controversies over
changes in election methods that ensured a pro-Beijing majority in
the local legislature.
	   Even some of Beijing's staunchest critics in the territory have
admitted that the first year under China's red flag has gone
smoothly.
	   Wednesday's anniversary of the handover, however, has been
overshadowed in the Chinese media by U.S. President Bill Clinton's
current nine-day China visit.
	   When asked by a Hong Kong reporter why the anniversary was being
given such subdued treatment, Tang noted ``President Jiang will
travel to Hong Kong and attend the celebration of the first
anniversary of Hong Kong's return. Is that a low-key phenomenon?''

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in south Lebanon for a second straight day on
Tuesday.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah guerrilla
group fired at the two Israeli jets but missed, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The planes fired four missiles at hide-outs in the hills of
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the sites of the attack, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately known whether there were any casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said the pilots
attacked guerrilla bases and reported accurate hits.
	   On Monday, two Israeli jets fired missiles at guerrilla
positions in south Lebanon in apparent retaliation for a roadside
bomb that killed two Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
bombing. There were no casualties in Monday's air raid.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the
occupied zone.
	   The zone covers about 10 percent of Lebanese territory and was
established in 1985 in an attempt to protect Israel's northern
towns from guerrilla attacks.

Mortar shell explodes near Indian army camp

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Residents who two days ago fled Pakistani
shelling that killed three civilians returned Tuesday to their
homes in India's share of the disputed Himalayan territory of
Kashmir, officials said.
	   In addition to the three killed Sunday, five people were injured
when mortar shells exploded in the northern town of Cargill and two
border villages in the northwestern districts of Baramullah and
Kuphwara, army and police officials said.
	   A Pakistani shell exploded near an Indian army helipad in
Cargill Tuesday, but no one was injured.
	   Indian soldiers retaliated with gun fire after the shelling
began Sunday in Cargill, a town of 10,000 people north of Jammu,
the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. Most of Cargill's
residents returned home Tuesday, officials said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Pakistan said at least 26 of its civilians were killed by Indian
shells during the past week. India, however, said Pakistan fired
the first shots.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, whose
population is mostly Muslim. Hindus form 82 percent of India's
nearly 1 billion population.
	   India accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of training and arming
Muslim militants in its share of Kashmir. Pakistan says it provides
only moral support.
	   Two thirds of Kashmir is controlled by India and the rest by
Pakistan. Both nations claim all of the territory.
	   Hostilities between the two neighbors increased after both
nations tested nuclear weapons, escalating the nuclear arms race in
South Asia.

Commission to investigate alleged misuse of funds by Kiev government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Parliament formed a special commission to
investigate the alleged misuse of funds and other illegal
activities by the city government in the capital Kiev.
	   The commission is to check the legality of newly introduced
municipal taxes and tax breaks. It will also investigate
allegations that money for construction projects was misallocated.
	   Opposition lawmakers have charged the city government of
Oleksandr Omelchenko with excessive spending during the recent
reconstruction of historical sites and the capital's central
street, Khreschatik.
	   They said the city allocated over 60 million hryvna (dlrs 30
million) to renovate Khreschatik and 38 million hryvna (dlrs 19
million) to reconstruct two historic squares in downtown Kiev, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The investigative commission was formed after Ukraine's media
questioned Omelchenko's plan to allocate more money to reconstruct
Kiev cathedrals instead of using them to build more apartments or
upgrade utilities.
	   The parliamentary commission is to report its findings to
lawmakers in two months. It includes former Kiev Mayor Leonid
Kosakivsky, who was replaced by President Leonid Kuchma's ally,
Omelchenko, in 1996.

Japan housing starts drop for 17th straight month 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by sluggish consumer demand, Japan's housing
starts in May fell 17 percent from the same month last year _ the
17th straight month of declines, the Construction Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   The government expects the sluggishness in the housing industry
to continue for the near term, saying the outlook is ``poor''
despite record low interest rates, a ministry official told
reporters.
	   There were 102,503 housing starts in May. In April, the figure
had fallen 16.1 percent from a year earlier to 106,001.
	   Private housing was hit hard, with starts for individual homes
in May down 18.6 percent to 39,234 starts, while rental housing
fell 13.4 percent to 35,977.
	   Company housing was pummeled, falling by 61.4 percent to 1,094,
while multi-unit dwellings, including condominiums, fell 15.2
percent to 26,198.
	   Housing is one of the hardest-hit sectors in Japan's
recessionary economy, which has been plagued by feeble consumer
demand. A drop-off in demand for public housing loans also weighed
on May housing starts, the ministry said.
	   The ministry also said housing starts for individual homes may
start rising in the second half of this year, when the government's
16.65 trillion yen (dlrs 118.9 billion) economic stimulus package
and housing-related tax breaks begin to take effect.

Restaurant workers join strike by technicians, costumed characters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Disney comment
<TEXT>
	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Restaurant workers at Disneyland
Paris on Tuesday joined technicians and parade performers in a
strike by a union demanding pay raises, a union spokesman said.
	   Dozens of strikers with signs and banners gathered at the
entrance of Europe's Magic Kingdom 30 kms (18 miles) east of the
capital, on the sixth day of a walkout that began with most parade
performers.
	   Sound and light technicians joined the walkout Monday, and
restaurant workers began walking out Tuesday, but it was not clear
what percentage of the work force was affected. The park said the
daily parade continued as scheduled.
	   ``We have miserable salaries,'' said Michel Balliwech, a local
organizer for the Communist-led General Labor Confederation.
	   The CGT was demanding a minimum 8,500-franc (dlrs 1,400) monthly
salary, or a 7 percent increase. Balliwech, who prints park
tickets, said he earns 7,300 francs (dlrs 1,200) per month after
seven years on the job.
	   ``A 7 percent raise is impossible. There's already been an 8
percent raise over three years,'' said Disneyland spokesman Michel
Dompnier.
	   Dompnier said the park has negotiated daily with the strikers,
who he claimed did not want to be represented by the unions. ``We
are talking with employee representatives.''
	   The park spokesman said Disneyland was offering more training
and higher-paying stage or technical positions to qualifying
employees.
	   ``What's important is that there's been no break in the talks.
And the parade continues,'' Dompnier said.
	   There was no immediate union reaction to Dompnier's comments.
	   About 90 people who participate in the daily Main Street parade
_ more than half the performers _ went on strike at first. But park
officials said the performers were slowly returning to work.
	   Balliwech said he felt no qualms about striking in the middle of
the tourist season.
	   ``Striking is a right,'' he said. ``We're not changing the
atmosphere,'' he insisted.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co. based in Burbank, California, opened the park's
doors in April 1992. It reported annual profit since 1995, in part
by imposing tougher cost controls that have triggered occasional
strikes.

Aid workers may leave Kabul if forced to relocate to dormitories their security; CLARIFIES that relocation applies to living quarters and not offices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with aid workers saying relocation would threaten
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Several international aid groups
threatened Tuesday to leave the beleaguered Afghan capital if the
Taliban religious army forces them to relocate to abandoned
dormitories once used by students of war-damaged technical
institutes.
	   Radio Shariat on Monday announced the Taliban decision to
relocate an estimated 38 international aid groups into the
Soviet-built dormitories within the next month.
	   Western aid workers, who didn't want to be identified because
they still were negotiating with the Taliban, warned that several
humanitarian groups would leave Kabul.
	   The Taliban cited security reasons for the forced relocation.
	   But aid workers said relocating to the dormitories would in fact
be a security risk. They said that housing all the aid workers
together would make them an easy target for military attacks and
hostage taking.
	   The Taliban control roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan where they
have imposed a harsh version of Islamic law that bans women from
working and girls from going to school. It also requires men to
grow a beard, publicly beating any man who shaves.
	   The dormitories, seven cement block buildings, are set among
other buildings ruined by rockets in fighting between rival Islamic
factions that took control of Kabul in 1992 from the communists
then in power.
	   While electricity is available, it's not clear whether the
dormitories are equipped with either running water or sewage
facilities.
	   ``The situation is very critical . . . we want to help the poor
people of Kabul, but we have made it clear that we do not want to
move and we will stop our operations,'' said one aid worker, who
wouldn't give his name.
	   The aid groups were holding emergency meetings in the Afghan
capital on Tuesday to try to plan a course of action. Aid workers
say the Taliban order applies only to their living quarters and not
their offices.
	   It wasn't immediately known whether the Taliban order also
applied to the International Red Cross and the United Nations.

Chandelier falls shortly after Estrada passes at presidential palace 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Philippines-Estrada
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A chandelier crashed to the floor
shortly after the Philippines' superstitious new president, Joseph
Estrada, passed by Tuesday in the presidential palace, officials
said.
	   No one was injured, but security officials were investigating
why it fell, said Brig. Gen. Jose Calimlim, chief of the
Presidential Security Group.
	   The incident was one of the few minor kinks in Estrada's
inauguration Tuesday as the Philippines' 13th president, succeeding
Fidel Ramos.
	   Estrada often jokes about reports the presidential palace is
haunted, and takes extra efforts to avoid being referred to as the
country's 13th president because of the bad luck associated with
the number.
	   During the campaign, he grew a goatee because he was told by a
feng shui expert it would bring him luck. He picked certain
locations for campaign appearances and rejected others because of
considerations of luck, and believes his ever-present wristband is
a good-luck charm.
	   Estrada told reporters of the chandelier's fall. Asked what it
signified, he said, ``I don't know, it's being investigated.''
	   Calimlim said the chandelier crashed shortly after Estrada and
some aides passed by on their way to swear in Cabinet members.
	   In other incidents Tuesday, scores of left-wing students and
farmers tried to get near Estrada three times but were forced back
by riot police outside the historic Barasoain church in Malolos,
northwest of Manila, where the new president was sworn in.
	   The activists planned to convey a string of demands of
impoverished farmers, workers and the poor.
	   Shortly after Estrada arrived at Rizal Park in Manila for his
inaugural address, several women activists unfurled protest
banners, one of which read, ``Land, jobs, food, houses for the
poor.''
	   Police grabbed the banners from the women but made no arrests.
	   Estrada won an overwhelming victory in elections May 11 and has
pledged to devote his six-year term to improving the plight of
millions of poor Filipinos.

Leaded gas banned more widely in China, but problems remain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The eastern city of Hangzhou announced a ban on
leaded gasoline Tuesday, joining Beijing and other Chinese cities
nationwide that are selling only unleaded gas.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was visiting Shanghai, near
Hangzhou, on Tuesday, is making cooperation in environmental
protection a theme of his trip to China.
	   Despite attempts to clean up a growing smog problem, China's
unleaded gasoline is still mixed with leaded fuel in many places,
making it unfit for cars with catalytic converters, Rudy Schlais,
president of China operations for General Motors, said in a recent
interview.
	   GM plans to open a plant in Shanghai at the end of this year
that will make 100,000 Buicks a year. But they will not be equipped
with fuel-efficient engines built to international environmental
standards until the government can guarantee the reliability of
unleaded gasoline, Schlais said.
	   Along with its leaded gas ban, Hangzhou also announced a ban on
detergents containing phosphorous to improve water quality in Tai
Lake, the state-run Xinhua News Agency announced. Both bans take
effect Dec. 1.

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in south Lebanon for a second straight day on
Tuesday.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah guerrilla
group fired at the two Israeli jets but missed, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The planes fired four missiles at hide-outs in the hills of
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the sites of the attack, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately known whether there were any casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said the pilots
attacked guerrilla bases and reported accurate hits.
	   On Monday, two Israeli jets fired missiles at guerrilla
positions in south Lebanon in apparent retaliation for a roadside
bomb that killed two Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
bombing. There were no casualties in Monday's air raid.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the
occupied zone.
	   The zone covers about 10 percent of Lebanese territory and was
established in 1985 in an attempt to protect Israel's northern
towns from guerrilla attacks.

New chief says European Central Bank must speak with `one voice' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with Duisenberg's opening remarks
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The new European Central Bank must
speak with ``one voice'' to set monetary policy with a ``truly
European outlook,'' the bank's chief said at a grand opening
ceremony Tuesday.
	   Wim Duisenberg told European leaders, including Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, that the bank
would keep inflation low and thereby win the confidence of
Europeans nervous about adopting a common currency.
	   Still, the difficulty of forging clarity and unanimity on key
issues was demonstrated just hours before the inaugural celebration
of the bank, which will set European monetary policy and oversee
the historic switch to the euro.
	   In an TV interview Tuesday, Duisenberg reiterated that no deal
had been made for his early departure from the top job, but hinted
that he would not serve his entire eight-year term.
	   Duisenberg's appointment in May followed a bitter squabble that
pitted his supporters, led by Germany, against France, which wanted
its own candidate to head the bank.
	   The row ended after French officials said they won a promise
from Duisenberg that he would quit in 2002 _ halfway through the
eight-year term _ to make way for the current Bank of France
governor, Jean-Claude Trichet.
	   Duisenberg again insisted that he was named central bank
president for an eight-year term. But told ZDF he would stay in the
job at least ``until the national currencies have totally
disappeared.''
	   That is supposed to happen in the 11 inaugural countries in
2002.
	   In his welcoming address, Duisenberg said monetary policy in the
``euro-zone'' must be ``one and indivisible'' and ``characterized
by a truly European outlook.
	   ``A precondition for adopting this outlook is that the ECB acts
as and is seen to act as a unit and speaks with `one voice,'
although sometimes in different languages,'' he said.
	   In addition to Kohl and Blair, Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and Austrian Chancellor
Viktor Klima were among the dignitaries expected.
	   The ECB governing council and executive board took up their work
at the beginning of June, but celebrated a grand opening on
Tuesday. The Maastricht Treaty called for the ECB's establishment
no later than July 1.
	   The ECB won't start setting monetary policy for the single
currency zone before Jan. 1, 1999. In the meantime, it will decide
on monetary instruments and strategies, and make other policy
decisions.

France renews support for U.N.-backed military intervention 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS background, byline
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Tuesday renewed his
country's support for U.N.-sanctioned NATO intervention to stop the
fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Hubert Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``It must happen with
a decision by the Security Council'' of the United Nations.
	   All options must be looked at, he said. as Serb troops in the
Yugoslav republic battled ethnic Albanian separatists. ``The
potential for destabilization of the situation in Kosovo could
become a powder keg for Europe.''
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday worried Kosovo could
become ``a second Bosnia.''
	   But the French position has contrasted with Washington's stand
that action may not need Security Council approval that requires
Russian backing. The Russians have opposed military action against
Serbian-led Yugoslavia, a historic ally.
	   Vedrine called for an autonomy that is ``the largest possible,
real and substantive for Kosovo.'' But he cautioned against
independence that ``could lead to a movement of destabilization in
this Balkan region that has already suffered very much.''
	   Independence would be ``a solution that would continue to
fragment the Balkan region into micro-states,'' the French foreign
minister said, referring to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia
into new states like Bosnia.
	   He also called for unity among the so-called Contact Group of
countries concerned with the former Yugoslavia, in which he said
``a few biased nuances were made in the last few days.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Vedrine's comments came as Serb forces maintained a blockade
around a Kosovo mining town in an effort to dislodge Albanian
separatists.
	   A day earlier, a three-pronged Serbian attack sent more than
8,000 people streaming away from their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.

Japanese exports falling due to weakness in Asia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's worldwide exports have fallen so far this
year as economic weakness in Asia more than offset gains in sales
elsewhere, a trade group said Tuesday.
	   Measured in dollars, Japanese exports fell 4.5 percent in the
first five months of 1998 to dlrs 161.6 billion, said the Japan
External Trade Organization, the trade promotion arm of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   By comparison, Japanese exports had grown by 2.5 percent for all
of 1997.
	   The Asian monetary crisis has severely curtailed demand for
Japanese goods in Asia, the report showed.
	   Exports from Japan to Asia's newly industrialized economies _
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan _ fell 17 percent
while exports to Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines fell
37.3 percent, the trade group said.
	   The figures show that the recent decline of the yen against the
dollar ``is not leading to expanded exports by Japanese
companies,'' the trade group said in a press release.
	   Many economists have predicted yen weakness would lead to an
increase in exports from Japan because a falling yen makes Japanese
goods cheaper in dollar terms.
	   But while Japanese exports to Asia shrank, demand for Japanese
goods elsewhere in the world remained strong, the report showed.
	   Exports to the United States rose 2.8 percent and exports to the
European Union jumped 11.8 percent. Exports to the Middle East were
up 15.4 percent.
	   Despite the decline in overall exports, Japan's trade surplus
has risen sharply so far this year, growing 66.6 percent in May.
The surplus is the difference between exports and imports, and
while exports have declined moderately, imports have fallen much
more rapidly.

China blames India again for South Asian nuclear arms race 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China renewed criticisms of India Tuesday,
calling Delhi the cause of South Asia's nuclear arms race and
urging it to ease regional tensions.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang defended a joint
statement on South Asia's nuclear tensions issued Saturday by U.S.
and Chinese leaders Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin following their
Beijing summit.
	   The two presidents urged India and Pakistan, acknowledged
nuclear powers after surprise tests in May, not to deploy nuclear
weapons and to sign ``immediately and unconditionally'' a global
treaty prohibiting nuclear testing.
	   ``The statement conforms to the common international aspiration
for non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,'' Tang said at a routine
media briefing. ``There's nothing reproachable.''
	   India had rejected the declaration's appeal not to test or
deploy nuclear weapons and said Delhi needed no outside help in
either negotiating with rival Pakistan or its ally, China.
	   Noting that Pakistan welcomed the Chinese-U.S. statement, Tang
said, ``I would like to point out that the current situation in
South Asia is of India's sole making.
	   ``We hope that the two sides would take measures to prevent a
nuclear arms race in South Asia and ease tensions there,'' he
added.
	   China has been suspected for years of helping Pakistan acquire
nuclear know-how and the missile capability to deliver nuclear
warheads, mainly to counter India's influence in the region.
	   But India's nuclear test explosions, closely followed by
Pakistan's, have raised the prospects of an expensive and
destabilizing arms race on China's southwestern frontier. Beijing
has moved to step up cooperation with the United States on nuclear
non-proliferation to prevent potential threats to its security.

Clinton banters with the Chinese on talk radio changes byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Beijing reaction to visit; RECASTS throughout,
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With callers lighting up the switchboard,
the American president fielded questions on a popular Chinese radio
talk show Tuesday, bantering about the Asian economy, World Cup
soccer and how he stays in shape.
	   The exchange was tame by the acerbic standards of U.S. talk
radio, which provides some of President Bill Clinton's harshest
criticism.
	   Clinton called the experience, his first talk show foray
overseas, a ``historic occasion'' and suggested he'll do more of
them to get a better idea of what ordinary citizens are thinking.
He also vowed to work for more Chinese-American educational and
cultural exchanges.
	   ``The more we do these things, the more we will be able to work
through our differences and build a common future,'' the president
said. ``And besides that, it will make life more interesting and
more fun.''
	   On Asia's financial turmoil, Clinton praised China for keeping
its currency stable, but added, ``We cannot see growth restored in
Asia unless it is restored in Japan.''
	   Clinton raised the concern about Japan, noting the upcoming
legislative election and government plans to announce steps for
financial reform.
	   ``If it is a good proposal and the confidence of investors ...
is raised, then I believe you will see the situation turn around''
in Asia, Clinton said. This, he said, would ease pressure on China
and also would be important for the United States.
	   With the rapid-fire questions relayed by simultaneous
translation, the toughest came from host Zuo Anlong, who suggested
Clinton could have difficulty dealing with opponents of the trip
back home. He asked if Clinton would have the courage to convince
critics it was right to go.
	   Clinton said his televised exchange on human rights with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing and the broadcast of the
president's remarks at Peking University should quiet his critics.
	   Even though Clinton still had three more days in China, Beijing
declared his visit a ``full success.''
	   It increased friendship, fostered mutual understanding and
brought progress towards a ``constructive strategic partnership,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
	   Clinton's talk radio appearance followed a 90-minute session
with Shanghai community leaders at the city's new,
Internet-connected library. They told him vast changes were
occurring across Chinese society, from the arts and media to
business and law to religious practices.
	   Clinton agreed, saying there is ``a new China emerging in the
world that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic.''
	   Responding to a question, Clinton carefully spelled out U.S.
policy toward Taiwan, a politically charged issue since China
regards Taiwan as a renegade province. The president adhered to
finely worded diplomatic language that broke no new administration
ground.
	   ``We don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or
one Taiwan, one China,'' he said. ``And we don't believe that
Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood
is a requirement.''
	   He said Taiwan and China should pursue a peaceful settlement
through dialogue.
	   Radio call-in shows are popular in Shanghai and, like many in
America, cover topics from people's financial troubles to their
love lives. But there was none of the abuse that Clinton endures at
home from his talk radio critics.
	   The ``Citizens and Society'' program featured Clinton along with
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi, who heads a city is a Western-style
economic engine dotted with skyscrapers and construction. The radio
program is heard by 10 million people each day, including two
million in Shanghai.
	   A query from a Mr. Hu about why Shanghai has so many cars gave
the president an opening to press for environmental protection in
China, the No. 2 emitter of greenhouse gases behind the United
States. ``This is a big problem everywhere in the world,'' he said.
	   A university student, Mr. Li, got a little more personal.
	   ``You seem to be very healthy and you seem to have a very nice
figure,'' he said, asking Clinton how he stays in shape.
	   The president, who hurt his knee last year, said he once was a
regular jogger but now uses a stair machine for exercise.
	   ``I like golf very much,'' he added. ``It's my favorite sport.
Even though it doesn't burn a lot of calories, it makes my mind
calm.''
	   Li also asked Clinton who he thought would win the World Cup.
	   ``I think the Brazilians are always hard to beat,'' Clinton
replied. He called international sporting events ``a great way of
bringing people together'' _ through matches such as the one
between the United States and Iran, a longtime adversary.
	   ``They beat us fair and square,'' Clinton said, referring to the
2-1 Iranian victory.
	   Talk show host Zuo noted that ``ping pong'' diplomacy in the
early 1970s helped break the diplomatic ice between the United
States and China and he asked if ``soccer diplomacy'' might work
with Iran.
	   ``I think it could be possible,'' Clinton said, noting the
president of Iran ``seems to be committed to not only lifting the
economic and social conditions of his people, but also having a
more regular relationship with the rest of the world.''

Iberia says baggage backlog in Madrid under control 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's biggest airline and the handler of
85 percent of the baggage passing through Madrid's Barajas airport,
said Tuesday that a week of suitcase chaos was under control.
	   More than 15,000 pieces of luggage piled up at the airport last
week.
	   Iberia Airlines said 800 pieces were still backlogged, but
emergency staffing measures were expected to clear the baggage
quickly.
	   Iberia handles 85 percent of the 70,000 pieces of baggage that
pass through the capital's airport daily.
	   The company blamed the piles of lost luggage on a new traffic
control system at Barajas that had caused delays and rushed
connections. The airport said Iberia was understaffed.
	   Most of the grounded suitcases belonged to passengers with
connecting flights. The baggage handlers just couldn't keep up,
Iberia spokeswoman Rosa Perez said.

Italian premier's visit expected to improve Iran-EU relations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Prodi expected to arrive Tuesday about 1530 GMT.
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians were hailing the expected visit of
the Italian prime minister on Tuesday as a first step to improving
relations with the European Union, which were severely strained
after a German court implicated the Tehran government in an
assassination.
	   The visit by Romano Prodi, the first by an EU head of government
since Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis in 1992, ``will
result in an immediate thaw in relations between Tehran and the
European Union,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Ahani told the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   For Italy's part, Prodi's trip shows that Rome is taking the
lead among EU governments in bolstering relations with Iran, which
has significant trade with several European countries.
	   The Italian minister of foreign trade is accompanying Prodi.
Iran's Ahani said his government hopes to do more business with
Italy, which is Tehran's fourth biggest trading partner. Trade
between them reached dlrs 2.3 billion last year, IRNA reported.
	   During his three-day visit, Prodi is expected to hold talks with
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and business leaders.
	   The 15-nation European Union broke off regular meetings with
Iranian officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after
a court in Germany accused Iranian leaders of ordering the 1992
assassination of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
	   The ambassadors returned late last year, and in March the EU
agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Relations have been strained by Iran's 1989 death sentence
against the British author Salman Rushdie for his book ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which many of Iran's clergy deem blasphemous.
	   Britain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the
EU, said recently it was encouraged by the political changes in
Iran since Khatami took office in August. But London said it still
had serious concerns about Iran's support for extremist groups and
its opposition to the current Middle East peace process.
	   Iran supports the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and the Hamas
militant group in the Palestinian territories.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West. He has promoted
cultural and sports exchanges with the United States and has eased
social restrictions imposed by the clergy after the 1979 Islamic
revolution.

Over consumption leads to blackout in capital 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A surge in demand for electricity on
Tuesday led to a short circuit in a main power substation and
blacked out many parts of the capital.
	   According to the Public Power Company, the short circuit left at
least 25 percent of the capital and its suburbs without
electricity. It also blacked out street lights, causing traffic
jams around this city of nearly five million.
	   Power requirements often spike in summer because of increased
use of such appliances as air conditioners. Temperatures in Athens
were expected to reach 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit).

President says Netanyahu is cut off from reality 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stepping up his attack on Benjamin Netanyahu
over stalled Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president said in
remarks published Tuesday that the prime minister is ``cut off from
reality.''
	   Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when he blamed
Netanyahu for the 15-month deadlock in the negotiations with the
Palestinians and said it was time to call early elections.
	   The president has no authority to determine the date of the next
elections. However, Weizman is Israel's most popular politician,
and with his stinging criticism of Netanyahu he lent greater
credibility to opposition claims that early elections are the only
way to rescue the peace process with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has rebuffed Weizman's calls, saying the vote would
take place, as scheduled, in 2000. Cabinet ministers and
legislators close to Netanyahu launched a counterattack, saying
Weizman overstepped his authority, but the prime minister himself
was careful not to criticize president.
	   Separate photographs of both leaders in combative stances with
their fists clenched were splashed across the front page of the
Yediot Ahronot daily. A poll of 507 Israelis in Yediot indicated
that 50 percent of Israelis favored early elections and 39 percent
did not. The margin of error was 4.5 percent.
	   In an interview with Yediot, Weizman questioned Netanyahu's
qualifications to be prime minister.
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality. The nation does not know where the prime minister is
leading them,'' Weizman said.
	   ``He rules by trial and error. If Netanyahu wants to know what
the nation thinks, he should go to polls,'' Weizman said.
	   Weizman will continue his campaign for new elections as long as
there is no breakthrough in the negotiations with the Palestinians
over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, Weizman's aides
told Israel radio.
	   Despite the uproar, there were no signs Tuesday that Weizman's
initiative brought Israel any closer to early elections. The
centrist Third Way Party said it had no immediate plans to quit the
coalition and was still hopeful agreement could be reached on a
troop pullback.
	   The United States is awaiting a long-overdue answer from Israel
on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.

<TEXT>
	   MALOLOS, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former B-movie
star loved by the masses, took his oath Tuesday as the Philippines'
13th president at the church where Asia's first republic was
inaugurated a century ago.
	   Estrada, the overwhelming winner in elections May 11, pledged to
devote his six-year term to narrowing the gap between the country's
rich and poor.
	   But his presidency, which he says will be his ``greatest
performance,'' was off to a rocky start. Many Filipinos reacted
angrily to his decision to permit the burial of former dictator
Ferdinand Marcos at a heroes' cemetery.
	   The bitter dispute forced Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, to
reverse his decision last week.
	   ``No previous president has assumed office with as much
dissonance in the air,'' said political scientist Alex Magno.
	   In a symbol of a remarkably smooth political transition,
however, Estrada rode together with outgoing President Fidel Ramos
in a horse-drawn carriage to historic Barasoain Church to take his
oath. Ramos could not run for re-election under the constitution,
but backed Estrada's main rival in the polls.
	   Throughout, Estrada's inauguration was designed to highlight
this year's centennial of the country's declaration of independence
from 333 years of Spanish colonial rule.
	   Hundreds of men and women in native costumes lined the road
leading to the church, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
Manila. Soldiers wearing revolutionary uniforms guarded the
majestic stone building.
	   The church, decorated with white orchids and chrysanthemums, was
where the first Philippine constitution was drafted a century ago
and where Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president, was proclaimed.
	   Estrada says he will continue most of Ramos' economic reform
policies but will focus on helping the poor and agriculture.
Police, however, prevented about 500 leftist demonstrators,
including workers, farmers and students, from approaching before
and after the oath-taking.
	   Estrada also pledged to crack down on official corruption and
solve the country's severe crime problem within six months.
	   ``I want to bring peace to our lives and harmony to our
society,'' he said in an inauguration speech delivered later
Tuesday at an outdoor grandstand in Manila.
	   ``I want to bring order to our streets and justice to our
institutions. I want to impart energy to our economy and more
equitableness in the distribution of its fruits,'' he said.
	   He also defended his decision to allow Marcos' burial at the
heroes' cemetery, saying he had been impatient to ``put yesterday
behind us so we can work for a brighter tomorrow.''
	   The new president, a college dropout with a swagger, mustache
and bouffant hairstyle, gained a devoted following among the
country's many poor during several decades as an actor in B movies,
playing tough guys who stood up against injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   He won the May 11 polls by one of the largest margins ever in a
free Philippine election. The polls were also among the
Philippines' most peaceful, although at least 45 people were
killed.
	   Many in the traditional Philippine elite have looked askance at
Estrada, considering him an undereducated buffoon with little
ability to lead the country's economy through the murky waters of
Asia's devastating currency crisis.
	   Estrada freely admits little proficiency in economics and says
he will depend on a stable of 30 economic advisers who range from
leftist academics to conservative bankers.
	   He also openly acknowledges a history of womanizing, heavy
drinking and gambling, but insists he now has given up all vices _
including cigarette smoking, which he quit several weeks ago.
	   His landslide victory prompted many to predict a long political
``honeymoon.'' But in addition to the dispute over Marcos' burial,
Estrada has taken on much of the Philippine Congress with a pledge
to eliminate ``pork barrel'' funds often misused by congressmen.
	   And Estrada faces a revolt from the popular head of the Subic
Bay special economic zone, who refuses to step down after being
fired by the new president over personal differences.

U.S. Treasury chief says Japan main risk for global crisis 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
stressed Tuesday that the risk of the Asian crisis turning into a
global depression remains low, but the most likely trigger would be
the perilous state of Japan's economy.
	   Rubin told reporters that a recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to
approve dlrs 18 billion for the International Monetary Fund sought
by the Clinton administration so it can quickly respond to new
outbreaks of economic upheaval.
	   Otherwise, a new phase of the crisis ``could result in a very
substantive impact on the American economy,'' until now largely
spared except for agricultural exports, Rubin said.
	   Rubin stopped in Thailand after China and Malaysia on a
pulse-taking trip a year after the crisis erupted July 2, 1997,
when Thailand allowed the baht to depreciate, touching off an
epidemic of currency turmoil. He left Tuesday afternoon for his
final stop, South Korea.
	   Rubin repeated his message that Japan's failure to reverse
economic stagnation since the bubble economy collapsed eight years
ago was delaying regional recovery and posed the chief threat of
the crisis spreading outside Asia.
	   ``I think the probability of global contagion is always low,''
Rubin said. ``What Japan does is very important. The immediate
focus on Japan is to develop effective responses in their banking
sector that win respect in international markets.''
	   Rubin said earlier in an address to business students at
Chulalongkorn University that Japan needed to create an economy
``led by domestic demand and a healthy currency.''
	   ``It is critical to the economic health of Thailand, the region
and the rest of the world,'' Rubin said.
	   The Japanese yen was recently propped up by U.S. intervention,
and Rubin did not rule out such action again if ``appropriate.'' It
was the first sale of dollars by Washington in financial markets
since 1992.
	   The United States has stressed that Japan needs to implement a
range of structural economic reforms and particularly deal with bad
loans troubling its banking sector.
	   Rubin met Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and said the United States stands ready to
back additional demands for credit by Thailand from the IMF, but
neither he nor Tarrin indicated that would be required.
	   The Thai government has shut down 56 finance companies and taken
over four small banks to sort out its financial sector. Rubin said
he had reviewed banking sector reforms with Thai officials but
refused to disclose details.
	   Rubin responded to a student's question about whether banks
should be nationalized by saying it was up to Thai authorities.
	   Rubin defended the IMF, which is leading bailouts totaling some
dlrs 120 billion for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, for
demanding tight monetary policies that critics say are making the
crisis worse by killing businesses.
	   Lowering interest rates would only divert attention from the
real reforms that need to be made and delay ``getting back to solid
growth and financial stability,'' Rubin said.
	   Asia's recovery will be rooted in values he said had created
growth in the first place: a strong work ethic, high savings rate
and focus on education. But he gave no time-frame for recovery.
	   Rubin said that financial speculators, blamed by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad for causing the crisis, were only minor
culprits.
	   The main causes were capital flight because of fear over poor
policies and corporations shielding against unstable domestic
currencies by buying dollars, Rubin said.

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon for second straight day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon for a second straight day
on Tuesday.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah guerrilla
group fired at the two Israeli jets but missed, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The planes fired four missiles at hideouts in the hills of Iqlim
al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the Israeli-occupied
southern tip of the country, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the sites of the attack, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately known if there were any casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said the pilots
attacked guerrilla bases and reported accurate hits.
	   On Monday, two Israeli jets fired missiles at guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon in apparent retaliation for a
roadside bomb that killed two Lebanese militiamen allied with
Israel.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters claimed responsibility for the
bombing. There were no casualties from Monday's air raid.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the
occupied zone.
	   Israel carved out the zone, which covers about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory, in 1985 in an attempt to protect northern
Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks.

Russian musicians win first prizes in Tchaikovsky competition

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian musicians bested an international field
and took top honors in the piano, violin and cello at the
prestigious Tchaikovsky music competition, officials said.
	   The judges gave Denis Matsuyev the prize for the piano, Nikolai
Sachenko was the top violinist, and Denis Shapovalov was selected
in the cello competition late Monday night.
	   ``It's not at all surprising that Russian participants won first
prizes in a competition which ... is based on the works of
Tchaikovsky,'' competition spokesman Andrei Ustinov said Tuesday.
	   Participants are not limited to Peter Tchaikovsky's works, but
each performer must include at least one piece of music by the
19th-century Russian composer for each of the competition's three
rounds.
	   Previous winners included musicians from around the world. One
of the most notable was a young American, Van Cliburn, who won the
piano prize in the first competition in 1958, and instantly became
one of the world's best know pianists.
	   But on the whole, Russian musicians seem to give ``more
authenticity'' to their performances of works by Russian composers,
Ustinov said.
	   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
1958. It has helped launch successful careers for many of the
winners.
	   The winners received dlrs 10,000, runners-up take home dlrs
8,000 and third-place finishers get dlrs 6,000.
	   The 11th Tchaikovsky competition ran for two weeks and the
international panel of juries included former Tchaikovsky winners.
Prizes in the three instrumental categories were announced late
Monday night. The winner in the vocals was to be chosen Tuesday.

Human rights group criticizes Germany for rejecting Kosovo refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The human rights group Amnesty
International criticized Germany on Tuesday for sending Kosovo
Albanian refugees back to Yugoslavia despite fighting in their home
province.
	   Wolfgang Grenz, the London-based group's refugee expert, called
the deportation of asylum seekers whose applications were rejected
``irresponsible'' at a time of unrest in the separatist region.
	   But one German official noted that deportations have been
effectively halted anyway by the European Union's decision in June
to deny landing rights to the Yugoslav airline in all 15 EU
nations.
	   Hartmut Wrocklage, interior minister in Hamburg, told German
radio that the German-Yugoslav agreement on deportations stipulates
that the Yugoslav airline JAT be used for sending refugees back.
	   German officials have defended their position in the past by
noting that the Kosovo Albanians were sent back to Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, and not directly to Kosovo.
	   About 140,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo are in Germany for
the often lengthy process of applying for asylum.

President says Netanyahu is cut off from reality 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stepping up his attack on Benjamin Netanyahu
over stalled Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president said in
remarks published Tuesday that the prime minister is ``cut off from
reality.''
	   Ezer Weizman caused political shockwaves Monday when he blamed
the prime minster for the 15-month deadlock in negotiations with
the Palestinians and said it was time to call early elections.
	   The president has no authority to determine the date of the next
elections. However, Weizman is Israel's most popular politician,
and with his stinging criticism of Netanyahu he lent greater
credibility to opposition claims that early elections are the only
way to rescue the peace process with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has rebuffed Weizman's calls, saying the vote would
take place, as scheduled, in 2000. Cabinet ministers and
legislators close to Netanyahu counterattacked, saying Weizman
overstepped his authority, but the prime minister himself was
careful not to criticize president.
	   Separate photographs of both leaders in combative stances with
their fists clenched were splashed across the front page of the
Yediot Ahronot daily. A poll of 507 Israelis in Yediot indicated
that 50 percent of Israelis favored early elections and 39 percent
did not. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.
	   In an interview with Yediot, Weizman questioned Netanyahu's
qualifications to be prime minister.
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality. The nation does not know where the prime minister is
leading them,'' Weizman said.
	   ``He rules by trial and error. If Netanyahu wants to know what
the nation thinks, he should go to polls,'' Weizman said.
	   Weizman will continue his campaign for new elections as long as
there is no breakthrough in the negotiations with the Palestinians
over the scope of a troop withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied West
Bank, Weizman's aides told Israel radio.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   Despite the uproar, there were no signs Tuesday that Weizman's
initiative brought Israel any closer to early elections. The
centrist Third Way Party said it had no immediate plans to quit the
coalition and was still hopeful that agreement could be reached on
a troop pullback.
	   The United States is awaiting a long-overdue answer from Israel
on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.

Ukrainian security service battles drug trafficking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The country's security service is combating
increased attempts by international drug traders to turn Ukraine
into a transit point for drugs headed to Western Europe, the
country's security chief said.
	   The Security Service has seized over 8.5 tons (9.4 short tons)
of drugs and arrested 140 drug dealers since the beginning of 1997,
the head of the service, Leonid Derkach, said in an interview
published by the daily Segodnya on Tuesday.
	   Derkach said the three most successful operations have yielded a
total of six tons (6.6 short tons) of hashish and 874 kilograms
(1,922 pounds) of cocaine.
	   He named drug traders from Columbia and Africa as being the most
active in transporting drugs through Ukraine to Western Europe.

Bicycle rickshaws back on Jakarta streets, thanks to economic crisis 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Once a fixture in Jakarta's maze of
neighborhood alleys, the bicycle rickshaw was banned a decade ago
as a traffic nuisance. Now, thanks to Indonesia's economic crisis,
it's making a comeback.
	   Anxious to lay on jobs in a city swamped with tens of thousands
of unemployed, the governor of the sprawling capital has
temporarily lifted the ban on the traditional mode of transport.
	   Now, on many street corners, drivers puffing on cigarettes
loiter by three-wheeled pedicabs with canopies, painted in bright
red, blue or yellow, often wit cough up clouds of
smog, was a quieter, less polluted spot.
	   Facing runaway inflation and unemployment that led to the
downfall in May of President Suharto, the government is casting
about for ways to help people make a living.
	   Pedicabs are common in India and parts of Southeast Asia, and
ply the streets of many Indonesian cities. But they were banned by
Jakarta councilors in the late 1980s as degrading to their drivers
and a hazard on already traffic-choked streets.
	   With the cyclist in back, passengers enjoy an unobstructed view.
To glide silently down a back lane is more relaxing, and cheaper,
than motorized alternatives.
	   ``This is better, because we can chat with the passengers,''
Rusamana, a 33-year-old driver, said Tuesday. He charges clients
about 1,000 rupiah (six U.S. cents) for every kilometer (0.6 miles)
and makes 10,000 rupiah (65 U.S. cents) a day.
	   The same ride on one of the thousands of orange, three-wheeled
motor scooters that belch and sputter around Jakarta is much
faster, but the cost is double.
	   Taxis fares are beyond the means of most, and it's getting
harder to catch a bus because of the economic turmoil. Many city
buses are not running because there's no money to buy spare parts.
	   Alarmed by reports that trucks are daily ferrying bicycle
rickshaws from outlying towns into Jakarta, some municipal
officials say Gov. Sutiyoso should stick to the ban on pedicabs.
	   ``A regulation is a regulation,'' said city councilor Afif
Hamka. ``We have to respect and abide by it,''
	   Pedicabs, or ``becaks'' (pronounced `BEH-chaks') in Indonesian,
are under strict orders to stay off main roads. Yet a few have
already been seen straying on to busy thoroughfares.
	   Years ago, authorities used to seize pedicabs from drivers who
broke traffic rules and hurl them into the Jakarta Bay, forming a
giant artificial reef.
	   Sutiyoso has pledged that once the economy recovers, the
pedicabs will be pulled off the streets. They could be around a
while, since any financial rebound is likely to take years.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A few steps from the walls of a towering,
15th-century mosque sits the potpourri of a modern Cairo bazaar:
papyrus, water pipes, scarabs and a clanging collection of brass
plates engraved with the bust of Nefertiti.
	   Scrawled awkwardly across the mosque's grimy portico is
``Mohammed the Rat,'' the irreverent nickname of a local vendor.
	   The makeshift shop _ its graffiti and all _ will soon be shut
down, one of hundreds of encroaching stands, kiosks, stores and
even homes to be demolished in the very heart of the city as part
of a plan to restore the tarnished glory of medieval Cairo.
	   The benefits are apparent: saving the world's greatest
collection of mosques and minarets and creating yet another draw
for tourists and, more importantly, the money they bring.
	   But the drawback _ choosing monuments over the masses _ leaves
some questioning the government's priorities. Increasingly across
Egypt, a country that some would say simply has too many monuments
and too many people, it is the people that have come out on the
losing end _ tens of thousands if the government gets its way.
	   ``Are you saving the neighborhood or are you saving the
monuments?'' asked William Lyster, an expert in Cairo on Islamic
architecture and art. ``It's kind of heretical but realistic to
say: I'm not sure that you can do both together.''
	   Already, the conflict has turned bloody.
	   In Qurna, a village near the Valley of the Kings and its
pharaonic tombs, police killed four people and wounded nine others
who were protesting the demolition of their homes in January.
	   The government had long sought to move them to houses built two
miles (three kilometers) away. But they said the settlement was too
far from the antiquities to make money from tourists.
	   They will likely lose in the end: Already 350 homes have been
destroyed, and 1,585 more are slated to be torn down over the next
three years, said Mohammed al-Saghir, head of pharaonic sites at
the government's Supreme Council of Antiquities.
	   At one site in Alexandria, Egypt's second-biggest city, the
Supreme Council wants to move at least 15,000 people, perhaps even
20,000, from an archaeological site uncovered during the building
of a bridge, said Gaballah Ali Gaballah, the council's chairman.
	   And across the country, in cities like Esna, Edfu and Cairo,
20,000 homes need to be demolished to protect monuments _ from
pharaonic tombs to Christian churches to Islamic mausoleums, said
Abdel-Halim Nur el-Din, a former chairman of the council.
	   With more than five people in the average Egyptian family, that
means 100,000 people might be moved.
	   ``I'm quite sure we'll have to sacrifice some people, but we can
compensate them, with money or something,'' Nur el-Din said. Like
others, though, he admits that money is frustratingly short.
	   In the past, planners that have remade cities _ Baron Haussmann
in 19th-century Paris, for instance, or Robert Moses in New York _
have destroyed parts of the city for the sake of the city itself.
In the end, it was the city's inhabitants who were served.
	   Not so in Egypt.
	   Planners openly acknowledge that tourism is a main priority,
particularly in their plan for medieval Cairo, a neighborhood with
more than 300 monuments, 300,000 people and 30,000 squatters.
	   The plan, to be completed over three years, entails rerouting
traffic through a tunnel to create a vast pedestrian area around
Al-Azhar, home to one of Islam's greatest institutions of religious
scholarship and site of the world's first university.
	   Eighty monuments will be restored, traffic will be barred from
many streets and houses and shops will be demolished, either to
safeguard the monuments or as part of the neighborhood's face-lift.
	   Gaballah, the antiquities director, says thousands of people
will be moved _ either voluntarily or through eviction orders.
	   Of 630 shops there, from aluminum welding and copper smelting to
vegetable pickling, about 280 will be torn down, their owners
provided an alternative on Cairo's outskirts.
	   Understandably, not all are overjoyed at the prospect.
	   ``If they tell me to go, I won't go,'' said Ali Omran, whose
perfume stall bursts with jars colored green, purple and blue.
	   Tarek al-Halwani, a merchant selling peasant gowns and amulets
to ward off evil, said there's no reason to leave.
	   The stores, the people and the very fabric of the community are
``part of the antiquities,'' he said. Removing them would destroy a
neighborhood at the hub of Cairo's commercial life for centuries.
	   ``The people don't have another place or another income,''
al-Halwani said over the din of honking horns, rambling donkey
carts and bakers hawking their sweets. ``What will they do?''
	   Gaballah said that anyone moved should be compensated in some
way, and he believes the government will provide promised support.
	   ``What matters to me are the people, and everything should be
for their sake, even without them knowing it,'' he said.
	   But, he added, ``They may hate you for it.''

Asian stock markets close generally higher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Tuesday, with the key index in Tokyo surging 3.02 percent on the
back of a stronger Japanese yen.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 464.54 points,
closing at 15,830.27. On Monday, the Nikkei had gained 155.69
points, or 1.02 percent.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 139.95 yen in
late afternoon, down 2.17 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below
its late New York level of 141.69 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's slip Tuesday below 140 yen was the first since June
24, a week after the U.S.-Japan joint intervention.
	   Traders said Tokyo stocks also rose because investors were
hopeful that that the government will take steps to boost Japan's
economy.
	   The Japanese economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported Tuesday
that Taku Yamasaki, a senior official in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, said the party will study the possibility of
permanent tax cuts after elections for Parliament's upper house on
July 12.
	   Stronger regional currencies also sent share prices surging in
Indonesia, where the Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose
14.689 points to 445.920.
	   Meanwhile, the Indonesia currency was trading at 14,737 rupiah
to the dollar, up from 15,050 late Monday.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher, boosted by a firmer
Japanese currency and an overnight rally on Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 82.39 points, or 1.0 percent, closing at 8,543.10.
On Monday, the index had fallen 147.15 points.
	   Singapore shares closed mostly lower because of disappointment
over the government's multibillion-dollar package to stimulate the
island's economy.
	   Dealers said that although the package, announced Monday,
provided measures to reduce corporate costs and control supply in
the glutted property market, it failed to offer much to spur
demand.
	   The Singapore Stock Exchange's benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index fell 18.49 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,066.66.
	   The market was closed in the Philippines because of the
inauguration of President Joseph Estrada.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on bargain-hunting. The
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 13.08 points, or 0.1
percent, to 7,548.81.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by
gains in the afternoon session on the back of a fall in short-term
interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 7.75 points, or 0.3
percent, to 1,964.59.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, giving the stock
market a lift on the last day of the financial year. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 47.3 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,668.4.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly lower on worries over the
effects of Monday's closure of five financially weak banks. The
Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 0.72 point to 297.88.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed. The benchmark
Composite Index rose 4.87 points, or 1.0 percent, to 455.64.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower in thin trading. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 3.87 points, or 1.4 percent,
to 267.33.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With callers lighting up the switchboard,
the American president fielded questions on a popular Chinese radio
talk show Tuesday, bantering about the Asian economy, World Cup
soccer and how he stays in shape. The exchange was tame by the
acerbic standards of U.S. talk radio, which provides some of
President Bill Clinton's harshest criticism. Clinton called the
experience, his first talk show foray overseas, a ``historic
occasion'' and suggested he'll do more of them to get a better idea
of what ordinary citizens are thinking. Back home, the other woman
on the Monica Lewinsky tapes finally gets her chance to tell a
grand jury what she knows about an alleged presidential affair and
cover-up. Linda Tripp's testimony Tuesday is likely to give
critical information to prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who is trying to
press beyond proving a sexual relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky when she was a White House volunteer, to possible
obstruction of justice and witness tampering. (CHINA-CLINTON,
US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)
	   MALOLOS, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former B-movie
star loved by the masses, took his oath Tuesday as the Philippines'
13th president at the church where Asia's first republic was
inaugurated a century ago. Estrada, the overwhelming winner in
elections May 11, pledged to devote his six-year term to narrowing
the gap between the rich and poor. But his presidency, which he
says will be his ``greatest performance,'' was off to a rocky
start. Many Filipinos reacted angrily to his decision to permit the
burial of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery.
In a symbol of a remarkably smooth political transition, however,
Estrada rode together with outgoing President Fidel Ramos in a
horse-drawn carriage to historic Barasoain Church to take his oath.
Ramos could not run for re-election under the constitution, but
backed Estrada's main rival in the polls. (PHILIPPINES-ESTRADA)
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces maintained a blockade
around a Kosovo mining village on Tuesday as they tried to dislodge
ethnic Albanian separatists. Amid the fighting, a human rights
group accused the Serbs of rape and other war crimes. Serb police
blocked access to the besieged area around Belacevac, 10 kilometers
(six miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, an indication that
their assault was continuing. The Serbs were trying to retake the
Belacevac open-pit mine, which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army last week. The mine is strategically important
because it supplies coal to the nearby Obilic power plant, which
provides electricity for most of Kosovo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stepping up his attack on Benjamin Netanyahu
over stalled Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president said in
remarks published Tuesday that the prime minister is ``cut off from
reality.'' Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when he
blamed Netanyahu for the 15-month deadlock in negotiations with the
Palestinians and said it was time to call early elections. The
president has no authority to determine the date of elections. But
Weizman is Israel's most popular politician, and with his stinging
criticism of Netanyahu he lent greater credibility to opposition
claims that early elections are the only way to rescue the peace
process. Netanyahu rebuffed Weizman's calls, saying the vote would
take place, as scheduled, in 2000. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ A three-member European Union diplomatic
team left troubled East Timor earlier than scheduled Tuesday, a day
after security personnel shot one pro-independence protester to
death and wounded four others. The shootings, outside a Roman
Catholic cathedral in the town of Baucau, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of Dili, took place as the team talked with the local bishop.
Clashes between rival groups of East Timorese, for and against
Indonesia rule, also marred their three-day fact-finding tour of
the former Portuguese colony. Demonstrations were held by both
sides to impress the Jakarta-based ambassadors of Britain, the
Netherlands and Austria, who arrived Saturday. Dili was calm
Tuesday, but police erected barbed wire barricades around the
territory's main government office, which was attacked by
stone-throwing mobs on the weekend. (INDONESIA-EAST TIMOR)

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
took her campaign to educate girls to Shanghai's only all-female
high school Tuesday, telling students one of them could some day
become president of China.
	   ``A girl's education is one of the best investments any family
or country can make. I'm delighted to see you have made this good
investment,'' Mrs. Clinton told students at the Shanghai No. 3
Girls High School.
	   The elite school, founded by missionaries in 1890 and now run by
the city, has 2,000 students admitted through competitive tests.
Graduates include the Soong sisters, two of whom became first
ladies of China as the wives of President Sun Yat-sen and
Nationalist leader Gen. Chiang Kai-shek.
	   ``I hope some time in the next century, there will be a meeting
between a woman president of the United States and a woman
president of China,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Perhaps one of you will
be in that position. I will be happy to see that.''
	   In a display of linguistic skill, students asked questions in
English and laughed in the right places during Mrs. Clinton's
comments, which weren't translated into Chinese. She got big laughs
when she noted, ``I'm not an expert with chopsticks, but I can get
most of the food into my mouth.''
	   Students asked about Mrs. Clinton's views on educating children,
whether she planned to run for president _ she said she didn't _
and about violence in U.S. schools.
	   Mrs. Clinton also visited classrooms where girls were studying
English and practicing traditional Chinese arts of calligraphy,
porcelain painting and engraving.
	   Yang Tianwei, 16, showed her a plate painted with a picture of
Mu Guiying, a Chinese woman who commanded an army during the
8th-century Song dynasty, and explained Mu's role in history in
clear, confident English.
	   ``I hope her visit will promote feelings between our two
countries,'' Ms. Yang said later. ``Letting Mrs. Clinton see the
extracurricular activities and classes of young Chinese is very
good, because it will help the U.S. first lady understand China
better.''
	   Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton joined the deputy mayor of
Shanghai and the Big Bird character from the Chinese-language
version of ``Sesame Street'' to celebrate the opening of China's
most advanced children's hospital.
	   The Shanghai Children's Medical Center, a joint effort by the
Shanghai city government and the U.S. charity Project Hope, is
equipped with the latest medical equipment, most of it donated by
U.S. manufacturers. The hospital is intended to treat children from
throughout China and teach doctors new techniques.
	   ``Certainly, the relationship between our two peoples has no
greater objective than improving conditions for the children of
both countries,'' Mrs. Clinton said before joining Deputy Mayor Zuo
Huanchen and two Shanghai schoolchildren in a ribbon-cutting
ceremony.
	   Mrs. Clinton later visited the Shanghai Women's Education and
Training Center, where women laid off in the overhaul of
money-losing Chinese state companies were learning to sew dresses
and dolls.

Thailand may relax ban on illegal foreign workers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will reconsider a plan to
expel illegal foreign workers since some industries are unable to
recruit Thais to replace them, a Labor Ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Labor Minister Trairong Suwankhiri will meet business leaders July
15 to reconsider a policy to deport hundreds of thousands of
illegal workers.
	   The plan, initiated in January, was aimed at creating jobs for
Thais forced into unemployment by the economic crisis. Since last
year, the jobless rate has doubled to 2 million, about 6 percent of
the work force.
	   Last week, Thai rice millers threatened to shut down their
industry to protest against the policy. Millers face a shortage of
20,000 workers _ whose job amounts to carrying 100-kilogram
(220-pound) sacks of rice all day.
	   Only 30 Thais signed up at a recent job fair to replace foreign
workers, and 20 have quit, Bumrung Kritchpakorn, honorary president
of the Thai Rice Mills Association, said last week.
	   An exception to the crackdown has already been made for the
fisheries sector, where there is an extreme shortage of willing and
able Thais to work on fishing boats.
	   Rice and fish are major Thai exports.
	   Thailand has about 1 million illegal immigrant workers, about 90
percent of them from neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma. Some
200,000 have temporary legal status after registering with the
government last year, but Trairong has said he will not renew their
legal status.
	   Thai governments had long turned a blind eye to illegal workers.
Some employers favor them because they are willing to work for low
wages and are less likely to complain about abuses.

Serbs battle to retake coal mine held by Kosovo rebels comments from U.N. refugee organization; trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts ld and throughout to UPDATE with details of fighting,
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces blasted ethnic Albanian
separatists with mortar fire Tuesday as they tried to dislodge them
from a strategic Kosovo mining village. Amid the fighting, a human
rights group accused the Serbs of rape and other war crimes.
	   Serb police kept access blocked to the besieged area around
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina Tuesday, the second day of the assault. The sound of heavy
mortars and other artillery was heard, and heavy clouds of black
smoke billowed from two locations near the village.
	   Dozens of people, including women and children, fled the
besieged area. The shooting calmed down by noon, with only
occasional gunfire being heard.
	   On Monday, a three-pronged Serbian attack sent more than 8,000
people streaming away from their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade. By evening police and other
paramilitary Serb forces had advanced within 200 meters (yards) of
Belacevac.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   Another group of refugees _ Kosovo Albanians on the run for
weeks _ raised the concerns of the main U.N. refugee agency in
Geneva.
	   The agency was in touch both with Serbian authorities and
Albanians in control of the area between Junik and the Albanian
border to try and arrange a relief convoy for several hundred
refugees in the region's highlands, said spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   ``The people have basically been roughing it for weeks,'' said
Janowski. ``They live in very provisional shelters made of
branches, cardboard and plastic.''
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to AP offices in the Balkans, the respected
private watchdog group said it had ``powerful evidence'' that Serb
police ``summarily executed an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said the
KLA siege of Kijevo town ``affects civilians and other
non-combatants in the town.''
	   Suspicions of war crimes and less grave rights violations have
led to demands from foreign capitals that international observers
be allowed into Kosovo _ something that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic recently agreed to.
	   In Pristina, western diplomats said observers had begun
trickling into the Serbian province and were looking for
accommodations in and around the provincial capital.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded the withdrawal of Serb
special forces and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday on the Shanghai stop of President Bill
Clinton's China visit.
	   The fighting came as international envoys urged the two sides to
seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic and
moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders to try to find a solution to the
conflict, while another U.S. diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in negotiations for peace in the region.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It increasingly is
supported by the ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Monday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the U.N.
Security Council must approve any military action.
	   The United States says the Security Council's blessing is not
needed for NATO intervention, but Russia disagrees.
	   In Paris Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine renewed
his country's support for U.N.-sanctioned NATO intervention to stop
the fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for
Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``It must happen with a
decision by the Security Council.''

Saudis rehire German coach to lead soccer squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Saudis have reverted to one of their
former coaches for the national football team: Otto Pfister of
Germany.
	   An official of Saudi Football Federation said Tuesday that
Pfister had been appointed to replace Carlos Alberto Parriera of
Brazil, who was sacked after the Saudis' poor performance in the
World Cup. The team was eliminated after Denmark beat it 1-0 and
France 4-0 in the first round.
	   Pfister, 51, who took Saudi Arabia through to the second round
in the 1994 World Cup, is currently training the Saudi under-16
team in Slovakia for next week's World Youth Games in Moscow, the
Saudi official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Starting mid-August, Pfister will train the Saudi national squad
for the Arab Cup in September in Doha, Qatar, the official said. He
will continue to serve as coach for the under-16 team.
	   The official declined to say how much Pfister will be paid.
	   Coaching the Saudi national squad is a precarious business. The
Saudis have gone through eight coaches in three years.

World Cup: Yugoslavia stumbles, yet again 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A mixture of bad luck, inconsistent
play, and political turmoil back home have combined to help
eliminate Yugoslavia, a dark-horse favorite, from the World Cup.
	   But Yugoslav teams, branded ``European Brazilians'' for their
technical skills, have a long history of such stumbles on big
occasions. Out of the 9 World Cups in which it participated,
Yugoslavia only managed two semifinals: 1930 in Uruguay and in 1962
in Chile.
	   The others were a string of disappointments for the Yugoslavs,
considered one of the top European soccer nations. And history
repeated itself in France.
	   On Monday, the star-studded Yugoslav team lost 2-1 against the
Netherlands in the first round of the knockout phase, on a goal by
Edgar Davids in the second minute of injury time.
	   But with a bit of luck, the result could have been in
Yugoslavia's favor since its star striker Predrag Mijatovic missed
a penalty in the 51st minute when the result was tied 1-1.
	   ``We go back home with our heads held up high. We lost against
probably the best team in the world,'' declared Yugoslav defender
Zeljko Petrovic.
	   Other players were not so proud of their performance Monday,
indirectly blaming coach Slobodan Santrac of ``cowardly'' tactics
against the Dutch.
	   The Yugoslavs, known for their offensive play, closed down
completely in the first half allowing the Dutch several attacks and
goal chances. The team opened up only at the start of the second
half, quickly tying the score and getting the penalty.
	   Then it was back to the defensive strategy, something the
Yugoslavs are not known particularly noted for.
	   ``I don't know why we played so fearfully,'' said captain Dragan
Stojkovic. ``A lot of things have to be analyzed after we cool our
heads.''
	   During the group stage, Yugoslavia edged 1-0 both Iran and the
United States, considered outsiders, in two lackluster
performances. It tied favored Germany 2-2 after leading 2-0 late in
the second period in its best match of the tournament.
	   ``Our play was up and down throughout the World Cup,'' said
Santrac, who is rumored to be on his way out because of the
disappointing result. ``We had a lot of injury problems as well.''
	   Star midfielder Dejan Savicevic only entered the U.S. and the
Netherlands games late in the second halves, but obviously fearing
further knee ligament injuries he avoided all duels. His entry
against the Dutch in the second half also contributed to the
Yugoslav defeat.
	   The Yugoslavs had severe problems off the pitch, as their
shrunken country is embroiled in another ethnic strife. More than
300 people have died since March in the troubled province of
Kosovo, and NATO is threatening air strikes against Serbian forces
unless they end their crackdown against ethnic Albanians there.
	   ``Of course we were distressed by the troubles back home,'' said
midfielder Vladimir Jugovic. ``Reporters were asking all those
political questions, and we were here only to play soccer and not
deal with politics.''
	   In another illustration of their political troubles, the
Yugoslavs pointedly avoided singing their national anthem before
each game. Their fans regularly boo the tune, a holdover from the
communist federation that collapsed in 1991.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Tuesday, with the key index in Tokyo surging 3.02 percent on the
back of a stronger Japanese yen. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average rose 464.54 points, closing at 15,830.27. On Monday, the
Nikkei gained 155.69 points, or 1.02 percent. In currency trading,
the U.S. dollar was quoted at 139.95 yen in late afternoon, down
2.17 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York
level of 141.69 yen overnight. Stronger regional currencies also
sent share prices surging in Indonesia, where the Jakarta Stock
Exchange's Composite Index rose 14.689 points to 445.920. The Hang
Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 82.39 points, or 1.0 percent, closing at 8,543.10. The
Singapore Stock Exchange's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
fell 18.49 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,066.66. The market was
closed in the Philippines because of the inauguration of President
Joseph Estrada. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
stressed Tuesday that the risk of the Asian crisis turning into a
global depression remains low, but the most likely trigger would be
the perilous state of Japan's economy. Rubin told reporters that a
recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to approve dlrs 18 billion for the
International Monetary Fund sought by the Clinton administration so
it can quickly respond to new outbreaks of economic upheaval.
Otherwise, a new phase of the crisis ``could result in a very
substantive impact on the American economy,'' until now largely
spared except for agricultural exports, Rubin said. He stopped in
Thailand after China and Malaysia on a pulse-taking trip a year
after the crisis erupted July 2, 1997, when Thailand allowed the
baht to depreciate, touching off an epidemic of currency turmoil.
He left later Tuesday for his final stop, South Korea.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-strapped government has finally
received dlrs 670 million as part of an International Monetary Fund
loan, according to a report Tuesday. The IMF decided Thursday to
release the money after delaying it for months, pressing the
Russian government to do more to balance its budget. The funds
arrived Tuesday in the Russian Finance Ministry's account, the
Interfax news agency reported, citing a ministry official. The
money is part of a dlrs 9 billion IMF loan spread over three years.
The IMF has on several occasions delayed payment because it was not
satisfied with the government's financial performance. The money
will not pull Russia out of its current financial tailspin, but it
should give President Boris Yeltsin's government a bit more
breathing space. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Restaurant workers at Disneyland
Paris on Tuesday joined technicians and parade performers in a
strike by a union demanding pay raises, a union spokesman said.
Dozens of strikers with signs and banners gathered at the entrance
to Europe's Magic Kingdom 30 kms (18 miles) east of the capital, on
the sixth day of a walkout that began with most parade performers.
Sound and light technicians joined the walkout Monday, and
restaurant workers began walking out Tuesday, but it was not clear
what percentage of the work force was affected. The park said the
daily parade continued as scheduled. ``We have miserable
salaries,'' said Michel Balliwech, a local organizer for the
Communist-led General Labor Confederation. (FRANCE-EURO
DISNEY-STRIKE)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The new European Central Bank must
speak with ``one voice'' to set monetary policy with a ``truly
European outlook,'' the bank's chief said at a grand opening
ceremony Tuesday. Wim Duisenberg told European leaders, including
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, that
the bank would keep inflation low and thereby win the confidence of
Europeans nervous about adopting a common currency. In addition to
Kohl and Blair, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern and Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima were
among the dignitaries expected. The ECB won't start setting
monetary policy for the single currency zone before Jan. 1, 1999.
In the meantime, it will decide on monetary instruments and
strategies, and make other policy decisions. (GERMANY-EUROPEAN

Statistics with a bite: dogs chomp men, cats go for women 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Dogs seem to prefer men, cats have a taste
for older women, and horses usually go for girls when it comes to
whom they choose to bite.
	   A two-year study of animal bites published Tuesday said 60
percent of dog bite victims registered in Oslo were men, 70 percent
of cat bite victims were women and 68 percent of horse bite victims
were girls.
	   Eilif Dahl, a Norwegian doctor, studied 1,051 bite cases at
Oslo's main public clinic between 1993 and 1995. His results were
published by the Norwegian Physicians Association.
	   Dahl doubted that dogs, cats or horses actually prefer biting
one sex over the other.
	   ``It probably says something about who has the most contact with
the various species. Young girls take care of horses, many older
women have cats and men may more often provoke dogs. Men have a
tendency to play rougher, approach strange dogs or try to break up
dog fights,'' he said.
	   According to Dahl, man's best friend, the canine, accounted for
the vast majority of bite wounds, 76 percent. German Shepherds,
Rottweillers and Dobermans were at the top of the list.
	   Cats accounted for 17 percent of the bites, horses in two
percent, and snakes, rodents and birds were blamed for the rest.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action suit 4-6. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INSERTS names of plaintiffs, more details from suit in grafs
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
suit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action suit, representing five victims of the
Holocaust, asks U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to award
compensatory and punitive damages from the Swiss National Bank, the
country's central bank.
	   The bank has said any obligations arising from World War II
dealings have been settled in a 1946 treaty and it rejects the
jurisdiction of any U.S. court to handle such a case against a
sovereign country.
	   The plaintiffs and current hometowns include Freda Rosenberg of
Borough Park, N.Y.; Gertrude Jorisch of New York; Andor Mittelman
of Louisville, Kentucky; Eva Garai of Winnipeg, Manitoba; and
Ernest Knopfler, whose address was given only as New York State.
	   The suit described how the Nazis sent them or their families to
concentration camps and stole their possessions.
	   It said the Swiss National Bank's ``gold reserves may include
assets looted'' from them or from thousands more people who could
be added to the plaintifs.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate,
multibillion suit in New York against Swiss commercial banks.
	   An independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The suit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the suit
said.
	   Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said that the bank
has not yet officially been informed of the suit.
	   He restated the bank's position that it does not consider a U.S.
court has jurisdiction in such cases and that it will fight any
suits against it vigorously.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private
and government assets during the war.
	   An earlier U.S. report said Swiss banks handled dlrs 400 million
of Nazi gold, some dlrs 300 million of it looted from European
banks.

Rebels demand withdrawal of Senegalese troops 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebellious military
leaders have demanded that Senegal and Republic of Guinea, fighting
in support of President Joao Bernardo Vieira, withdraw all troops
as a pretext to further peace negotiations.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a ceasefire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers, rebel officials said.
	   A government delegation was scheduled Tuesday to meet with rebel
leaders to search for a solution to their three-week conflict in
this small former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip.
	   But the talks were jeopardized by heavy artillery fire in the
capital late Monday afternoon.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes, the military junta's spokesman, asked
Portuguese ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva to press the
government to stop the attacks.
	   ``If one of ours dies, you can be sure we'll retaliate,''
Fernandes told da Silva in a phone call cited by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane staged a coup
attempt against Vieira earlier this month, which has degenerated
into near civil war in around the capital and some nearby towns.
	   Rebel-controlled Radio Bombolon on Tuesday said Mane's military
junta would only consider a cease-fire when Senegal's more than
1,500 troops withdraw from Guinea-Bissau.
	   Over the weekend, Senegal sent additional troops to Bissau, the
capital, to counter growing support for the rebel movement.
	   Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira
and Mane.
	   In the countryside, more and more former guerrilla rebels from
Guinea-Bissau's 1960s and '70s independence war against Portugal
have been rearming and coming out in favor of Mane's uprising.
	   Fighting, meanwhile, continued with an early morning volley of
artillery fire Tuesday near Bissau, where the vast majority of the
city's 300,000 people have fled.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's internally displaced population
_ many of whom have moved to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata
and Canchungo _ are putting enormous pressure on food reserves.
	   The World Food Program on Monday said Bafata's population of
160,000 people has doubled, while rice stocks have dwindled with
only a few days remaining.

Bomb damages government offices, injures two police officers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A bomb on Tuesday slightly injured two
police officers and damaged the offices of a government agency
responsible for hiring civil servants.
	   The time bomb exploded at 1:10 p.m. (1010 GMT) outside the
offices of the Higher Council for the Evaluation of Civil Servants,
or ASEP, located in central Athens. It was planted inside the ASEP
offices.
	   A small and little known terrorist group calling itself the
Revolutionary Cells took responsibility for the attack in a call to
a local radio station. They called in a warning to police shortly
before the blast.
	   Two police officers cordoning off the streets around the
building were slightly injured, apparently by flying glass.
	   The group has in recent months taken responsibility for a number
of bomb and arson attacks.
	   It is one of a number of small but prolific terrorist groups
that have this year carried out more than 150 firebomb attacks,
mostly against cars belonging to government officials, diplomats,
journalists and foreign companies. The attacks resulted in only one
injury.
	   Officials have been unable to stop the attacks, which have
increased fears of harm to Greece's vital tourism industry.
	   Revolutionary Cells did not say why they carried out the attack,
but ASEP has in recent days been reviewing exams for qualified
teachers wishing to be appointed to state-run schools.
	   Hundreds of teachers have opposed the exams, imposed by a new
education reform law. Riot police on June 12 clashed with teachers
trying to prevent the exams from taking place.

	   RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) _ Judges, lawyers and defendants toured
the scene of the fatal Maccabiah Games bridge collapse Tuesday and
found garbage, graffiti and memorial candles where the rickety
structure had crumbled last year.
	   The footbridge, which spanned the polluted Yarkon River, had
been built especially for the Maccabiah's opening ceremony, held
last July 14. About 100 Australian athletes crossed on their way to
the ceremony when the structure buckled, plunging the competitors
into the Yarkon. Four athletes were killed and dozens injured.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   During Tuesday's tour, the court found a sign near the steep
banks of the Yarkon, warning: ``Polluted water. It is prohibited to
enter the water or fish.'' A shopping cart jutted out of the water.
The high pollution level of the river had aggravated the injuries.
	   Attached to the warning sign was a sarcastic sticker reading:
``We apologize that we fell from the bridge. Australian and world
Jewry.''
	   Builder Yehoshua Ben Ezra, who is one of the defendants, showed
the court the exact location of the base of bridge that was
dismantled after the collapse.
	   The footbridge led into the Ramat Gan sports stadium, and the
outer wall of the stadium was covered with graffiti, including the
names of the four athletes killed in the collapse. Memorial candles
were spread along the top of the wall.
	   ``It is important to see the place in order to know what we are
talking about in court. Many subjects dealt with in the court room
have now become clear,'' said defense lawyer Abraham Landstein.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces blockaded a mining
village in Kosovo again Tuesday, trying to dislodge ethnic Albanian
separatists. Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the
Serbs of rape and other war crimes.
	   Serb police blocked access to the besieged area around
Belacevac, 6 miles (10 kilometers) west of the Kosovo capital of
Pristina, an indication that their assault was continuing.
	   On Monday, a three-pronged Serb attack sent more than 8,000
people fleeing their homes in Belacevac and the neighboring village
of Hade. By evening, police and paramilitary Serb forces had
advanced to within 200 yards (185 meters) of Belacevac.
	   The Serbs are trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell last week to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation
Army. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ although it
primarily targeted the Serbs _ of violating human rights in the
area.
	   In a statement, the private watchdog group said it had
``powerful evidence'' that Serb police ``summarily executed an
unspecified number of ethnic Albanians between February and May.''
	   It also said eyewitnesses reported the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June. The report did not explain why the helicopters had Red
Cross markings.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks'' on Serb civilians. Human Rights Watch also said the KLA
siege of the town of Kijevo ``affects civilians and other
noncombatants'' there.
	   Since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try
to halt an independence movement, more than 300 people _ mostly
ethnic Albanians _ have died in Kosovo, which is part of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's larger republic.
	   KLA rebels claim to control up to 40 percent of Kosovo. They
increasingly are supported by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday in Shanghai during U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to China.
	   The fighting came as international envoys urged the two sides to
seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic and
moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders to try to find a solution to the
conflict, while another U.S. diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in any peace negotiations.
	   Rebels were bracing for a new attack after Yugoslav helicopters
strafed them over the weekend at Kijevo, Kosovo's other main hot
spot.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen were estimated to be
in the village, cut off from supplies and other support by a ring
of Albanian fighters. The KLA holds large areas north and south of
the road that passes through Kijevo and connects Pristina and the
city of Pec.
	   Speaking in Vienna on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
urged swift international steps to prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in
Kosovo, but he reiterated that the U.N. Security Council must
approve any military action.
	   The United States disagrees with that position, saying the
Security Council's blessing is not needed for NATO intervention.
	   In Paris Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
reiterated French support for NATO intervention to stop the
fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``(But) it must happen with a
decision by the Security Council.''

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
suit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action suit, representing five victims of the
Holocaust, asks U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to award
compensatory and punitive damages from the Swiss National Bank, the
country's central bank.
	   The bank has said any obligations arising from World War II
dealings have been settled in a 1946 treaty and it rejects the
jurisdiction of any U.S. court to handle such a case against a
sovereign country.
	   The plaintiffs and current hometowns include Freda Rosenberg of
Borough Park, N.Y.; Gertrude Jorisch of Westberry, N.Y.; Andor
Mittelman of Louisville, Kentucky; Eva Garai of Winnipeg, Manitoba;
and Ernest Knopfler, of Brooklyn, N.Y.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ As their team bowed out of soccer's World
Cup, Mexicans watched with pride _ and disturbances that left one
youth gravely injured.
	   More than 10,000 people watched the game Monday on a
giant-screen television in Mexico City's main plaza, the Zocalo,
cheering wildly as Mexico took a 1-0 lead over Germany early in the
second half.
	   But most of the crowd quickly dissolved after the match ended in
a 2-1 victory for the European team, and the crowds in general were
much tamer than the bottle-throwing mobs that turned out after
Mexico's previous World Cup matches.
	   Still, police arrested some 53 people, and Oscar Rivas Medina,
19, suffered skull injuries when a small explosive struck him in
the head. He underwent several hours of surgery.
	   Dozens of youths, some in school uniforms, looted newsstands and
soft-drink trucks in the Zocalo before order was restored.
	   Television Azteca reported that a youth depressed over the loss
tried to hang himself in the northern city of Monterrey, but rescue
workers arrived in time to save his life.
	   Most, however, found plenty to celebrate. Few had expected
Mexico to advance to the World Cup's second round, and there was
little disgrace in losing to Germany, one of the best teams.
	   ``They gave some extremely cool moments to the entire nation. As
athletes, they demonstrated a world-class quality,'' Mario Sosa,
23, said after watching the game in the Zocalo. ``We think we
should be really proud of the team.''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo called the team after the game to
offer congratulations. He said its performance ``has been an
example not only of its extraordinary athletic capacity, but also
of its enormous character, its extraordinary spirit and, above all,
its desire to win.''
	   Police boosted security after celebrations of last week's 2-2
tie with Belgium resulted in 164 arrests and more than 90 injuries
_ four of them severe. Hundreds of police in riot gear surrounded
the Angel of Independence Monument or were posted nearby, but they
appeared to have few problems with the many fans who gathered there
to honor the fallen team.
	   ``I saw that they gave their best effort and did all they
could,'' said Alejandro Jimenez Escobar, 19, at the Zocalo. ``It
was a good game, wasn't it? Someone has to lose.''

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces blasted ethnic Albanian
separatists with mortar fire Tuesday as they tried to dislodge them
from a strategic Kosovo mining village. Amid the fighting, a human
rights group accused the Serbs of rape and other war crimes.
	   Serb police kept access blocked to the besieged area around
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina Tuesday, the second day of the assault. The sound of heavy
mortars and other artillery was heard, and heavy clouds of black
smoke billowed from two locations near the village.
	   Dozens of people, including women and children, fled the
besieged area. The shooting calmed down by noon, with only
occasional gunfire being heard.
	   On Monday, a three-pronged Serbian attack sent more than 8,000
people streaming away from their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade. By evening police and other
paramilitary Serb forces had advanced within 200 meters (yards) of
Belacevac.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   Another group of refugees _ Kosovo Albanians on the run for
weeks _ raised the concerns of the main U.N. refugee agency in
Geneva.
	   The agency was in touch both with Serbian authorities and
Albanians in control of the area between Junik and the Albanian
border to try and arrange a relief convoy for several hundred
refugees in the region's highlands, said spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   ``The people have basically been roughing it for weeks,'' said
Janowski. ``They live in very provisional shelters made of
branches, cardboard and plastic.''
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to AP offices in the Balkans, the respected
private watchdog group said it had ``powerful evidence'' that Serb
police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said the
KLA siege of Kijevo town ``affects civilians and other
non-combatants in the town.''
	   Suspicions of war crimes and less grave rights violations have
led to demands from foreign capitals that international observers
be allowed into Kosovo _ something that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic recently agreed to.
	   In Pristina, western diplomats said observers had begun
trickling into the Serbian province and were looking for
accommodations in and around the provincial capital.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded the withdrawal of Serb
special forces and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday on the Shanghai stop of President Bill
Clinton's China visit.
	   The fighting came as international envoys urged the two sides to
seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic and
moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders to try to find a solution to the
conflict, while another U.S. diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in negotiations for peace in the region.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It increasingly is
supported by the ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Monday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the U.N.
Security Council must approve any military action.
	   The United States says the Security Council's blessing is not
needed for NATO intervention, but Russia disagrees.
	   In Paris Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine renewed
his country's support for U.N.-sanctioned NATO intervention to stop
the fighting in Kosovo, which he called ``a powder keg for
Europe.''
	   ``We can intervene militarily. It's an option that is on the
table,'' Vedrine told Europe 1 radio. ``It must happen with a
decision by the Security Council.''

Cambodian opposition party stops campaigning in former Khmer Rouge stronghold 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
has decided to suspend election campaigning in an area controlled
by Khmer Rouge defectors because of security concerns, a party
activist said Tuesday.
	   The royalist FUNCINPEC party of deposed co-Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh will temporarily cease campaign activities in
Pailin in western Cambodia because its candidates ``are very
scared,'' said Mu Sochua, a party worker in the area.
	   Opposition parties such as FUNCINPEC have charged that an
atmosphere of violence and intimidation makes a free and fair
election on July 26 difficult, if not impossible.
	   Mu Sochua said the decision to suspend campaigning was made
after Pailin authorities threatened to arrest a party candidate in
the former jungle base because ``they said he was Khmer Rouge.''
	   ``The man escaped,'' she said, adding that other FUNCINPEC
candidates in the area are too frightened to continue campaigning
for the time being.
	   Pailin's leaders are former high-ranking Khmer Rouge guerrillas
who defected to the government in 1996. Chief among them is Ieng
Sary, who was foreign minister when the Khmer Rouge held power in
the late 1970s.
	   When the Khmer Rouge held power, its extremist policies were
responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians from
overwork, illness, disease and execution.
	   Some 10,000 guerrillas followed Ieng Sary's lead, dealing a
major blow to the rebel movement, which now is all but defunct. The
Khmer Rouge stronghold at Pailin was returned to government
control, but allowed a high degree of autonomy under its former
leaders.
	   Although Ieng Sary was granted a royal pardon, there are reasons
to doubt his commitment to democracy. He has aligned himself and
his movement with Hun Sen, the country's strongman, who overthrow
Ranariddh, his co-premier, in a coup last July.
	   As many as 90 of Ranariddh's supporters were killed in the
months following the coup, according to human rights workers.
	   FUNCINPEC, the main challenger to Hun Sen's formerly communist
Cambodian People's Party, has said that at least four of its
supporters have been killed in the past month, raising fears of new
violence in the run-up to the polls.
	   ``We take the threat very seriously,'' FUNCINPEC party
Secretary-General Tol Lah said of the incident in Pailin.

Iraqi dinar slides, prices jump in Baghdad 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi dinar has fallen about 8 percent
to the U.S. dollar in the past few days owing to tension over U.N.
inspections and the government's huge bailout for farmers, traders
said Tuesday.
	   The currency slid to 1,575 to the dollar Tuesday. It was trading
at 1,550 on Monday and around 1,450 last week.
	   Traders attributed the fall partly to the row over the United
Nations' reporting that traces of the deadly nerve gas VX had been
found on Iraqi missile warheads.
	   The finding prompted the U.S. government to say it will be a
long time before the world body lifts the sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   Prices of most commodities, which are linked to the dinar-dollar
ratio, have gone up by almost the same amount. Certain items _ such
as tires, car spare parts and electrical appliances _ are priced in
dollars in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said it will not lift the
sanctions until Baghdad proves to its weapons monitors that it has
destroyed all illegal weapons. Last week's finding, which Iraq has
disputed, challenged Baghdad's claims that it had never armed
missiles with VX.
	   Traders said the dinar's fall was also due to the government's
massive bailout of farmers who have suffered from crippling losses
this year owing to unusually low prices for wheat, barley and rice.
	   The rescue package will cost the government about 375 billion
dinars, which it is expected to raise by printing new currency.

Over consumption leads to blackout in capital 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with power company preparing for heat wave
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A surge in consumer demand for electricity
on Tuesday led to a short circuit in a main power substation and
blacked out many parts of the capital.
	   According to the Public Power Company, the short circuit left at
least 25 percent of the capital and its suburbs without
electricity. It also blacked out street lights, causing traffic
jams around this city of nearly five million. It hoped to have
power fully restored by nightfall.
	   With temperatures expected to hit 42 degrees Celsius (108
degrees Fahrenheit) by the weekend, the Public Power Company
company said it hopes to have all its power plants on-line to cope
with an expected surge in demand. One is off-line for repairs.
	   Power requirements often spike in summer because of increased
use of such appliances as air conditioners. Temperatures in Athens
were expected to reach 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit)
Tuesday.

Serbs battle to retake coal mine held by Kosovo rebels from U.N. refugee organization; trim. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with details of fighting, comments

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces blasted ethnic Albanian
separatists with mortar fire Tuesday as they tried to dislodge them
from a strategic Kosovo mining village. Amid the fighting, a human
rights group accused the Serbs of rape and other war crimes.
	   Serb police kept access blocked to the besieged area around
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, on the second day of the assault. The sound of heavy
mortars and other artillery was heard, and heavy clouds of black
smoke billowed from two locations near the village.
	   Dozens of people, including women and children, fled the
besieged area. The shooting slowed down by noon, with only
occasional gunfire heard.
	   On Monday, a three-pronged Serbian attack sent more than 8,000
people streaming from their homes in Belacevac and the neighboring
village of Hade. By evening, police and other paramilitary Serb
forces had advanced to within 200 meters (yards) of Belacevac.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance. The KLA claims up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It
is increasingly supported by the ethnic Albanians, who represent 90
percent of Kosovo's population.
	   A group of Kosovo Albanian refugees on the run for weeks
concerned the main U.N. refugee agency in Geneva on Tuesday.
	   The agency was in touch both with Serbian authorities and ethnic
Albanians in control of the area between Junik and the Albanian
border, trying to arrange a relief convoy for several hundred
refugees in the region's highlands, said spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   ``The people have basically been roughing it for weeks,'' said
Janowski. ``They live in very provisional shelters made of
branches, cardboard and plastic.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ for war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to Associated Press offices in the Balkans,
the respected private watchdog group said it had ``powerful

Singapore Airlines adjusts services as regional travel patterns shift 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines announced Tuesday it will
reduce flights to Japan and add services to Australia and New
Zealand over the coming months as travel patterns continue to
shift.
	   Because of fewer passengers to Japan due to the economic
slowdown there, the airline will terminate all four weekly flights
to Sendai by September, a statement from the airline said.
	   But it will add a total of 10 flights a week to Melbourne,
Brisbane and Christchurch because of ``robust growth in passenger
demand'' on these routes.
	   Singapore Airlines said it will add four flights per week to
Melbourne and three flights per week to Brisbane by October. It
also will use larger planes on its route to Perth.
	   It will also reintroduce three flights to Christchurch in late
October after a one-year break. It had signed a code-sharing
agreement with Air New Zealand in October 1997, but its planes had
not operated on the seven flights each week.
	   In addition, the airline will add two flights a week to Hong
Kong starting Aug. 6. It now has 33.
	   It will increase the frequency of its services to Katmandu,
Nepal, from two to three per week at the end of October.

Chechen police to launch crackdown on crime wave 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov called for
police to get tougher on criminals to stem a wave of crime in the
breakaway republic, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   ``We cannot put up with such things any longer,'' Maskhadov said
in a televised speech Monday night, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Wearing his military uniform for the first time since he became
president in 1997, Maskhadov said, ``people are tired of bandits
and have lost any hope of protection from authorities.'' He vowed
that ``criminals will be wiped out of Chechen soil.''
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its war for
independence from Russia two years ago.
	   Criminal groups are holding an estimated 40 people in the
republic, including Russia's envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov,
ITAR-Tass said. Two British, two Hungarians, and a man from Turkey
are also known to be in captivity.
	   Maskhadov's speech was followed by a spate of arrests _ part of
a curfew imposed five days ago when Maskhadov announced a state of
emergency in the republic, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Most of those arrested were later released, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maskhadov denied that the state of emergency was political to
prevent a military coup. ``Such rumors are specially spread by
enemies of Chechen independence,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, a Chechen delegation arrived in Moscow Tuesday for
talks with leaders of parliament, ITAR-Tass said. The agenda
includes discussions on human rights, financial problems and
increasing cooperation between the two sides.
	   Russia is seeking ``a constructive dialogue to try to ensure the
preservation of peace and relative stability in the region,''
deputy speaker of parliament Mikhail Gutseriyev said.

Russia receives IMF loan disbursement government's austerity package. ADDS byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-8 with Communists commenting on
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After months of waiting, Russia's cash-strapped
government has finally received dlrs 670 million as part of an
International Monetary Fund loan, according to a report Tuesday.
	   The IMF decided last Thursday to release the money after
withholding it for months and pressing the Russian government to do
more to get its finances in order. The funds arrived Tuesday at the
Russian Finance Ministry's account, the the Interfax news agency
reported, citing a ministry official.
	   The money will not be enough to pull Russia out of its current
financial tailspin, but it should give President Boris Yeltsin's
government a bit more breathing space.
	   The money is part of an IMF loan for dlrs 9 billion that is
spread over three years. But the IMF has on several occasions
delayed the installments because it was not satisfied with the
government's financial performance.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was to appear before
parliament on Wednesday to answer questions about the government's
austerity plan, which is designed to stabilize the Russian markets.
	   Parliament is controlled by Communists who have consistently
opposed cuts in government spending programs, and it remained
unclear whether lawmakers would give their consent to the package.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has been critical of the
government plan and said Tuesday that five of the 21 proposals were
completely unacceptable, Interfax reported.
	   But Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is the speaker of
parliament's lower house, predicted that ``a majority of the bills
submitted may be ... passed into law on Wednesday,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Russian financial markets have been falling sharply in recent
weeks, due to a combination of factors that include government
budget problems, a drop in revenues from oil exports, and the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new
lending from the IMF as part of an economic package aimed at
preventing a devaluation of the ruble. The IMF is considering the
loan request.
	   Also on Tuesday, Russian commercial banks were allowed to
restart gold exports, only days after they were suspended on
grounds of a legal dispute, officials said.
	   The trouble was apparently caused by a lack of regulations on
whether gold is to be classified as a commodity _ and therefore out
of bounds for banks _ or as a monetary item.
	   The Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade intends to
draft changes to export rules to classify gold as a monetary item
and avoid similar problems in the future, ministry officials said,
according to Interfax.

Soldiers ordered in to guard hydro power station 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A company of soldiers took over security
operations at Fiji's main hydroelectric power station Tuesday with
orders to shoot trespassers.
	   The Monasavu Hydroelectric installation in the mountains of Viti
Levu, the country's main island, was the target of an arson attack
over the weekend that caused Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka to cut
short a visit to Australia to deal with the crisis.
	   Minister for Home Affairs Col. Paul Manueli said the soldiers
had been told to use firearms if needed.
	   Trouble started brewing in the area around the installation over
the weekend and an office block was destroyed by fire Sunday after
the government ignored a demand by landowners last week for 35
million Fiji dollars (U.S. dlrs 17.5 million) in compensation for
their land.
	   Investigations are continuing into the blaze and no arrests have
been made.
	   Manueli, a former commander of the Fiji army, said more than 100
soldiers will take over security of the hydroelectric installation
from police.
	   He said the soldiers would remain in the area as long as they
were needed.
	   He said there had been about 100 policemen deployed over the
past week in the area northwest of the capital, Suva.
	   They will be moved to sugar fields in western Viti Levu to watch
over Indian cane cutters harvesting for the first of the country's
four sugar mills at Penang, which started crushing last week.
	   About 80 percent of Viti Levu's electricity needs are supplied
from the Monasavu hydro installation, operated by the state-owned
Fiji Electricity Authority.
	   Meanwhile, a special Cabinet subcommittee has been appointed to
look into the landowners' demands and make recommendations next
month.

Arafat: U.S. requested that Palestinians delay U.N. initiative 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The United States has asked the
Palestinians to postpone for 10 days a U.N. Security Council debate
on Israel's plans to expand Jerusalem, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Tuesday.
	   Arafat did not say whether he accepted the U.S. request.
	   A senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Palestinians would likely agree to postpone the
Jerusalem debate, scheduled for later Tuesday.
	   The Security Council is considering a resolution that would
condemn Israel's decision to extend municipal services from
Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
	   The United States had sought to delay the meeting until next
month, saying any council action would hinder U.S. diplomatic
efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Asked about the timing of the debate, Arafat said Tuesday in his
halting English: ``The U.S. administration had asked me to delay
for 10 days, until they return from China.'' U.S. President Bill
Clinton is on a trip to China.
	   The future of Jerusalem is the most explosive issue on the
Israeli-Palestinian agenda. The Palestinians hope to establish a
capital in east Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan
in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of the
city. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to
keep building in the disputed sector and threw his support behind
Jewish settlers buying homes in the city's Arab neighborhoods.

Frenchman shot dead in dispute with security guards

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Frenchman employed by a local
investment firm was shot and killed after accusing the company's
security guards of sloppy work habits and challenging them to a
fight, police said Tuesday.
	   The man, identified only as Tony, 35, headed the security detail
of the Power Investment Group, said Mak Chito, head of the police
division in charge of foreigners.
	   Mak Chito said the victim had an argument with the three
Cambodian guards and accused them of being late and skipping work.
He apparently challenged them to a fight and closed the compound
gate to prevent them from leaving.
	   Sok Padana, 25, a police officer moonlighting as a security
guard, shot him three times, Mak Chito said. The other guards took
the man to a hospital, where he died.

Thailand's foreign reserves drop as obligations come due 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's foreign reserves dropped
dlrs 1.4 billion to dlrs 26.1 billion in early June as the country
repaid obligations incurred in currency markets during a futile
defense of the baht last year.
	   The Bank of Thailand released the figures Tuesday, showing that
the central bank repaid dlrs 1.4 billion in swap market
obligations, reducing its net forward position to dlrs 12 billion.
	   Thailand's central bankers drained the foreign reserves last
year to nearly zero to defend the currency's rate of about 25 to 1
against the U.S. dollar.
	   On July 2, 1997, the country conceded defeat and allowed the
baht to depreciate, triggering a wave of currency crises in Asia.
The baht is currently trading at about 42 to the dollar.
	   The International Monetary Fund put a priority on rebuilding the
foreign reserves, stepping in with a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout a
month later. The government has since changed and the top ranks of
the central bank were shaken up.
	   Thailand has promised the IMF to bring the obligations down to
dlrs 9 billion by the end of the year from more than dlrs 23
billion built up ahead of the de facto devaluation.
	   Central bank statistics released Tuesday also showed that
Thailand's current account surplus fell to dlrs 859 million from
dlrs 1.48 billion in March, its lowest level in six months.
	   The trade surplus fell to a seven-month low, from dlrs 1.12
billion to dlrs 633 billion. Preliminary Customs Department data,
however, indicate trade figures will improve sharply for May.
	   Exports dropped 2 percent year-on-year in April in dollar terms.
Analysts say strong volume growth in exports of rice and other
commodities has been offset by decreases in global market prices.
	   The central bank director of economic research, Kleothong
Hetrakul, told reporters that economic decline in Asia has reduced
demand for Thai exports in the region.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action suit suit, trim, minor edits. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD names of plaintiffs, more details from
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
suit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action suit, representing five victims of the
Holocaust, asks a U.S. court in Washington, D.C. to award
compensatory and punitive damages from the Swiss National Bank,
Switzerland's central bank.
	   The bank has said that any obligations arising from World War II
dealings were settled in a 1946 treaty, and it says no U.S. court
has jurisdiction in such a case against a sovereign country.
	   The suit described how the Nazis sent the victims or their
families to concentration camps and stole their possessions.
	   It said the Swiss National Bank's ``gold reserves may include
assets looted'' from them or from thousands more people who could
be added to the list of plaintiffs.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate
multibillion suit in New York against Swiss commercial banks.
	   An independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The suit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the suit
said.
	   Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said that the bank
has not yet officially been informed of the suit.
	   He restated the bank's position that it does not consider a U.S.
court has jurisdiction in such cases and that it will fight any
suits against it vigorously.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private
and government assets during the war.
	   An earlier U.S. report said Swiss banks handled dlrs 400 million
of Nazi gold, some dlrs 300 million of it looted from European
banks.
	   The plaintiffs in the case filed Monday include Freda Rosenberg
of New York, New York, Gertrude Jorisch of New York; Andor
Mittelman of Louisville, Kentucky; Eva Garai of Winnipeg, Canada;
and Ernest Knopfler, whose address was given only as New York
State.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Swansea manager Alan Cork has been sacked after
after a clash with officials at the Welsh club over his style of
management.
	   Cork, an FA Cup winner with Wimbledon in 1988, on Tuesday became
the 31st manager of a senior team in Britain to be sacked or resign
since January.
	   Cork took over at Swansea last October when Micky Adams quit
after just 13 days at the helm and steered the team to a
disappointing 20th place in the division three competition.
	   Swansea chairman Steve Hamer said the team was moving to a new
stadium next year and the board wanted a change now rather than
wait until the season started.
	   Former Bradford manager Chris Kamara started what has been a
tumultuous year for managers when he was sacked on January 6.
	   In February, Ruud Gullit was sacked by eventual European Cup
Winners Cup titlists Chelsea, Frank Clark was sacked by Manchester
City and Brian Little resigned at Aston Villa.
	   Graeme Elder resigned from Queens Park Rangers in March, while
Attilio Lombardo resigned as Crystal Palace manager in April.
	   Scottish teams also had high-level coaching departures in April,
with Wim Jansen resigning at Celtic and Walter Smith stepping down
at Rangers.
	   The most recent controversial, but not unexpected, management
departure occured on June 25 when Howard Kendall left Everton by
``mutual consent''.

United Nations returns 4 millionth Afghan refugee home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Six years after Afghanistan's Islamic
insurgents retook control of their nation from Moscow-backed
communists, the United Nations announced Tuesday the return home of
the 4 millionth Afghan refugee.
	   In a statement marking the milestone, the U.N. office in
Pakistan said, ``This staggering number of returnees is a record
for any refugee group since World War II.''
	   There are still 2.6 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and
Iran, but the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office in
Pakistan says it's running out of money.
	   Just half way through the year, the UNHCR says it has barely
dlrs 4 million left from its dlrs 21 million budget, making it
``one of the most cash-strapped refugee programs in the world at
present.''
	   When the former Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in
1979 to prop up its communist allies, millions of Afghans fled. By
the early 1980s, more than 6 million Afghans were refugees either
in neighboring Pakistan or Iran.
	   When Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan 10 years later, the
battle raged on between the pro-Moscow government and Islamic
insurgents backed by the United States and other Western countries.
	   Muslim rebels ousted the communists in 1992 and took control of
the Afghan capital, Kabul.
	   In the first eight months after that, 1.6 million refugees
returned home from Iran and Pakistan. But fighting soon broke out
between the rival groups and fewer refugees returned after that.
	   The UNHCR says the next few years will be crucial for the
remaining Afghan refugees. Many are adults who have lived in exile
since birth and may be reluctant to go to a country they don't
know.

Belarussian tourists robbed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Four men held up a bus full of
Belarussian tourists near Graz on Tuesday, robbing them of jewelry,
cameras and money.
	   A Polish bus carrying 38 passengers from Belarus was attacked
around 4 a.m. by four men believed to be Russians, the Austrian
Press Agency reported. The four men remain at large.
	   The incident occured after the bus stopped in Klagenfurt, 311
kilometers (193 miles) south of Vienna, and three suspects boarded.
A fourth followed the bus in a dark sports car, the press agency
said.
	   Once on the bus, the men forced the passengers to hand over
their valuables. The value of the stolen goods was not available.
	   One passenger was slightly injured in the throat following a
struggle with an assailant armed with a knife.
	   The men then forced the chauffeur to stop the bus at a highway
rest station outside of Graz some 140 kilometers (90 miles) down
the road, where they met up with their accomplice.
	   The four disabled the bus by slashing one of its tires and fled
toward Vienna.

Former Interior Minister defends Tehran Mayor 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's former interior minister came to the
mayor's defense Tuesday in the highly publicized corruption trial
that has riveted the nation.
	   Ali Mohammad Besharati testified that Gholamhossein Karbaschi
did a good job as Tehran mayor and that he would have fired him had
he thought he was corrupt.
	   ``Not only as an interior minister but also as a citizen I could
see the results in Tehran of the efforts of Mr. Karbaschi. I
supported him by word and deed and if I believed he had any bad
intentions, I would definitely have dismissed him,'' Besharati told
the packed courtroom.
	   Karbaschi has been credited for cleaning up pollution and
beautifying Tehran, a city of 8 million. He has built parks, new
roads, sports and cultural facilities and added a splash of color
to the city's drab streets.
	   But conservative clerics have complained about the
``corrupting'' influence of films and music at the cultural
centers. And the powerful bazaar merchants say they have been taxed
heavily to pay for city improvements.
	   Many see the case against Karbaschi as an attempt by hard-liners
in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Karbaschi was arrested April 4 and released 11 days later on the
orders of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, after the mayor's
supporters took to the streets and clashed with security forces.
	   On Tuesday, Karbaschi denied accusations by judge Hojatoleslam
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei that he had taken money out of the
city's coffers without documentation.
	   ``Every single rial (Iranian currency) we spent was documented
and the evidence is the Tehran municipality documents you are using
now,'' said the bespectacled, bearded mayor, looking dapper in a
dark green suit and shirt.
	   It was the fourth session of Karbaschi's trial.
	   As in previous trials, Karbaschi sparred with the judge for

Ruling party agrees on bridge banks plan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with reports on bank rescue
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's governing party agreed Tuesday to allow
``bridge banks'' based on a U.S. model to take over failed
financial institutions, news reports said.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's party has been studying
various proposals for a bridge bank system to clean up mountains of
bad loans in the nation's banking system and keep credit flowing to
healthy borrowers.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse in the early
1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and real estate
speculation.
	   Under the proposed system, government officials would be sent to
manage a failed institution until a buyer was found or its assets
were sold.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.
	   ``Basically, I want you to study incorporating U.S. bridge
bank-style functions, so in the event of a bank's failure, its
operations could be passed on quickly to a public institution,''
Hashimoto was quoted as saying by Nikkei news service.
	   Hashimoto's government has been scrambling to put the plan
together since it pledged aggressive action to clean up ailing
banks at a meeting of international finance officials earlier this
month.
	   Bridge banks are the centerpiece of a plan designed to restore
financial system health and pull Japan out of its deepest economic
recession since the end of World War II.
	   Bridge banks would likely draw on a 30 trillion yen (dlrs 211
billion) pool created earlier this year for troubled banks, media
reports said. The money could be used for new loans to healthy
borrowers or to cover loans that go bad.
	   The government should let the bridge banks operate for a maximum
of two years, a leading governing party politician said in a speech
Tuesday.
	   The party is scheduled to outline the bridge bank proposal
Thursday and will likely submit related bills to a special session
of Parliament expected in late July.
	   Separately Tuesday, a major newspaper reported that a Bank of
Japan official said some of Japan's banks are substantially
bankrupt.
	   ``There are more than a few banks that have virtually failed,''
Kazuo Ueda, one of nine members of the central bank's board, was
quoted as saying by the newspaper Mainichi.

Clinton banters with the Chinese on talk radio

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With callers lighting up the switchboard,
the American president fielded questions on a popular Chinese radio
talk show Tuesday, bantering about the Asian economy, World Cup
soccer and how he stays in shape.
	   The exchange was tame by the acerbic standards of U.S. talk
radio, which provides some of President Bill Clinton's harshest
criticism.
	   Clinton called the experience, his first talk show foray
overseas, a ``historic occasion'' and suggested he'll do more of
them to get a better idea of what ordinary citizens are thinking.
He also vowed to work for more Chinese-American educational and
cultural exchanges.
	   ``The more we do these things, the more we will be able to work
through our differences and build a common future,'' the president
said. ``And besides that, it will make life more interesting and
more fun.''
	   On Asia's financial turmoil, Clinton praised China for keeping
its currency stable, but added, ``We cannot see growth restored in
Asia unless it is restored in Japan.''
	   Clinton raised the concern about Japan, noting the upcoming
legislative election and government plans to announce steps for
financial reform.
	   ``If it is a good proposal and the confidence of investors ...
is raised, then I believe you will see the situation turn around''
in Asia, Clinton said. This, he said, would ease pressure on China
and also would be important for the United States.
	   With the rapid-fire questions relayed by simultaneous
translation, the toughest came from host Zuo Anlong, who suggested
Clinton could have difficulty dealing with opponents of the trip
back home. He asked if Clinton would have the courage to convince
critics it was right to go.
	   Clinton said his televised exchange on human rights with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing and the broadcast of the
president's remarks at Peking University should quiet his critics.
	   Even though Clinton still had three more days in China, Beijing
declared his visit a ``full success.''
	   It increased friendship, fostered mutual understanding and
brought progress towards a ``constructive strategic partnership,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
	   Clinton's talk radio appearance followed a 90-minute session
with Shanghai community leaders at the city's new,
Internet-connected library. They told him vast changes were
occurring across Chinese society, from the arts and media to
business and law to religious practices.
	   Clinton agreed, saying there is ``a new China emerging in the
world that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic.''
	   Responding to a question, Clinton carefully spelled out U.S.
policy toward Taiwan, a politically charged issue since China
regards Taiwan as a renegade province. The president adhered to
finely worded diplomatic language that broke no new administration
ground.
	   ``We don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or
one Taiwan, one China,'' he said. ``And we don't believe that
Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood
is a requirement.''
	   He said Taiwan and China should pursue a peaceful settlement
through dialogue.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, ``It's no surprise the
United States would reiterate U.S. policy.'' But he acknowledged
Taipei might be upset by Clinton's words, seeing it as leaning
toward Beijing.

South Korea proposes joint probe into captured North Korean sub grafs 2-3, 7-8 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with U.N. Command statement denouncing North Korea,
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung proposed
Tuesday that South and North Korea jointly investigate the deaths
of nine crewmen of a captured North Korean submarine.
	   Generals from the American-led U.N. Command relayed the offer
later Tuesday when they met with North Korean generals at the
border village of Panmunjom to protest the submarine intrusion as
an armistice violation.
	   The command ``called upon the (North) Korean People's Army to
acknowledge the facts as presented by the UNC ... to punish those
responsible for these activities,'' the command's news release
said.
	   After the submarine was towed to shore last week, nine bodies
were found inside. South Korean officials said all had been shot,
apparently to avoid capture.
	   But North Korea said the sub had drifted into southern waters
because of mechanical problems and questioned South Korea's
explanation of the cause of death of the crew. It also demanded the
return of the submarine and its dead crew.
	   ``We need to deal aggressively with the North's unreasonable
arguments,'' the president was quoted as saying by his spokesman,
Park Ji-won.
	   The U.N. Command did not divulge details of what North Korea
said at Tuesday's border meeting.
	   But it said it proposed talks on returning the nine dead crewmen
after North Korea agreed not to exploit the repatriation for
``political purposes'' or anti-South ``propaganda.''
	   On Monday, South Korea said the submarine was on a spying
mission, briefly landing three agents on the South's eastern coast,
which is dotted with airfields, naval bases and other key military
facilities.
	   What those agents did on shore was not clear, but the Defense
Ministry said they may have contacted North Korean spies already on
land, before returning to the submarine.
	   The nine bodies were discovered when the sub's hatches were
opened Friday, four days after the 70-ton craft was found tangled
in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast.
	   An analysis of gunshot wounds indicated that five of the North
Koreans were killed by the sub's captain and the three agents, who
then killed themselves, South Korean officials said.
	   President Kim asked North Korea to admit the incursion and
prevent a recurrence, but said the episode would not end civilian
exchanges and increasing cooperation to open the North's reclusive
communist society.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. The countries are still technically
at war, since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a
peace treaty.

	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebellious military
leaders have demanded that Senegal and Republic of Guinea, fighting
in support of President Joao Bernardo Vieira, withdraw all troops
before further peace talks can occur.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a ceasefire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers, rebel officials said.
	   A government delegation was scheduled Tuesday to meet with rebel
leaders to search for a solution to their three-week conflict in
this small former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip.
	   The talks were jeopardized by heavy artillery fire in the
capital late Monday afternoon.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes, the rebel spokesman, asked Portuguese
ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva to press the government to
stop the attacks.
	   ``If one of ours dies, you can be sure we'll retaliate,''
Fernandes told da Silva in a phone call cited by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane staged a coup
attempt against Vieira earlier this month, which has degenerated
into near civil war in around the capital and some nearby towns.
	   Rebel-controlled Radio Bombolon on Tuesday said Mane's forces
would only consider a cease-fire when Senegal's more than 1,500
troops withdraw from Guinea-Bissau.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is willing to expand relations with Poland,
despite plans by the former ally to join the NATO alliance,
officials told visiting Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski on
Tuesday.
	   Poland, a former Warsaw Pact member, has been invited to join
NATO next year, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic. Russia
opposes the plan, saying the expansion of the alliance is aimed
against Russia.
	   ``Our relations with Poland are not bad,'' Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said after meeting with Kwasniewski. ``I wouldn't
look at them only in the context of Poland's efforts to join
NATO.''
	   Kwasniewski, who was on a private visit to Moscow to see the
international Tchaikovsky music competition, also met with
President Boris Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and other
officials.
	   Yeltsin agreed to make a reciprocal visit at the end of the
year. Kwasniewski said the exchange of visits was a sign of the two
state's willingness to expand bilateral relations, Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Kwasniewski also visited a Catholic cathedral in Moscow and two
of the city's new Western-style sprawling shopping malls, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov called for
police to get tougher on criminals to stem a wave of crime in the
breakaway republic, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   ``We cannot put up with such things any longer,'' Maskhadov said
in a televised speech Monday night, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Wearing his military uniform for the first time since he became
president in 1997, Maskhadov said, ``people are tired of bandits
and have lost any hope of protection from authorities.'' He vowed
that ``criminals will be wiped out of Chechen soil.''
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its war for
independence from Russia two years ago.
	   Criminal groups are holding an estimated 40 people in the
republic, including Russia's envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov,
ITAR-Tass said. Two British, two Hungarians, a Frenchman, and a man
from Turkey are also known to be in captivity.
	   The wife of French hostage Vincent Cochetel, an official of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, was in Moscow Tuesday to
appeal for her husband's release. Cochetel has been held in
Chechnya since January, but his captors have not made any demands
for his release, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Maskhadov's speech was followed by a spate of arrests _ part of
a curfew imposed five days ago when Maskhadov announced a state of
emergency in the republic, according to ITAR-Tass. Most of those
arrested were later released, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maskhadov denied that the state of emergency was political to
prevent a military coup. ``Such rumors are specially spread by
enemies of Chechen independence,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, a Chechen delegation arrived in Moscow Tuesday for
talks with leaders of parliament, ITAR-Tass said. The agenda
includes discussions on human rights, financial problems and
increasing cooperation between the two sides.
	   Russia is seeking ``a constructive dialogue to try to ensure the
preservation of peace and relative stability in the region,''
deputy speaker of parliament Mikhail Gutseriyev said.

U.S. lawyers say they have filed new Holocaust class-action suit York City and CORRECT that Jorisch is from Westbury, New York sted New York.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. lawyers have filed a long-awaited
suit for victims of the Holocaust to recover plundered gold
accepted by Switzerland during World War II, according to documents
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The class-action suit, representing five victims of the
Holocaust, asks a U.S. court in Washington, D.C. to award
compensatory and punitive damages from the Swiss National Bank,
Switzerland's central bank.
	   The bank has said that any obligations arising from World War II
dealings were settled in a 1946 treaty, and it says no U.S. court
has jurisdiction in such a case against a sovereign country.
	   The suit described how the Nazis sent the victims or their
families to concentration camps and stole their possessions.
	   It said the Swiss National Bank's ``gold reserves may include
assets looted'' from them or from thousands more people who could
be added to the list of plaintiffs.
	   The 29-page brief, signed by lawyers Michael D. Hausfeld of
Washington and Melvyn Weiss of New York, was filed late Monday in
Washington. It was faxed overnight from Hausfeld's office to The
Associated Press in Bern.
	   The two lawyers also represent plaintiffs in a separate
multibillion suit in New York against Swiss commercial banks.
	   An independent panel of historians recently reported that the
bank had apparently unknowingly received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims.
	   This gold was in addition to gold looted by the Nazis from the
national treasuries of occupied countries and used to buy war
materiel and other supplies from Switzerland and other neutral
countries.
	   The suit accuses the bank of ``unlawful behavior ... in
trafficking in and disposing of and concealing looted assets'' or
the products of slave labor knowing that it was dealing with ``the
fruits of Nazi violations of international law.''
	   The lawyers ask the court to order an audit of the bank's
transactions from 1939 to 1950 and to direct it ``to return all
identifiable property looted from plaintiffs.''
	   ``As a result of their conduct for a period of over 50 years
Swiss National Bank has retained and profited from illegally
obtained assets belonging to the members of the class,'' the suit
said.
	   Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said that the bank
has not yet officially been informed of the suit.
	   He restated the bank's position that it does not consider a U.S.
court has jurisdiction in such cases and that it will fight any
suits against it vigorously.
	   A U.S. government report issued in early June said Switzerland
held from dlrs 250 million to dlrs 750 million in German private
and government assets during the war.
	   An earlier U.S. report said Swiss banks handled dlrs 400 million
of Nazi gold, some dlrs 300 million of it looted from European
banks.
	   The plaintiffs in the case filed Monday include Freda Rosenberg
of New York City, Gertrude Jorisch of Westbury, New York; Andor
Mittelman of Louisville, Kentucky; Eva Garai of Winnipeg, Canada;
and Ernest Knopfler of New York City.

`Giorgio' Bush meets Giorgio Armani in Milan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ ``George Bush meet Giorgio Armani.''
	   The two Giorgios were introduced by mutual friend and film star
Arnold Schwarzenegger after the Armani Emporio menswear show held
in a renovated factory Monday night.
	   Schwarzenegger bumped into the former U.S. president in the
lobby of the Milan hotel where both are staying and suggested he
come along to the show.
	   Bush, in town on a private visit to meet with Italian business
people, was unable to catch the show but dropped in for the
mega-party (1,500 invitees) which followed, part of the current
round of Italian menswear presentation for spring-summer 1999.
	   While George was chatting with Giorgio over a bowl of pasta and
a glass of sparkling wine, Milan's Mayor Gabriele Albertini was
casting his ballot and casting off his clothes for the
made-in-Italy label.
	   The fashion-conscious mayor stripped to the bare minimum during
the Monday's Valentino presentation to show off the designer's
latest cashmere bathing suit.

Hingis, Novotna sail into quarters AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with Hingis, Novotna victories; edits to conform
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis and
last year's runnerup, Jana Novotna, eased into the Wimbledon
quarterfinals Tuesday with straight-set victories.
	   The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, while No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3.
	   Hingis got off to a slow start, losing serve in the first game
and struggling to find her rhythm. But she won the next four games
and breezed to victory over her 42nd-ranked opponent.
	   ``I had a little bit of a problem at the beginning to get into
it,'' Hingis said. ``The second set was much better. I was always
more aggressive and controlling the games and the points.''
	   Hingis said she may have been affected by the 11 a.m. start.
	   ``Everything was kind of very fast in the morning,'' she said.
``I was still sleeping in practice.''
	   Tournament officials scheduled early matches in order to clear
up a backlog caused by so many rain delays. The sun was out Tuesday
and there was only a small chance of showers.
	   Hingis will meet the winner of the fourth-round match betwen
French Open champion and No. 5 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and
Belgium's No. 15 Dominique Van Roost.
	   Novotna will face either Venus Williams or Virginia
Pascual-Romano.
	   Hingis and Novotna are both in the top half of the draw and
could meet in the semifinals.
	   In men's play, defending champino Pete Sampras was scheduled to
face French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean in a fourth-round match.
Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was due to face
Wayne Ferreira for a place in the quarters.
	   For the third straight year, Tim Henman has reached the
quarterfinals, raising Britain's hopes of having its first male
champion since 1936.
	   Feeding off the frenzied support of the Centre Court crowd, the
12th-seeded Henman downed U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter of
Australia 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``To walk out on a court when it was full as that, it gives you
a buzz,'' Henman said. ``I think I've shown in the past and I've
shown again that I do respond to that.''
	   Henman described Monday's win as ``one of the best, if not the
best'' victory of his career. With so much focus on the England
soccer team's progress at the World Cup, he said he felt less
pressure than ever before.
	   ``I do feel very, very relaxed about the whole situation,''
Henman said. ``I surprised myself a little bit, how relaxed I was
today.''
	   Henman next faces No. 3 Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion
who downed John van Lottum in straight sets. Korda strained his
left Achilles tendon in the third set but said he plans to play
Wednesday.
	   ``If it's going to be nice weather, I'll be there,'' he said.
	   Based on the weather so far, that's no certainty. Monday was the
fifth day affected by rain delays.
	   Henman, who beat Korda in their last meeting in Key Biscayne
this spring, said the left-handed Czech is ``probably one of the
most dangerous players'' in the draw.
	   ``He can hit winners from all over the court,'' Henman said.
	   The same goes for Goran Ivanisevic, who served 44 aces in his
third-round win over Daniel Vacek.
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, came into this year's
tournament as a forgotten man after a terrible slump that saw him
win only one match in his last five Grand Slams.
	   But the 14th-seed Croatian, scheduled to face Todd Martin in the
fourth round, believes he may be on the verge of a breakthrough
victory in a major.
	   ``It was not easy for me, all this talking, `He's gone, and he's
never going to be back again,''' Ivanisevic said. ``But every time
when I am on that court, I know I can beat anybody. My matches are
like horror thrillers. You cannot expect anything. I made the
movie, but I don't know the end.''
	   In women's play, the quarterfinalists in the bottom half of the
draw were set Monday when No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 6 Monica
Seles, No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva all advanced in
straight sets.
	   Seles will face Zvereva, while Davenport will play Tauziat.
	   Tuesday had been projected as the day for a fourth-round
showdown between Venus Williams and her 16-year-old sister Serena.
	   But Serena, citing a strained left calf muscle, retired from her
match Monday against Ruano-Pascual while trailing 7-5, 4-1.

points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,858.3 in the early afternoon.

Cossacks to patrol Petersburg streets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Armed Cossacks will soon patrol the streets of St.
Petersburg on horseback, if local police chief Viktor Vlasov gets
his way.
	   Vlasov plans to hire Cossacks to patrol an uncrowded city
district for a trial period, so he can ``try all forms of law
enforcement,'' the Moscow Times reported Tuesday, citing police
spokeswoman Tatyana Fyodorova.
	   The city will pay the Cossacks and provide them with guns, but
they will have to provide their own horses.
	   St. Petersburg officials said if the Cossacks do effective work,
their patrols may be later spread to other districts.
	   In past centuries the Cossacks received special privileges and a
degree of independence in return for military service. They were
known for their horsemanship and their fierce loyalty to the czar.
	   And it was the Cossacks that the czars sent out decade after
decade to suppress various minorities, including Jews, Tatars and
Chechens, earning the Cossacks a reputation for savagery.
	   Police are not worried about the Cossacks' reputation. ``There
have been no interracial conflicts with the Cossacks who live in
the city and the Leningrad region,'' Fyodorova said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Lothar Matthaeus of Germany keeps setting World Cup
records.
	   On Monday, the 37-year-old utility player took over as all-time
leader in the number of World Cup minutes played with 1,958 _ eight
more than Uwe Seeler, who played 1,950 minutes in 21 matches for
Germany in the 1960s and 1970s.
	   Diego Maradona of Argentina is third, with 1,943 minutes in 21
matches.
	   Starting in Germany's 2-1 second-round victory over Mexico,
Matthaeus increased to 24 matches his record for the most World Cup
games. He had broken the previous record of 21 by playing in
Germany's first-round draw with Yugoslavia. Seeler and Maradona had
shared the previous record with Matthaeus.
	   Matthaeus now has 15 victories, six draws and three losses in
this cup career.
	   He also stands third in the total number of international
matches played with 128. Saudi Arabian goalkeeper Majed Abdullah is
record holder with 147 international matches played, followed by
Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli who played 143.

Former interior minister defends Tehran mayor 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's former interior minister came to the
Teheran mayor's defense Tuesday in the highly publicized corruption
trial that has riveted the nation.
	   Ali Mohammad Besharati testified that Gholamhossein Karbaschi
did a good job as mayor and that he would have fired him had he
thought he was corrupt.
	   ``Not only as an interior minister but also as a citizen I could
see the results in Tehran of the efforts of Mr. Karbaschi. I
supported him by word and deed and if I believed he had any bad
intentions, I would definitely have dismissed him,'' Besharati told
the packed courtroom.
	   Karbaschi has been credited with cleaning up pollution and
beautifying Tehran, a city of 8 million. He has built parks, new
roads, sports and cultural facilities and added a splash of color
to the drab streets.
	   But conservative clerics have complained about the
``corrupting'' influence of films and music at the cultural
centers. And the powerful bazaar merchants say they have been taxed
heavily to pay for city improvements.
	   Many see the case against Karbaschi as an attempt by hard-liners
in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
banishment from public office. The case was adjourned till July 5.
	   Karbaschi was arrested April 4 and released 11 days later on the
orders of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, after the mayor's
supporters took to the streets and clashed with security forces.
	   On Tuesday, Karbaschi denied accusations by Judge Hojatoleslam
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei that he had taken money from city
coffers without documentation.
	   ``Every single rial (Iranian currency) we spent was documented
and the evidence is the Tehran municipality documents you are using
now,'' said the bespectacled, bearded mayor, dapper in a dark green
suit and shirt.
	   It was the fourth session of Karbaschi's trial.
	   As in previous trials, Karbaschi sparred with the judge for
interrupting him and for quoting from confessions extracted from
municipality officials while they were in prison.
	   ``I do not accept any statements extracted by torture in
prison,'' he said before a gallery of 130 people and dozens of
journalists.

Arafat: U.S. requested that Palestinians delay U.N. initiative 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The United States has asked the
Palestinians to postpone for 10 days a U.N. Security Council debate
on Israel's plans to expand Jerusalem, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Tuesday.
	   Arafat did not say whether he agreed.
	   A senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Palestinians would probably agree to postpone
the Jerusalem debate, scheduled for later Tuesday.
	   The Security Council is considering a resolution condemning
Israel's decision to extend municipal services from Jerusalem to
Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
	   The United States had sought to delay the meeting until next
month, saying any council action would hinder U.S. diplomatic
efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Asked about the timing of the debate, Arafat said Tuesday, ``The
U.S. administration had asked me to delay for 10 days, until they
return from China.'' U.S. President Bill Clinton is on a trip to
China.
	   The future of Jerusalem is the most explosive issue on the
Israeli-Palestinian agenda. The Palestinians hope to establish a
capital in eastern Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of the
city. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to
keep building in the disputed sector and threw his support behind
Jewish settlers buying homes in the city's Arab neighborhoods.

Saudis rehire German coach to lead soccer squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Saudis have reverted to one of their
former coaches for the national football team: Otto Pfister of
Germany.
	   An official of Saudi Football Federation said Tuesday that
Pfister had been appointed to replace Carlos Alberto Parriera of
Brazil, who was sacked after the Saudis' poor performance in the
World Cup. The team was eliminated after Denmark beat it 1-0 and
France 4-0 in the first round.
	   Pfister, 51, who took Saudi Arabia to the second round in the
1994 World Cup, is currently training the Saudi under-16 team in
Slovakia for next week's World Youth Games in Moscow, the Saudi
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Starting mid-August, Pfister will train the Saudi national squad
for the Arab Cup in September in Doha, Qatar, the official said. He
will continue to serve as coach for the under-16 team.
	   The official declined to say how much Pfister will be paid.
	   The Saudi national team has gone through eight coaches in three
years.

Four people found dead in north Amsterdam home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Alerted by neighbors, police found
the bodies of four people in a home in north Amsterdam Tuesday.
	   Police spokesman Klaas Wilting declined to disclose the cause of
death, only to say the victims died between 10 and 14 days ago.
	   The identities of the 29-year-old mother, her two sons ages 8
and 2, and her 27-year-old boyfriend, were not disclosed in line
with Dutch police practice.
	   Police visited the apartment after the family's neighbors
downstairs noticed strange marks on their ceiling, said police
spokeswoman Annemiek Meijer. She declined to elaborate.
	   Police were conducting door-to-door interviews in the
neighborhood north of Amsterdam's center.
	   Neighbors were stunned by the deaths since there were no signs
of unusual activities in the family, Dutch TV reported.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Boeing 737-700 belonging to Norwegian
airline Braathens SAFE suffered engine failure during a flight due
to a possible production fault, the airline said Tuesday.
	   One of the two engines on the 11-week-old plane stopped during a
flight Friday from Trondheim to Oslo, the airline said. The plane
can safely fly on one engine and there no injuries among the 42
passengers and five crew members, the airline said.
	   Airline spokeswoman Anne Grete Ellingsen said a transmission
gear in the aircraft's CFM56-7 engine lost a tooth during the
flight, apparently due to a manufacturing flaw. She said repairs
are likely to be completed on Wednesday, and that the problem had
been reported to Boeing and Norwegian aviation authorities.
	   Ellingsen said a Russian-operated aircraft with a CFM56-7 engine
had suffered a similar problem in Moscow on Friday, but that she
had no details.

U.N. nuclear watchdog holds talks with Iraqis in Baghdad 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A team of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency held talks with the Iraqi government Tuesday
in a bid to fill the gaps in the country's nuclear file, a senior
U.N. disarmament official said Tuesday.
	   Garry Dellon of Britain and two colleagues discussed
``outstanding issues according to the IAEA report'' with Iraqi
officials, Nils Carlstrom told The Associated Press. He declined
further comment on the talks.
	   A report by the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog of the United
Nations, gave Iraq an almost clean bill of health in April, saying
it found no evidence of any activity prohibited by the U.N.
sanctions imposed on the country after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   But the agency said Iraq needed to provide more documents to
complete the picture of its past nuclear activities.
	   Dellon, who arrived with his colleagues Monday for a week-long
visit, runs the Iraqi desk at the agency's Vienna headquarters,
which oversees the scrapping of Iraq's nuclear program in
accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   In a related development, Carlstrom said U.N. disarmament
experts were arriving in large numbers in Iraq in a bid to follow
through on a June 14 agreement between the United Nations and Iraq
to try to resolve as many of the remaining questions as possible
within two months.
	   The Security Council has said sanctions will not be lifted until
Iraq proves it has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction
and long-range missiles.

Japan's justice minister confirms last week's executions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Justice Minister Kokichi Shimoinaba went further
than any of his predecessors Tuesday in discussing specific
executions in Japan, where hangings are kept secret even from the
condemned prisoner's family.
	   News media reported last week that three convicted murderers
were hanged on Thursday in Japan's first executions in nearly a
year.
	   While declining to say how many convicts were executed, or
where, Shimoinaba did confirm that hangings were carried out.
	   ``I understand that there are various opinions concerning the
execution, but it (execution order) is a very heavy responsibility
for the justice minister,'' Shimoinaba said at a news conference.
	   ``I had repeatedly contemplated the case before signing'' the
order, he added.
	   Shimoinaba was the first justice minister to discuss his
feelings on signing an execution order, said Kazuhiko Nambu, a
spokesman for the Justice Ministry.
	   Shimoinaba's predecessor, Isao Matsuura, was the first justice
minister to officially admit signing an execution order, but he
declined to discuss the matter further, Nambu added.
	   Nambu said the ministry will announce once a year the number of
convicts executed in the past year. He said four were executed in
1997.
	   Japan now has executed 28 criminals since 1993, when the death
penalty was resumed after more than three years of suspension, the
earlier media reports said, citing informed sources that they did
not name.
	   Akira Ishikawa, a spokesman for the human rights group Amnesty
International, which opposes the death penalty, said that after the
three executions last week, 51 convicts remain on death rows in
Japan.
	   Although executions in Japan are never publicly announced,
relatives and lawyers can learn of them later as the Justice
Ministry usually asks the relatives to take the ashes or the
convict's belongings, Ishikawa said.
	   Shimoinaba reiterated the ministry's longstanding position
Tuesday, saying, ``I think the execution should not be announced to
the public, considering the families of the convicts as well as
those of the victims and people who may be concerned with the
case.''
	   A 1994 government survey found 73.8 percent of those responding
favored retaining the death penalty, the highest percentage since
such surveys began in 1956.
	   Amnesty International, however, has argued that ``the death
penalty system in Japan is extremely cruel. Prisoners are held in
prolonged solitary confinement for years on end with little
opportunity for contact with anyone except prison guards.
Executions are carried out without the knowledge of families or
lawyers and apparently in an arbitrary fashion.''

Policeman survives hand-grenade attack unscathed

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A policeman escaped injury when a
hand grenade thrown at him exploded some three meters (yards) away,
the CTK news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The agency said the incident occurred Monday shortly before
midnight in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague.
Two policemen had stopped to check a parked car after hearing cries
for help from within from a man bound with chains.
	   One of three men standing by the car tried to escape and a
policeman started chasing him, Brno police director Jaroslav
Prikryl was quoted as saying. The suspect threw a hand grenade at
the officer, which exploded some three meters (yards) away but left
him unhurt.
	   The policeman then shot and wounded the suspect. He and the two
others were detained moments later, said Prkryl.
	   The suspects, as well as the chained man, have so far refused to
speak to police, CTK said.

Spanish prime minister: peace process is running out of time

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a veiled criticism of Israel,
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Tuesday that
Mideast peace negotiators are running out of time.
	   ``I believe the coming weeks are important,'' Aznar told a joint
news conference with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
``Time needs to be used wisely because time is limited.''
	   The United States is waiting for a long-overdue Israeli reply to
a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank. The Palestinians agreed to the proposal, first
introduced in January, several weeks ago.
	   Aznar recalled a visit to Gaza three years ago, at a time when
he was opposition leader.
	   Hope filled the air then, Aznar said. ``Now we are going through
difficult times concerning the peace process, but we must continue
to have the will to go forward,'' Aznar said.
	   In 1991, Spain hosted a Middle East conference that opened the
door to Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria
and Jordan.
	   Aznar and Arafat met for 30 minutes before being joint by aides.
Aznar spent two days in Israel before visiting the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat praised the Spanish government for aid it has provided to
the Palestinian Authority. ``I would like to point out Spain's help
regarding Gaza airport, its role was important,'' Arafat said.
	   Spain funded the electronic security fence around the airport
building and other equipment.

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ A Pakistani shell exploded near an Indian
army helipad in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir on
Tuesday, as residents who fled Pakistani shelling two days ago were
returning to their homes.
	   No one was injured Tuesday, but three people were killed in
Sunday's shelling, which reflected continuing tensions in the
territory claimed by both India and Pakistan.
	   Pakistan says at least 26 civilians have been killed by Indian
shells in the past week. India says Pakistan fired the first shots.
	   In addition to the deaths, five people were injured Sunday when
mortar shells exploded in the northern town of Cargill and two
border villages in the northwestern districts of Baramullah and
Kuphwara, army and police officials said.
	   Indian soldiers retaliated with gunfire after the shelling began
Sunday in Cargill, a town of 10,000 people north of Jammu, the
winter capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state. Most of Cargill's
residents returned home Tuesday, officials said.
	   The helipad targeted Tuesday is near Cargill.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, whose
population is mostly Muslim. Hindus form 82 percent of India's
nearly 1 billion population.
	   India accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of training and arming
Muslim militants in its share of Kashmir. Pakistan says it provides
only moral support.
	   Two-thirds of Kashmir is controlled by India and the rest by
Pakistan. Both nations claim all of the territory.
	   Hostilities between the two neighbors increased after both
tested nuclear weapons this spring.

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebellious military
leaders have demanded that Senegal and Republic of Guinea, fighting
in support of President Joao Bernardo Vieira, withdraw all troops
before further peace talks can occur.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a ceasefire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers, rebel officials said.
	   Planned peace talks due to involve a government delegation and
rebel leaders were called off Tuesday according to press reports in
Portugal, the former colonial ruler of this tiny West African
country. The reports were not immediately confirmed.
	   The talks had been jeopardized by heavy artillery fire in the
capital late Monday afternoon.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes, the rebel spokesman, asked Portuguese
ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva to press the government to
stop the attacks.
	   ``If one of ours dies, you can be sure we'll retaliate,''
Fernandes told da Silva in a phone call cited by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   The government has offered a pardon to rebel soldiers who lay
down their arms and a life in exile to the officers who
masterminded the uprising that began on June 7.
	   The coup attempt staged by former army chief of staff Brig.
Ansumane Mane has degenerated into near civil war in around the
capital and some nearby towns.
	   Rebel-controlled Radio Bombolon on Tuesday said Mane's forces
would only consider a cease-fire when Senegal's more than 1,500
troops withdraw from Guinea-Bissau.
	   Over the weekend, Senegal sent additional troops to Bissau, the
capital, to counter growing support for the rebel movement.
	   Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira
and Mane.
	   In the countryside, more and more former guerrilla rebels from
Guinea-Bissau's 1960s and '70s independence war against Portugal
have been re-arming and coming out in favor of Mane's uprising.
	   A growing number of people in the countryside support the
rebel's claim that Vieira's government was riddled with corruption.
	   Fighting, meanwhile, continued with an early morning volley of
artillery fire Tuesday near Bissau, which is largely abandoned
after the vast majority of the city's 300,000 people fled.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's internally displaced population
_ many of whom have moved to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata
and Canchungo _ are putting enormous pressure on food reserves.
	   The World Food Program on Monday said Bafata's population of
160,000 people has doubled, while rice stocks have dwindled with
only a few days remaining.

Mandela reunited with 96-year-old woman who aided anti-apartheid plotters

<TEXT>
	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Forty years after he plotted the
overthrow of white rule while drinking tea in her house, President
Nelson Mandela paid homage Tuesday to Augusta Lollan, now 96 years
old.
	   ``She may not have hit the headlines but she was one of the
persons in those most difficult days who ... was in the
forefront,'' said Mandela, draping an arm over Lollan's stooped
shoulders.
	   The reunion underscored the fact that the African National
Congress activists who fought apartheid through civil disobedience
and guerrilla tactics are retiring or dying, passing the mantle to
a younger generation. Mandela, 79, is retiring and will likely be
succeeded by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 56, after next year's
elections.
	   Mandela and other ANC militants, including Lollan's son Stanley,
had planned ANC policies and actions in her home in Soweto, the
sprawling black township near Johannesburg. Police often invaded
her house, searching for evidence.

dimmed with age, downplayed her role in the meetings where she had
served tea, but was obviously proud the activists had used her
home.
	   ``I paid no attention,'' she told reporters. ``I didn't realize
what they were doing _ but that's where all the conniving was going
on.''
	   Mandela was convicted of treason a few years later and spent 27
years in prison. Freed in 1990, he became president in the nation's
first all-race elections four years later.
	   ``I think of the old days when I see you,'' Mandela reminisced
with Lollan, calling that period ``the darkest days in our history
when we were not human beings, when we had no dignity in our own
country.''
	   Lollan no longer sees well enough to recognize Mandela, but said
``his voice is still the same.''

U.N. nuclear watchdog holds talks with Iraqis in Baghdad 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A team of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency held talks with the Iraqi government Tuesday
in a bid to fill the gaps in the country's nuclear file, a senior
U.N. disarmament official said Tuesday.
	   Garry Dellon of Britain and two colleagues discussed
``outstanding issues according to the IAEA report'' with Iraqi
officials, Nils Carlstrom told The Associated Press. He declined
further comment on the talks.
	   A report by the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog of the United
Nations, gave Iraq an almost clean bill of health in April, saying
it found no evidence of any activity prohibited under the U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   But the agency said Iraq needed to provide more documents to
complete the picture of its past nuclear activities.
	   Dellon, who arrived with his colleagues Monday for a week-long
visit, runs the Iraqi desk at the agency's Vienna headquarters,
which oversees the scrapping of Iraq's nuclear program in
accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   In a related development, Carlstrom said U.N. disarmament
experts were arriving in large numbers in Iraq in a bid to follow
through on a June 14 agreement between the United Nations and Iraq
to try to resolve as many of the remaining questions as possible
within two months.
	   The Security Council has said sanctions will not be lifted until
Iraq proves it has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction
and long-range missiles.

Frenchman shot dead in dispute with security guards

Eds: ADDS victim's surname in 2nd graf, suspect uncaught in last
graf
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Frenchman employed by a local
investment firm was shot and killed after accusing the company's
security guards of sloppy work habits and challenging them to a
fight, police said Tuesday.
	   The man, identified as ``Tony,'' 35, headed the security detail
of the Power Investment Group, said Mak Chito, head of the police
division in charge of foreigners. A company employee said the dead
man's surname was Giacobelli.
	   Mak Chito said the victim had an argument with the three
Cambodian guards and accused them of being late and skipping work.
He apparently challenged them to a fight and closed the compound
gate to prevent them from leaving.
	   Sok Padana, 25, a police officer moonlighting as a security
guard, shot him three times, Mak Chito said. The other guards took
the man to a hospital, where he died.
	   Sok Padana fled after the shooting, and no arrests have yet been
made.

Poland's largest commercial bank listed on Warsaw's stock exchange 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In Poland's biggest privatization to date,
Grupa Pekao SA, the country's largest commercial bank, made a
successful debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange Tuesday, indicating
strong investor interest in the banking sector.
	   The Treasury Ministry sold 15 percent of Pekao's dlrs 1.8
billion in stock in three heavily oversubscribed tranches for
domestic retail investors, domestic institutions and foreign
institutions.
	   The debut price was fixed at 55 zloty (dlrs 16), a gain of 22
percent over the subscription price, exceeding analysts'
expectations of about 50 zloty (dlrs 14).
	   Much of the demand came from one institution _ Poland's Bank
Handlowy SA, which said it wants to take a controlling stake in
Pekao. Handlowy indicated it plans to buy another 35 percent of
Pekao's equity when it goes on sale in the fall.
	   But observers say a Pekao-Handlowy partnership, though a giant
by Polish standards, would not supply new capital and much-needed
international know-how once the country's bank sector is opened to
European Union competition.
	   Pekao's market capitalization of 7.57 billion zloty (dlrs 2.1
billion) makes it by far the largest company listed on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange.

With non-royal trains and smaller planes, royals economize: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The queen's husband and sister use senior
citizens' rail passes, and Prince Charles recouped from insurance
some of the cost of flying to Paris to bring back Princess Diana's
body, Buckingham Palace's first report on royal travel costs
released Tuesday said.
	   Overall, Queen Elizabeth II's family saved a total of 2 million
pounds (dlrs 3.3 million) on travel _ what with being deprived of
the royal yacht, Britannia, cutbacks on the use of the royal train,
and flying in smaller royal planes, the report by a royal
accountant, Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Michael Peat, said.
	   ``I hope that we've set a new standard in clear and detailed
disclosure that others in the private and public sectors might
follow,'' Sir Michael noted crisply.
	   The economies were set out as part of a general attempt by the
British royals to acquire an approachable image and be more open
since the death of Diana in a Paris car crash underlined the huge
popularity of her warm, relaxed style.
	   In fact, Sir Michael reported, the royal didn't even spend all
the 19.4 million pounds (dlrs 32.2 million) of state funds
allocated for their travel in the year ending March 31. They got
around between unveiling plaques on new buildings, launching ships,
visiting old age home's and attending a total of 1,200 functions
for just 17.3 million pounds (dlrs 28.7 million).
	   For example, Princess Margaret, 67, the queen's sister, not only
made a 60-mile (100 km) trip from London to Brighton to open a
youth club by regular train. She took advantage of a concession _
known in Britain as an Old Age Pensioner's pass _ to make the July
8 round trip for 22.60 pounds (dlrs 37.50). The regular price is
41.20 pounds (dlrs 68.40).
	   Prince Philip, 78, went to Cambridge _ he holds the honorary
post of Chancellor of the university _ on Sept. 28 using the same
concessions for a cutprice 44.40 (dlrs 73.70).
	   The report did not disclose how much Charles reclaimed from
Diana's insurance when he flew from Aberdeen, near Balmoral, the
royal estate in Scotland, on Aug. 31 to bring home her body.
	   The 72-year-old queen, however, does not claim concessions for
the elderly, the report said _ although she did take a regular
train to visit her 97-year-old mother in hospital.
	   The big savings, the report said, were in more economical use of
a Royal Air Force planes charged with transporting the royals,
government ministers and other VIPs. This included using smaller
aircraft.
	   ``These are savings in terms of making money work harder rather
than cutting back on standards and quality,'' said Sir Michael.
	   Spending on the Royal Train was reduced by 700,000 pounds (dlrs
1.2 million ) from the allocated budget of 1.85 million pounds
(dlrs 3.1 million). And Sir Michael said it might get even cheaper
by reducing the number of cars.
	   Anothe report released Tuesday on the costs of keeping up the
royal palaces showed savings of 3.2 million pounds (dlrs 5.3
million) last year, and down 43 percent since 1991.

Euro label to help shoppers cope with currency change 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Organizations representing shopkeepers
and consumers across Europe agreed Tuesday on a code of conduct
designed to help shoppers cope with the switch to a common European
currency.
	   The agreement foresees the creation of a ``euro label'' which
businesses can stick in their shop windows if they respect rules
aiming to ease the transition to the euro.
	   Eleven nations will start phasing the new European money on Jan.
1, when non-cash transactions in euros will begin. Euro notes and
coins won't finally replace local monies until 2002.
	   To get the ``euro label'' during the transition, business must
display prices both in euros and the local currency. Prices in
euro's must be calculated according to European Union rules and
customers must be informed if they can already pay in euros with
their checks and credit cards.
	   No additional charges may be passed on to customers paying in
euros; information on paying in euro's must be displayed; and staff
must be trained to explain the use of the euro.
	   The European association of wholesale and retail traders,
EuroCommerce, stressed individual businesses could decide if they
wanted to sign up to the code, but once in they would have to
respect the rules.
	   ``Consumers will be able to identify traders who have accepted
the code of conduct,'' EuroCommerce President Igino Sogaro, told
reporters after signing the agreement.
	   ``If anyone breaks the rules, the label will be withdrawn.''

Crown prince meets with visiting Jordanian minister 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah
arrived here Tuesday met Tuesday with Jordan's planning minister
amid talk of reconciliation between the two countries.
	   Rima Khalaf delivered a letter to Sheik Saad from his Jordanian
counterpart, Prince al-Hassan bin Talal, the Kuwait News Agency
said. The contents of the letter were not disclosed.
	   Khalaf, here to meet with officials of the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development, is the first Jordanian cabinet
minister to visit Kuwait following the Gulf war.
	   Ties between Kuwait and Jordan soured during the Gulf crisis
because of Amman's perceived tilt toward Iraq that invaded Kuwait
in 1990 and occupied it for seven months before its troops were
evicted by a U.S.-led coalition.
	   Relations began warming up slowly in 1995 when Jordan distanced
itself from Baghdad and called for political change in Iraq.
	   Khalaf is expected to sign loan agreements with the Kuwait-based
Arab fund to finance health, transportation and agricultural
projects in Jordan.
	   Jordanian members of Parliament have said Jordan is interested
in a reconciliation with Kuwait to guarantee that financial aid
from this oil-rich state would flow to Amman again.
	   KUNA said Khalaf also met with her Kuwaiti counterpart, Ali
al-Moussa, and Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah. It
said the two planning ministers ``explored the horizons of
cooperation,'' between the two countries.

World Cup: France vs. Italy is neighborly battle between slew of teammates 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Instead of the Stade de France,
Friday's quarterfinal between Italy and France might as well be
played on a cozy piazza somewhere in northern Italy. Many players
are there much of the time anyway.
	   Just about every player will be facing a friend, or a club
teammate, current or former, when the two neighboring countries
face off. Even their team color is identical _ Les Bleus vs. the
Azzurri.
	   Like migrant laborers, the French have flocked to Italy's Serie
A over the past 15 years, slowly acquiring the skills, poise and
winner's mentality that has marked the classic Italian player.
	   For every Alessandro del Piero, there is a Zinedine Zidane. For
every Paolo Maldini, there is a Marcel Desailly.
	   ``It will be a game between Italians and those playing there,''
said French captain Didier Deschamps, who played for four years
with Italian champion Juventus Turin.
	   Zidane is Juventus' star playmaker and has underlined time and
again how Italy has toughened up his game.
	   ``It's an advantage to have our players there,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet.
	   The great Michel Platini was France's first major success in
Italy and the playmaker who led Juventus to the 1985 European
Champions Cup.
	   ``Italy has contributed a lot. It has made us stronger,'' said
Deschamps.
	   Marco Simone is Italy's top export to France but the Paris
Saint-Germain striker failed to make it on the Azzurri squad.
Marseille's Fabrizio Ravanelli had to pull out of the World Cup
because of illness.
	   ``French players who come to the Serie A improve their technical
skills and overall play. So this is their advantage,'' said Parma's
Enrico Chiesa, who has France's Lilian Thuram and Alain Boghossian
as teammates.
	   Such closeness can prove a special motivator. ``I'll have to do
everything possible to win, otherwise I'll have to listen to their
taunts at Juventus all year,'' said Deschamps a teammate of Del
Piero, Gianluca Pessotto, Filippo Inzaghi and Angelo Di Livio.
	   Youri Djorkaeff knows all about goalie Gianluca Pagliuca at
Inter Milan, and during the World Cup they have been in steady
phone contact, although that might change over the next few days.
	   ``He scored against me in an exhibition match last year,'' said
Pagliuca. ``So I told him 'enough is enough'.''
	   It's pretty clear there are no secrets between the national
teams this way, in a match that in some ways will resemble a top
Serie A game _ disciplined, with special care for defense and
counting on that individual burst of class to make the difference.
	   ``We have very good information on them,'' said French defender
Laurent Blanc.
	   ``By winning we want to show how much we owe them,'' said
Deschamps.

Eds: Updates with Venus Williams' and Sanchez Vicario victories;
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams powered into the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday by trouncing the player who knocked
her sister out the tournament a day earlier.
	   Volleying with authority for the first time and showing an
all-court game which could make her a real title threat, Williams
needed just 62 minutes to beat Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1.
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals were defending champion
Martina Hingis, last year's runnerup Jana Novotna and French Open
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 and No. 5
Sanchez Vicario rallied for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dominique Van
Roost.
	   Williams will face Novotna in the quarters, while Hingis will
play Sanchez Vicario.
	   On Monday, the prospect of a fourth-round meeting between Venus
and her sister was dashed when 16-year-old Serena Williams failed
to get past Ruano-Pascual. Citing a calf injury, Serena quit the
third-round match while trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   Venus avenged that result by overwhelming the 47th-ranked
Spaniard with her best performance so far, mixing big serves and
groundstrokes with lobs, drop shots and winning volleys.
	   In previous matches, Williams had been reluctant to go to net, a
tactic that many believe she needs to master in order to win on
grass.
	   But on Tuesday she was an imposing force at the net, taking full
advantage of her height _ 6-foot-1 1/2 height (1.86 meters) _ and
long arms. She attacked on every short ball and won more than 20
points at the net.
	   The match ended, fittingly, with Williams coming in behind a
serve return and punching a forehand volley which Ruano-Pascual
could barely reach.
	   While Serena had neglected to shake hands with the Spaniard
after quitting Monday's match, Venus stood at the net and exchanged
handshakes.
	   Hingis got off to a slow start, losing serve in the first game
and struggling to find her rhythm. But she won the next four games
and breezed to victory over her 42nd-ranked opponent.
	   ``I had a little bit of a problem at the beginning to get into
it,'' Hingis said. ``The second set was much better. I was always
more aggressive and controlling the games and the points.''
	   Hingis said she may have been affected by the 11 a.m. start.
	   ``Everything was kind of very fast in the morning,'' she said.
``I was still sleeping in practice.''
	   Tournament officials scheduled early matches in order to clear
up a backlog caused by so many rain delays. The sun was out Tuesday
and there was only a small chance of showers.
	   In men's play, defending champino Pete Sampras was scheduled to
face French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean in a fourth-round match.
Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was due to face
Wayne Ferreira for a place in the quarters.
	   For the third straight year, Tim Henman has reached the
quarterfinals, raising Britain's hopes of having its first male
champion since 1936.
	   Feeding off the frenzied support of the Centre Court crowd, the
12th-seeded Henman downed U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter of
Australia 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``To walk out on a court when it was full as that, it gives you
a buzz,'' Henman said. ``I think I've shown in the past and I've
shown again that I do respond to that.''
	   Henman described Monday's win as ``one of the best, if not the
best'' victory of his career. With so much focus on the England
soccer team's progress at the World Cup, he said he felt less
pressure than ever before.
	   ``I do feel very, very relaxed about the whole situation,''
Henman said. ``I surprised myself a little bit, how relaxed I was
today.''
	   Henman next faces No. 3 Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion
who downed John van Lottum in straight sets. Korda strained his
left Achilles tendon in the third set but said he plans to play
Wednesday.
	   ``If it's going to be nice weather, I'll be there,'' he said.
	   Based on the weather so far, that's no certainty. Monday was the
fifth day affected by rain delays.
	   Henman, who beat Korda in their last meeting in Key Biscayne
this spring, said the left-handed Czech is ``probably one of the
most dangerous players'' in the draw.
	   ``He can hit winners from all over the court,'' Henman said.
	   The same goes for Goran Ivanisevic, who served 44 aces in his
third-round win over Daniel Vacek.
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, came into this year's
tournament as a forgotten man after a terrible slump that saw him
win only one match in his last five Grand Slams.
	   But the 14th-seed Croatian, scheduled to face Todd Martin in the
fourth round, believes he may be on the verge of a breakthrough
victory in a major.
	   ``It was not easy for me, all this talking, `He's gone, and he's
never going to be back again,''' Ivanisevic said. ``But every time
when I am on that court, I know I can beat anybody. My matches are
like horror thrillers. You cannot expect anything. I made the
movie, but I don't know the end.''
	   In women's play, the quarterfinalists in the bottom half of the
draw were set Monday when No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 6 Monica
Seles, No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva all advanced in
straight sets.
	   Seles will face Zvereva, while Davenport will play Tauziat.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah met
Tuesday with Jordan's planning minister amid talk of reconciliation
between the two countries.
	   Rima Khalaf delivered a letter to Sheik Saad from his Jordanian
counterpart, Prince al-Hassan bin Talal, the Kuwait News Agency
said. The contents of the letter were not disclosed.
	   Khalaf, here to meet with officials of the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development, is the first Jordanian cabinet
minister to visit Kuwait following the Gulf war.
	   Ties between Kuwait and Jordan soured during the Gulf crisis
because of Amman's perceived tilt toward Iraq that invaded Kuwait
in 1990 and occupied it for seven months before its troops were
evicted by a U.S.-led coalition.
	   Relations began warming up slowly in 1995 when Jordan distanced
itself from Baghdad and called for political change in Iraq.
	   Khalaf is expected to sign loan agreements with the Kuwait-based
Arab fund to finance health, transportation and agricultural
projects in Jordan.
	   Kuwaiti members of Parliament have complained that Jordan's
moves toward reconciliation is aimed at receiving Kuwaiti financial
aid.
	   KUNA said Khalaf also met with her Kuwaiti counterpart, Ali
al-Moussa, and Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah. It
said the two planning ministers ``explored the horizons of
cooperation,'' between the two countries.

Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow complains about human rights abuses 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainians say they have been abused by
police in Russia and their government has demanded an
investigation.
	   A complaint was filed by the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Viktor Hahaychuk said Tuesday.
	   Tens of thousands of unemployed Ukrainians have migrated to
neighboring Russia in recent years in search of jobs. Many live
illegally in Moscow, building homes for wealthy Russians.
	   Some have complained to Ukrainian newspapers of being treated
badly or even beaten by Moscow police after losing or being unable
to produce identification papers required to live in the Russian
capital.
	   Ukrainian authorities are demanding that prosecutors in Moscow
investigate the complaints.
	   Human rights activists long have criticized Moscow's residency
registration system but Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has defended it, saying
visitors are responsible for much of the city's crime.

Amnesty International says war crimes being committed in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ War crimes are being committed in Kosovo, and each
day greater numbers of civilians are falling victim to
displacement, torture and death, Amnesty International said
Tuesday.
	   The vast majority of victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the population of the Serbian province, but Serbs are
also suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence, the international human rights organization
said.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' it said. ``Albanian civilians in particular have
come under artillery, mortar and other weapons fire from the
Yugoslav forces, but the Kosovo Liberation Army has also
deliberately or indiscriminately attacked civilians _ Albanian as
well as Serb.''
	   Clashes between Serbian government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement, have left more than 300 people dead and an unknown number
of others wounded and missing.
	   Some 70,000 people have fled their homes _ about 45,000 to other
parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to neighboring Montenegro, and another
13,000 to northern Albania, Amnesty International said.
	   ``Survivors are fleeing a combination of deliberate or
indiscriminate attacks resulting in many dead and wounded,
arbitrary arrests or abductions, the deliberate destruction of
homes and other gross human rights abuses,'' it said.
	   Amnesty International's Secretary General Pierre Sane told a
news conference that ``war crimes are being committed in Kosovo
today.''
	   ``Only the high level of scrutiny given by the international
media ... has prevented the number of people displaced, missing,
tortured or killed from escalating much farther,'' he said.
	   Sane urged the international community to recognize Kosovo ``as
a human rights crisis ... not simply a threat to regional
security.'' And he said ``only when a comprehensive human rights
agenda is put in place can Kosovo's crisis begin to be resolved.''
	   Earlier this month, the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating
human rights violations in Yugoslavia announced that it was sending
investigators to Kosovo.
	   Paul Miller, an Amnesty International researcher who returned
from Kosovo on Sunday, cited a number of incidents where there may
have been ``grave breaches'' of international law.
	   These included the killing of some 50 Albanians, including women
and children, by excessive Serb force in the village of Prekazin
March; the May 25 shooting of where five ethnic Albanian men in the
village of Ljubinic; and the disappearance of nine men from Poklek
who were taken into custody by Serb forces on May 31.
	   But Miller said it has been difficult to determine who among the
250 ethnic Albanians and 50 Serbs had been unlawfully killed, and
so far no suspected perpetrators of war crimes have been
identified.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The United States has asked the
Palestinians to postpone for 10 days a U.N. Security Council debate
on Israel's plans to expand Jerusalem, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Tuesday.
	   Arafat did not say whether he accepted the U.S. request.
	   Later Tuesday, the Security Council was to begin considering a
resolution that would condemn Israel's decision to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
	   The debate will likely begin Tuesday, as planned, but a vote
will not be taken until U.S. President Bill Clinton returns from
his nine-day trip to China, said Assad Abdel Rahman, a member of
the PLO Executive Committee.

a fairer share of the country's wealth during his administration,
despite the economic slowdown caused by Asia's currency crisis.
	   ``The common people have waited long enough for their turn,'' he
said in his inaugural speech. ``That day is here.''
	   Estrada, a former B-movie star who campaigned on a pro-poor
platform, took his oath earlier in the day as the country's 13th
president at Barasoain Church, where Emilio Aguinaldo, the first
president, was also proclaimed.
	   Estrada also attempted in his speech to defuse the angry
reaction to his earlier decision to permit the burial of former
dictator Ferdinand Marcos at a heroes' cemetery, saying he had been
impatient to ``put yesterday behind us so we can work for a
brighter tomorrow.''
	   The bitter reaction forced Estrada, a former Marcos supporter,
to reverse his decision last week.
	   Estrada said his administration will focus on helping the
country's many poor and will do its best to ``put a roof over their
heads, food on their tables and clothes on their backs.''
	   But he warned that the region's economic problems mean ``the
good times are gone'' and that the government's resources are
limited.
	   What wealth is generated, however, ``will be more equitably
shared,'' he pledged.
	   Estrada also promised to crack down on corruption and crime.
	   The Philippines has weathered Asia's currency crisis better than
many other countries in the region, in large part because of
economic reforms introduced by outgoing President Fidel Ramos. But
in recent months, economic growth has slowed, while inflation,
unemployment and the budget deficit have climbed.
	   Estrada ``knows that the expectations of the Filipino masses who
voted for him are great, but also that the capacity of the
Philippine government to meet those expectations is low,'' said
Randy David, a professor of sociology at the University of the
Philippines. ``It's not going to be very easy for him to deliver.''
	   Estrada's speech at an outdoor grandstand near Manila Bay was
followed by fireworks and free food, including more than 3,000
roast pigs and 21,000 chickens donated by El Shaddai, a Catholic
group.
	   The new president, a college dropout with a swagger and bouffant
hairstyle, gained a devoted following among the country's poor
during several decades as an actor in B movies, playing tough guys
who stood up against injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   He won the May 11 presidential polls by one of the largest
margins ever in a free Philippine election. The polls were also
among the Philippines' most peaceful, although at least 45 people
were killed.
	   Many in the traditional Philippine elite have looked askance at
Estrada, considering him an undereducated buffoon with little
ability to lead the country's economy through the murky waters of
Asia's devastating currency crisis.
	   Estrada freely admits little proficiency in economics and says
he will depend on a stable of 30 economic advisers who range from
leftist academics to conservative bankers.
	   He also openly acknowledges a history of womanizing, heavy
drinking and gambling, but insists he now has given up all vices _
including cigarette smoking, which he quit several weeks ago.
	   His landslide victory prompted many to predict a long political
``honeymoon.'' But in addition to the dispute over Marcos' burial,
Estrada has taken on much of the Philippine Congress with a pledge
to eliminate ``pork barrel'' funds often misused by congressmen.
	   And Estrada faces a revolt from the popular head of the Subic
Bay special economic zone, who refuses to step down after being
fired by the new president over personal differences.

World Cup: Brazilian captain to end national team career after Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ If Brazilians needed any extra
motivation to win the World Cup, they'd do it for Dunga.
	   The 34-year-old captain quietly announced he would retire from
the national team after the Cup, although he will still play for
his club, Jubilo Iwata of Japan.
	   ``These are my last three games for the 'selection','' Dunga
said as the team prepared to face Denmark in the quarterfinals.
	   His count is based on the assumption that Brazil will get by
Denmark. Once in the semifinals, the team at worst will play for
third place. But the worst isn't in his plans.
	   ``Our team is a killer,'' he said. ``But we must fight, take
every opponent seriously, forget the score.''
	   Dunga is the heart of the defending champions. His bullying,
badgering, on-field manner isn't always pleasant for his teammates,
but they know he gives his utmost for the team.
	   In the match against Chile, a vicious tackle opened a gash on
his leg that took six stitches to close, but Dunga didn't even slow
down until he was ordered off for treatment.
	   ``When I'm wearing the jersey of the selection, I don't feel
pain,'' he said. ``You can kick me, I feel nothing. My leg was full
of blood, and I didn't even notice. I only realized it when the
referee stopped the game to send me off.''
	   If his teammates questioned his drill-sergeant tactics, it took
just one game to realize how much they depend on him.
	   Criticized after a heated on-field argument with Bebeto, Dunga
was subdued in the next game against Norway. After Brazil lost 2-1,
the team as one came to ask for their old leader back.
	   ``Dunga has something special, that natural dynamism that is
super important for us,'' said Leonardo.
	   After the Bebeto incident, an Internet survey asked whether
Dunga should still be a starter on the Brazilian team. Fully 95
percent of respondents said ``yes.''
	   ``Dunga is very important because of the vision he has of the
game,'' said Rivaldo. ``He pushes us at the right moment.''
	   It all comes naturally to Dunga, the descendant of German
immigrants to the ``gaucho'' region of far southern Brazil.
	   ``That's the only way I know how to play,'' he said. ``I felt
bad when I shouted at Bebeto. I think I went too far. But when I
see something wrong, I can't overlook it. On the field I'm crazy
for the selection. I want to win always.''
	   It's been same the wherever he played, in Brazil, Germany, Italy
and Japan. On the national team, Dunga embodied the spirit
Brazilians call the ``fatherland in cleats.''
	   In three World Cups, he became a symbol of the best and the
worst of the team. In 1990, his bulldog style was ridiculed as
artless and ugly. Four years later, when the team won a fourth Cup
title, Brazilians saluted his courage and leadership.
	   Now, he just wants one more chance.
	   ``In soccer, what remains is the last moment,'' he said.
``People generally forget what you did before.''
	   What's difficult is imagining Brazilian soccer in the post-Dunga
era. He has left his imprint on the team, and an example to follow.
	   ``I always gave the maximum of myself,'' Dunga said, running his
hand over his buzz-cut in a reflective moment. Then he paused. This
was about more than soccer.
	   ``I took the love of my country to the world,'' he said. ``I
tried to show that Brazil is not just a Third World country. It has
extraordinary riches. I just hope I left something positive.''

World Cup: Tired Germans get day off, optimistic about quarters 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ After a light workout in the morning, the
weary warriors of Berti Vogts got a day off Tuesday to refresh
their aging bodies from the exertions of a come-from-behind victory
over Mexico.
	   The Germans may be getting on in years, but after their 2-1
triumph Monday it's on to the quarterfinals of the World Cup for a
meeting with either Romania or Croatia on Saturday in Lyon. The
players' average age is just under 30.
	   ``We did it with German virtues,'' Vogts said after the game
that was decided on Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 86th minute.
``We fought our way back into the game.''
	   Mexico took the lead less than two minutes into the second half
on Luis Hernandez' fourth goal of the tournament. But captain
Juergen Klinsmann equalized for Germany in the 75th.
	   Klinsmann and Bierhoff are carrying Germany with three goals
apiece, combining for six of Germany's total of eight.
	   ``They have to be used even more,'' Vogts said. ``Our forwards
are working a lot when we don't have possession.''
	   ``I am not happy with our play on the flanks. We have to work on
them more, practice them. Or we should perhaps give them up
altogether. I hope they'll learn them some time,'' Vogts said.
	   Ever since arriving at the World Cup, the Germans have been
practicing hard on crosses. Vogts himself has said that each
players must have hit at least 1,000 crosses in training.
	   But in games, few crosses are accurate enough to reach the
danger area. Luckily for Germany, Klinsmann and Bierhoff need few
chances to score and will use any opening they can find.
	   ``I should have scored in the first half, when I hit the bar,''
Bierhoff said. ``But I think I score more off difficult situations
than simple ones.''
	   ``I would have preferred, though, that we had made sure of
victory earlier in the game,'' said Bierhoff, who now has 20 goals
in 30 games for Germany. His ``golden goal'' in 1996 gave Germany
the European title.
	   Klinsmann, with 11 goals in three World Cups and 16 games, is
second on the all-time German list, behind Gerd Mueller's 14 goals
in 13 World Cup games. Mueller scored a total of 68 goals for
Germany in 62 games. Klinsmann shares second place with Rudi
Voeller with 47.
	   The 11 goals make Klinsmann equal with Sandor Koscis of Hungary.
Mueller tops the all-time World Cup list, Just Fontaine of France
has 13 and Pele has 12.
	   ``I was hoping that I would have a possibility to score,''
Klinsmann said. ``You always hope.''
	   Central defender Juergen Kohler, who missed the game because of
a strained calf muscle, will be fit for Saturday. Midfielder Thomas
Helmer also will be fit after receiving a knock in his shins.
	   The Germans had a little scare after the game in Montpellier,
when the special Air France plane carrying them back to Nice had to
abort its first takeoff because of unexplained mechanical problems,
team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said. The second takeoff went
without problems.

After riots, thousands protest Arabic-only law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIZI-OUZOU, Algeria (AP) _ Several thousand people marched
against Algeria's Arabic-only law Tuesday in the country's ethnic
Berber capital that has been the scene of several days of rioting.
	   Police reported no incidents during the rally in the city 100
kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, shaken by unrest after Muslim
militants assassinated the region's popular singer Lounes Matoub
last week.
	   Four people died in violence which raged in several of the
region's cities inhabited by Berbers, a Muslim people with their
own language. Matoub was an outspoken defender of Berber culture.
	   The language law, due to come into effect Sunday, would
effectively ban from official use other languages including Berber,
also known as Tamazight, and French, which is widely used in this
former French colony.
	   Many see the Arabic-only law as an effort by the military-backed
government to appease supporters of Islamic movements in a
6-year-old insurgency that has left more than 75,000 people dead.
	   Tizi-Ouzou was in a shambles, with most of its traffic lights,
street lamps and bus stops damaged. Rioters also burned a cinema,
state department stores, state banks and Air Algerie, among other
offices.
	   After the death of Matoub, mourners chanted, ``We are not
Arabs!'' and carried portraits of the singer and signs reading,
``No peace without the Berber language.''
	   The Muslim insurgency began after the government canceled
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was tipped to win the balloting from voter anger
over high unemployment and corruption in this petroleum-rich North
African nation.

Romanian, Azerbaijani presidents discuss transport cooperation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Presidents Geidar Aliev of Azerbaijan and Emil
Constantinescu of Romania discussed prospects for a new
transportation route along the legendary Silk Road between Europe
and Central Asia during a meeting Tuesday.
	   Energy cooperation was also raised during Constantinescu's visit
to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Azerbaijan's Turan news agency
reported. Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil reserves are believed to be
the world's richest, after the Middle East.
	   Constantinescu and Aliev signed agreements on bilateral
relations, transport cooperation, and cooperation between state-run
news agencies, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
	   Azerbaijan and Romania have long been planning to create a trade
and transportation route between Europe and Central Asia, to go
across the Black and Caspian Seas and through the Caucasus
Mountains.
	   The route would cover part of the ancient Silk Road _ a passage
that for centuries connected China and Europe, allowing mutual
trade and bringing power and prosperity to many cities along the
way.

Ugandan army rescues 45 people abducted by rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ At least 45 people escaped their rebel
captors during heavy clashes with the army, including 29
schoolgirls who were rescued by soldiers, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Another three Ugandan children kidnapped by the rebel Lord's
Resistance Army and taken to Sudan were released to Uganda by the
Sudanese government, the state-run New Vision newspaper said.
	   UNICEF estimates the LRA has abducted 3,000 to 6,000 children to
use as fighters, porters or sex slaves in its 12-year insurgency.
Others have put the figure at 10,000.
	   Many are taken to southern Sudan, where they are held at Ugandan
rebel bases with the tolerance of Khartoum, which is fighting its
own rebels.
	   The 45 abductees escaped Sunday following heavy fighting in
which four LRA rebels were killed west of Kitgum town, about 335
kilometers (210 miles) north of the capital Kampala, military
spokesman Gen. Caleb Akandwanaho told New Vision.
	   Among them were 29 schoolgirls, aged 13 to 15, who were part of
40 taken by the LRA during a raid June 20 on their school dormitory
in Kitgum. Eight escaped the following day.
	   Military sources told the newspaper the rebels had planned to
take the girls to Sudan, where three abducted boys were released by
the Sudanese government earlier this month.
	   The boys, aged 15 to 17, were handed over to the U.N. refugee
agency on June 19, two days after a U.N. envoy visiting Khartoum
urged the government to use its influence over the LRA to free
abducted schoolchildren, New Vision said.
	   U.N. representatives in Kampala said the children would not give
any details about their abductions, it said. They said the boys
would receive three months of counseling before they were sent
home.

Amnesty International says war crimes being committed in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Edits graf 12 to eliminate extraneous words
By EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ War crimes are being committed in Kosovo, and each
day greater numbers of civilians are falling victim to
displacement, torture and death, Amnesty International said
Tuesday.
	   The vast majority of victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the population of the Serbian province, but Serbs are
also suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence, the international human rights organization
said.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' it said. ``Albanian civilians in particular have
come under artillery, mortar and other weapons fire from the
Yugoslav forces, but the Kosovo Liberation Army has also
deliberately or indiscriminately attacked civilians _ Albanian as
well as Serb.''
	   Clashes between Serbian government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement, have left more than 300 people dead and an unknown number
of others wounded and missing.
	   Some 70,000 people have fled their homes _ about 45,000 to other
parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to neighboring Montenegro, and another
13,000 to northern Albania, Amnesty International said.
	   ``Survivors are fleeing a combination of deliberate or
indiscriminate attacks resulting in many dead and wounded,
arbitrary arrests or abductions, the deliberate destruction of
homes and other gross human rights abuses,'' it said.
	   Amnesty International's Secretary General Pierre Sane told a
news conference that ``war crimes are being committed in Kosovo
today.''
	   ``Only the high level of scrutiny given by the international
media ... has prevented the number of people displaced, missing,
tortured or killed from escalating much farther,'' he said.
	   Sane urged the international community to recognize Kosovo ``as
a human rights crisis ... not simply a threat to regional
security.'' And he said ``only when a comprehensive human rights
agenda is put in place can Kosovo's crisis begin to be resolved.''
	   Earlier this month, the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating
human rights violations in Yugoslavia announced that it was sending
investigators to Kosovo.
	   Paul Miller, an Amnesty International researcher who returned
from Kosovo on Sunday, cited a number of incidents where there may
have been ``grave breaches'' of international law.
	   These included the killing of some 50 Albanians, including women
and children, by excessive Serb force in the village of Prekaz in
March; the May 25 shooting of five ethnic Albanian men in the
village of Ljubinic; and the disappearance of nine men from Poklek
who were taken into custody by Serb forces on May 31.
	   But Miller said it has been difficult to determine who among the
250 ethnic Albanians and 50 Serbs had been unlawfully killed, and
so far no suspected perpetrators of war crimes have been
identified.

Argentine president signs agreements in Armenia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Argentina wants closer cooperation with
Armenia because it is home to one of the world's largest group of
Armenian emigres, Argentina's president said Tuesday.
	   More than 100,000 Armenians live in Argentina, President Carlos
Menem said.
	   Menem and Armenian President Robert Kocharyan signed agreements
on science, health services, and visa-free travel between the two
countries during the Argentine leader's visit, which ends Tuesday
night.
	   It was the first state visit of an Argentine president to
Armenia.
	   The two presidents also agreed to use atomic energy only for
peaceful purposes.
	   They also discussed problems in Nagorno-Karabakh, a pocket of
Azerbaijan that is populated largely by ethnic Armenians. It
declared independence in 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops out with
Armenian help.

General put on reserve to train Greeks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The army general coaching Romania's
national soccer team has been made a reservist to permit him to
leave the country and train the Greek national soccer team, the
daily Libertatea reported Tuesday.
	   Earlier this year, Brig. Gen. Anghel Iordanescu signed a
two-year contract with the Hellenic Football Association to qualify
its national team for the European Championships in 2000.
	   Greece will pay Iordanescu dlrs 800,000 for the two years,
starting in this August. The Romanian Football Federation currently
pays Iordanescu dlrs 100,000 a year.
	   Iordanescu is the only Romanian officer to have made general
solely from training the national team. As an active officer, he
would not have been permitted to leave the country to train another
team.
	   Iordanescu was made brigadier general after the 1994 World Cup,
when Romania got to the quarterfinals, its best result in World Cup
history.
	   If Romania gets to the semifinals this year, Iordanescu might be
promoted to major general, Defense Minister Victor Babiuc told
reporters.

Chechen police to launch crackdown on crime wave rejected, official says Chechnya cannot be considered for U.N.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov called for
police to get tougher on criminals to stem a wave of crime in the
breakaway republic, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   ``We cannot put up with such things any longer,'' Maskhadov said
in a televised speech Monday night, ITAR-Tass said.
	   ``People are tired of bandits and have lost any hope of
protection from authorities,'' said Maskhadov, who was wearing his
military uniform in public for the first time since he became
president in 1997.
	   He vowed that ``criminals will be wiped out of Chechen soil.''
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its war for
independence from Russia two years ago.
	   Criminal groups are holding an estimated 40 people in the
republic, including Russia's envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov.
Two Britons, two Hungarians, a Frenchman and a Turk are also known
to be in captivity.
	   The wife of French hostage Vincent Cochetel, an official of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, was in Moscow on Tuesday to
appeal for her husband's release. Cochetel has been held since
January, but his captors have not made any demands for his release,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maskhadov's speech was followed by a spate of arrests _ part of
a curfew imposed last week when Maskhadov announced a state of
emergency in the republic, according to ITAR-Tass. Most of those
arrested were later released, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maskhadov denied that the state of emergency was a political
move to prevent a military coup. ``Such rumors are specially spread
by enemies of Chechen independence,'' he said.
	   A delegation from the Chechen parliament met with Russian
lawmakers in Moscow on Tuesday and asked that relations with
Chechnya be upgraded to an interparliamentary level.
	   Their request was denied, and the delegation was told it would
be treated as colleagues from a legislative body subject to the
Russian Federation, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said a Chechen application
to join the United Nations would be rejected.
	   ``Only internationally recognized states can claim membership in
the U.N., spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news briefing.
``Chechnya cannot be regarded as such because it is an integral
part of Russia,'' he said.

U.N. refugee agency gets involved in Thai border camps 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency is considering how best it
can help in refugee camps on Thailand's border with Myanmar,
formerly Burma, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Thailand last week requested the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees for the first time to become formally involved in the
camps, spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   The camps hold some 100,000 refugees, mostly from ethnic
minorities, fleeing military campaigns by Myanmar's government
against ethnic rebel armies.
	   UNHCR is discussing with the Thai government ``what exactly they
expect us to do and what we can do for them to help looking after
the Myanmar refugees,'' Janowski said.
	   ``We've had so far only sporadic access to the camps,'' run by a
government organization called the Burma Border Commission, he
added.
	   Thailand has been accused of keeping some camps closed to
outsiders and reports have occasionally emerged of refugees being
abused.
	   The camps have also been attacked frequently by rebel groups
inside Myanmar allied to that country's military government.
	   UNHCR officials said in early June after meeting with senior
government officials that they were hopeful of receiving approval
to have a higher presence in the camps.

French policeman in coma showing signs of improvement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French policeman in a coma since being
attacked by German soccer hooligans after a June 17 World Cup match
is showing signs of improvement, doctors said Tuesday.
	   Doctors treating Daniel Nivel, 44, said he was reacting to
stimulation. They said there were signs he was gradually coming out
of the coma, although they stressed his condition was still
critical.
	   A hospital statement said Nivel's condition was ``neurologically
satisfactory,'' and that he was suffering from ``cranial
traumatism.''
	   Nivel was hit on the head with an iron bar minutes after a World
Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when groups of neo-Nazis
rampaged through Lens, a town in northern France.
	   Two Germans have been placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
that has erupted in several French cities hosting the five-week
soccer championship that began June 10. More than 200 people have
been arrested.

Six drown in suspected clandestine crossing to Spain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ Coast guards pulled six bodies out of the
sea off the coast of the north African Spanish enclave of Ceuta on
Tuesday, authorities said
	   The six men were probably would-be immigrants who drowned while
making the dangerous crossing from neighboring Morocco to mainland
Spain, Interior Ministry spokesman Ricardo Franca said.
	   Franca stressed that an attempted clandestine sea crossing was
only a first hypothesis. Coast guards had not located either the
boat that the six are thought to have been traveling in, or any
other survivors of a shipwreck, he said.
	   Every year thousands of people fleeing poverty and unemployment
in north Africa make the overnight sea journey to southern Spain in
makeshift boats. The Strait of Gibraltar separating Morocco from
Spain is as narrow as 12 miles (20 kilometers) in some places.
	   Coast guards from the southern province of Cadiz, where most of
the immigrants are heading, arrested 691 would-be immigrants from
January to June 28.
	   They were arrested as their boats approached the shore or soon
after they reached land.
	   Authorities are expecting an increase in the number of crossings
with improved summer weather. Over 100 people were intercepted by
Cadiz coast guards last weekend alone.

Former deputy PM and son declared bankrupt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A former Malaysian deputy prime
minister and his son were declared bankrupt by the High Court
Tuesday after failing to settle a 2 million ringgit (dlrs 500,000)
debt owed to a local businessman.
	   Abdul Ghafar Baba, 73, failed to pay 500,000 ringgit (dlrs
125,000) to Choong Kok Min, the director of a publicly listed
company, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   His son, Mohd. Tamrin, was also declared bankrupt after he
failed to repay Choong 1.5 million ringgit (dlrs 375,000).
	   In a rags-to-riches story, Ghafar, 73, rose from humble
beginnings as a golf caddy to become deputy premier after he won
the 1987 general elections as the running mate of Malaysia's
current prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Ghafar's descent into insolvency came after his son's company
failed to settle an outstanding loan with Citibank. The bank then
sued Ghafar, Tamrin and Choong, who were all guarantors of that
loan.
	   Choong ended up settling the entire amount. He later filed
bankruptcy proceedings against Ghafar and his son after they
refused to pay back the amount owed him, the state news agency
reported.

South African gov't completes computerized database for 1999 elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The Independent Electoral
Commission has completed a computerised geographic and population
database which will help define voting districts for next year's
general election.
	   ``What has been achieved here has no peer,'' Jim, a consultant
from Australia, proudly told reporters at Tuesday's unveiling of
the IEC's new geographical information system.
	   Deputy chief electoral officer Norman du Plessis said the 60
million rand (dlrs 10 million) system was being used to divide the
country into 12,000 voting districts on an apolitical basis for the
1999 general election.
	   Du Plessis said the IEC was about halfway through delimiting
voting districts and should complete the process in July.
	   Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom said delimiting voting
districts on a statistical instead of political basis would help
ensure the legitimacy of the elections.
	   Voter registration is scheduled to start in mid-October.
	   President Nelson Mandela, who is retiring, will call for the
elections later this year and set the date. With Mandela's African
National Congress almost certain to capture a majority of votes,
his heir apparent is Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is also
president of the ANC.

Rubber bullets injure dozens as workers protest in Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with violent protest in West Java
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and soldiers, firing rubber
bullets, wounded dozens of steel factory workers Tuesday as
thousands staged a violent protest to demand better pay and social
welfare.
	   ``We had to fire the rubber bullets as they attacked us with
rocks and concrete bricks,'' said an officer at a military post in
Bekasi, just east of Java. ``They even wanted to burn a movie
house.''
	   The state-run TVRI television station reported that 104 people
were arrested for interrogation, and at least 26 workers were
injured.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced an average 15 percent
increase in regional minimum wages, putting the monthly salaries
between 130,000 and 198,500 rupiah (dlrs 8.60 and dlrs 13.20).
	   The workers at the PT. Gunung Garuda steel factory were unaware
of the order. Company officials could not be reached immediately
for comment on current pay and working conditions.
	   But the military officer said all 2,100 employees of the factory
went on a rampage to protest low salaries and adverse conditions.
	   A number of security personnel were injured, including three who
were treated at a hospital, added the officer, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity,
	   It was the second consecutive day of protests by the workers.
	   Also Tuesday, about 2,000 workers of P.T. Tyfontex, a textile
company in the Central Java town of Sukoharjo, about 520 kilometers
(325 miles) east of Jakarta, staged a similar protest. They
demanded higher salaries and better social welfare, police said.
	   One officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the workers
planned to march 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the nearby city of
Solo. There were no reports of trouble.
	   Antara reported that about 6,000 workers at the factory went on
strike Monday.
	   About 3,000 students and other youths demonstrated Tuesday at
the local council building in Maumere, a town on Flores Island in
East Nusatenggara province, demanding total political and economic
reform.
	   On Sunday, police opened fire on a mob looting a timber
warehouse. One man was killed and the slaying triggered a riot in
the town of Blora, about 550 kilometers (340 kilometers) east of
Jakarta, the Antara news agency reported.
	   Indonesia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis
in 30 years and has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Unemployment is rising dramatically. Prices of basic foodstuffs
are soaring. The official inflation rate is now running at 46
percent and is expected to exceed 80 percent by the end of the
year.
	   Some fear that economic hardship and growing poverty might
trigger civil unrest in the wake of riots last month that resulted
in as many as 1,200 deaths.
	   The violence helped force former President Suharto to quit,
ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   New President B.J. Habibie struck a deal last week with the
International Monetary fund to restart a dlrs 43 billion bailout
for the battered economy.

Shanghai to build dlrs 200 million science museum 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Shanghai unveiled plans Tuesday for a new
dlrs 200 million science museum to complement a series of urban
projects that have given the city a new art museum and opera house.
	   The museum, due to open in 2001, will include exhibits ranging
from natural sciences to high technology, Mayor Xu Kuangdi
announced at a reception at the Shanghai Museum for U.S. President
Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
	   ``It's to tell the world that Shanghai is a center for science
and technology,'' said Harold L. Adams, chairman of RTKL Associates
Inc., a Baltimore, Maryland, architecture firm chosen to design the
museum.
	   Shanghai is engaged in an urban renovation of immense scale,
including a new financial center, dozens of new buildings and
multibillion-dollar freeway and subway projects. The Shanghai
Museum, with an extensive collection of Chinese art donated by
wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong and abroad, is regarded as the
nation's best.
	   The new museum, called Shanghai Scienceland, is to be built in
Pudong, the area across the Huangpu River from downtown where the
city is developing a new business district, Adams said.
	   A model that he displayed showed a spiral, steel-and-glass
building.

	   armed groups from four towns around Quimbele, 400 kilometers
(250 miles), northeast of the capital Luanda, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported, citing an unidentified Angolan army official.
	   The report didn't say how many troops were involved nor whether
there were any casualties.
	   United Nations staff based around Quimbele have been withdrawing
from the
	   area due to the danger of attacks by bandits, Lusa reported.
	   UNITA demobilized its 70,000-strong guerilla army following the
U.N.-brokered 1994 peace pact with the government which ended two
decades of civil war. However, the government claims that UNITA is
keeping some troops hidden in the bush.
	   Unidentified gangs of bandits have in recent months launched
attacks in rural areas of the huge southwest African nation.

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The widow of the United
Nations envoy to Angola who died in a plane crash last week stopped
over here Tuesday
	   en route to his funeral in Mali.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye and seven others died when their small
charter plane
	   crashed near Abidjan international airport on Friday.
	   Beye, a respected diplomat from Mali who brokered Angola's 1994
peace pact to end a two-decade civil war, wasto be buried Tuesday
afternoon in the Malian capital, Bamako.
	   His widow, Kadiatou, was accompanied by Angola's Minister for
the Territory, Faustino Muteka, and other Angolan and U.N.
officials.
	   She was met at the airport by President Miguel Trovoada who
described Beye's death as ``a bitter blow'' to efforts to implement
the peace accord in
	   the face of lingering hostility between the Angolan government
and former rebels.
	   ------
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Togo's Prime Minister Kwassi Klutse has
appealed to opposition forces to stop protesting against the
country's proclaimed election winner, President Gnassigbe Eyadema.
	   Klutse called on opposition parties Monday to ``remain calm in
this fragile period and desist demonstrations which threaten peace
and stability in our country.''
	   The capital of this tiny French-speaking West African country
was calm early Tuesday following a week of demonstrations and
reprisals by security forces against opposition leaders.
	   On Friday, security officers burned the offices of Togo's main
opposition
	   leader, Gilchrist Eyadema, and attacked aides.
	   Eyadema's party proclaimed him the winner of June 21 elections.
Earlier, the country's top electoral officer had resigned.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Authorities have a deported a U.S.
businessman after accusing him of collaborating with the former
military regime which was ousted in March, local newspapers
reported.
	   Police commissioner James Kanyako said Roger Crooks was taken
under police escort to the airport Sunday and put on a plane after
a deportation order signed Friday, the Concorde Times reported.
	   Crooks, a long-time resident of Sierra Leone who is from Texas,
has a business empire in this war-torn West African country
spanning from the diamond trade to air and sea travel.
	   He was perhaps best known as owner of the Mammy Yoko _ one of
Sierra Leone's few ritzy hotels before it was looted by rebels
earlier this year.
	   ------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia plans to intensify an AIDS
prevention campaign amid unproven fears the disease is escalating
in the battle-scarred West African country.
	   Only 225 AIDS cases of the disease have been confirmed in
Liberia since 1996, although countless thousands more may be
infected, authorities say.
	   The destruction of Liberia's health infrastructure during the
country's 7-year civil war that ended in 1996 means authorities
have little means of measuring the scale of the disease.
	   Alfred Kollie, director of Liberia's AIDS Control Program, said
health officials were pushing to make education efforts to be
included in official school programs. Health workers were also
being trained to act as counselors in rural villages, Kollie said.
	   ------
	   LILONGWE, Malawi (AP) _ Lawmakers of President Bakili Muluzi's
United Democratic Front have rejected condemnation of Malawian
prison conditions, saying their constituents want criminals
``taught a lesson''.
	   About 200 prisoners reportedly died in custody between January
1996 and September 1997, largely due to disease epidemics
exacerbated by poor hygiene, chronic food shortages and overcrowded
cells.
	   ``Let prisoners die. Why should we give them bread, meat and
milk when people in the village cannot afford them?'' demanded
parliament member Moses Dossi. ``We can't spend money on criminals.
They should be treated as such.''

World Cup: Zidane comes back after 2-game suspension against Italy 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ It's payback time for Zinedine
Zidane.
	   After kicking an opponent to earn a two-match suspension, the
star playmaker said he was confident his teammates would make sure
he would be able to play more World Cup games.
	   They have, and for Friday's quarterfinal against Italy, Zidane
has the pressure of a whole nation on to finally start producing
the goods that will earn the World Cup.
	   ``Now it's all up to me,'' said Zidane.
	   Without ``Zizou,'' as he is known, France struggled long and
hard, unable to crack the Paraguayan defense in a golden-goal, 1-0
win in Sunday's second round. He was the most nervous on the bench
and the happiest of all afterwards.
	   Now, coach Aime Jacquet can go back to his original tactical
plan centered on Zidane. He always said Zidane was the genius
France could not do without if Les Bleus wanted to lift the World
Cup.
	   He can deliver the decisive pass with such apparent ease, and
when necessary, he has come through with the decisive goal too.
	   ``His influence is so important. We expect a lot from him and he
can make the difference,'' said Didier Deschamps, the French
captain who had given Zidane more than an earful after his
expulsion against Saudi Arabia in the second game.
	   He was suspended by FIFA for two games for deliberately planting
his studs in the side of an opponent. At that time France was
already 2-0 up on the way to a 4-0 win.
	   Youri Djorkaeff has tried to take over as the offensive
mastermind and even though he has not failed, he hardly replaced
Zidane. Too often the center of midfield left an empty hole.
	   Italy knows the danger that is coming.
	   ``He's one of the strongest world players. We must try to limit
his imagination,'' said Italy's veteran defender Alessandro
Costacurta.
	   And Zidane will be more than eager and more than rested.
	   ``On the bench, it was impossible to hold him down,'' said
Jacquet.

New chief: European Central Bank must be above national interests

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The European Central Bank must stay
above national interests and speak with ``one voice'' when setting
monetary policy, its chief told European leaders at the bank's
inaugural ceremony Tuesday.
	   Addressing dignitaries including Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Prime Minister Tony Blair, ECB head Wim Duisenberg also said that
while the central bank cannot fight high joblessness across Europe,
its monetary policies eventually could help sustain growth and
employment.
	   In the meantime, he said, the bank's mandate is to maintain
price stability ``without prejudice to that of supporting the
economic policies'' of the 11 countries participating in a common
currency.
	   The ECB, which started its work earlier this month, also will
oversee the launch of the euro on Jan. 1. And a key question has
been whether the Frankfurt-based central bank can stay independent,
given competing national interests.
	   EU Commission President Jacques Santer said the bank would
succeed as long as Europeans are convinced that the ECB is managing
the euro as a shared asset.
	   Kohl, addressing the audience at the Frankfurt Opera House,
assured that the ECB's governing council would uphold the bank's
independence. ``This is the best guarantee for a stable and secure
euro,'' he said.
	   Although reiterating that Britain will not take part the euro
launch, Blair said his country's six-month presidency of the
European Union has marked a ``sea change'' in the British approach
to Europe.
	   Britain has grown from ``self-imposed isolation to full-hearted
cooperation,'' he said.
	   Still, the difficulty of forging European unity remains _ as
demonstrated just hours before the inaugural celebration.
	   In a TV interview, Duisenberg reiterated that no deal had been
made for his early departure from the bank's top job, but hinted
that he would not serve his entire eight-year term.
	   Duisenberg's appointment in May followed a bitter fight between
his supporters, led by Germany, and France, which wanted its own
candidate to head the bank.
	   The row ended after French officials said they won a promise
from Duisenberg that he would quit halfway into the term to make
way for the Bank of France governor, Jean-Claude Trichet.
	   Duisenberg insisted that he was named central bank president for
an eight-year term. He also told ZDF he would stay in the job at
least ``until the national currencies have totally disappeared.''
	   That is to happen in 2002, when euro notes and coins are
introduced in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
	   On Jan. 1, the currency union starts with the locking together
of euro nations' exchange rates.
	   Other leaders attending the inaugural ceremonies were Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
Events started with a concert by a choir from Maastricht, the Dutch
city where euro plans were set down on paper in the EU's Maastricht
Treaty in 1992.

Orangemen will face police `for 365 days if necessary' to march 
</HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
major Protestant brotherhood said Tuesday they would stand their
ground ``for 365 days if necessary'' to win the right to march past
a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
	   Opposition to the annual Orange Order march in Portadown, 30
miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast, has triggered violence for the
past two summers.
	   Many fear this time the conflict will undermine April's peace
agreement, which is designed to create a new compromise government
for Northern Ireland. Its main pillar, a 108-seat legislative
Assembly of Catholic and Protestant politicians, convenes Wednesday
with many antagonists in the Portadown dispute sitting on opposite
sides of the room.
	   On Monday a government-appointed Parades Commission ordered that
Portadown's approximately 2,000 Orangemen not take their usual
route down Garvaghy Road, Portadown's main Catholic district, back
into town from their annual service at the rural Drumcree Anglican
church. Police and soldiers will block Orangemen outside the church
if they don't obey.
	   ``Portadown District are prepared to stand at Drumcree for 365
days if necessary for the principle and the right to walk along the
Garvaghy Road back into Portadown,'' said Dennis Watson, an
Assembly member and the senior Orange official in Portadown's
county of Armagh.
	   In 1996, police blocked the parade but after four nights of
Orange protests and Protestant mob mayhem across Northern Ireland
caved in and escorted the Orangemen down Garvaghy Road, sparking
even worse rioting in Catholic areas.
	   In 1997, police blitzed Garvaghy Road before dawn and clubbed
Catholic protesters off the streets to clear the Orangemen's path.
That provoked four nights of rioting in Catholic areas.
	   Robert Saulters, grand master of the 80,000-member Orange Order,
said his organization would not concede any ground this year to
Garvaghy Road protesters, led by former Irish Republican Army
prisoner Breandan MacCionnaith.
	   ``Small, narrow-minded groups within local communities should
not be permitted to control who travels along such roads,''
Saulters said. ``Such segregation did not work in South Africa, nor
did it work in the southern states of America. Such cultural
apartheid cannot be allowed to work in Northern Ireland.''
	   Saulters confirmed that his more than 100 district officers are
already organizing protests across Northern Ireland. In 1996
Orangemen closed major roads, the international airport and the
main harbor in a successful bid to stretch the 13,000-member police
force.
	   Asked if he would guarantee that Orangemen would not become
involved in violence, Saulters said: ``I am asking that there are
no stones, or no fighting on the streets. Guarantee? That is a hard
thing for anyone to do.''
	   Northern Ireland's police commander, Ronnie Flanagan, said last
month he would enforce whatever decision the Parades Commission
made over Portadown. But he has the authority to reverse the ruling
in the interest of public safety.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia plans new laws and other measures to crack
down on religious and political extremism, Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Tuesday.
	   ``I believe it is time to pass from words to deeds,'' Stepashin
said, according to the Interfax news agency. It gave no other
details.
	   Russia has recently experienced an increase in racist attacks by
skinheads, and attacks on synagogues and Jewish cemeteries.
	   The Russian government also complains about the rise in Islamic
fundamentalism, and the radical Wahhabi sect has been blamed for
violence in several parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov agreed Tuesday that
legislation to deal with fascism and extremism was urgently needed.
	   ``We find ourselves unarmed in our own country in the face of
the fascist threat,'' Krasheninnikov said, according to Interfax.
	   More extremists are entering politics, such as the
ultranationalist Russian National Unity paramilitary organization
that plans to run in next year's parliamentary elections.

U.N.'s Annan meets Nigerian leader, pro-democracy activists 
</HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Bidding to bring democracy to an
international pariah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held talks
Tuesday with Nigeria's new military ruler and was due to meet the
country's most prominent prisoner.
	   Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than and hour at the
military leader's state residence in the capital of Abuja.
	   Annan declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, although
a member of his delegation, Ahmad Fawzi, said he had ``frank
discussions'' with the military ruler.
	   The U.N. Secretary General had been granted permission to see
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been
imprisoned since 1995, human rights and government officials said
on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur.
	   David Attah, a spokesman for the military government said Annan
had decided not to speak to journalists until the end of his visit
on Thursday.
	   ``This is to allow the U.N. Secretary General to continue with
his consultations with other segments of society ... and he will be
briefing the press on Thursday after the meetings,'' Attah said.
	   Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku was also due to
meet Abubakar later Tuesday and would be given the chance to speak
to Abiola, human rights activists and government officials said.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, and the Nigerian-born Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995.
	   Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was quickly succeeded
by Abubakar, a career soldier with little political experience.
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation club of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks following the execution.
	   Annan expected to sit down with a wide range of pro-democracy
and opposition activists during his visit, which he said was aimed
at easing Nigeria's transition to democracy and civilian rule while
improving strained international ties with the country.
	   The U.N. leader on Wednesday planned to attend a ``mini
heads-of-state summit'' which was being organized by the Nigerian
government, Fawzi said.
	   It was unclear which leaders had been invited or what was on the
agenda and a Nigerian government spokesman gave no details of the
possible summit.
	   The country's new military leader has raised expectations for
democratic reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners
and suggesting Abiola too may eventually be freed.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams powered into the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday by trouncing the player who knocked
her sister out the tournament a day earlier.
	   Volleying with authority for the first time and showing an
all-court game which could make her a real title threat, Williams
needed just 62 minutes to beat Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1.
	   The prospect of a fourth-round meeting between Venus and her
sister was dashed Monday when 16-year-old Serena Williams failed to
get past Ruano-Pascual. Citing a calf injury, Serena quit the
third-round match while trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   Venus took pleasure in avenging that result.
	   ``I wanted to win every point, all the points that Serena
couldn't win yesterday,'' the 18-year-old American said. ``I didn't
like it when she (Ruano-Pascual) came back to 4-3. That was
negligent on my part. I had to get serious to make sure she didn't
get too many more games.''
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals were defending champion
Martina Hingis, last year's runnerup Jana Novotna and French Open
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 and No. 5
Sanchez Vicario rallied for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dominique Van
Roost.
	   Williams will face Novotna in the quarters, while Hingis will
play Sanchez Vicario.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras was scheduled to
face French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean in a fourth-round match.
Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was due to face
Wayne Ferreira for a place in the quarters.
	   Williams, runner-up at the U.S. Open last year, said Wimbledon
would be the ideal place to win her first Grand Slam title.
	   ``I think there will be many more,'' she said. ``It all starts
right now. ... I'm trying to get as serious as possible. I want to
have every point. The people that win the Slams are the people who
work the hardest.''
	   Williams overwhelmed the 47th-ranked Spaniard with her best
performance so far, mixing big serves and groundstrokes with lobs,
drop shots and winning volleys.
	   ``With every match I'm able to play smarter, able to come in
more, able to serve better,'' she said. ``I'm serving consistently
and that's very important.''
	   In previous matches, Williams had been reluctant to go to net, a
tactic that many believe she needs to master in order to win on
grass.
	   But on Tuesday she was an imposing force at the net, taking full
advantage of her height _ 6-foot-1 1/2 height (1.86 meters) _ and
long arms. She attacked on every short ball and won more than 20
points at the net.
	   The match ended, fittingly, with Williams coming in behind a
serve return and punching a forehand volley which Ruano-Pascual
could barely reach.
	   Williams said she can do better.
	   ``I don't really think I played that well today,'' she said. ``I
tried more things, but i think at certain points, I was a little
inconsistent. I was more diligent in coming in today, actually
attacking.''
	   While Serena had neglected to shake hands with the Spaniard
after quitting Monday's match, Venus stood at the net and exchanged
handshakes.
	   Novotna is a two-time Wimbledon finalist with the most natural
grass-court game in women's tennis. But Williams said she didn't
even know until Tuesday that Novotna was in her half of the draw
and she was cleary not in awe of her next opponent.
	   ``She's a good grass-court player,'' Williams said. ``She played
well last year and is playing well this year, and so am I.''
	   Hingis got off to a slow start, losing serve in the first game
and struggling to find her rhythm. But she won the next four games
and breezed to victory over her 42nd-ranked opponent.
	   ``I had a little bit of a problem at the beginning to get into
it,'' Hingis said. ``The second set was much better. I was always
more aggressive and controlling the games and the points.''
	   Hingis said she may have been affected by the 11 a.m. start.
	   ``Everything was kind of very fast in the morning,'' she said.
``I was still sleeping in practice.''
	   Tournament officials scheduled early matches in order to clear
up a backlog caused by so many rain delays. The sun was out Tuesday
and there was only a small chance of showers.
	   In women's play Monday, the quarterfinalists in the bottom half
of the draw were set when No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 6 Monica
Seles, No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva all advanced in
straight sets. Seles will face Zvereva, while Davenport will play
Tauziat.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Iran, which fought an eight-year
war in the 1980s, are holding talks to boost economic ties, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The Iranian Trade Ministry's undersecretary, Abdulhussein
Wahaji, has met his Iraqi counterpart, Farouk al-Ubeidi, in Baghdad
to explore expanding commercial relations, the agency reported.
	   Iraq has a steady flow of hard cash owing to its oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations. But it has not yet bought goods
officially from Iran since the program began in December 1996.
	   Iranian goods, however, are available in Baghdad shops,
particularly spare-parts, tires, dry batteries and foodstuffs.
Iraqi crude oil and byproducts are said to be smuggled into Iran in
a thriving contraband trade.
	   Iraq is refurbishing the Mundhariya post on the Iranian border
in anticipation of a large-scale exchange of goods and tourists.
	   But progress in improving relations has long been held up by
differences over prisoners of war and missing soldiers from the
1980-88 war.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordanian economy grew by an
unsatisfactory 0.8 percent in 1997 because of economic recession
caused by political uncertainty in the Middle East, the government
said Tuesday.
	   ``We are disappointed with the growth rate because it was much
below our expectations,'' a senior official at the planning
ministry said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Planning Ministry figures show the government had forecast a
growth rate of 2.4 percent in 1997.
	   The growth rate in 1996 was 1 percent.
	   The planning ministry official attributed the decrease to
reduced trade with Iraq and the West Bank.
	   The World Bank's vice president, Kamal Darwish, told reporters
in Amman on Monday that although Jordan had attained financial and
monetary stability, maintained sound reserves and an inflation rate
of 6 percent, it needed to achieve higher growth rates.
	   Darwish urged legislative and administrative reforms to bolster
transparency and reduce red tape in order to improve the Jordan's
investment climate.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Stock Exchange will permit trading in
futures for an experimental period starting in October, the
newspaper Al-Qabas reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper quoted the market's general manager, Hisham
al-Otaibi, as saying futures may be traded through the Kuwait and
Middle East Financial Investment Co..
	   If the six-month trial period proves successful, other
``investment instruments,'' will be considered, al-Otaibi said, .
	   The official did not elaborate, but the government has been
promising to open the exchange to more non-Kuwaitis. Only citizens
and nationals of the Arab Gulf states can trade directly on the
market at present.
	   A spate of unregulated futures trading on an unofficial stock
market in 1982 led to a crash from which it took the economy about
a decade to recover.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The assets of Jordan's treasury have risen
11 percent owing to a growth in deposits in the local currency, an
official said on Tuesday.
	   Saeed Shahin, the treasury's director of foreign exchange, said
the increase to 3.6 billion Jordanian dinars (dlrs 5 billion) was
recorded between January and May, compared with the same period in
1997.
	   He told The Associated Press that many Jordanians were
exchanging their hard currency for dinars because of the high
interest rate offered by local banks.
	   He said Central Bank of Jordan had issued 79 million dinars
(dlrs 111.2 million) in local currency between January and May to
cover for the increased demand for the dinar.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The state-run Nuclear Substances Corp. will
soon begin a second round of prospecting for uranium in the desert,
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   MENA said the search would cover 75 percent of the country in
the next seven years, but prospecting would concentrate in the area
of the southern city of Aswan, the eastern desert, and south Sinai,
where preliminary investigations were promising.
	   Any radioactive material processed from uranium would be used
for peaceful purposes in the fields of scientific research, health
and agriculture, the agency said.
	   MENA said the government would allocate 3 million pounds (dlrs
880,000) to bore holes as deep as 350 meters (385 yards) to measure
radiation levels.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Tourist ministers of the Arab world
wrapped up two days of discussions here by calling for investment
in the old city of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
	   In a statement issued after their meetings, the ministers of the
Arab Tourism Council said such investment would ``support the Arab
presence'' in those places.
	   The old city of Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War. Israel has annexed it, but the Palestinians view
it as an inalienable part of east Jerusalem where they hope to
found the capital of their would-be state. Bethlehem is
administered by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The council also urged Arab states to abandon the system of
requiring visas to be issued in advance and instead to grant
tourist visas on arrival.

World Cup: Johansson promising offensive soccer against Brazil AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   BANDOL, France (AP) _ Four years ago Bo Johansson watched his
native Sweden play defensive soccer and lose 1-0 to Brazil in the
semifinals.
	   Johansson, who coached Silkeborg to the Danish Superliga title
in 1994, promises that Denmark will not adopt the same strategy
against defending champion Brazil in the quarterfinals.
	   ``Brazil will attack _ and we'll try to attack as fast as we
can. That's football,'' Johansson said as Denmark continued
preparations Tuesday for one of the biggest games in its
109-year-old soccer history.
	   The Danes won the 1992 European Championship in Sweden,
upsetting Germany 2-0 in the final, made the second round in the
1986 World Cup in Mexico and reached two Olympic finals _ 1912 in
Stockholm and 1960 in Rome.
	   But reaching the World Cup quarters tops those accomplishments,
they say.
	   ``It's the biggest achievement ever in Danish football,'' said
Brian Laudrup, who scored one of the goals in Sunday's 4-1 rout of
Olympic champion Nigeria in the round of 16 at Saint-Denis.
	   ``We have already made (Danish) football history. No matter what
happens next, we have achieved something big.''
	   Johansson, whose only previous national team coaching experience
was a stint with Iceland, agrees.
	   ``Naturally, this is the biggest thing that ever happened to me
(in soccer),'' he said. ``And playing the world's best team ...
will be fantastic.
	   Like its Scandinavian neighbor Norway, which beat Brazil 2-1 in
the Group A finale and is undefeated in three games with the South
Americans, Denmark has never lost to Brazil.
	   The last match in 1989 ended 4-0. Denmark won the other game
against Brazil 3-2 in 1972.
	   Can Denmark made it three in a row?
	   ``Everything can happen in football, especially at this stage,''
Johansson said. ``I think Brazil has played better and better for
each game. But so have we. It's going to be exciting.''
	   ``They have great individualists, like Nigeria. But contrary to
Nigeria, the Brazilians are a team. The organization is OK. That's
the decisive difference.''
	   Morten Olsen, who captained Denmark to the second round in its
only appearance in the World Cup finals in 1986, also thinks Brazil
can be beaten.
	   ``I believe we have great chances to beat them,'' he said.
``They are easier to play rather than a well-organized European
team which plays more defensively and remains in one bloc. I'd
rather meet Brazil than Italy.''
	   After an unimpressive first-round performance that included a
2-1 loss to host France, Johansson said he had no explanations for
the sudden turnaround against Nigeria when the Danes scored twice
in the first 10 minutes.
	   ``I can't explain why we played so great against Nigeria. It's
something that just happens,'' Johansson said.

Ukrainian farmers demonstrate to demand reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hundreds of Ukrainian farmers demonstrated
Tuesday in front of parliament and the presidential headquarters,
demanding that authorities speed up agricultural reforms.
	   The farmers want to be able to buy and sell land freely and they
want a separate system of government grants set up for farming
needs, said the leader of Ukrainian Farmers' Association, Ivan
Tomich.
	   Despite pressure from international financial organizations,
Ukraine has been slow to move toward land privatization.
Agricultural land remains in state hands, with private farmers
renting plots from Soviet-era collective farms.
	   The nearly 400 protesting farmers also wanted the government to
introduce a single agricultural production tax, the Interfax news
agency said. President Leonid Kuchma unified 10 of the existing 19
agricultural taxes last month.
	   ``The imperfect tax system has led to bankruptcy of 10 percent
of farms in 1997. So far this year, farmers already have to pay 18
million hryvna (dlrs 9 million) in fines,'' he said.

U.S. jet fires on Iraqi installation AP Military Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout
By SUSANNE SCHAFER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 fighter fired a missile at an
Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq Tuesday after
Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes, Pentagon
officials said.
	   The fighter had been accompanying the British Tornadoes
enforcing NATO's no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to base.
	   The Iraqi radar at the site had illuminated the British jets,
signaling an intention to fire, said Pentagon spokesman Col.
Richard Bridges.
	   The incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq at about
0530GMT. The firing of the missile was standard response to Iraq's
locking its radar on any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.
	   No U.S. warplanes were fired upon and there was no immediate
report on whether the missile fired by the F-16 struck its target.
	   ``Coalition aircraft pilots assigned to Joint Task
Force-Southwest Asia received cockpit indications that they were
being targeted by a missile site,'' said Navy Lt. John O'Neal,
spokesman for the U.S. Command, the joint military headquarters
responsible for the Persian Gulf region.
	   ``This is considered an action requiring aggressive defensive
measures.''
	   In London, the British Defense Ministry confirmed the incident.
	   ``The Defense Ministry can confirm that a coalition aircraft
launched a missile at an Iraqi defense system this morning when
that system threatened coalition aircraft on a patrol in the south
no-fly zone,'' a ministry statement said. ``We can confirm that
Royal Air Force Tornadoes were part of the patrol. All aircraft
returned safely.''
	   When enemy radar ``locks on'' or ``paints'' a warplane, air
commanders consider that a precursor to the firing of a
surface-to-air missile. During the seven years that U.S. and allied
warplanes have patrolled southern Iraq, Iraqi air defenses have
periodically been turned on coalition aircraft. Sometimes the
action is so brief that no responsive fire is possible.
	   The F-16 fired a high-speed anti-radiation, or HARM missile.
	   The incident occurred while coalition aircraft were conducting
Operation Southern Watch, the name given to the deny-flight
mission, which dates to the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   All the coalition aircraft returned to their bases in Saudi
Arabia without further incident. Central Command, a Tampa,
Fla.-based headquarters, plans to order an immediate resumption of
the patrols.
	   The F-16 was assigned to the 4404th Air Wing-Provisional, which
has been the main land-based air force operating in southern Iraq.
Navy aircraft also take part in the deny-flight mission.
	   O'Neal said he had no reports of any further hostile activity by
Iraq.
	   The deny-flight operation involves a complex array of tankers,
radar planes, air-to-air fighters and aircraft such as the F-16
which can drop bombs and fire anti-radar missiles.
	   Tensions with Iraq had subsided in recent months, following a
confrontation early this year over Iraqi resistance to U.N. weapons
inspections. The United States sent thousands of extra troops, plus
warplanes and naval power, to the Gulf before U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused the situation in a trip to
Baghdad in February.
	   Just last month President Clinton decided to cut the number of
U.S. forces in the Gulf from about 37,000 to around 20,000, and on
June 4 the Air Force announced it was pulling its F-117 stealth
fighter-bombers out of the Gulf area.
	   Iraq reacted angrily to a report on June 24 by the chief U.N.
weapons inspector that findings by a U.S. Army laboratory showed
``there is no doubt'' that Iraq placed deadly VX nerve gas in
missile warheads.

World Cup: Regions battle for slots at 2002 tournament 
</HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Everyone wants to come to the World Cup party.
Problem is, there aren't enough invitations to go round.
	   With the World Cup in its final stages, regions are battling for
as many berths as possible for their members at the 2002 tournament
in Japan and South Korea, the co-hosts.
	   The case for greater European representation was made last week
by German coach Berti Vogts, who also argued that the World Cup
should revert to the old format of having groups in the second
round.
	   ``European soccer is the winner of this World Cup, while Asia
and Africa are the big losers,'' Vogts said. ``Europe and South
America have confirmed their strengths. FIFA should see how many
European teams qualify for the finals.''
	   FIFA, which has already committed to a field of 32 teams in
2002, is evaluating the performance of the different regions at
this World Cup and will decide by October how many teams each
confederation will send to Japan and South Korea, FIFA spokesman
Keith Cooper said.
	   Despite Vogts' protestations, FIFA seems unlikely to increase
the allocation of the traditional soccer powerhouses of Europe and
South America. FIFA wants to expand the popularity of soccer in
Africa and Asia, while Sepp Blatter won the recent FIFA presidency
on a promise to boost the sport in Africa.
	   ``It is extremely difficult to go back,'' Cooper said Tuesday.
``It's not really foreseeable. Maybe one or two teams didn't quite
come up to the mark at this World Cup, but the number of less
appealing matches has been very low.''
	   With 32 participants, the 1998 World Cup is the largest ever. It
includes a record five teams from Africa and four from Asia. Europe
has 15 places, South America five and Central and North America
three.
	   So far, FIFA is hedging its bets on 2002.
	   ``We need to wait and see who wins this World Cup. Remember,
South America had four of its five representatives in the second
round. Africa only got one of its five as far,'' Cooper said.
	   One of the biggest questions concerns the number of places
allocated to Asia, Cooper said.
	   This year, Asia had an allocation of 3 1-2 places _ three
guaranteed places, and a play off match against Oceania's best
team. Iran beat Australia for the last World Cup berth.
	   By convention the host nation, which qualifies automatically, is
included in the allocation of its region.
	   But Peter Velappan, head of the Asian Football Confederation,
has gone on record as saying that Asia should have 5 1-2 places for
the next World Cup _ its current allocation plus South Korea and
Japan.
	   But the possibility remains that with Japan and South Korea
qualifying as hosts, other Asian nations could be squeezed out in
2002.
	   ``Take away two from the current Asian allocation and that
doesn't leave a lot for the whole of Asia. That's one of the
problems of co-hosting and the Asians are worried about it,''
Cooper said.
	   ``There is also a strong case for Oceania to have a guaranteed
place,'' Cooper added, a move that would reduce further Asia's
allocation at the next World Cup.
	   Meantime, some in Europe want a greater allocation for its
teams.
	   Africa and Asia fought long and hard to increase representation
at the World Cup.
	   But Europe and South America continue to dominate the
competition, while Asia and Africa have registered little
improvement in results since the early 1980s.
	   In 1994, seven European teams plus Brazil reached the last
eight. This time, all eight places will be filled by teams from
soccer's two dominant regions.
	   Meanwhile, FIFA has little sympathy for Vogts' idea of using a
group format in the second round, a system last used in 1982, when
four groups of three teams contested the second round, with the
winner of each going to the semifinals.
	   ``A knockout competition should be a knockout competition as
soon as possible,'' Cooper said. ``Of course it's unreasonable for
teams to lose one game and get a plane back home. Under the present
system all are guaranteed three matches, which seems the right
number of games.''
	   Another round would mean a large number of extra games. When
other competitions, such as the European Champions League, have
added a second round of group games it ``hasn't seemed logical,''
Cooper said.

Police question 31 in slaying of Nepalese lawmaker 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Police detained 31 people for questioning
on Tuesday, a day after unidentified assailants gunned down a
Nepalese lawmaker and his driver near his home in the Nepalese
capital.
	   Mirza Dilshad Beg, a member of the National Democratic Party,
had just gotten out of his car and was walking toward his residence
when gunmen opened fire on Monday evening, said Internal Security
Minister Govindraj Joshi. Joshi said a special unit had been set up
to investigate the case and was questioning 31 people. He gave no
further details.
	   At least two gunmen shot Beg eight times in the back, Joshi
said. His body was found about 40 feet (13 meters) from the car.
The car's engine was still running and its headlights on. Police
said the motive was unclear.
	   Beg served in Nepal's House of Representatives since 1994 and
twice held Cabinet posts.
	   Members of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal said
the internal security minister should step down for failing to
protect a lawmaker. The Communists are the main supporters of the
minority government, headed by the Nepali Congress party, but it
decided against pulling down the government.
	   Nepal has been politically unstable, with five prime ministers
since the 1994 vote left no party with the majority needed to
govern alone. But the uncertainty has rarely erupted into violence
in a country where criminal violence is also uncommon.
	   Surya Bahadur Thapa of the National Democratic Party was toppled
from the prime minister's post in April and replaced by a minority
government led by the Nepali Congress Party.

EU agreement on fuel emissions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union officials Tuesday
hailed an agreement to introduce stricter controls on vehicle fuel
emissions as an important step in the fight against air pollution.
	   ``The auto-oil measures ... will make a positive difference to
the lives of everyone in Europe,'' EU Environment Commissioner Ritt
Bjerregaard said in a statement.
	   ``We shall have cleaner air in our cities.''
	   Environment officials from EU governments and members of the
European Parliament reached an accord late Monday to cut levels of
noxious chemicals such as sulfur, lead and carbon monoxide from
gasoline and diesel.
	   In a statement, the EU's executive Commission said the package
will reduce emissions per vehicle by around 70 percent compared to
current standards.
	   The clean-air package had been deadlocked since February when
the European Parliament voted for clean-air standards much stricter
than those agreed by the 15 EU member nations.
	   A ``conciliation committee'' was set up to bridge the gap
between the EU assembly and the member governments. The agreement
it reached Monday night must be translated into all 11 official EU
languages, after which the 626-member parliament and the member
nations will have six weeks to ratify it.
	   Under the agreement, leaded fuels will be phased out by 2000 and
very low sulfur fuels will become mandatory from 2005. However, EU
nations will be able to seek exemptionss.

Russian cautious about proposal for Mideast conference 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An international conference on Mideast peace
proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not
work unless the deadlock in direct Arab-Israeli talks is broken,
Russian officials said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin also said
Palestinian leaders may interpret Netanyahu's proposal as an
intention to renege on earlier Arab-Israeli agreements, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Russia, as a co-sponsor of the (Mideast peace) process, will
promote this process with due account taken of the opinions of the
direct participants in the settlement,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as
saying.
	   Arab leaders expressed anger at Netanyahu's proposal over the
weekend, accusing him of diverting attention from his failure to
honor promises to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said the conference to discuss Mideast regional
issues _ but not the Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically _ was
intended to complement the bilateral negotiations, not replace
them.

Greenpeace activists halt loading of chemicals at Exxon factory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Greenpeace activists halted the
loading of chemicals at an Exxon factory Tuesday in their campaign
against toys made with polyvinyl chloride, known better as PVC.
	   Twenty-three protesters occupied the loading area at the plant
of Exxon Chemical Holland BV in Rotterdam's harbor, said Greenpeace
International spokeswoman Louisa Colasimone.
	   According to the environmental group, Exxon is the world's
largest producer of phthalates, which are used to made PVC toys
soft and flexible.
	   The group claims that soft PVC can poison children with
hazardous chemicals when they chew or bite on toys.
	   A spokeswoman for Exxon Chemical Holland, which belongs to Exxon
Corp., said the protesters blocked access to delivery trucks, but
it was a peaceful demonstration.
	   Exxon spokeswoman Josefa Terloo said ``there was no antagonism''
between the two sides, adding that police officers were standing
by.
	   Amsterdam-based Greenpeace has been protesting the use of PVC in
children's products, not only because of the possible health risks
but also because of PVC's polluting effects on the environment.
	   Exxon's chemical adviser, Leendert van Dijk, said Greenpeace
findings on PVC were inconclusive. ``There is not enough basis for
a ban on PVC toys,'' he said.

BayStars beat Carp 13-10 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose started an eight-run seventh inning
rally with an RBI double and three teammates then homered as the
Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp 13-10 at Yokohama Tuesday.
	   Akira Etoh accounted for eight of the Carp's runs with three
home runs, and now has 15 homers for the season.
	   Rose, formerly of the California Angels, came to bat with the
BayStars trailing 9-5 in the seventh. His double was followed by a
three-run home run by Takahiro Saeki _ his second homer of the game
_ and two-run shots each by Tatsuya Shindo and Takuro Ishii.
	   For the season, Saeki has three homers, Shindo 10 and Ishii one.
	   The BayStars are two games ahead of the Yomiuri Giants, who lost
8-6 to the Yakult Swallows at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   The Swallows' Takahiro Ikeyama went 3-for-3 and drove in six
runs with two homers _ a grand slam in the fourth and the winning
two-run blast in the seventh. He now has 12 homers.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Alonzo Powell hit a two-run home run in the
seventh inning and the Hanshin Tigers blanked the Chunichi Dragons
2-0.
	   Tetsuro Kawajiri limited the Dragons to three hits over 7 1/3
innings for his sixth victory against two defeats and reliever Ben
Rivera (1-1) yielded no hits over the last 1 2/3 innings for his
13th save.
	   Powell, formerly with the Seattle Mariners, has eight homers.
Rivera formerly played for the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   In the Pacific League, Nigel Wilson drove in the first run in
the first inning with a grounder and Hiroshi Narahara singled home
two runs in the second as the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
blanked the Kintetsu Buffaloes 5-0 at Osaka Dome.
	   Wilson formerly played for the Cleveland Indians.
	   The victory widened the Fighters' lead over the second-place
Buffaloes to three games.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks ended their losing
streak at seven with a 7-3 victory over the Orix BlueWave.
	   The Hawks capitalized on pitcher Edwin Hurtado's error for two
runs in the four-run seventh inning. Hurtado formerly played for
the Seattle Mariners.
	   At Fukui, Domingo Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester
team, hit a one-run double and Norio Takabe singled home the tying
run in the eighth as the Seibu Lions and the Chiba Lotte Marines
tied 5-5 in 12 innings.
	   Under Pacific League rules, no extra innings can start after 12
innings.

Germany pushes for tighter borders to stem flow of illegal aliens 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ East European countries must beef up
their border police to slow an exodus of illegal aliens that is
producing a crime wave in the West, a German official said Tuesday.
	   The comments by Laszlo Felkai, a department head at the Interior
Ministry, came at a special two-day meeting on illegal migration
through southeastern Europe held at Germany's request.
	   ``The change in regimes in Central and Eastern Europe showed
that freedom of travel also has a down side,'' he said.
	   The German Interior Ministry's state secretary, Kurt Schelter,
said Germany is the main target country and ``illegal immigration
goes hand in hand with crime _ drug and arms traffic, organized
prositution, and people smuggling.''
	   ``Two-thirds of all crime by organized criminals in Germany is
committed by foreign gangs; there are 100 nationalities active in
organized crime,'' Schelter said.
	   The participants, representing 30 countries and organizations,
agreed on the need for tighter border controls to the east.
	   ``Transit countries must improve their border policing,''
Schelter said, adding that ``today's transit coutry is tomorrow's
target country.''
	   Some 100,000 illegal aliens entered Germany alone last year.
	   Hungarian border guards apprehended 5,700 illegal aliens
entering Hungary in the first quarter of this year, a 34 percent
increase over the same period last year.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ ``I'm sorry about the horses'' King Juan
Carlos said to the new American Ambassador as they chatted
surrounded by gilded and velvet drapes.
	   The royal beasts had equestrian flu and couldn't pull the
carriages as planned for Tuesday's ceremony in which Ed Romero and
seven other new diplomatic heads presented their credential's to
the Spanish monarch.
	   One by one, the ambassadors entered the parade ground of
Madrid's Royal Palace in a black Rolls Royce accompanied by a
mounted and plumed guard of honor while a military band played the
appropriate national anthem.
	   The ambassadors, introduced into the ornate state room
individually, handed the king, Spanish head of state, a sealed
envelope with their credentials before sitting down to exchange
pleasantries.
	   The King was in full dress uniform with a sky blue sash. All the
ambassadors, except the robed Nigerian Isaac Agboala Aluko-Olukun,
wore white tie and tails.
	   As well as Romero and Aluko-Olukun, the King welcomed Colombian
Luis Fernando Jaramillo, Mexico's Juan Jose Bremer, Japan's
Kiyohito Arafuna, Solvenia's Ciril Stokelj, Bulgaria's Vasilka
Doheva Paplomatas and Costa Rica's Javier Solis.
	   Romero, 64, arrived in Spain Sunday to fill the position left
open by Richard Gardner almost a year ago.
	   A New Mexico businessman, Romero's ancestors arrived in the
Americas from Spain exactly five centuries ago. He still serves as
chief executive officer of Commodore-ASI, an Albuquerque
environmental management company.
	   Romero was sworn in last week for a three-year-term as
ambassador to Spain and the tiny country of Andorra sandwiched
between Spain and France.

World Cup: England legend supports from hospital 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SUFFOLK, England (AP) _ Sir Alf Ramsey was confined to hospital
but he still got his message across to England's World Cup team
before its must-win match against Argentina in France on Tuesday.
	   Ramsey, who steered England to World Cup glory in 1966 and
remains the only English manager to win soccer's most prestigious
trophy, suffered a minor stroke on June 9 and is recovering in
Hospital.
	   The 78-year-old England soccer legend, who is in a
``comfortable'' condition in Ipswich Hospital, Suffolk, sent a good
luck message to the team via hospital officials.
	   Information on Ramsey's condition was released Sunday and the
England squad immediately responded by sending messages for a
speedy recovery.

Crown prince meets with visiting Jordanian minister 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with signing of loan agreement.
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah met
Tuesday with Jordan's planning minister amid talk of reconciliation
between the two countries.
	   Rima Khalaf delivered a letter to Sheik Saad from his Jordanian
counterpart, Prince al-Hassan bin Talal, the Kuwait News Agency
said. The contents of the letter were not disclosed.
	   Khalaf, here to meet with officials of the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development, is the first Jordanian cabinet
minister to visit Kuwait following the Gulf War.
	   She signed an agreement Tuesday with the Kuwait-based fund for a
15-million-dinar (dlrs 49 million) soft loan, KUNA said. The money
will be used to partly finance the building of King Abdullah's
teaching hospital in northern Jordan.
	   She was expected to sign more agreements for loans to finance
transportation and agricultural projects.
	   Ties between Kuwait and Jordan soured during the Gulf crisis
because of Amman's perceived tilt toward Iraq that invaded Kuwait
in 1990 and occupied it for seven months before its troops were
evicted by a U.S.-led coalition.
	   Relations began warming up slowly in 1995 when Jordan distanced
itself from Baghdad and called for political change in Iraq.
	   Kuwaiti members of Parliament have complained that Jordan's
moves toward reconciliation is aimed at receiving Kuwaiti financial
aid.
	   KUNA said Khalaf also met with her Kuwaiti counterpart, Ali
al-Moussa, and Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah. It
said the two planning ministers ``explored the horizons of
cooperation,'' between the two countries.

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services suggesting a presidential statement rather than resolution.

Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with council under way; British ambassador
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Over U.S. objections, the Security Council
began debate Tuesday on Israel's decision to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   Council members were considering a resolution that condemns
Israel for the move and calls on it to stop settlement expansion
because it constitutes ``a major obstacle to peace.''
	   The council was meeting at the request of Arab envoys to the
United Nations.
	   Mindful of U.S. opposition to any resolution, Britain's
ambassador, John Weston, suggested Tuesday the council might
instead adopt a presidential statement. Such a statement wouldn't
carry the same international weight as a resolution.

U.N. refugee agency gets involved in Thai border camps ministry. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS 5th graf to clarify camps run by army and interior
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency is considering how best it
can help in refugee camps on Thailand's border with Myanmar,
formerly Burma, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Thailand last week requested the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees for the first time to become formally involved in the
camps, spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   The camps hold some 100,000 refugees, mostly from ethnic
minorities, fleeing military campaigns by Myanmar's government
against ethnic rebel armies.
	   UNHCR is discussing with the Thai government ``what exactly they
expect us to do and what we can do for them to help looking after
the Myanmar refugees,'' Janowski said.
	   ``We've had so far only sporadic access to the camps,'' run by
the Thai Army and the Interior Ministry, he added.
	   Thailand has been accused of keeping some camps closed to
outsiders and reports have occasionally emerged of refugees being
abused.
	   The camps have also been attacked frequently by rebel groups
inside Myanmar allied to that country's military government.
	   UNHCR officials said in early June after meeting with senior
government officials that they were hopeful of receiving approval
to have a higher presence in the camps.

Report: Sinking Brent Spar would have posed small risk 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giant Shell's original plan to sink the
obsolete Brent Spar platform at sea would have posed little more
environmental risk than the new proposal to cut it into pillars for
a ferry terminal, scientists said Tuesday.
	   Shell was forced to change plans after Greenpeace activists
boarded the Brent Spar three years ago in an environmental protest
that spread across Europe, leading to violent attacks on Shell fuel
stations and sharp criticism from some heads of state.
	   Both Shell and Greenpeace praised Tuesday's report from the
Natural Environment Research Council, a British government-funded
group that evaluated both proposals for getting rid of the Brent
Spar.
	   Dumping the Brent Spar at sea would have been slightly cheaper,
easier and safer for workers, but reusing it to make a Norwegian
ferry terminal is environmentally more sound than just throwing it
away, the scientists concluded.
	   ``The balance of advantage between the deep sea option and the
proposal to use parts of Brent Spar as a quay is not clear-cut,''
said John Shepherd, the director of Southampton Oceanography
Center, who chaired the scientific study.
	   ``A final decision may have to include other factors such as
cost, technical considerations and public acceptability,'' Shepherd
said in a statement.
	   Shell wants to begin dismantling the Brent Spar later this year,
so the ferry terminal in Mekjarvik, Norway, can be in operation by
next summer, spokeswoman Fran Morrison said.
	   Shell hopes the report will speed British government approval
for its new plan. After the dramatic standoff with Greenpeace,
Shell has been unable to get rid of the vessel, which now is
floating in a Norwegian fjord, because Britain had previously
authorized only the option of sinking it.
	   Greenpeace said it hopes the Brent Spar incident will prompt the
European Commission and other nations to ban deep-sea dumping of
disused oil equipment, at a meeting next month in Sintra, Portugal.
	   Greenpeace campaigner Simon Reddy said the government should
``discard Britain's Dirty Man of Europe image and agree a ban on
the dumping of all existing steel installations and all future
steel and concrete installations.''

Chinese police detain another dissident, turn family members away another

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police on Tuesday detained a democracy
campaigner working to form an opposition party, after releasing one
of his colleagues, a human rights group reported.
	   Police were seen taking Zhu Yunfu off a street in eastern
Hangzhou city Tuesday morning, making him at least the seventh
dissident to be detained in the past week.
	   Hangzhou police on Monday warned Zhu's fellow dissident, Wang
Youcai, to stop trying to set up the China Democracy Party and
released him after six hours, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Zhu, whose activism dates from the late 1970s, had been
spreading the word about the China Democracy Party, the first
opposition party dissidents have tried to formally register, the
group said.
	   Although police routinely harass dissidents and their families,
the repressive measures have marred U.S. President Bill Clinton's
trip through China. Clinton raised earlier detentions with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on Saturday, but Jiang afterward told
reporters that authorities acted to ensure security.
	   Chinese dissidents have used Clinton's trip to press for change,
or in the case of Zhu and his associates form an opposition party.
At the same time, police have intensified surveillance and taken
action against family members.
	   Immigration inspectors at Beijing airport refused to allow the
wife of a democracy activist in north China's Inner Mongolia into
the country Sunday. Tao Li was turned away from customs and sent
back to Germany despite her travel documents, the New York-based
Human Rights in China said in a statement.
	   Hu Suchan, the mother of a protester in the democracy movement
that swept China in 1989, was detained by police in Beijing on June
22 and escorted to her home in central China two days later, the
group said.
	   Her son, Yu Zhuo, spent two years in prison for putting up
posters demanding an investigation into the military assault on the
democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. Yu
died in a car accident, although the police officer accompanying
him was unhurt, the group said.
	   The family of jailed Chinese journalist Gao Yu appealed to
Chinese President Jiang to release her on medical parole and urged
Clinton to champion her case.
	   During a visit to her prison outside Beijing on June 9, Gao's
son and father found that her heart trouble had worsened and her
skin was covered with red, festering sores, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center said.
	   Gao, 55, is 4 1/2 years into a six-year prison term. Once a
deputy editor-in-chief of an economics weekly, she was convicted in
a secret trial in 1994 for leaking state secrets, apparently for
writing about Communist Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.

Tripp arrives at grand jury to testify in Lewinsky investigation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with White House reaction in new new 7th graf;trims
By PETE YOST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Linda Tripp, the other woman on the Monica
Lewinsky tapes, went before a U.S. grand jury Tuesday to tell what
she knows about an alleged presidential affair and cover-up and to
counter perceptions she manipulated the former White House intern.
	   Her appearance at the District Courthouse marks a critical
juncture in the investigation, as prosecutor Kenneth Starr tries to
press beyond proving a sexual relationship between Ms. Lewinsky and
President Bill Clinton to possible obstruction of justice and
witness tampering.
	   Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and urged her to do so. Starr could
turn over his findings to the House of Representatives, the body
with the power to begin impeachment hearings against a president.
	   Mrs. Tripp's evidence could be crucial in determining where
Starr's investigation goes from here.
	   Mrs. Tripp was accompanied by three lawyers and her children as
she arrived at the courthouse. Asked if she was nervous, she
replied only with a smile. Her lead attorney, Anthony Zaccagnini,
said, ``Not at all. ... She's doing good. She's real strong.''
	   And with that, unaccompanied, Mrs. Tripp entered the grand jury
room for questioning that could stretch over several days.
	   A crowd of about 300 journalists struggled to get a view _ or a
question in _ as she arrived at the federal building where dozens
of grand jury witnesses have preceded her.
	   In an interview reported in Tuesday's editions of The Washington
Post, Mrs. Tripp said she had been vilified unfairly. ``I am so
anxious to go before the grand jury and tell the truth,'' she told
the newspaper.
	   At the White House, presidential aides were withholding any
criticism of Mrs. Tripp while keeping a watchful eye on a witness
whose account could undercut Clinton's denial of a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``We'll let the American people
draw their own conclusions about Linda Tripp,'' spokesman Jim
Kennedy said.
	   Mrs. Tripp in 1993 became executive assistant to Clinton's White
House counsel, Bernard Nussbaum, and now works for the Pentagon.
She precipitated a criminal probe of Clinton in January when she
took 20 hours of secretly recorded telephone conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky to prosecutors.
	   But in addition to her discussions with Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Tripp
had contact last year with presidential confidant Bruce Lindsey and
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey at a time when the White House
was scrambling to contain potential damage from the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
	   In the Post interview, Mrs. Tripp said she had been vilified
unfairly. She dismissed allegations that she had betrayed Ms.
Lewinsky and had cynically tried to use their friendship as
Pentagon coworkers against Clinton. ``I did not cultivate Monica _
she cultivated me,'' Mrs. Tripp told the Post. ``Monica is a very
worldly person. She educated me.''
	   During the 20-minute telephone interview Sunday, Mrs. Tripp
refused to discuss Starr's investigation, her taping of Ms.
Lewinsky or what she will tell the grand jury, the Post said.
	   ``Linda Tripp ... believes the public will have a better
understanding of the events that led to this investigation when all
of the facts are revealed,'' said her lawyers, Zaccagnini and Joe
Murtha.
	   Meanwhile, another legal battle was brewing in secret that
threatened to delay Starr's investigation _ this one over materials
prosecutors subpoenaed from a private investigator used by
Clinton's lawyers to help in the president's defense.

Charles Rycroft, leading British psychoanalyst, dies at 83 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dr. Charles Rycroft, one of the leading figures in
British psycholanalysis, has died at age 83.
	   Rycroft, whose writings include the widely used ``A Critical
Dictionary of Psychoanalysis,'' died of acute pancreatitis May 24
at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London after after a brief
illness. He saw his last patient only a few days before his death.
	   Rycroft believed the subconscious mind influences the perception
of reality through the imagination, and saw the unconscious as a
creative and positive force, where Sigmund Freud saw it as
repressive and negative.
	   He also believed in a link between the subconscious and biology,
and that anxiety was not irrational but a biological function
necessary for survival, keeping people alert to threats.
	   In addition to his dictionary, published in 1968, Rycroft's
influential books include ``The Innocence of Dreams,'' and
``Anxiety and Dreams.''
	   ``Above all he was blessed with the ability to communicate
difficult and obscure ideas in clear and concise form,'' The Daily
Telegraph said in its obituary.
	   Charles Frederick Rycroft was born Sept. 9, 1914, son of a
baronet.
	   At Cambridge University, where he breifly joined the Communist
Party, he studied economics and history but decided to pursue
psychoanalysis.
	   He received his degrees in medicine and psychoanalysis at
University College Hospital in London, then worked in psychiatry
before setting up in private practice as an analyst in 1948.
	   Rycroft quickly became a success in his field. He was a member
of the British Psychoanalytic Society and assistant editor of the
International Journal of Psychoanalysis.
	   He was a sometimes a dissenter and, disillusioned by infighting
between proponents of different theories in the 1950s, he retired
from the society.
	   Rycroft also reviewed psychoanalytic literature and his opinion
was influential.
	   ``His role as an anti-establishment insider gave him a unique
perspective on the psychoanalytic movement. His inimitable voice _
ironic, self-deprecatory, yet quietly authoritative _ will long
outlive him,'' The Independent wrote.
	   Rycroft is survived by his wife, the former Jenny Pearson, and a
son and two daughters of his first marriage, to Chloe Majolier,
which ended in divorce in 1963.

<TEXT>
	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Restaurant workers at Disneyland
Paris on joined technicians and parade performers Tuesday in a
partial strike to press for pay raises, officials said.
	   Dozens of strikers with signs and banners gathered at the
entrance of Europe's Magic Kingdom 30 kms (18 miles) east of the
capital, on the sixth day of a walkout that began with most parade
performers.
	   Sound and light technicians joined the walkout Monday, and
restaurant workers began walking out Tuesday, a union spokesman
said. The park said the daily parade continued as scheduled and the
vast majority of its 13,000 employees remained on the job.
	   The park and its hotels ``are not affected'' by the strike, the
holding company Euro Disney said in a statement.
	   Disneyland said about 40 stage performers and 15 technicians
were on strike, while the Communist-controlled General Labor
Confederation (CGT) said about 150 remained off the job, with
restaurant workers beginning to strike and others threatening to
walk out.
	   ``We have miserable salaries,'' said Michel Balliwech, a local
CGT organizer.
	   The CGT was demanding a minimum 8,500-franc (dlrs 1,400) monthly
salary, or a 7 percent increase. Balliwech, who prints park
tickets, said he earns 7,300 francs (dlrs 1,200) per month after
seven years on the job.
	   ``A 7 percent raise is impossible. There's already been an 8
percent raise over three years,'' said Disneyland spokesman Michel
Dompnier.
	   Dompnier said the park has negotiated daily with the strikers,
who he claimed did not want to be represented by the unions. ``We
are talking with employee representatives.''
	   Dompnier said Disneyland was offering more training and
higher-paying stage or technical positions to qualifying employees.
	   CGT local chief Roger Dupont countered that union members were
in the talks, and that if the union were barred ``that would mean
they don't observe the laws here. It would be an error because
things can happen that aren't very nice.''
	   Asked to elaborate, Dupont said protests ``could increase.''
	   Dupont said strikers, including members of the French
Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), voted on Monday for an
indefinite walkout. ``They are fed up,'' he said.
	   Balliwech said he felt no qualms about striking in the middle of
the tourist season.
	   ``Striking is a right,'' he said. ``We're not changing the
atmosphere,'' he insisted.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co. based in Burbank, California, opened the park's
doors in April 1992. It reported annual profit since 1995, in part
by imposing tougher cost controls that have triggered occasional
strikes.

Chinese president arrives for handover ceremonies 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with protest outside Jiang's hotel, grafs 3-4
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fresh from high-profile summitry in Beijing,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday to help
celebrate the territory's handover _ an event that has boosted
China's prestige as a reliable global partner.
	   Military bands and schoolchildren waving flags greeted Jiang as
he stepped from his plane. He was accompanied by Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa, and made no statement at the airport.
	   However, about 10 pro-democracy activists demonstrated Tuesday
night outside the hotel where Jiang was staying under tight
security.
	   The demonstrators burned portraits of Jiang, and called on the
Chinese leader to step down from his post. Some of the protesters
scuffled with police but no one was injured.
	   Jiang's white Boeing 747 glided over Hong Kong's cityscape
before touching down at venerable Kai Tak airport, which closes
Sunday night after 73 years in service. On Thursday, the Chinese
president officially opens new Chek Lap Kok airport on outlying
Lantau island.
	   Jiang will depart from the new airport. U.S. President Bill
Clinton, with whom he met in Beijing, is expected at the new
airport just hours later for a short visit that concludes his tour
of China.
	   With Hong Kong suffering economically, Wednesday's anniversary
ceremonies will be muted compared to the 1997 extravaganza that
ended more than a century and a half of British colonial rule.
	   A year ago, Hong Kong saw off Prince Charles and the last
British colonial governor, Chris Patten, while Jiang presided over
the re-establishment of Chinese sovereignty.
	   Only one day later, Asia's economic woes broke open in Bangkok.
While Hong Kong's economic power kept it immune for months, it now
is being dragged into recession along with much of the region.
	   However, China largely has been given high marks for standing by
its pledges to keep hands off the territory, and allow it to run
its own affairs.
	   China's handling of Hong Kong has won praise from Western
governments, and grudging respect even from its foes in Hong Kong,
who acknowledge that changes have been relatively small.
	   A survey released Monday indicated people believe the economic
and social conditions have deteriorated in the past year. Even
though the government of Hong Kong leader Tung is coming under
criticism, relatively few worries have surfaced over China's role.
	   The presence of Beijing officials for the handover anniversary
``is a demonstration of their great support and true concern for
Hong Kong,'' Tung said in a statement.
	   Anniversary celebrations in Hong Kong on Wednesday, which is a
public holiday, will include a flag-raising ceremony, a gala show
at Hong Kong's coliseum and a banquet. News reports said this
year's celebration will cost only about 10 million Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 1.3 million), compared to the 250 million Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 32 million) spent last year.
	   In the University of Hong Kong survey released Monday, 48.6
percent of those who responded said their confidence in Hong Kong's
future had decreased since the handover.
	   Almost 95 percent said they thought economic conditions were
worse. Only 34 percent thought the political situation was worse.
	   Hong Kong's 4.2 percent unemployment is the highest in 15 years,
the stock market has fallen sharply, and the government has had to
take drastic steps to try to limit the economic damage. Last week,
it froze sales of government land to try to stabilize the
all-important property market.

Rubber bullets injure dozens as workers protest in Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS location of Bekasi, fixes quote, 2nd graf
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and soldiers, firing rubber
bullets, wounded dozens of steel factory workers Tuesday as
thousands staged a violent protest to demand better pay and social
welfare.
	   ``We had to fire rubber bullets because they attacked us with
rocks and concrete bricks,'' said an officer at a military post in
Bekasi, just east of Jakarta. ``They even wanted to burn a movie
house across from the factory.''
	   The state-run TVRI television station reported that 104 people
were arrested for interrogation, and at least 26 workers were
injured.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced an average 15 percent
increase in regional minimum wages, putting the monthly salaries
between 130,000 and 198,500 rupiah (dlrs 8.60 and dlrs 13.20).
	   The workers at the PT. Gunung Garuda steel factory were unaware
of the order. Company officials could not be reached immediately
for comment on current pay and working conditions.
	   But the military officer said all 2,100 employees of the factory
went on a rampage to protest low salaries and adverse conditions.
	   A number of security personnel were injured, including three who
were treated at a hospital, added the officer, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity,
	   It was the second consecutive day of protests by the workers.
	   Also Tuesday, about 2,000 workers of P.T. Tyfontex, a textile
company in the Central Java town of Sukoharjo, about 520 kilometers
(325 miles) east of Jakarta, staged a similar protest. They
demanded higher salaries and better social welfare, police said.
	   One officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the workers
planned to march 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the nearby city of
Solo. There were no reports of trouble.
	   Antara reported that about 6,000 workers at the factory went on
strike Monday.
	   About 3,000 students and other youths demonstrated Tuesday at
the local council building in Maumere, a town on Flores Island in
East Nusatenggara province, demanding total political and economic
reform.
	   On Sunday, police opened fire on a mob looting a timber
warehouse. One man was killed and the slaying triggered a riot in
the town of Blora, about 550 kilometers (340 kilometers) east of
Jakarta, the Antara news agency reported.
	   Indonesia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis
in 30 years and has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Unemployment is rising dramatically. Prices of basic foodstuffs
are soaring. The official inflation rate is now running at 46
percent and is expected to exceed 80 percent by the end of the
year.
	   Some fear that economic hardship and growing poverty might
trigger civil unrest in the wake of riots last month that resulted
in as many as 1,200 deaths.
	   The violence helped force former President Suharto to quit,
ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   New President B.J. Habibie struck a deal last week with the
International Monetary fund to restart a dlrs 43 billion bailout
for the battered economy.

Bandits kill security guard trying to rob armored cars 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A wild shootout erupted on a road
near the capital Tuesday when about 20 bandits tried to rob an
armored-car convoy, killing a security guard.
	   The guard died after the robbers drove a 10-ton truck straight
into the path of the three armored cars. The first armored car
swerved away from a collision and was pursued by bandits in a
pickup truck who opened fire with AK-47 and R5 assault rifles.
	   The truck collided with the two other armored cars, killing the
driver of the last vehicle, said police Inspector Gideon Thessner.
The two guards in the middle armored car fled their damaged
vehicle. One was shot in the foot.
	   When the gunmen discovered the two damaged armored cars weren't
carrying money, they hijacked a woman's car after forcing her off
the road with a second 10-ton truck.
	   The first armored car eluded the bandits. It was unclear how
much money, if any, it was carrying.
	   With military precision, bandits have been robbing South
Africa's bank and securities transports, snaring dlrs 18 million
last year and killing dozens of guards.
	   Police have arrested more than 50 suspects, about half the
number believed involved in sophisticated gangs that include
policemen and former anti-apartheid guerrilla fighters.

	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Restaurant workers at Disneyland
Paris joined technicians and parade performers Tuesday in a partial
strike to press for pay raises, officials said.
	   Dozens of strikers with signs and banners gathered at the
entrance of Europe's Magic Kingdom 30 kms (18 miles) east of the
capital, on the sixth day of a walkout that began with most parade
performers.
	   Sound and light technicians joined the walkout Monday, and
restaurant workers began walking out Tuesday, a union spokesman
said. The park said the daily parade continued as scheduled and the
vast majority of its 13,000 employees remained on the job.
	   The park and its hotels ``are not affected'' by the strike, the
holding company Euro Disney said in a statement.
	   Disneyland said about 40 stage performers and 15 technicians
were on strike, while the Communist-controlled General Labor
Confederation (CGT) said about 150 remained off the job, with
restaurant workers beginning to strike and others threatening to
walk out.
	   ``We have miserable salaries,'' said Michel Balliwech, a local
CGT organizer.
	   The CGT was demanding a minimum 8,500-franc (dlrs 1,400) monthly
salary, or a 7 percent increase. Balliwech, who prints park
tickets, said he earns 7,300 francs (dlrs 1,200) per month after
seven years on the job.
	   ``A 7 percent raise is impossible. There's already been an 8
percent raise over three years,'' said Disneyland spokesman Michel
Dompnier.
	   Dompnier said the park has negotiated daily with the strikers,
who he claimed did not want to be represented by the unions. ``We
are talking with employee representatives.''
	   Dompnier said Disneyland was offering more training and
higher-paying stage or technical positions to qualifying employees.
The company also offered ``improvement in work conditions,''
without elaborating.

Russian musicians win first prizes in Tchaikovsky competition

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian musicians bested an international field
and took top honors in the piano, violin and cello at the
prestigious Tchaikovsky music competition.
	   The judges gave Denis Matsuyev the prize for the piano, Nikolai
Sachenko was the top violinist, and Denis Shapovalov was selected
in the cello competition late Monday night.
	   ``It's not at all surprising that Russian participants won first
prizes in a competition which ... is based on the works of
Tchaikovsky,'' competition spokesman Andrei Ustinov said Tuesday.
	   Participants are not limited to Peter Tchaikovsky's works, but
each performer must include at least one piece of music by the
19th-century Russian composer for each of the competition's three
rounds.
	   Previous winners included musicians from around the world. One
of the most notable was a young American, Van Cliburn, who won the
piano prize in the first competition in 1958, and instantly became
one of the world's best know pianists.
	   But on the whole, Russian musicians seem to give ``more
authenticity'' to their performances of works by Russian composers,
Ustinov said.
	   But Daniel Pollack, a piano juror and runner-up in the first
Tchaikovsky competition in 1958, said he thought Britain's
Frederick Kampf, who took third prize, was the ``most talented''
pianist.
	   ``He should have been, in my opinion, the first prize,'' Pollack
said.
	   Matsuyev, the winner in piano, played Tchaikovsky's ``Concerto
No. 1 in B-flat Minor'' and Liszt's ``Concerto No. 1 in E-Flat'' in
the finals. Both Kampf and second-prize runner-up, Russia's Vadim
Rudenko, played the ``Tchaikovsky Concerto'' and Rachmaninoff's
``Concerto No. 3 in D-Minor.''
	   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
1958. It has helped launch successful careers for many of the
winners.
	   The winners received dlrs 10,000, runners-up take home dlrs
8,000 and third-place finishers get dlrs 6,000.
	   The 11th Tchaikovsky competition ran for two weeks and the
international panel of juries included former Tchaikovsky winners.
Prizes in the three instrumental categories were announced late
Monday night.
	   The runners-up were:
	   _ In piano, Russia's Vadim Rudenko was second, followed by
Britain's Frederick Kampf, Russia's Sergei Tarasov, Russia's Maxim
Filippov and Ukraine's Oleg Polyansky.
	   Special mention diplomas were awarded to Russia's Victoria
Korchinskaya-Kogan and Japan's Mica Sato.
	   _ In cello, Australia's Li Wei Qin received second prize,
followed by Russia's Boris Andrianov and France's Francois Salque.
No fifth prize was awarded. Sixth was shared by Germany's Wolfgang
Emanuel Schmidt and Russia's Dmitry Tsirin.
	   Diplomas were awarded to Russia's Vladimir Balshin and Alexander
Neustroyev.
	   _ In violin, Germany's Latica Honda-Rosenberg was second,
followed by China's Yigiong Pan, China's Bin Huang, Russia's
Alexander Trostyansky and Britain's Natasha Lomeiko.
	   Diplomas were awarded to Italy's Francesco Manara and Russia's
Yelena Revich.
	   The winner in the vocals was to be chosen Tuesday.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ East European countries must beef up
their border police to slow an exodus of illegal aliens that is
producing a crime wave in the West, officials at a conference on

Computer meltdown causes massive delays at new airport

<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Fuming passengers stormed from the
baggage area, minus their luggage, after a computer meltdown
Tuesday caused massive delays on the first working day of
Malaysia's dlrs 2.3 billion airport.
	   Touted as the world's biggest and most modern airport, Kuala
Lumpur International Airport folded under the pressure of its first
full day of flights.
	   Baggage and check-in computers stopped working. Overhead
monitors blipped out. Escalators ground to a halt. Airplanes took
off without food supplies.
	   Hundreds of hapless passengers waited up to four hours,
occasionally in the dark, for their bags and searched fruitlessly
for airport officials who were nowhere to be found.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad later told reporters he had
suspected all along that a flurry of problems would crop up at the
KLIA, one of his pet projects.
	   ``There were other new airports which, when they were opened,
couldn't function at all,'' he said, pointing out that the control
tower worked fine and that planes could still take off and land. He
described all the glitches as ``not very serious complications.''
	   But others begged to differ.
	   ``This is a disaster,'' said Yunus Paruk, 29, a textiles
manufacturer from South Africa who left without his bags after
waiting three hours and missing two business meetings.
	   ``It's very impressive to look at. But frankly, I'm more
concerned about getting my bags back,'' said Paruk.
	   The sleek new KLIA was designed to put Malaysia on the
international map, transforming Kuala Lumpur into a regional
air-transport hub competing with Singapore and Bangkok.
	   The 10,000-hectare (24,700-acre) airport in the middle of oil
palm plantations is claimed to be the world's largest, built to
accommodate millions of passengers and faster jets.
	   It is unclear whether the airport will be able to draw traffic
from its rivals. Critics have complained about its location, 70
kilometers (40 miles) from downtown Kuala Lumpur, and its reliance
on the world's first ``total airport management system,'' which
links all operations to a central computer.
	   Gayle Hardy, 46, a management consultant from Australia, was the
first international passenger to arrive Tuesday morning. She was
greeted by a pack of journalists and televisions cameras.
	   ``Oh, I feel incredibly privileged,'' Hardy said. ``It's very
impressive. I travel quite a bit and I've never seen anything like
this.''
	   But as the day wore on, swarms of weary international travelers
sat dozing on their carry-on bags and slept on the cold marble
floors waiting for luggage belts to begin moving.
	   Passengers from one jumbo jet clapped hands, chanting
``lug-gage, lug-gage,'' in an effort to get some explanation as to
the delay. Departing domestic and some international flights were
delayed for hours.
	   One Malaysian honeymoon got off to a bad start.
	   ``The terminal here, it's not the most romantic place in the
world,'' said Sean Martin and Ingrid Brandt, newlyweds from
Johannesburg, South Africa, who waited four hours for their
luggage.
	   A harried airport official eventually addressed a crowd of
hundreds with cupped hands, apologizing for the long wait.
	   ``The system is down. They didn't expect this to happen,'' said
the official. ``It'll take time.''
	   The loudspeaker didn't work and extra manpower had to be called
in from the capital to help load bags manually from the tarmac to
the baggage system.
	   As the arrival hall filled with a backlog of passengers, about
200 people waited in a taxi line that barely budged.
	   Khairuddin Ibrahim, the airport's managing director, described
the glitches as ``teething problems.''
	   ``This is the first day of the new airport. There are bound to
be problems,'' he said, declining to discuss the reasons behind the
delays.

Israel, Palestinians extend mandate of international Hebron force 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians Tuesday extended
the mandate of the unarmed multinational force whose job is to
observe in the troubled and divided West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and director-general of
Israel's foreign ministry, Eitan Ben-Tsur signed the extension
agreement for the Temporary International Presence in Hebron at a
low-key ceremony in Jerusalem.
	   The 122-member force which includes observers from Norway,
Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, was established in
1994, after a Jewish settler massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in a
Hebron mosque. The mandate has been extended every six months since
the force was established.
	   Some 130,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, with 80 percent of the
city controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Israel still
maintains control over 20 percent of Hebron including the area
where some 500 Jewish settlers live.
	   The TIPH observers do not intervene in daily incidents of
friction between settlers, Israeli troops and Palestinians, but
report on the incidents to the Israeli army and the Palestinian
police, as well as to their home governments.
	   At a time when peace talks are frozen and Israelis and
Palestinians are finding little to agree on, Ben-Tsur said TIPH was
an example of the two sides finding ``creative solutions that
enabled the continuation of the peace process.''

Malian envoy's final tribute draws diplomats, civilians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAMAKO, Mali (AP) _ Foreign diplomats, family members and
ordinary civilians began converging Tuesday on a government
ceremony to pay homage to Mali-born Alouin Blondin Beye, the U.N.
envoy whose plane crashed into a swamp in Ivory Coast on Friday.
	   The ceremony, expected to be attended by several thousand people
from all walks of life including U.N., Malian and other
dignitaries, was due to begin around 3:30 p.m. at the Palais de
Congres, a large open-air public courtyard in the dusty capital of
Bamako.
	   The gathering would be followed by a traditional Islamic burial
in Bamako's Hamdallaye quarter.
	   Beye, the U.N. special envoy to Angola, was among eight people
who died when a small charter plane disappeared Friday night as it
tried to land in Abidjan, the commercial capital of the Ivory
Coast.
	   The crash deeply shook the people of Mali, where the 59-year-old
Beye _ a former university professor and cabinet minister _ had
been well-known for years.

Romania lawmakers keep law against homosexual relations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Legislators voted Tuesday to keep
homosexual activity a criminal act in Romania, despite pressure
from the government and the European Union to decriminalize it.
	   Lawmakers rejected a government proposal to abolish a law that
makes homosexual relations punishable by one to five years in
prison, instead voting to reduce the minimal sentence to three
months.
	   ``Integration in Europe does not presuppose sodomy,'' deputy Dan
Barbaresso said last week in arguing against legalization.
	   Baptist priest Matei Boila also invoked family, moral and
Christian values.
	   The main opposition for legalizing homosexual activity is the
Romanian Orthodox Church, which is strongly opposed to any form of
homosexuality. Almost 90 percent of Romanians adhere to the
Orthodox creed.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ ``I'm sorry about the horses'' King Juan
Carlos told the new American ambassador as they chatted amid gilded
surroundings and velvet drapes.
	   The royal beasts had equestrian flu and couldn't pull the
carriages as planned for Tuesday's ceremony in which eight new
diplomatic heads presented their credentials to the Spanish
monarch.
	   One by one, the ambassadors entered the parade ground of
Madrid's Royal Palace in a black Rolls Royce accompanied by a
mounted and plumed guard of honor while a military band played the
appropriate national anthem.
	   The ambassadors, introduced into the ornate state room
individually, handed the king, Spanish head of state, a sealed
envelope with their credentials before sitting down to exchange
pleasantries.
	   The king was in full dress uniform with a sky-blue sash. All the
ambassadors, except the robed Nigerian Isaac Agboala Aluko-Olukun,
wore white tie and tails.
	   As well Aluko-Olukun, the king welcomed American Ed Romero,
Colombian Luis Fernando Jaramillo, Mexico's Juan Jose Bremer,
Japan's Kiyohito Arafuna, Slovenia's Ciril Stokelj, Bulgaria's
Vasilka Doheva Paplomatas and Costa Rica's Javier Solis.

Thai police ask phone company to help trace illicit web pages 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police, frustrated in efforts to
trace purveyors of pornography and drugs on the Internet, are
asking the country's telephone company to help.
	   Police Col. Chalermkiat Srivorakan said Tuesday that the police
wanted to use a ``caller ID'' system to help find out who is
posting objectionable ``home pages'' on the World Wide Web offering
illicit services or products.
	   ``All Internet access in Thailand will be monitored by the
department,'' Chalermkiat was quoted as saying by the Bangkok
newspaper The Nation. ``Telephone numbers that are used to access
the Internet will be displayed at the department's server so we
know what every Internet user is doing.''
	   He told The Associated Press he thought the state-run Telephone
Organization of Thailand would agree to provide the police with a
calling line indicator system for tracing calls to the Internet.
Such service so far is only available for some cellular phone
networks in Thailand.
	   Chalermkiat stressed that the planned monitoring was not aimed
at people reading the World Wide Web, but just at people posting
web pages with illegal offerings. He said Thailand had no intention
of censoring what people read on the Internet, which is done in
some neighboring countries. He mentioned Singapore.
	   He said that in a case three or four months ago, police asked
Internet service providers who the account holder was for a certain
objectionable web page, but the person turned out not to have
produced that page.
	   Local Internet service providers, who apparently had not been
told of the police department plan, said it appeared misguided, and
probably technically impossible.
	   Vivatvong Vichit-Vadakan, managing director of Loxinfo, one of
Thailand's major Internet services, said the police concern
appeared to be inspired by a well-publicized case earlier this year
of a mass e-mailing purporting to offer 15- to 17-year-old Thai
girls for rent as sex slaves. The e-mail advertisement contained
two local e-mail addresses.
	   ``Police came and asked who those persons were,'' said
Vivatvong. ``It sounded very fishy. What I explained to them was
that if I were in that (sex) business I wouldn't be stupid enough
to put my address there.''
	   In another case some time back, a home page was posted on the
U.S. computer network AOL saying derogatory things about Thailand's
King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Under Thai law, printing or saying
derogatory comments about the monarchy can be a serious legal
offense.
	   In the AOL case, the home page contained a Thai e-mail address,
but the owner of the e-mail account had nothing to do with the
offensive web page.
	   A staff member of another major Internet provider, speaking on
condition of anonymity, described the police plans as ``a knee-jerk
reaction'' and ``kind of alarming.''
	   Both he and Loxinfo's Vivatvong said they would protect their
subscribers' privacy unless served with a court order.
	   But they said it could be useful for them if the phone company
implemented a caller ID system, so that callers trying to illegally
break into their systems could be traced.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to see

	   During a three-day cleanup ahead of Clinton's arrival Thursday
in the scenic southwestern city of Guilin, soldiers removed 20,000
tons of mud left behind by floods last week, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The cleaning brigades restored Guilin's pine-studded limestone
peaks to their ``original heavenly beauty,'' the report said.
	   The floods along the Li River, which meanders through the hills
near Guilin, raised concerns Clinton might have to cancel his trip
to one of China's most popular tourist destinations, but swollen
rivers have receded in time.

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services the council. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from Palestinian representative before
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Over U.S. objections, the Security Council
began debate Tuesday on Israel's decision to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The Palestinian U.N. representative, M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, opened
the debate by urging the 15-member council to adopt an
Arab-sponsored resolution that condemns Israel for the move and
urges it to stop settlement expansion, which is ``a major obstacle
to peace.''
	   ``We hope that the council will have the sufficient will to
finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee the
rescinding of the plan and to prevent Israel, the occupying power,
from undertaking any further illegal actions in Jerusalem and the
rest of the occupied territories,'' Al-Kidwa said.
	   The decision by Israel represents its ``aim of furthering the
process of the judaization of the city,'' he said.
	   The council was meeting at the request of Arab envoys to the
United Nations.
	   Mindful of U.S. opposition to any resolution, Britain's
ambassador, John Weston, suggested Tuesday the council might
instead adopt a presidential statement. Such a statement wouldn't
carry the same international weight as a resolution.
	   The United States had sought to delay the meeting until next
month, saying any council action would enflame passions and hinder
U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
	   But Bahrain, the only Arab country on the 15-member council,
insisted on the meeting. As a rule, the Security Council accepts
all such requests from its members.
	   On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said the
United States objected to any condemnation of Israel, saying it
would be counterproductive to the peace process.
	   With U.S. mediators trying to get Israel and the Palestinians to
end a 16-month stalemate, ``the last thing we need is action by the
parties or anybody else that raises suspicions and makes it even
more difficult to get the process back on track,'' McClenny said in
Washington.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But resorting to a veto is considered
a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent member is
unable to muster majority support.
	   Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved a plan
June 21 to put some Jewish settlements under Jerusalem municipal
authority for certain services, notably building and planning.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help
re-start the stalled peace talks.
	   The Arab League criticized the Israeli plan, calling it an
attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem'' and
``destroy the peace process.''

Oracle to set up software center in India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ American computer software giant Oracle
Corp. will invest dlrs 10 million in a software development center
in southern India, an official said Tuesday.
	   Oracle Applications Development Center will begin operating with
250 professionals in this southern Indian city July 15, said Louis
Selincourt, Oracle's vice president of industry and front office
applications division.
	   ``This will be the biggest software development center of Oracle
outside its headquarters in California,'' he said. Oracle, which is
headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, chose Hyderabad
because of the support to software development from the state
government, Selincourt told a news conference.
	   Oracle's rival Microsoft is also starting operations in
Hyderabad, in a 160-acre (64.8-hectare) facility the government of
Andhra Pradesh state is setting up. Microsoft and Oracle have both
also tied up with the state government to run computer and software
training schools.
	   Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu, a computer buff, is trying to
turn Hyderabad into India's Silicon Valley.
	   ``The Oracle decision as well as the decision by the World Bank
last week to approve a loan of dlrs 528 million to Andhra Pradesh
for its economic restructuring are very significant because they
have come after the U.S. decision to impose sanctions,'' Naidu
said.
	   The United States slapped economic and military sanctions on
India after New Delhi tested five underground nuclear devices last
month, prompting neighboring Pakistan to set off six similar tests.
	   The sanctions do not prevent private American companies from
doing business in India, but they could make it harder for them to
finance projects because of bans on U.S. government loans.

After riots, thousands protest Arabic law; claim for Matoub's death responsibility for Matoub's slaying 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with leaflet saying Muslim militants claiming
<TEXT>
	   TIZI-OUZOU, Algeria (AP) _ Several thousand ethnic Berbers
marched against Algeria's Arabic-only law Tuesday, while a leaflet
claimed Muslim militants were responsible for a singer's slaying
that touched off rioting in the region.
	   Police reported no incidents during the rally in the city 100
kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, shaken by unrest after the
militants assassinated the region's popular singer Lounes Matoub
last week.
	   Four people died in violence which raged in several of the
region's cities inhabited by Berbers, a Muslim people with their
own language. Matoub was an outspoken defender of Berber culture.
	   A leaflet believed to be from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the
most violent movement in a 6-year-old Muslim insurgency, claimed
responsibility for Matoub's slaying Thursday.
	   Circulated in Algiers, the leaflet quoted the group's regional
leader Hassen Hattab as saying the GIA carried out the killing as
``the just treatment reserved for enemies of God.'' The leaflet was
being checked for authenticity.

Government to crack down on non-paying gas consumers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government will launch a massive
crackdown on non-paying gas consumers as of July 1, suspending
supplies of gas to all debtors until they pay their bills, a top
official said Tuesday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko told a Cabinet
meeting all state gas distributors and regional governments have
already been instructed to cut off gas supplies to debtor
organizations and institutions.
	   The government was owed 7.6 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.8 billion)
for supplied gas as of the beginning of June, of which 2 billion
hryvna (dlrs 1 billion) has accumulated since Jan. 1, according to
the State Oil and Gas Committee.
	   Ukraine desperately needs the money to cover its huge gas debt
to Russia, which provides over 80 percent of the former Soviet
republic's energy needs.
	   Holubchenko said Ukraine's gas debt to Russia currently stands
at dlrs 610 million. The Russian side earlier estimated it at over
dlrs 1 billion.
	   Separately, Holubchenko said payments for electricity and heat
seriously decreased recently. The government says consumers owe the
state 3.7 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.85 billion).

Dutch bank opens new branches in Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Leading Dutch bank ABN Amro said
Tuesday it has opened four new branches in Indonesia, bringing the
total number of branches in the country to 14.
	   The bank, which had to close its offices in Indonesia
temporarily at the height of unrest in May, said it has been
opening new accounts in all new locations.
	   ``The Western banks are seen as safe havens in these turbulent
times,'' ABN Amro spokesman Tanno Massar said, pointing to the
large number of new private customers in the country which has been
hit hard by the financial crisis in Asia.
	   The new offices of ABN, which has been active in Indonesia since
1826, are located in Solo, Denpasar, Semarang and Manadao.
	   Riots swept through the capital city of Jakarta in May after
weeks of protests. As many as 1,200 people died in the civil
unrest.

Israel, Palestinians extend mandate of international Hebron force 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians extended on Tuesday
the mandate of the unarmed multinational observer force in the
troubled and divided West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and the
director-general of Israel's foreign ministry, Eitan Ben-Tsur,
signed the extension agreement for the Temporary International
Presence in Hebron at a low-key ceremony in Jerusalem.
	   The 122-member force, which includes observers from Norway,
Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, was established in
1994, after a Jewish settler massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in a
Hebron mosque. The mandate has been extended every six months since
then.
	   About 130,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, with 80 percent of
the city controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Israel still
maintains control over 20 percent of Hebron, including the area
where about 500 Jewish settlers live.
	   The TIPH observers do not intervene in daily incidents of
friction between settlers, Israeli troops and Palestinians, but
report on the incidents to the Israeli army and the Palestinian
police, as well as to their home governments.
	   At a time when peace talks are frozen and Israelis and
Palestinians are finding little to agree on, Ben-Tsur said TIPH was
an example of the two sides finding ``creative solutions that
enabled the continuation of the peace process.''

India to reopen its embassy in Fiji after eight years 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India said Tuesday it would reopen its
embassy in the Fijian capital, which was closed eight years ago
after a military coup ousted a government headed by an ethnic
Indian.
	   ``It is expected that the opening of a resident Indian High
Commission in Suva will contribute to a further consolidation of
the close and friendly ties between India and Fiji,'' said a
statement by the external affairs ministry in New Delhi.
	   Earlier this year, India lifted a trade embargo on the Pacific
island nation after Fiji's government and opposition political
parties adopted constitutional reforms that removed political
restrictions on ethnic Indians.
	   India broke off diplomatic ties when Fiji's government expelled
the Indian ambassador in May 1990 because it claimed he was
allegedly involved in covert political activities.
	   India had strongly opposed a now-overturned constitution
introduced by military ruler Sitveni Rabuka that guaranteed
indigenous Fijians political domination over the descendants of
Indians brought in the 19th century as indentured laborers.

Bangladesh court indicts Anup Chetia for trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ An Indian guerrilla leader wanted for
murder in India and facing immigration cases in neighboring
Bangladesh will face trial on two new charges, court officials said
Tuesday.
	   Anup Chetia, who leads a fight for independence of India's
eastern Assam state bordering Bangladesh, pleaded not guilty to
illegally holding a mobile phone and foreign currencies during a
court appearance Tuesday.
	   Judge Shahed Nuruddin of the one-man special tribunal rejected
Chetia's plea and set Aug. 2 for the trial.
	   Police escorted Chetia to the court from Dhaka Central Jail,
where he has been imprisoned since his arrest at a rented house in
Dhaka in December last year.
	   Chetia is facing trial on two more charges _ illegal holding of
Bangladeshi passports and violation of travel rules _ at another
magistrate's court in Bangladesh. The hearing on these two charges
is set for July 9.
	   If convicted on all four counts, Chetia could be sentenced to up
to 20 years in jail.
	   The trial has put on hold India's move to take him home, where
he is wanted for murder and kidnapping charges.
	   Some human rights groups in Bangladesh oppose Chetia's
extradition, comparing his cause with Bangladesh's own independence
war against Pakistan in 1971. India troops backed Bangladeshi
forces in the war.

Farmers stage sit-in at Polish Finance Ministry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 30 farmers staged a sit-in Tuesday
at the Finance Ministry to demand higher prices for their grain and
government guarantees that all of it will be bought.
	   The members of the Individual Farmers' Solidarity union also
demanded more subsidies for agriculture and the abolition of a
value-added tax for farmers, the state news agency PAP reported.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Rafal Zagorny met Tuesday evening with
the farmers, who originally said they wanted to meet with the
finance minster. There was no immediate word on the outcome of
their talks.
	   Polish farmers struggle to stay afloat. Their farms are small,
ill-equipped and inefficient when compared with European norms.
	   But squeezing more subsidies out of Poland's strapped budget
will be difficult. Poland is under pressure to reduce agrarian
subsidies to meet requirements for membership in the European
Union, which Polish officials hope to achieve within three years.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Tuesday said the conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province is in
critical stage, and that the United States' efforts to cool off the
situation were continuing.
	   Holbrooke, recently nominated to become U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, left Yugoslavia on Friday after four days of
shuttle diplomacy without coming up with a formula for ending the
fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``Diplomatic and political efforts to resolve the problem are
intense and ongoing. Many press reported that my mission ended last
week in failure, so let me clarify something: The mission didn't
end. It is continuing even though I left Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said.
	   He said Americans were still engaged in mediation, but that he
did not want to disclosed details. The United States and NATO have
also warned of possible military intervention unless the fighting
stops.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28. The forces are
trying to halt growing resistance by Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   ``One problem is that, on the military side, there is no clear
Albanian chain of command with which to deal when on talks about a
ceasefire. This is a marked difference from Bosnia,'' he said,
speaking briefly to reporters.
	   Holbrooke mediated the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war.
	   Holbrooke was in Oslo for a meeting of Turks and Greeks on the
tensions in Cyprus.
	   Cyprus was divided after Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974. Greek and Turkish Cypriots
now live separated by a U.N.-patrolled line running across the
island.
	   The meeting was called to bring together private citizens from
both sides of the island in hopes of building contact and trust.
	   ``I want to stress these are not negotiations. These are
meetings between private citizens,'' Holbrooke said.

World Cup: Croatia leads Romania 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Davor Suker scored an injury-time
penalty to give Croatia a 1-0 halftime lead over Romania on Tuesday
in the second round of the World Cup.
	   Suker slotted his right-footed spot kick just inside the right
post on his second attempt. His first try, almost an identical
kick, was waived off by Argentine referee Javier Castrilli after at
least two Croatian players encroached into the penalty arc.
	   The foul was called on Gabriel Popescu, who became entangled
with Aljosa Asanovic as they chased a pass in the Romanian penalty
area.
	   The winner will play Germany in the quarterfinals Saturday at
Lyon.
	   Before the penalty, opposing strikers Suker and Adrian Ilie had
the action flowing from end to end.
	   The Croatians kept Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea busy from
the opening whistle. Stelea denied Suker from close range, leaped
to push away Goran Vlaovic's long drive and made a reflex save on
Asanovic's shot _ all in the first 15 minutes.
	   Ilie was creative at the other end for Romania, winning spot
kicks deep in Croatian territory. But his teammates were unable to
convert any of the chances, and Ilie's best opportunity to set up a
goal failed when he couldn't lift his cross over approaching
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic to a wide-open Dan Petrescu in the 29th
minute.

Coalition to halt use of children in war launched 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Campaigners against the use of children as
soldiers on Tuesday launched a coalition to press governments for
strict international legal protection of under-18s.
	   ``The use of children as soldiers has no place in civilized
society and must be stopped,'' said Stuart Maslen, coordinator of
the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers.
	   The campaign, based near Geneva, is headed by a committee of six
organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights
Watch.
	   It estimates that more than 300,000 children worldwide under 18
years old are involved in armed conflicts, and at least as many
again are in armed forces not currently fighting.
	   The launch came a day after the U.N. Security Council in a
special meeting demanded an immediate end to the practice of arming
children.
	   Organizers said the coalition is a response to the failure of
negotiations to add to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child a non-binding resolution raising the age of participation in
war to 18 from 15.
	   In February, the United States was among countries that opposed
an international move to make 18 the minimum age that young
soldiers can go to war.
	   Washington fears that the proposed new standard could constrain
recruitment and training, and is skeptical about adding new norms
when old ones are not respected.
	   The United Nations refugee agency welcomed the move to draw
attention to ``children serving as cannon fodder in wars throughout
the world.''
	   ``Half of the refugee population worldwide are children, and
refugee populations are probably one of the most exposed people,''
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, told reporters.

	   TIZI-OUZOU, Algeria (AP) _ Several thousand ethnic Berbers
marched against Algeria's Arabic-only law Tuesday, while a leaflet
claimed Muslim militants were responsible for a singer's slaying
that touched off rioting in the region.
	   Police reported no incidents during the rally in the city 100
kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, shaken by unrest after the
militants assassinated the region's popular singer Lounes Matoub
last week.
	   Police banned and blocked a march against the Arabic-only law by
several hundred people in Algiers.

By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams powered into the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday, trouncing the player who knocked
her sister out the tournament a day earlier.
	   Volleying with authority for the first time and showing an
all-court game which could make her a real title threat, Williams
needed just 62 minutes to beat Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1.
	   The prospect of a fourth-round meeting between Venus and her
sister was dashed Monday when 16-year-old Serena Williams failed to
get past Ruano-Pascual. Citing a calf injury, Serena quit the
third-round match while trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   Venus took pleasure in avenging that result.
	   ``I wanted to win every point, all the points that Serena
couldn't win yesterday,'' the 18-year-old American said. ``I didn't
like it when she (Ruano-Pascual) came back to 4-3. That was
negligent on my part. I had to get serious to make sure she didn't
get too many more games.''
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals were defending champion
Martina Hingis, last year's runnerup Jana Novotna and French Open
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 and No. 5
Sanchez Vicario rallied for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dominique Van
Roost.
	   Williams will face Novotna in the quarters, while Hingis will
play Sanchez Vicario.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras moved closer to
his fifth title in six years by beating French qualifier Sebastian
Grosjean 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the quarters.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set so far, finished the match
with his 13th and 14th aces. He was never broken, faced only one
break point and broke Grosjean four times.
	   Sampras will next face big serving Mark Philippoussis, who
downed fellow Australian Jason Stoltenberg 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, swept to a
6-3, 6-3, 7-5 victory over Wayne Ferreira. No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic,
who had won only one match in his five previous Grand Slams, beat
Todd Martin 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Jan Siemerink was a four-set winner over Magnus Larsson, while
65th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti of Italy _ who had won only one
Grand Slam match before this tournament _ continued his surprising
run by beating Francisco Clavet in straight sets.

Russia receives IMF loan disbursement 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-6 with market closings
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After months of waiting, Russia's cash-strapped
government has finally received dlrs 670 million as part of an
International Monetary Fund loan, according to a report Tuesday.
	   The IMF decided last Thursday to release the money after
withholding it for months and pressing the Russian government to do
more to get its finances in order. The funds arrived Tuesday at the
Russian Finance Ministry's account, the the Interfax news agency
reported, citing a ministry official.
	   The money will not be enough to pull Russia out of its current
financial tailspin, but it should give President Boris Yeltsin's
government a bit more breathing space.
	   The money is part of an IMF loan for dlrs 9 billion that is
spread over three years. But the IMF has on several occasions
delayed the installments because it was not satisfied with the
government's financial performance.
	   Russian markets closed slightly lower Tuesday while investors
were preoccupied by troubles in the treasury market. The Russian
Trading System closed 1.7 percent lower than Monday in light
trading.
	   Benchmark one-year government bonds offered yields of 80 percent
Tuesday on widespread fears of a ruble devaluation.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was to appear before
parliament on Wednesday to answer questions about the government's
austerity plan, which is designed to stabilize the Russian markets.
	   Parliament is controlled by Communists who have consistently
opposed cuts in government spending programs, and it remained
unclear whether lawmakers would give their consent to the package.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has been critical of the
government plan and said Tuesday that five of the 21 proposals were
completely unacceptable, Interfax reported.
	   But Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is the speaker of
parliament's lower house, predicted that ``a majority of the bills
submitted may be ... passed into law on Wednesday,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Russian financial markets have been falling sharply in recent
weeks, due to a combination of factors that include government
budget problems, a drop in revenues from oil exports, and the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new
lending from the IMF as part of an economic package aimed at
preventing a devaluation of the ruble. The IMF is considering the
loan request.
	   Also on Tuesday, Russian commercial banks were allowed to
restart gold exports, only days after they were suspended on
grounds of a legal dispute, officials said.
	   The trouble was apparently caused by a lack of regulations on
whether gold is to be classified as a commodity _ and therefore out
of bounds for banks _ or as a monetary item.

Lux says center-left coalition still a possibility 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Christian Democratic leader Josef
Lux said Tuesday a center-left coalition was still possible after
an ``important, positive shift'' in the Social Democrats'
negotiating standpoint.
	   Lux spoke after talks with Social Democratic leader Milos Zeman,
asked by President Vaclav Havel to form a new Cabinet after the
Social Democrats won early parliamentary election June 19-20. The
center-left party came out on top with 74 seats in the 200-seat
parliament but lacks allies needed to form a majority government.
	   The small Christian Democrats have repeatedly refused to join
Zeman in a two-party coalition, saying they would prefer taking on
another small center-right party, the Freedom Union.
	   But Lux seemed to suddenly change his mind Tuesday, citing
``notable concessions from the Social Democrats.''
	   Lux did not elaborate. But he spoke only hours after Zeman
indicated he might rely on the support of the center-right Civic
Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav Klaus in his efforts to form
a new government.
	   The Social Democrats said last week their ideal choice would be
forming a minority government with the Christian Democrats and
tacit support from others.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
Havel is expected to ask Klaus, whose party won 63 seats, to
attempt the same.

Protesters attack suspects in murder of black youth 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: NOTE LANGUAGE in penutimate graf
By JENNY HELLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Protesters attacked five white men accused of
killing a black youth, after the five ended their testimony Tuesday
at a public inquiry into the killing.
	   One suspect was knocked down by an object thrown by the crowd,
and another was struck down by a protester outside the inquiry
building in south London.
	   Police in riot gear shoved back demonstrators and the five
eventually reached a white mini-van and were driven away.
	   As they left the building, one of the whites slapped a black
protester across the face, and with others spat toward the crowd of
about 100, mainly blacks.
	   Protesters hurled bottles, eggs and hot coffee at the suspects
and at a cordon of police officers, and one smashed a passenger
window on a passing double-decker bus. There were no reports of
serious injuries. Two people were arrested in disturbances outside
the building on Monday.
	   The five men were charged with the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old
Stephen Lawrence in 1993, but none was convicted. However, the
Daily Mail newspaper branded all five as the killers in a
front-page story and defied the men to sue.
	   Under British law, the youths cannot be charged again with the
murder. A judge ordered them to testify at the inquiry.
	   The inquiry has raised serious questions of police incompetence
and highlighted racial antagonism in some rundown London districts.
The Metropolitan Police have acknowledged they failed to
investigate properly and apologized.
	   In his testimony Tuesday, suspect David Norris, 21, parried many
questions by saying he was unable to remember.
	   ``Are you going to persist in saying `I don't remember where I
was' whatever questions are put to you?'' said Michael Mansfield,
an attorney for the Lawrence family.
	   ``If I could remember I would say, but if I can't remember I
can't remember,'' Norris said.
	   Norris, Neil Acourt, 22, his brother Jamie Acourt, 21, Luke
Knight, 20, and Gary Dobson, 22, had all been charged with murder.
	   Neil Acourt, Dobson and Knight were acquitted in 1996 after the
collapse of a private prosecution brought by Stephen's parents,
Neville and Doreen Lawrence. Charges against Jamie Acourt and
Norris were dropped before the trial.
	   Knight was questioned Tuesday about a police video made in 1994,
a year after the Lawrence killing, which showed him using racist
language.
	   ``I just spoke out in anger I suppose for what has happened to
me,'' Knight said.
	   When Knight said he no longer used racist language, Mansfield
accused him of calling protesters ``black bastards'' outside the
inquriy on Monday.
	   ``No, I never,'' Knight said, though Mansfield said the incident
was caught on film.

	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ The lake island where Princess
Diana is buried, and new museum dedicated to her memory, go on
public view at her family home Wednesday.
	   Her brother, Earl Spencer, has opened the grounds of Althorp,
the family estate in rural Northamptonshire, through Aug. 30.
Visitors will not be allowed on to the island where Diana is
buried, and the exact location of the grave is not marked.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets _ called ``invitations to visit'' _ have
been sold at prices ranging from 5 pounds (dlrs 8) for children to
7.50 pounds (dlrs 12) for senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15)
for adults.
	   Spencer set up the museum in a grand stable block built in the
1730s. The displays include personal effects from Diana's
childhood, family photographs and home movies. Admission to the
museum is included in the ticket price.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associted with Diana, ``but not
cheapening her memory in any way,'' the estate says.
	   Diana died Aug. 31 following a car crash in Paris, and was
buried in a privte family ceremony on Sept. 6 following her funeral
at Westminster Abbey in London.

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services it has no role in council; TRIMS. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israeli ambassador defending the decision, saying
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Over U.S. objections, the Security Council
began debate Tuesday on Arab calls to condemn Israel's decision to
extend municipal services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements in
the West Bank.
	   The Palestinian U.N. representative, M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, opened
the debate by urging the 15-member council to adopt an
Arab-sponsored resolution urging Israel to stop what it called
illegal settlement expansion, which constitutes ``a major obstacle
to peace.''
	   ``We hope that the council will have the sufficient will to
finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee the
rescinding of the plan and to prevent Israel, the occupying power,
from undertaking any further illegal actions in Jerusalem and the
rest of the occupied territories,'' Al-Kidwa said.
	   The council was meeting at the request of Arab envoys to the
United Nations despite calls by the United States to postpone the
meeting and U.S. objection to any resolution condemning Israel.
	   Mindful of the U.S. opposition, Britain's ambassador, John
Weston, suggested Tuesday the council might instead adopt a
presidential statement. Such a statement wouldn't carry the same
international weight as a resolution.
	   The United States had argued that any council action would
inflame passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the
stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Israel too said the council had no role in taking up the
dispute.
	   ``This is entirely an internal Israeli matter on the municipal
administrative level rather than on the international level,'' said
Israel's ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   He defended Israel's June 21 decision to put some Jewish
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning, as a move to bolster the
city's economy.
	   ``This is not a new political program affecting the political
status of Jerusalem,'' Gold told the council. ``This is not a plan
to gerrymander district lines in order to affect political
outlines.
	   ``It consists of a municipal blueprint for bolstering the city's
economy and infrastructure.''
	   Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved the plan over U.S.
protests.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help restart
the stalled peace talks.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But resorting to a veto is considered
a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent member is
unable to muster majority support.
	   On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said the
United States objected to any resolution that would condemn Israel,
saying it would be counterproductive to the peace process.
	   With U.S. mediators trying to get Israel and the Palestinians to
end a 16-month stalemate, ``the last thing we need is action by the
parties or anybody else that raises suspicions and makes it even
more difficult to get the process back on track,'' McClenny said in
Washington.

Pakistan's prime minister arrives in Qatar 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan
arrived Tuesday on a visit aimed at explaining his country's
reasons for conducting nuclear tests last month.
	   Sharif was greeted at the airport by Qatari Crown Prince Sheik
Jassem bin Hamad Al Thani.
	   Sharif will meet Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani
Wednesday, said a Pakistani diplomat, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity. Sheik Hamad is expected to arrive to Qatar
from Sudan later Tuesday.
	   It was not clear if Sharif would request any aid to offset
sanctions imposed on Pakistan by the United States and other
countries because of the tests.
	   Sharif arrived from Kuwait, where he met with the emir, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and other officials.
	   Earlier this month, Sharif visited Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates and discussed the consequences of the nuclear tests
that Islamabad says were in retaliation for tests India carried
out.
	   In Saudi Arabia, Sharif reportedly sought the kingdom's help in
lifting sanctions, which were also imposed on India.

Russia wants Kosovo Liberation Army kept out of talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army should not be allowed
to take part in talks with Yugoslavia, a Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Talks can be held ``only those political parties which group
around Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,'' spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin told the Interfax news agency. ``The KLA is not one of
those parties.''
	   The KLA says it controls up to 40 percent of Kosovo, a province
in southern Serbia, the larger partner in what remains of
Yugoslavia. It rejects the pacifist approach of Rugova, the ethnic
Albanian leader.
	   Rakhmanin said Russia's position was shared by Serbia and the
United States, and that the recent meeting between U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the KLA had been informal.
	   He reiterated Russia's position that military force should not
be used in Kosovo. ``No action should be taken that would give
Kosovo extremists the signal that they should start provocations,''
Rakhmanin said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters
in the predominantly Albanian province.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has said repeatedly that
outside military force should not be used in the conflict.

Pensioners rally in central China demanding pay 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A thousand retirees from a nearly bankrupt state
auto maker disrupted traffic in a central Chinese city Tuesday to
protest a lack of pension payments, a human rights group reported.
	   The protesters from Wuhan's Light Auto Works General factory
blocked streets for 2 1/2 hours before city officials agreed to
give them three months of overdue pension payments, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Duty officers with city agencies, reached after hours by
telephone, refused to confirm the demonstration.
	   The protest was the sixth this month in the ailing industrial
city and is part of a nationwide wave of unrest by workers as state
factories cut jobs to cope with government-ordered market reforms.
	   The Light Autoworks, like many state enterprises, suffered from
bad management and bloated payrolls, the Information Center said.

U.N.'s Annan meets Nigerian leader, pro-democracy activists talks with former Nigerian vice-president, quotes. Edits to conform. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to ADD Annan and Abubakar expected to meet again,
By GILBERT DA COSTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Bidding to bring democracy to an
international pariah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held talks
Tuesday with Nigeria's new military ruler and was due to meet the
country's most prominent prisoner.
	   Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than and hour at the
military leader's state residence in the capital of Abuja.
	   Annan declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, although
a member of his delegation, Ahmad Fawzi, said he had ``frank
discussions'' with the military ruler.
	   Both men regarded the meeting as the first in a series that will
continue after Annan has left Nigeria, Fawzi added.
	   The U.N. Secretary General had been granted permission to see
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been
imprisoned since 1995, human rights and government officials said
on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur.
	   David Attah, a spokesman for the military government said Annan
had decided not to speak to journalists until the end of his visit
on Thursday.
	   ``This is to allow the U.N. Secretary General to continue with
his consultations with other segments of society ... and he will be
briefing the press on Thursday after the meetings,'' Attah said.
	   Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku was also due to
meet Abubakar later Tuesday and would be given the chance to speak
to Abiola, human rights activists and government officials said.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, and the Nigerian-born Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995.
	   Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was quickly succeeded
by Abubakar, a career soldier with little political experience.
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation club of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks following the execution.
	   Annan was sitting down with a wide range of pro-democracy and
opposition activists during his visit, which he said was aimed at
easing Nigeria's transition to democracy and civilian rule while
improving strained international ties with the country.
	   Former Nigerian vice president Alex Ekueme, who was strongly
opposed to Abacha's rule, was among the first to meet the U.N.
leader.
	   ``The Secretary General's main preoccupation is the acceleration
of a credible political transition program,'' Fawzi said.
	   The U.N. leader on Wednesday planned to attend a ``mini
heads-of-state summit'' which was being organized by the Nigerian
government, Fawzi said.
	   It was unclear which leaders had been invited or what was on the
agenda and a Nigerian government spokesman gave no details of the
possible summit.
	   The country's new military leader has raised expectations for
democratic reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners
and suggesting Abiola too may eventually be freed.

Precede DILI East Timorese mourners bury slain protester, declare him a martyr protester. `Orlando' on second reference is correct.

	   BAUCAU, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of black-clad East Timorese
mourners filed into a hilltop cemetery to bid farewell Tuesday to a
pro-independence protester shot by Indonesian security forces.
	   His coffin draped with a separatist rebel flag, 35-year-old
Orlando Carcelinu da Costa was buried as his wife sobbed and
enraged student activists declared him a martyr.
	   Orlando was killed Monday after protesters mobbed a car carrying
security officials in the seaside town of Baucau in East Timor
during a visit by a three-member European Union diplomatic team.
Agents opened fire, shooting Orlando in the face and injuring four
others.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, Austria and the Netherlands left the
former Portuguese colony earlier than scheduled Tuesday in order to
avoid serving as a catalyst for more demonstrations.
	   They departed on an Indonesian military plane, not a commercial
flight as planned, from the East Timorese capital of Dili.
	   Clashes between rival groups of East Timorese, for and against
Indonesia rule, marred the ambassadors' three-day fact-finding tour
of the troubled territory.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later, triggering widespread human rights abuses and a guerrilla
war. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over
the half-island territory.
	   Orlando was shot outside a Roman Catholic cathedral in Baucau,
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili, as the ambassadors held
talks with the local bishop. The slain protester was buried in the
Roman Catholic Wainiki Cemetery.
	   ``Now we don't have any one to support my family,'' wailed his
wife, Maria Ximenes, who was accompanied by her two children, 1 and
2 years old. Orlando was a peasant who sold vegetables in the
market.
	   The wooden coffin was covered with the flag of Fretilin, a
guerrilla group that has been fighting Indonesian troops for more
than two decades. Many East Timorese want a referendum on
independence, but Indonesia has ruled that out.
	   In a speech at the funeral, student Nataline de Jesus Soares
proclaimed Orlando a hero ``because he was shot and killed while
struggling for an independent East Timor.''
	   Fearing more violence, police blocked at least 20 buses and
trucks packed with hundreds of mourners from entering Baucau to
attend the funeral service.
	   Another pro-independence protester was shot during a rally near
Dili on Friday. Witnesses said soldiers were responsible, while the
military said it was investigating.
	   Pro-independence groups want not only a referendum on Indonesian
control over East Timor but also the release of imprisoned rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence for
fighting Indonesian forces.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered to free him and grant East
Timor special status in return for international recognition of
Indonesia's claim over the territory.
	   The territory's spiritual leader, Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner
of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, condemned Monday's shootings.
	   ``These were young people who only wanted to make known their
aspirations. So why were they shot? Why wasn't a warning shot fired
into the air first?'' he said Tuesday.

China cuts interest rates again to revive flagging growth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Aiming to revive domestic demand and slowing
economic growth, China cut interest rates on Tuesday, the fifth cut
in two years.
	   The People's Bank of China will lower deposit rates by an
average 0.49 percentage points and will cut lending rates by an
average 1.12 percentage points starting Wednesday, state-run media
reported.
	   The central bank also said bank reserve rations would be lowered
by 1.71 percentage points to 6.29 percent, again to encourage
lending.
	   Although the People's Bank cut interest rates in March, domestic
consumption remains weak. The sluggishness is occurring at a
sensitive time for the government. It has set a target of 8 percent
growth rate this year _ the threshold needed to generate jobs as
state factories lay off workers in a government-ordered overhaul.
	   Two reliable engines of economic growth, foreign investment and
exports, appear to be slowing, victims of Asia's prolonged
financial upheaval.
	   Recent commentary in the state-run China Daily complained that
despite rate cuts, real interest rates remain high due to declining
inflation.

Coalition launches effort to halt use of children in war 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Campaigners against the use of children as
soldiers launched a coalition Tuesday to press governments for
strict international legal protection of under-18s.
	   ``The use of children as soldiers has no place in civilized
society and must be stopped,'' said Stuart Maslen, coordinator of
the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers.
	   The campaign, based near Geneva, is headed by a committee of six
organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights
Watch.
	   It estimates that more than 300,000 children worldwide under 18
years old are involved in armed conflicts, and at least as many
again are in armed forces not currently fighting.
	   The launch came a day after the U.N. Security Council demanded
an immediate end to the practice of arming children.
	   Organizers said the coalition is a response to the failure of
negotiations to add to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child a non-binding resolution raising the age of participation in
war to 18 from 15.
	   In February, the United States was among countries that opposed
an international move to make 18 the minimum age for young soldiers
going to war.
	   Washington fears that the proposed new standard could constrain
recruitment and training, and is skeptical about adding new norms
when old ones are not respected.
	   The U.N. refugee agency welcomed the move to draw attention to
``children serving as cannon fodder in wars throughout the world.''
	   ``Half of the refugee population worldwide are children, and
refugee populations are probably one of the most exposed people,''
said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.

Iranian students call for reinstatement of interior minister 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 2,000 students gathered at Tehran
University Tuesday in a show of support for the impeached interior
minister, Abdollah Nouri, and demanded that he be reinstated.
	   The impeachment of Nouri, a moderate cleric, was a major setback
for President Mohammad Khatami's efforts at reform.
	   ``We ask the president not to compromise when he names a new
interior minister and to maintain his principles,'' said Maisam
Saeedi, one of the students at the meeting.
	   Throughout the two-hour meeting, the crowd shouted, ``Nouri
should be reinstated, Nouri is our interior minister.''
	   In a demonstration of Khatami's backing for Nouri, Ataollah
Mohajerani, the popular minister of cultural affairs and Islamic
guidance, and the acting interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh,
attended the meeting, which was organized by a student coalition.
	   Nouri, a prominent supporter of Khatami, was impeached June 21
after he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament, or Majlis, which
is dominated by hard-liners. But Khatami swiftly countered by
naming him to a newly created post of deputy president.
	   Students urged Khatami not to allow Nouri's impeachment to
affect the reforms he initiated after taking office in August.
	   Mohajerani suggested there was foul play during the impeachment
and told the meeting that a second vote should be taken.
	   ``There is a serious suspicion about the no-confidence vote and
the Majlis should clarify the issue for the people by voting
again,'' he said to thunderous applause. Others shouted, ``The
Majlis is incompetent and the Majlis should be dissolved.''
	   Nouri said his impeachment was a valuable lesson that
highlighted divisions in the government, where a battle is being
played out between Khatami's supporters and hard-liners who fear
that his reforms will undo the revolution.
	   Khatami's landslide victory shook the foundations of Iran's
clerical rule, brought to power in the 1979 revolution. The
president has tried to use his popularity to ease some of the
government's harsher social restrictions.
	   Hard-liners backed by Ali Khamenei, Iran's powerful spiritual
leader, have tried to discredit Khatami and his supporters.
	   ``The impeachment was very useful because it made it clear to
the people that some political factions and the majority of the
Majlis don't agree with the government's policies,'' Nouri said.
	   Hard-line deputies started impeachment proceedings against Nouri
last month, accusing him of jeopardizing Iran's stability and
allowing student rallies that protested the clergy's influence.
	   Unlike his predecessors, Nouri had granted permission to
students groups wanting to demonstrate. Some of those
demonstrations in the capital, Tehran, turned violent.

Israel cancels Palestinian cultural event in Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A fashion show, arts exhibit and song festival
planned to mark Palestinian Heritage Day in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem were canceled by Israeli police Tuesday, which claimed
the event undermines Israel's sovereignty over the disputed city.
	   The two-day event which was to begin on Wednesday and coincide
with Heritage Day, was sponsored by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. The Palestinians want to establish an
independent state with the eastern sector of the city as its
capital.
	   The two sides are to discuss the future of Jerusalem in talks on
a final peace settlement, but Israel's government has already said
it would never relinquish control over the east and calls any
official Palestinian activity a violation of peace accords and an
attempt to undermine Israeli control.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli police questioned the owner of the east
Jerusalem theater which booked the festival and told him to cancel
the events.
	   Jerusalem police spokeswoman Sigal Toledo said the owner, Ahmed
Abu Saloum was told that if the event takes place, police will shut
down his theater. ``We see the event as a demonstration sponsored
by the Palestinian Authority, not a festival,'' she said.
	   Last year, Israel passed a law to limit Authority activities in
the city and recently shut down a private Palestinian security firm
it charged was acting under Authority rules.
	   ``The police told me that we are violating the peace accords,''
said Abu Saloum, adding that he would not fight the police order.
	   The Palestinian Culture Minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, called the
Israeli ban on the events ``a racist, narrow-minded and stupid
decision.''
	   ``The world should condemn the prevention of a people from
marking their holidays and being proud of their heritage,'' Abed
Rabbo said in a statement released to the press.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams powered into the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday, trouncing the player who knocked
her sister out the tournament a day earlier.
	   Volleying with authority for the first time and showing an
all-court game which could make her a real title threat, Williams
needed just 62 minutes to beat Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1.
	   The prospect of a fourth-round meeting between Venus and her
sister was dashed Monday when 16-year-old Serena Williams failed to
get past Ruano-Pascual. Citing a calf injury, Serena quit the
third-round match while trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   Venus took pleasure in avenging that result.
	   ``I wanted to win every point, all the points that Serena
couldn't win yesterday,'' the 18-year-old American said. ``I didn't
like it when she (Ruano-Pascual) came back to 4-3. That was
negligent on my part. I had to get serious to make sure she didn't
get too many more games.''
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals were defending champion
Martina Hingis, last year's runnerup Jana Novotna and French Open
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 and No. 5
Sanchez Vicario rallied for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dominique Van
Roost.
	   Williams will face Novotna in the quarters, while Hingis will
play Sanchez Vicario.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras moved closer to
his fifth title in six years by beating French qualifier Sebastian
Grosjean 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the quarters.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set so far, finished the match
with his 13th and 14th aces. He was never broken, faced only one
break point and broke Grosjean four times.
	   ``I felt pretty good today,'' Sampras said. ``I haven't played a
baseliner until today, which was a little bit unusual. I'm playing
pretty well, holding serve pretty handily. It's been a pretty good
week.''
	   Sampras, whose third-round match was stretched over four days
because of rain delays, was happy to get this one over so quickly.
	   ``It was nice to start a match and complete a match in one
day,'' he said.
	   Sampras will, 11th graf

Witness testifies against WW II camp commander 
</HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A survivor of Croatia's World War II
concentration camp of Jasenovac said Tuesday during pre-trial
testimony about camp conditions that its commander was present at a
hanging, a lawyer said.
	   Dragan Roler, who spent three years at Jasenovac, testified
before an investigative judge looking into pressing charges against
Dinko Sakic, the camp commander recently extradited by Argentina.
	   Roler spoke in closed testimony. Sakic's attorney, Ivan Kern,
said Roler testified his client was present at a camp hanging but
did not further implicate him.
	   Sakic, 76, is suspected by the Zagreb district court of
committing crimes against humanity while running Jasenovac and a
nearby camp of Stara Gradiska. Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews,
Gypsies and Croat insurgents were killed in the camp, either as
political opponents or because of racially motivated hate.
	   The indictment charges Sakic and associates of carrying out
``killings and torture of civilians by commanding and organizing
the camp.'' He also is charged with ``personally ordering'' war
crimes and participating in them and of not preventing his
subordinates from committing such crimes.
	   Sakic, now in Zagreb's main prison, fled Croatia in 1945 when
its World War II Nazi puppet state was crushed. He lived quietly in
Argentina until April, when he acknowledged that he ran Jasenovac
in an interview.
	   His claims that ``nothing happened'' there and that detainees
were dying ``of natural death,'' outraged survivors and prompted
his extradition to Croatia earlier this month.
	   Roler's testimony is to be followed by other survivors' and
historians' hearings, which will likely result in an indictment and
trial.
	   Sakic case is forcing Croats to confront the darkest pages of
their history.
	   The number of Jasenovac victims has never been ascertained.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman estimated it at about 60,000,
while Serbs, the majority of the victims, claim the figure exceeds
500,000. The United States Justice Department says about 120,000
people died there.
	   Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, whose efforts led to Sakic's arrest
and extradition, arrived to Croatia on Tuesday. He has asked the
Argentine government to arrest and extradite Sakic's wife, Nada on
suspicion of war crimes. She allegedly ran the female camp of Stara
Gradiska.

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services Palestinians could live with presidential statement sted resolution, but that language still unclear; UPDATES with Richardson saying US regretted Israeli decision. TRIMS.

Eds: UPDATES with diplomatic source saying United States and
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Over U.S. objections, the Security Council
began debate Tuesday on Arab calls to condemn Israel's decision to
extend municipal services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements in
the West Bank.
	   The Palestinian U.N. representative, M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, opened
the debate by urging the 15-member council to adopt an
Arab-sponsored resolution that calls on Israel to stop what it
called illegal settlement expansion because it constitutes ``a
major obstacle to peace.''
	   ``We hope that the council will have the sufficient will to
finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee the
rescinding of the plan and to prevent Israel, the occupying power,
from undertaking any further illegal actions in Jerusalem and the
rest of the occupied territories,'' Al-Kidwa said.
	   The council was meeting at the request of Arab envoys to the
United Nations despite a U.S. request to postpone the meeting and
its objections to any resolution condemning Israel.
	   Mindful of the U.S. position, Britain's ambassador, John Weston,
suggested Tuesday the council might instead adopt a presidential
statement. Such a statement wouldn't carry the weight of
international law as a resolution would.
	   A council source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and the Palestinians could live with such a
presidential statement _ but that the exact language was still up
for negotiation.
	   The United States had argued that any council action would
inflame passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the
stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Israel, too, said the council had no role in taking up the
dispute.
	   ``This is entirely an internal Israeli matter on the municipal
administrative level rather than on the international level,'' said
Israel's ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   He defended Israel's June 21 decision to put some Jewish
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning, as a move to bolster the
city's economy.
	   ``This is not a new political program affecting the political
status of Jerusalem,'' Gold told the council. ``This is not a plan
to gerrymander district lines in order to affect political
outlines.
	   ``It consists of a municipal blueprint for bolstering the city's
economy and infrastructure.''
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said he welcomed
Israel's assurances that the decision wasn't political in nature,
but he said the United States nevertheless regretted it.
	   ``Logic suggests and reality demands that no action be taken
that would prejudge or prejudice an issue of such sensitivity,'' as
the status of Jerusalem, which he called ``one of the most
sensitive and emotionally charged issues in the Arab-Israeli peace
process.''
	   He repeated the U.S. position that the council should not get
involved in the dispute until both sides asked for it.
	   ``In the end, of course, the council cannot and should not
interject itself into issues that the parties themselves have
decided will be dealt with in face-to-face negotiations,''
Richardson said.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But resorting to a veto is considered
a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent member is
unable to muster majority support.
	   Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved the plan over U.S.
protests.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help restart
the stalled peace talks.

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ The lake island where Princess
Diana is buried, and a new museum dedicated to her memory, go on
public view at her family home Wednesday.
	   Her brother, Earl Spencer, has opened the grounds of Althorp,
the family estate in rural Northamptonshire, through Aug. 30.
Visitors will not be allowed on to the island where Diana is
buried, and the exact location of the grave is not marked.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets _ called ``invitations to visit'' _ have
been sold at prices ranging from 5 pounds (dlrs 8) for children to
7.50 pounds (dlrs 12) for senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15)
for adults.
	   Spencer set up the museum in a grand stable block built in the
1730s. The displays include the spectacular dress Diana wore at her
wedding to Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981, personal
effects from Diana's childhood, family photographs and home movies.
	   Jewelry on display includes Diana's necklaces, tiaras and a
crown. And in one room, mannequins are dressed in some of the
outfits she wore at public functions, together with pictures of her
wearing them.
	   Visitors will see Diana's school uniform, her candy box, school
reports and letters home. Video displays illustrate her
humanitarian work and the public reaction to her death. The first
draft of Earl Spencer's funeral speech is also displayed.
	   Admission to the museum is included in the ticket price.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, ``but not
cheapening her memory in any way,'' the estate says.
	   Diana died Aug. 31 following a car crash in Paris, and was
buried in a private family ceremony on Sept. 6 following her
funeral at Westminster Abbey in London.

Cuban foreign minister welcomes EU decision on closer ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
on Tuesday welcomed the European Union's decision to grant Cuba
observer status in negotiations between the EU and 71 developing
countries.
	   ``We've both moved ahead, this is an important step,'' Robaina
told deputies at the European parliament.
	   On Monday EU foreign ministers agreed to grant Cuba an observer
status in its negotiations to renew a trade and aid agreement with
the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries who form the ACP
group.
	   These countries benefit under the Lome Convention from trade
privileges with the EU. The current convention is due to expire in
2000 and negotiations are due to start soon to renew it.
	   Robaina discussed Cuba's bid to join the ACP group with the EU
Development Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro and Manuel Marin,
the commissioner for relations with Latin America.
	   Robaina said becoming an observer would counterbalance efforts
to isolate Cuba.
	   ``Despite all the manoeuvers to try and put it in the sidelines,
Cuba has diplomatic relations with 164 states,'' he told the
European Parliament's committee on relations with the ACP group.
	   The minister lashed out at parliamentarians who questioned him
about Cuba's human rights record. ``Cuba is perfectly happy to talk
about human rights with anyone, but there is discriminatory
treatment attached to the issue,'' he said.
	   He evaded questions on four high-profile jailed dissidents,
opposition politician Vladimiro Roca, economists Marta Roque and
Felix Bonne and lawyer Rene Gomez, arrested in a security sweep
last July and held without trial ever since.
	   ``Rather than asking what will happen with these four
individuals, why not ask what these individuals have done?'' he
said.

World Cup: Mexicans believe their game has come of age 
</HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ To hear Manuel Lapuente tell it, a
second-round exit from the World Cup isn't disappointing for
Mexico, it's a sign that the North American nation's game has come
of age.
	   With three second-half rallies in the first round, the only time
Mexico stumbled was with the lead, shocking Germany with a goal
just after halftime but allowing two in the final 15 minutes to
fall 2-1.
	   Monday's loss knocked Mexico out of the World Cup for the second
straight time in the round-of-16.
	   Mexico had never won a World Cup game in Europe before a 3-1
first-round victory over South Korea in its France '98 opener. In
its next two matches, against Belgium and the Netherlands, it fell
behind 2-0 but rallied for draws both times.
	   After struggling through qualifying and enduring a huge swell of
criticism at home, including a cynical media that dubbed the team
``El Tritanic'' instead of its more common nickname ``El
Tricolor,'' the team not only made the second round but gave the
reigning European champions a scare.
	   And that, coach Lapuente says, is Mexico's great achievement.
	   ``I'm satisfied, we've changed the face of Mexican soccer.
Today, we're among the best teams,'' Lapuente said.
	   ``Mexican players have shown true character. They know how to
play the game.''
	   Goalkeeper Jorge Campos, a veteran of the national team that
reached the second round in the 1994 Cup in the United States, said
Mexico has earned ``a new image.''
	   ``If we lost against Germany it's because of a lack of
experience. This World Cup was a huge step for Mexican soccer,'' he
said.
	   That the team advanced to the second round seems more remarkable
considering it hobbled into the Cup after several lopsided losses
against fellow qualifiers and some second-rate club teams. Back
home, fans and the media alike screamed for Lapuente's job.
	   ``We weren't looking for medals, we were getting ready to win in
a World Cup,'' said Lapuente, who replaced Bora Milutinovic as head
coach in late November, shortly after Mexico qualified for the Cup.
	   This is the 11th time Mexico has qualified for the World Cup
finals, but it never has advanced past the second round outside of
Mexico. Twice it reached the quarterfinals, 1970 and 1986, both
times when it hosted the quadrennial championship.
	   Some of Mexico's troubles in the run-up to France were due to
the change in styles.
	   ``Mexico improved under Lapuente,'' team captain Alberto Garcia
Aspe said. ``We improved in many areas. With Bora we had a set
style for every match. But with Manuel every game is different,
depending on whom we're playing.''
	   The changes payed off: Mexico finished even on points with the
Netherlands for the lead in Group E with five points, and finished
second on goal difference.
	   ``We turned out not to be anyone's piece of cake, as everyone
thought,'' Lapuente said.
	   Indeed, Mexican soccer has had a tough time earning respect
outside the CONCACAF.
	   Within CONCACAF, it had been the unchallenged power for decades,
but in the last few years has heard the United States closing in
behind it.
	   After qualifying losses to Jamaica and Honduras and a draw at
home to the United States in which it had a man advantage for
nearly an hour, not much was expected of Mexico in France.
	   Many claimed that the qualifying disappointments were more
indicative of their standings than the two strong Copa America
performances, where it lost to Argentina in the 1993 final and
reached the semifinals in 1997.
	   After their run in the 1998 World Cup, they're at least making
believers of themselves.
	   ``I can guarantee that from now on, Mexico will be very
strong,'' Lapuente said.

Oil company plan to invest in Iran touches nerve in Norway 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A member of the Saga Petroleum board, who
also is on the board of Salman Rushdie's Norwegian publisher,
resigned Tuesday to protest the company's proposal to invest in
Iran.
	   ``I can see that it might be economically correct to search for
new areas to where Saga's expertise can lead to growth and profits
... (but) I have also seen how the fatwa works in practice,'' Leif
Frode Onarheim said in a prepared statement.
	   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 issued a religious
edict called a fatwa, calling for the death of Rushdie, whose novel
``The Satanic Verses'' he deemed blasphemous to Islam.
	   Onarheim is also board chairman of the Aschehaug Publishing
House, whose director William Nygaard was shot and badly wounded in
1993. Nygaard and Rushdie both said they believe the shooting was
connected to the fatwa.
	   Aschehaug published the Norwegian translation of ``The Satanic
Verses.''

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Dirk Nowitzki, the German basketball star, said
Tuesday he will play for the Dallas Mavericks next season rather
than continuing to play in Europe.
	   Nowitzki, who had said earlier said would need two more seasons
before he was ready for the U.S. National Basketball Association,
was drafted ninth overall by Milwaukee last week, then traded to
Dallas. Mavericks officials flew to Germany the next day to try to
recruit him.
	   Nowitzki arrived Sunday in Dallas, stayed at the home of
coach-general manager Don Nelson, spoke to reporters and attended a
barbecue Monday with prospective teammates that night. A news
conference was scheduled for Tuesday to discuss his decision.
	   ``Nellie called me 20 minutes ago and said he's agreed to play
here,'' team spokesman Tony Fay said of his conversation with
Nelson.
	   The 20-year-old Nowitzki said he was concerned that his game
wasn't polished enough for the NBA and he wanted to make sure he
was free to help the German national team qualify for the Olympics.
	   Nelson assured Nowitzki he's ready and the Mavericks have agreed
to let him leave the team in the fall and winter to play for his
country's squad.
	   The 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter), 237-pound (108-kilo) Nowitzki faced
a Tuesday deadline to decide whether he would play for the
Mavericks. Negotiations would be barred after midnight because of a
lockout.
	   Nowitzki planned to return to Germany later Tuesday.
	   Nelson did not want Nowitzki to return to Germany unsigned
because he would be free to negotiate with European clubs.
	   The Mavericks cannot offer him a contract because the rookie
salary scale is one of the items in the labor dispute between the
owners and players.

Galina Brezhnev, daughter of former Soviet leader, dead at 69 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Galina Brezhnev, the flamboyant daughter of former
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, has died, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said Tuesday. She was 69.
	   Galina Brezhnev died in a Moscow hospital and will be cremated
on Wednesday, ITAR-Tass said, quoting unidentified medical sources.
	   It did not give the cause of death or any other details.
	   Galina Brezhnev was in the news more often than most relatives
of Kremlin leaders during the Soviet era, when wives and offspring
were practically state secrets.
	   In 1982, Soviet sources leaked reports that a ranking circus
official with whom she was friendly had been arrested in a bribery
scandal. Another circus performer known as Boris the Gypsy, also
said to be her friend, had been arrested earlier and a valuable art
collection was confiscated from his apartment, the reports said.
	   Westerners theorized at the time that the story was floated to
discredit Leonid Brezhnev and promote the political career of Yuri
V. Andropov, then chief of the KGB secret police. Andropov
succeeded to the leadership when Leonid Brezhnev died in November
1982.
	   Galina Brezhnev's husband, Yuri Churbanov, was convicted in 1988
of taking bribes after a trial that exposed corruption at the
highest levels of the Kremlin.
	   Coming in the early years of economic and political reform under
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the case also sent an
important political signal that no one was above the law. He was
released from prison in 1993.
	   Galina Brezhnev was accused in Soviet news accounts of
speculating in diamonds. She often was seen driving her father's
Mercedes car through the streets of Moscow.
	   Details on survivors was not immediately available.
	   Leonid Brezhnev, who led the Soviet Union from 1964 until his
death, is buried alongside the Kremlin wall.

World Cup: Croatia upsets Romania 1-0 in second round 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Newcomer Croatia advanced to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup on Tuesday, beating Romania 1-0 on
Davor Suker's penalty kick in first-half injury time.
	   Croatia, which gained independence seven years ago, became the
first nation to make the final eight in its World Cup debut since
East Germany in 1974. The Croats next face European champion
Germany on Saturday at Lyon.
	   Suker's third goal of the tournament was the highlight of a game
controlled mostly by the Croatians, even after Romania substituted
two strikers for two midfielders in a vain attempt to generate
scoring chances in the second half.
	   The penalty, however, wasn't without dispute. Argentine referee
Javier Castrilli called the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu,
whose legs became entangled with those of Aljosa Asanovic as they
chased Dario Simic's pass in the penalty area. Popescu protested
with arms raised high, but to no avail.
	   Suker slotted his right-footed spot kick just inside the right
post on his second attempt. His first try, almost an identical good
kick, was waived off by Castrilli after at least two Croatian
players encroached into the penalty arc.
	   Though Romania pressed in the second half, Suker and his
teammates continued to create the better scoring chances. Romanian
defender Liviu Ciobotariu nearly had to tackle Zvonimir Boban to
keep him from converting Suker's cross in the 55th minute, and
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea had to stop two point-blank shots from
substitute Petar Krpan in second-half injury time.
	   There was more end-to-end action in the first half as opposing
strikers Suker and Adrian Ilie tried to force the scoring chances.
	   The Croatians kept Stelea busy from the opening whistle. The
keeper denied Suker from close range, leaped to push away Goran
Vlaovic's long drive and made a reflex save on Asanovic's shot _
all in the first 15 minutes.
	   Ilie was creative at the other end for Romania, winning spot
kicks deep in Croatian territory. But his teammates were unable to
convert any of the chances, and Ilie's best opportunity to set up a
goal failed when he couldn't lift his cross over approaching
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic with wide-open teammate Dan Petrescu
waiting in front of the net.
	   The Croats played without central defender Zvonimir Soldo, who
was suspended after receiving two yellow cards in the first round.

Family of Scottish tourist sues Israel for a million shekels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The family of a deceased Scottish tourist whose
body was returned to them without the heart, is suing Israel for 1
million shekels (approx. dlrs 280,000), their lawyer said.
	   Alistair Sinclair committed suicide in an Israeli jail in April
after being arrested on suspicion of drug smuggling. Israel
performed an autopsy on the body and removed the heart before
shipping it back to the family in Scotland in May.
	   Israeli authorities have acknowledged that they failed to inform
the family that the heart was missing. Israeli forensic experts
have said Sinclair's heart was removed to examine it for signs of
disease but the tests had not been completed when the body was
returned.
	   The family only discovered the heart was missing from Scottish
doctors who performed a second autopsy. By the time Israel shipped
the heart separately to the family earlier this month.
	   Their Israeli lawyer, Nitzana Darshen-Lietner, claimed that
Sinclair was falsely arrested. She said the family is suing for
pain and suffering caused by the incident, plus compensation for
the cost of shipping the body home and genetic testing being done
on the heart.

Russia urges U.S. restraint in Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia urged the United States on Tuesday to
exercise restraint after an American F-16 fighter jet fired a
missile at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern
Iraq.
	   ``It is necessary to localize the incident and prevent its
escalation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told
the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We don't have complete information about what has happened,''
Rakhmanin said, adding that Moscow would make inquiries in Baghdad
and Washington.
	   The American fighter jet had been accompanying British Tornadoes
enforcing the southern no-fly zone when Iraqi radar illuminated the
British planes, signaling an intention to fire, the Pentagon said
in Washington.
	   The planes returned safely to base.

Family of Scottish tourist sues Israel over missing heart 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The family of a deceased Scottish tourist whose
body was returned to them without the heart is suing Israel for 1
million shekels (dlrs 280,000), their lawyer said.
	   Alistair Sinclair committed suicide in an Israeli jail in April
after he was arrested on suspicion of drug smuggling. Israel
performed an autopsy on the body and removed the heart before
shipping it back to the family in Scotland in May.
	   Israeli authorities have acknowledged that they failed to inform
the family that the heart was missing. Israeli forensic experts
have said Sinclair's heart was removed to examine it for signs of
disease but the tests had not been completed when the body was
returned.
	   The family learned that the heart was missing from Scottish
doctors who performed a second autopsy. Israel shipped the heart to
the family earlier this month.
	   Their Israeli lawyer, Nitzana Darshen-Lietner, claimed that
Sinclair was falsely arrested. She said the family is suing for
pain and suffering caused by the incident, plus compensation for
the cost of shipping the body home and genetic testing being done
on the heart.

Program for sustainable forests running ahead of schedule 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A plan to protect world forests is running six
months ahead of schedule, as loggers, manufacturers and retailers
join hands with conservationists to place 10 million hectares (25
million acres) in a sustainable management program, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   As fires consumed tropical forests from Southeast Asia to the
Amazon this winter, the Forest Stewardship Council worked with
governments and industrialists to protect an area half the size of
the United Kingdom.
	   ``What we are seeing with the recent flare-up of forest
destruction, fires, is all the tip of the iceberg of a long process
that is leading increasingly to fragmentation of forest area, a
change of micro-climates... caused partially but not exclusively by
increased commercial exploitation,'' said Claude Martin. He is
director general of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (known in the
United States as the World Wildlife Fund),the main sponsor of the
program.
	   The area under stewardship is just a tiny fraction of the
world's original forests. Since the 1960s, wood consumption has
doubled and paper use has more than tripled. Each year, at least
another 16 million hectares (40 million acres) of natural forest
are razed, an area the size of the United Kingdom. Two thirds of
the globe's original forests have been destroyed, and only 6
percent are under any sort of protection, Martin said.
	   The Forest Stewardship Council aims to increase the land under
its protection by 100 percent per year for the foreseeable future,
said Tim Synnott, director of the program. The project, based in
Oaxaca, Mexico, embraces 115 forests in 25 countries.
	   A big recent boost came with the participation of AssiDoman, a
Swedish wood and pulp manufacturer that is the world's largest
publicly held owner of forests, with 3.3 million hectares (8
million acres.)
	   ``Our foresters came to the conclusion that we could not
continue'' clearing forests, said company chief executive Lennart
Ahlgren.
	   Instead, he said, AssiDoman harvests trees selectively, leaving
the forest intact. The forests are certified as sustainable by
experts licensed by the council.
	   The program got another lift with the participation of the Roda
Group, the largest forestry company in Bolivia, logging 650,000
hectares (1.6 million acres, said company director Cristobal Roda.

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded
Albanian rebel strongholds in Kosovo with tanks and mortars
Tuesday, sending thousands of villagers streaming in the second day
of a major offensive that threatens to engulf a wider region.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes in the conflict this year. Another said
both sides were guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to halt the steadily worsening conflict.
	   Fierce fighting was under way Tuesday between Yugoslav and
Serbian security forces and the fast-growing Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Serb forces, intent on retaking the strategically important
Belacevac open-pit mine which fell to the KLA last week, trained
heavy firepower on the area around the mine.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo.
	   Throughout the day, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of a ridge
overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and
mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _ all fired on
the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment of the area, Serb forces ceased
their fire about 6 a.m., then resumed it a few hours later after
changing their positions. At least four other villages also were
shelled Tuesday.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked 19-year-old Saban
Gadeni, a 19-year-old economics student at the University of
Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, said in
Oslo, Norway, that the conflict has reached a critical stage. He
said Americans were still trying to mediate.
	   ``One problem is that, on the military side, there is no clear
Albanian chain of command with which to deal when on talks about a
cease-fire. This is a marked difference from Bosnia,'' said
Holbrooke, who mediated the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, however, that the KLA
should not be part of talks with its ally Yugoslavia.
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to Associated Press offices in the Balkans,
the respected private watchdog group said it had ``powerful
evidence'' that Serb police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified
number of ethnic Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said the
KLA siege of Kijevo town ``affects civilians and other
non-combatants in the town.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International also said the vast
majority of the victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90
percent of the population in Kosovo. But it said Serbs also are
suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' the international human rights organization said.
	   The wife and mother of two Serbs kidnapped Monday by the KLA
appealed to the militants Tuesday to release them.
	   ``My 18-year-old son Ivan's childhood was ruined by the war in
Croatia where we lived, now his youth is ruined in Kosovo,'' said
Vesna Bakrac. The men reportedly were taken off a bus by armed
Albanians on Monday along with two other Serbs.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday in Shanghai, China.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Roman Catholics will pray for all victims of

	   Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz and the pope's representative
in Russia, Archbishop John Bokovsky, are expected to attend the
funeral in St. Petersburg on July 17.
	   The Russian Orthodox church hierarchy has decided not to
attended the burial of Nicholas II, his family and servants,
although it has said that local priests in St. Petersburg can take
part in the service.
	   The Russian Orthodox church says it still has doubts about the
identities of nine sets of remains found in Yekaterinburg where the
czar was executed by Bolsheviks 80 years ago.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A cure for AIDS? Not yet. But scientists are
seriously mapping strategies to achieve this ultimate goal, once so
distant it was hardly mentioned aloud.
	   Treatment with drug combinations can stop the inexorable
progression of HIV infection to sickness and death. But this means
a lifetime of expensive treatment with 15 or 20 daily pills that
often carry unpleasant side effects.
	   At this week's 12th World AIDS Conference, researchers talked of
plans for going the next step. Their intention: Rid the body of HIV
completely or reduce it so drastically that the body's own immune
defenses can hold the virus in check without drugs.
	   ``Cure of HIV infection is not a myth,'' Dr. Roberto Siliciano
of Johns Hopkins University said Tuesday. ``I think this is a
problem that can be solved.''
	   However, he and others acknowledged this will not be easy.
Several reports at the conference described one large barrier to
wiping out HIV, and there may be more that scientists haven't even
discovered yet.
	   Even though AIDS drugs can eliminate all detectable signs of the
virus in the bloodstream, researchers have learned that some cells
stay infected for many years, leaving a reservoir of potentially
deadly virus.
	   These are called memory T cells. Ordinarily, their job is to sit
quietly, holding the image of a germ in case it comes back. Perhaps
1 million of these HIV-infected cells linger on after AIDS
treatment. They would amount to no more than a tiny dot if somehow
isolated in a test tube.
	   No one knows precisely how long these cells live.
	   Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New
York City presented new evidence that they gradually die off, but
it would take 10 years for them to go away completely. But in the
meantime, they are often replaced as tiny amounts of virus in the
bloodstream continue to infect more memory T cells.
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, attempted to purge the infected memory cells
by triggering them to spring to life with hormones.
	   In theory, the activated memory cells would release their virus
and die. Antiviral drugs would catch the released virus, and the
infected memory cells would be eliminated. However, Fauci said a
single round of this treatment left some infected cells still
living, although repeated attempts might eventually clean them out.
	   However, this approach will ultimately fail if memory cells keep
getting infected. Another strategy is to first give patients higher
doses of existing AIDS drugs _ or perhaps use more powerful ones
still in testing stages _ in an attempt to halt the new infections.
Then doctors could try to erase the remaining reservoir.
	   However, none of this may even be necessary.
	   ``It may be that you don't have to eliminate it,'' said Fauci.
	   For various reasons, some HIV-infected people have stopped
taking their medicines after a year or two. Ordinarily, this makes
virus levels shoot up. But to doctors' surprise, their virus counts
sometimes stay so low they are undetectable.
	   Researchers theorize that these people's immune systems
recovered enough to keep the virus in check. The result: They stay
well without taking drugs.
	   Doctors are looking for ways to recreate this situation more
predictably. Ho suggested giving a vaccine to stimulate the body's
natural anti-HIV defenses before AIDS drugs are withdrawn. The
immune system could keep the virus in check, just as seems to be
happening in those who stopped their drugs.
	   A cure is the ultimate goal in AIDS, said Ho, and ``we shouldn't
apologize for wanting to achieve it.''

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ French police aided by a British
hooligan-spotter arrested an English suspect before a World Cup
match Tuesday, in a city tense from overnight clashes between
soccer fans and local youths, officials said.
	   Authorities nearly doubled security forces to about 1,600 police
for the evening match between England and Argentina, out of concern
over new violence by local youths as well as fans from the two
visiting countries that fought a war in 1982.
	   The English suspect stepped off a train in this southeastern
town when a British officer identified the man as a ``category C''
soccer fan, considered among the most dangerous.
	   The officer alerted French police, who tried to check the
identity of the 25-year-old man. The suspect gave a policeman a
soccer-style headshot and was arrested, police said on customary
anonymity.
	   Authorities said the suspect was subject to expulsion or a quick
French court trial.
	   Overnight, North African French youths clashed with English fans
at an outdoor screen showing a World Cup match.
	   Authorities stopped the screening of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match late Monday while violence spread to an area around the
stadium, where the local youths burned several cars.
	   Police said the incident began when the local youths from poor
neighborhoods, seeking to avenge English-Tunisians clashes after a
match in Marseille two weeks earlier, insulted, then struck English
fans.
	   The English fought back and CRS riot police intervened,
arresting nine French and one English fan. Police dogs were
deployed to help maintain security, authorities said.
	   Police arrested more than 700 people, expelled more than a
dozen, and turned away more than 500 at the border since the World
Cup began June 10, the Interior Ministry has said.
	   The ministry has tallied at least 3,200 injuries, most of them
slight. About 400 were hospitalized, including a policeman in a
coma who was attacked by German neo-Nazis in Lens.
	   The policeman was showing signs of improvement, doctors said
Tuesday.
	   Doctors treating Daniel Nivel, 44, said the officer was reacting
to stimulation and there were signs he was gradually coming out of
the coma, although they stressed his condition was still critical.
	   Nivel was hit on the head with an iron bar minutes after a World
Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when groups of neo-Nazis
rampaged through Lens, a town in northern France.
	   Two Germans have been placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.

Opposition walks out of Ivory Coast constitution vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Ivory Coast's parliament voted
unanimously Tuesday to grant President Henri Konan Bedie sweeping
powers to cancel elections or delay polling results.
	   The vote to radically change the country's constitution was
boycotted by opposition members, some of whom walked out of
Parliament after accusing Bedie of wanting to spring a
``constitutional coup d'Etat.''
	   Boga Doudou, leader of the country's main opposition group, the
Ivorian Popular Front, also accused Bedie of ``behaving like a
monarch.''
	   The proposals were passed by a vote of 144-0 in the 175-member
Parliament.
	   Most of the controversy centered on a section of the
constitutional proposals which would grant the president powers to
cancel national elections or delay announcement of elections
results.
	   Opposition leaders are also furious about clauses extending the
presidential mandate from five to seven years, creating a second
chamber _ one-third of whose members would be appointed by the
president _ and altering majority voting rules.
	   International human rights organizations and opposition groups
have sharply criticized Bedie, who took power in December 1993, and
then won presidential elections in October 1995.

World Cup: Croatia upsets Romania 1-0 in second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Suker quote; optional upcoming
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Newcomer Croatia advanced to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup on Tuesday, beating Romania 1-0 on
Davor Suker's penalty kick in first-half injury time.
	   Croatia, which gained independence seven years ago, became the
first nation to make the final eight in its World Cup debut since
East Germany in 1974. The Croats next face European champion
Germany on Saturday at Lyon.
	   Suker's third goal of the tournament was the highlight of a game
controlled mostly by the Croatians, even after Romania substituted
two strikers for two midfielders in a vain attempt to generate
scoring chances in the second half.
	   The penalty, however, wasn't without dispute. Argentine referee
Javier Castrilli called the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu,
whose legs became entangled with those of Aljosa Asanovic as they
chased Dario Simic's pass in the penalty area. Popescu protested
with arms raised high, but to no avail.
	   Suker slotted his right-footed spot kick just inside the right
post on his second attempt. His first try, almost an identical good
kick, was waived off by Castrilli after at least two Croatian
players encroached into the penalty arc.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''
	   Though Romania pressed in the second half, Suker and his
teammates continued to create the better scoring chances. Romanian
defender Liviu Ciobotariu nearly had to tackle Zvonimir Boban to
keep him from converting Suker's cross in the 55th minute, and
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea had to stop two point-blank shots from
substitute Petar Krpan in second-half injury time.
	   There was more end-to-end action in the first half as opposing
strikers Suker and Adrian Ilie tried to force the scoring chances.
	   The Croatians kept Stelea busy from the opening whistle. The
keeper denied Suker from close range, leaped to push away Goran
Vlaovic's long drive and made a reflex save on Asanovic's shot _
all in the first 15 minutes.
	   Ilie was creative at the other end for Romania, winning spot
kicks deep in Croatian territory. But his teammates were unable to
convert any of the chances, and Ilie's best opportunity to set up a
goal failed when he couldn't lift his cross over approaching
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic with wide-open teammate Dan Petrescu
waiting in front of the net.
	   The Croats played without central defender Zvonimir Soldo, who
was suspended after receiving two yellow cards in the first round.

Iraq denies its radar locked on to allied planes

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq denied Tuesday that its radar locked
on to four British patrol planes and called the firing of a U.S.
missile ``proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pentagon officials said a U.S. F-16 fighter fired the missile at
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq Tuesday
after Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes.
	   The fighter was accompanying the British Tornadoes enforcing the
southern no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to base.
	   But the Iraqi official said no radar was illuminated, and the
missile fell 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the nearest radar.
	   ``This aggression is probably a plan for a new all-out
aggression against Iraq,'' the official said. ``This is the proof
of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   The incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq. The firing of
the missile was standard response to Iraq's locking its radar on
any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.

World Cup: Past disputes relived at Argentina-England match AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Scott Astle wants England to win
because Argentina sunk the frigate HMS Coventry off the Falkland
Islands, and his team is Coventry. Other English soccer fans
remember the despised ``Hand of God'' dealt to them in 1986.
	   And the Argentines are desperate to be champions of the world
for the third time. They particularly want to cream the English,
whose long-since retired coach called them ``animals'' in 1966.
	   As the two nations square off in this football-mad industrial
city to decide who makes it to the World Cup quarterfinals, no one
thinks the game is only about football.
	   On the sun-splashed plaza by City Hall, the grudge match was
previewed with opposing cheers by enthusiastic rival hordes.
	   Argentines, leaping in the air in their sky blue and white
striped shirts, began chanting a Spanish word for sissies. Few of
their adversaries understood. Instead, they raised glasses of beer
for an answering chant:
	   ``You'll never touch the Falklands.''
	   Argentina declared war in 1982 when the military government in
Buenos Aires tried to end Britain's presence on the Falklands.
Possession of the small South Atlantic islands remains a sore point
with them.
	   For the English, the conflict is now mostly folklore. They worry
about the 1986 World Cup when Diego Maradona punched in a goal with
his fist unseen by the referee. Argentina won the match, 2-1, and
two game later won the Cup.
	   When questioned about his goal after the game, Maradona
responded: ``It was the hand of God.''
	   Astle, a 25-year-old student, had more than a sunken frigate in
mind. He came to France three weeks ago to follow his team. Robbed
the first day, he has worn the same gamey red shirt and floppy
off-white hat to Marseille, Toulouse, Lens and St. Etienne.
	   He got a ticket in England to the Lens game against Colombia,
but this one, like two others, had to be watched on TV in a bar.
``It's worth it,'' he said. ``I'm English.''
	   The ticket situation and French fears about English fans added
to the highly charged atmosphere. Only 2,000 tickets were available
to Britons, and up to 30,000 were expected in St. Etienne for the
game. Scalper prices are up to nearly dlrs 800.
	   On Monday night, just as the city's temporary alcohol-ban came
into effect and fans learned that the big video screen in the park
would not show the match, hundreds of riot police materialized to
clear the area.
	   That triggered insults, scuffles, and wild baton charges in the
city center.
	   Young ethnic North Africans joined in, beating up English
stragglers. Other youths attacked English fans near the stadium and
they burned several cars. Police arrested nine locals and an
Englishman.
	   Until the police appeared, hundreds of Englishmen, Argentines
and Frenchmen had been drinking peacefully together in the balmy
open air. A band played on a makeshift stage, and stands served up
beer and hot-dogs.
	   Police officials said they wanted to separate potentially
violent fans. But all sides faulted the French police for
overreacting.
	   ``Why did they do that?'' asked Ben Murphy, 22, an English
engineering student from Lincoln, as he watched columns of nervous
police in riot gear tighten cordons around the brightly lit City
Hall square.
	   ``This was ridiculous, just looking for trouble,'' said Mariano
Recalde, 26, a lawyer who flew from Buenos Aires to watch Argentina
play. ``We're just trying to get to our hotel, but we're blocked in
on all sides. The cops panic easily here, don't they?''
	   Recalde and his friends laughed when asked if they expected
Argentines to attack British fans. ``We want to beat them on the
field, and badly,'' he said. ``But that's all.''

	   The officer alerted French police, who tried to check the
identity of the 25-year-old man. The suspect gave a policeman a
soccer-style headshot and was arrested, police said on customary
anonymity.
	   Authorities said the suspect was subject to expulsion or a quick
French court trial.
	   Overnight, North African French youths clashed with English fans
at an outdoor screen showing a World Cup match.
	   Authorities stopped the screening of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match late Monday while violence spread to an area around the
stadium, where the local youths burned several cars.
	   Police said the incident began when the local youths from poor
neighborhoods, seeking to avenge English-Tunisians clashes after a
match in Marseille two weeks earlier, insulted, then struck English
fans.
	   The English fought back and CRS riot police intervened,
arresting nine French and one English fan. Police dogs were
deployed to help maintain security, authorities said.
	   Police arrested more than 700 people, expelled more than a
dozen, and turned away more than 500 at the border since the World
Cup began June 10, the Interior Ministry has said.
	   The ministry has tallied at least 3,200 injuries, most of them
slight. About 400 were hospitalized, including a policeman in a
coma who was attacked by German neo-Nazis in Lens.
	   The policeman was showing signs of improvement, doctors said
Tuesday.
	   Doctors treating Daniel Nivel, 44, said the officer was reacting
to stimulation and there were signs he was gradually coming out of
the coma, although they stressed his condition was still critical.
	   Nivel was hit on the head with an iron bar minutes after a World
Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when groups of neo-Nazis
rampaged through Lens, a town in northern France.
	   Two Germans have been placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.

Iraq denies its radar locked on to allied planes

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq denied Tuesday that its radar locked
on to four British patrol planes and called the firing of a U.S.
missile ``proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pentagon officials said a U.S. F-16 fighter fired the missile at
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq earlier
Tuesday after Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes.
	   The fighter was accompanying the British Tornadoes enforcing the
southern no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to base.
	   The Iraqi official said the missile fell 18 kilometers (11
miles) from the nearest radar.
	   ``This aggression is probably a plan for a new all-out
aggression against Iraq,'' the official said. ``This is the proof
of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   The incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq. The firing of
the missile was standard response to Iraq's locking its radar on
any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Dutch software company donated dlrs 1 million
to computerize the vast archives of Israel's Holocaust Memorial,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The Yad Vashem national Holocaust Museum has one of the world's
largest collections of materials from the World War II genocide
including 50,000 documents, 270,000 photographs and film reels, and
lists of 4 million victims killed by the Nazis.
	   Simcha Salach, who heads Yad Vashem's fundraising efforts, said
the donation by the Oikonomos Foundation, run by the
Netherlands-based Baan Company, will help preserve and disseminate
information in the next century.
	   The projected budget to computerize the archive and information
system of Yad Vashem is estimated at dlrs 10 million. Officials are
planning to assemble a consortium of hi-tech companies to donate
money and equipment for the project.
	   Six million Jews perished at the hands of the Nazis during World
War II. Some 300,000 survivors live in Israel

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's largest public sector
trade unions plan to launch a general strike to support telephone
workers protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company.
	   The member unions of the General Committee of Labor
Organizations voted in favor of the strike on Monday. They were
expected to join the walkout July 7. Members include more than
12,000 workers with the state water and electricity unions.
	   Sabotage by telephone workers protesting the telephone company's
sale has caused more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, Carmen Ana
Culpeper, the company's president, said Monday.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp., saying it will produce
severe job losses.
	   Also Monday, Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE announced that
Citibank had agreed to finance dlrs 1.5 billion of the purchase.
	   Talks on transfer of control of Puerto Rico Telephone operations
will begin ``in the coming weeks,'' GTE said in a statement.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The penalty kick that Yugoslav forward Pedrag
Mijatovic missed against the Netherlands ended a long streak of
success from the spot.
	   When Mijatovic's attempt crashed off the crossbar Monday night,
it ended a string of 38 consecutive penalty kicks converted in the
Cup, going back eight years.
	   Gianluca Vialli of Italy had the last miss, against the United
States on June 14, 1990.
	   In the 16 World Cups, players have converted 119 of 141
penalties, a rate of 84.5 percent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The ``golden goal'' might be lead in the next World
Cup.
	   The first goal in sudden-death extra time in World Cup history
was scored Sunday in the second round France-Paraguay match by
Laurent Blanc for France Sunday, but FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said Tuesday that the rule that ends the game in extra time could
be changed or omitted for the next World Cup.
	   ``The golden goal rule comes from the regulation of the
competition and not from the rules of the game,'' Cooper said. ``It
is the FIFA World Cup organizing committee that can change the
rule.''
	   Cooper said there were no decisions yet on whether the rule
would be used in the 2002 World Cup.
	   For now, FIFA is very happy with the arrangement because it has
led to aggressive play in extra time, Cooper said
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The idea for yellow and red cards, used by soccer
referees throughout the world to issue a warning or expulsion,
originated from a bitterly disputed quarterfinal match between
Argentina and England in the 1966 World Cup, FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said Tuesday.
	   That game was marred by numerous fouls on both sides. West
German referee Rudolf Kreitlein booked five players within the
first half hour.
	   The referee ejected Argentine captain Antonio Rattin in the 36th
minute. But Rattin refused to leave because he didn't understand
the referee. He finally walked off the field after eight minutes.
	   Cooper said that after driving home from the match, English
referee Ken Aston thought about a way to show more graphically what
a referee is trying to convey to the players. When he stopped his
car for a traffic light and saw it change between red and yellow,
Aston came up with the idea for red and yellow cards.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy and France will meet for the 31st
time when they square off in Friday's World Cup quarterfinal at St.
Denis.
	   Italy leads the series having won 17, lost six and drawn the
other seven.
	   However, the last World Cup clash between the two national teams
was won by France _ 2-0 in the second round at Mexico '86.
	   Their latest confrontation came in June last year during the
Tournoi de France, a test event for the World Cup, when the two
sides drew 2-2. Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff scored for the
French side and Pierluigi Casiraghi and Alessandro Del Piero for
Italy.
	   Going back into soccer history, Italy won its second World Cup
in 1938 on French soil after overcoming Norway in the second round
and France in the quarterfinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian coach Cesare Maldini said Tuesday
that Brazil and Denmark were the only World Cup teams which did not
struggle in their second-round matches.
	   ``Germany, France, the Netherlands and, in part, Italy had to
fight their way into the quarterfinals. This means all teams are
well prepared and technically good in the world competition.''
	   Maldini added that some losers, such as Mexico and Paraguay,
deserved a better fate and rejected criticism about Italy's play in
the match against Norway.
	   ``We received undue criticism after the match in Marseille ...
we played a good match,'' he said. ``Italy played the way it had to
play against the Norwegians.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LYON, France (AP) _ An England fan was expected to make a full
recovery after falling from a stand next to a giant television
screen used to show World Cup matches to fans without tickets.
	   A spokeswoman for the British consulate said Sean Glover, 26,
from Cambridge, was making good progress in a hospital near Lyon,
where the accident happened.
	   Glover and a friend tumbled from a stand especially erected next
to a giant screen in the early hours Saturday morning. Glover
suffered serious head and back injuries in the fall and doctors
originally feared he may have been paralyzed for life.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricket captain Allan
Border was ``quite chuffed'' to hear that Italy's goal-scoring hero
Christian Vieri lists him as one of his sporting heroes.
	   Vieri, who leads the World Cup with five goals, developed a love
of cricket when he lived in Sydney for 10 years between the ages of
5-15, so Border has sent him a good luck charm _ an autographed
cricket bat.
	   Border, the world-record holder for test runs, was glad to hear
that Vieri was also a left-handed batsman.
	   ``I'm sending the bat to Christian as a token gesture of my
appreciation of his kind sentiments,'' Border said Tuesday. ``I
hear that he was a handy little cricketer and with him also being a
left-hander, he would undoubtedly have been a great batsman as
well. I wish him all the very best of success.''
	   Border said he first heard that Vieri was a fan just two weeks
ago.
	   ``It was a tremendous thrill for me to hear this news,
particularly as Christian is such a big name in soccer,'' Border
said. ``I would have expected his response to a sporting hero query
being more in line with a name such as Pele.''

Chirac seeks deeper trade and political links with Angola 
</HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said
Tuesday he wanted France and Angola to engage in ``a comprehensive
economic partnership'' driven by private investment.
	   ``Angola can count on France,'' Chirac told the National
Assembly during an official visit to expand French business and
political ties with this former Portuguese colony.
	   He held private talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
while some 50 top French businessmen traveling with him met local
officials and business leaders.
	   The large trade delegation ``demonstrates our interest in Angola
and our determination to develop an ambitious, confident, solid and
long-lasting relationship'' between the two countries, Chirac said.
	   The two leaders signed a general cooperation agreement and
separate agreements on trade and the media.
	   Speaking on the last day of his six-day tour of four southern
African nations, Chirac said he was committed to helping revive
Angola's ailing peace process. Chirac returns to Paris Tuesday.
	   Dos Santos said he had asked Chirac to make ``discrete'' efforts
towards consolidating the country's 1994 peace pact which ended a
two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA rebels, but
declined to give details.
	   Talks between the two leaders had been ``very fruitful,'' dos
Santos told a joint news conference.
	   Lingering hostility between the former foes has stymied
implementation of the accord, which is running more than a year
behind schedule and has placed a brake on foreign investment.
	   The southwest African country has vast untapped natural
resources, including oil, diamonds and other minerals, as well as
agriculture and forestry.
	   United Nations officials have blamed UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ for dragging its feet on the peace deal. UNITA must still hand
over its central highland strongholds to government control.
	   Dos Santos also asked for Chirac's help in persuading the
International Monetary Fund to show ``greater comprehension and
flexibility'' over Angola's foreign debt payments.
	   Chirac has said France favors debt relief in southern Africa to
give momentum to democratic and economic reforms.
	   Angola's foreign debt is estimated at more than dlrs 10 billion.
Repayments have been made difficult by the falling world price of
oil, the country's main source of revenue.
	   Chirac's tour was aimed at forging closer political and economic
ties in nations with little French presence.
	   French economic cooperation in Angola is restricted mainly to
offshore oil production, with the companies Total and Elf investing
dlrs 3 billion in the petroleum sector over the past 15 years,
according to the French embassy in Luanda.
	   French companies are keen to strengthen their presence in
Cabinda, an Angolan enclave wedged between Congo and the Republic
of Congo, where deepwater finds in recent months are estimated to
hold billions of barrels of recoverable oil.
	   Chirac also visited Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique during
his tour.

Parliament prepares for debate on government austerity plan on government's austerity plan, market closing, changes byline.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers predicted Tuesday that many of
the government's anti-crisis economic measures will get preliminary
approval before parliament begins its summer recess on Friday.
	   Swift passage of the austerity program could help pull Russia
out of its current financial tailspin and would give President
Boris Yeltsin's government some breathing space.
	   It would also give the International Monetary Fund additional
impetus to grant Russia a new loan and ease fears about the
stability of the ruble.
	   ``I think that a majority of the bills submitted to the State
Duma by the government can be approved (preliminarily) on
Wednesday,'' said the Communist speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Gennady Seleznyov.
	   He said he expected most bills will be given final passage in
special sessions of parliament to be held July 15 and 16.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was to appear in parliament
Wednesday to explain the government's austerity plan, Seleznyov
said.
	   ``We expect him to make his presentation in 30 minutes,'' then
answer questions from lawmakers for the next half-hour, he said.
	   Wednesday's debate could determine the fate of the ruble, said a
spokesman for Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said.
	   ``If the stabilization program is passed, the threat of
devaluation will retreat,'' Oleg Zhukov said in a telephone
interview.
	   However, parliament is controlled by Communists who have
consistently opposed cuts in government spending, and it remained
unclear whether lawmakers would ultimately approve the government's
package.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who has been critical
of the government plan, said Tuesday that five of the 21 proposals
were completely unacceptable, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian markets quieted Tuesday, with the Russian Trading System
index closing 1.7 percent lower, compared to Monday's sharp 6.1
percent drop. Benchmark one-year bonds offered yields of about 80
percent as the government tried to lure investors afraid of a ruble
devaluation back into the market.
	   Financial markets have been falling sharply in recent weeks, due
to a combination of factors that include government budget
problems, a drop in revenues from oil exports, and the effects of
the Asian financial crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the IMF came through Tuesday with the latest dlrs 670
million installment on an existing dlrs 9 billion loan to Russia.
	   The IMF decided Thursday to release the money after withholding
it for months and pressing the Russian government to do more to get
its finances in order.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new
lending from the IMF and the World Bank as part of an economic
package aimed at preventing a devaluation of the ruble.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the government's liaison with lending
institutions, said the loan negations had reached a crucial stage.
	   ``We are set to conclude the talks within a very compact period
of time, within a month,'' Chubais said, according to ITAR-Tass.

UN human rights team for Congo calls for international tribunal 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. human rights team for Congo, in a
report on its aborted investigation into alleged massacres of
Rwandan Hutu refugees, called Tuesday for an international tribunal
to try Congolese authorities and others for ``serious violations of
human rights.''
	   The report was the first from the team withdrawn in April from
Congo because of what the United Nations said was a ``total absence
of cooperation,'' on the part of the government of President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The team had been sent last August to investigate massacres of
Rwandan Hutu refugees allegedly committed by forces loyal to Kabila
during their sweep across the vast African country formerly known
as Zaire to oust President Mobuto Sese Seko from power.

Suriname oil company director back on job 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ An oil company executive whose
firing touched off an eight-week strike in Suriname is back on the
job.
	   Eddy Jharap, the managing director of the government-controlled
State Oil Co., began his first full day of work Tuesday after
winning a lawsuit Monday against the Natural Resources Ministry.
	   Jharap had opposed President Jules Wijdenbosch's dlrs 60 million
privatization of the company's Tambaredjo oilfield, and 700 workers
walked off the job to protest his dismissal by natural resources
minister Errol Alibux on May 4. They returned to work on Friday.
	   Judge John von Niesewand ruled that only the board of directors
had the authority to fire Jharap. The government, which is
technically a shareholder in the company, cannot hire or fire, he
said.
	   Von Niesewand ruled that the company also violated laws
requiring firms to request permission from the Labor Ministry to
fire employees.
	   Dozens of oil workers who squeezed into the courtroom to watch
the proceedings cheered as Von Niesewand handed down the ruling.
``Law and order has prevailed,'' they chanted as the judge called
for order.
	   Alibux had vowed on Friday never to rehire Jharap. He was
expected to appeal the ruling.

World Cup: Croatia upsets Romania 1-0 in second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Iordanescu quotes; optional upcoming
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Newcomer Croatia advanced to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup on Tuesday, beating Romania 1-0 on
Davor Suker's penalty kick in first-half injury time.
	   Croatia, which gained independence seven years ago, became the
first nation to make the final eight in its World Cup debut since
East Germany in 1974. The Croats next face European champion
Germany on Saturday at Lyon.
	   Suker's third goal of the tournament was the highlight of a game
controlled mostly by the Croatians, even after Romania substituted
two strikers for two midfielders in a vain attempt to generate
scoring chances in the second half.
	   ``Croatia deserved to win,'' said Anghel Iordanescu, whose
five-year stint as Romanian coach came to an end with the loss. He
has signed a two-year deal to coach Greece's national team.
	   ``They played with more cohesion throughout and had more scoring
chances,'' Iordanescu said. ``Romania's quality of play was quite
low.''
	   The penalty, however, wasn't without dispute. Argentine referee
Javier Castrilli called the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu,
whose legs became entangled with those of Aljosa Asanovic as they
chased Dario Simic's pass in the penalty area. Popescu protested
with arms raised high, but to no avail.
	   Suker slotted his right-footed spot kick just inside the right
post on his second attempt. His first try, almost an identical good
kick, was waived off by Castrilli after at least two Croatian
players encroached into the penalty arc.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''
	   Though Romania pressed in the second half, Suker and his
teammates continued to create the better scoring chances. Romanian
defender Liviu Ciobotariu nearly had to tackle Zvonimir Boban to
keep him from converting Suker's cross in the 55th minute, and
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea had to stop two point-blank shots from
substitute Petar Krpan in second-half injury time.
	   There was more end-to-end action in the first half as opposing
strikers Suker and Adrian Ilie tried to force the scoring chances.
	   The Croatians kept Stelea busy from the opening whistle. The
keeper denied Suker from close range, leaped to push away Goran
Vlaovic's long drive and made a reflex save on Asanovic's shot _
all in the first 15 minutes.
	   Ilie was creative at the other end for Romania, winning spot
kicks deep in Croatian territory. But his teammates were unable to
convert any of the chances, and Ilie's best opportunity to set up a
goal failed when he couldn't lift his cross over approaching
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic with wide-open teammate Dan Petrescu
waiting in front of the net.
	   The Croats played without central defender Zvonimir Soldo, who
was suspended after receiving two yellow cards in the first round.

FDA approves melt-in-mouth migraine drug 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S.government approved a new type of
migraine relief Tuesday: a mint-flavored tablet that literally
melts on the tongue in seconds.
	   Patients don't swallow Merck &AMP; Co.'s Maxalt-MLT like a typical
pill. Made with a new technology that freeze-dries the medicine,
Maxalt-MLT dissolves upon contact with the tongue _ no water
needed.
	   There are numerous other migraine medicines. But Merck noted
that swallowing pills can be difficult for some patients who also
experience nausea. Migraine drugs also come in injection and
nasal-spray forms.
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, known
chemically as rizatriptan, for adults based on studies that found
it relieved pain for about 66 percent of patients within two hours.
	   The prescription-only drug will be available within a few weeks,
Merck said. It is expected to cost about dlrs 14 a pill.
	   Most side effects in tests were mild, including dizziness and
fatigue, Merck said. But the drug should not be used by patients
with heart disease or uncontrolled high blood pressure, the company
warned.
	   Merck also will sell a conventional-pill version of Maxalt.
	   Some 20 million Americans have migraines, powerful headaches
that can last 24 hours and often are accompanied by extreme
sensitivity to light and sound.

World Cup: Italian striker skips afternoon tuneup With Sports-Soccer-Franco-Italian Mix 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ World Cup top striker Christian Vieri,
suffering from a sore muscle, skipped the afternoon tuneup at
Italy's training camp Tuesday.
	   Team officials said however that the presence of the 24-year-old
forward was not at risk in Friday's quarterfinal match against
France.
	   Vieri, who tallied five goals in four matches, made 20 minutes
of light foot work on his own and left the field when the teammates
started joggling with the ball before a tuneup.
	   Team doctors said Vieri was expected to resume full-time
training Wednesday.

Chechen court bans killings based on blood feuds

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's Islamic court system on Tuesday banned
killings based on family feuds, which it said have become more
common in the breakaway region of southern Russia.
	   Those involved in such killings could face the death penalty,
the court said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Mostly Muslim Chechnya has become a center of violent crime,
including rampant kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its
independence war against Russia two years ago. Its government has
not been able to restore order or rebuild the economy.

World Cup: Danes looking for another upset _ this time against Brazil Argentina-England AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Croatia advancing, will be updated after
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Denmark is proving to be the upset champion of
world soccer.
	   Gaining a backdoor entrance to the 1992 European Championship
when Yugoslavia was kicked out, the Danes went home with the title,
beating hot favorite Germany in the final.
	   After ousting 1996 Olympic gold medalist Nigeria from World Cup
'98 by a surprising 4-1 score, they now face defending titlist and
four-time world champion Brazil for a place in the semifinals.
	   Another upset? Why not.
	   ``Everybody expects Brazil to win,'' said Danish striker Brian
Laudrup. ``We might be able to do it again. You never know. I think
we showed the whole football world that we can play attractive
football as well.''
	   Brazil-Denmark takes place Friday at Nantes the same day that
host France takes on three-time winner Italy at the Stade de
France.
	   Reigning European champion Germany and the Netherlands have also
made it to the last eight. Germany, a three-time winner, will face
debutant Croatia at Lyon on Saturday while the Dutch meet either
Argentina or England who faced each other later Tuesday at
Saint-Etienne.
	   The Croatians made it to the quarterfinals at their first
attempt and got there after beating Romania 1-0 Tuesday at Bordeaux
on a disputed, twice-taken penalty by Real Madrid striker Davor
Suker.

	   In the report, the team said the difficulties and obstacles
imposed by Kabila's government ``make it impossible to confirm or
disprove at this time most of the allegations that have been made
concerning serious violations of human rights and humanitarian
law.''
	   ``Nevertheless,'' the report said, ``the investigative team was
able to confirm that certain types of violations occurred, and that
they occurred in certain regions and during certain periods.''
	   In particular, the team said it was able to confirm
participation in several instances of former Rwandan army soldiers
in the killings. It also said it verifed the capture and execution
of hundreds of unarmed people after an attack on Mugunga camp in
November 1996. Many others were later hunted down and executed, it
said.
	   Others were executed after fleeing camps in South Kivu,
Tingi-Tingi, Kasese and Obiro camps, the report said.
	   The team said Congolese authorities had shown no interest in
investigating responsibility for ``the serious violations of human

endowing an international tribunal with competence over these
crimes,'' the report said.

Dane emerges as European candidate to head UNDP 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's development minister has
emerged as the European Union's candidate to oust the American head
of the U.N. Development Program, Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen said Tuesday.
	   In a sign of European discontent with the United States' unpaid
U.N. bills, Denmark in 1996 considered a bid to oust agency head
James Gustave Speth. But after failing to get support from all
European Union nations, Denmark retracted.
	   Since then, Speth has said he would step down in June 1999.
Denmark has been lobbying for their candidate, Development Minister
Poul Nielson.
	   ``We don't have any indication that there are other
candidates,'' Helveg Petersen said. The EU has set June 30 as its
deadline for finding its candidate.
	   ``It's now Europe's turn to hold this post, which the Americans
have been holding pretty long. It is natural that Europe, which is
a large contributor, gets its,'' Helveg Petersen told reporters.
	   For years, Washington was the largest contributor to the UNDP.
In 1995, Congress slashed the U.S. contribution from dlrs 113
million to dlrs 52 million. That dropped the United States to
seventh place among the voluntary contributors behind Japan,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Sweden.

	   The team said that failure to prosecute such crimes will
encourage the perception that the international community is not
impartial.
	   It would also ``nurture collective feelings of victimization and
of denial of justice, contributing to the cycle of reprisals and
the culture of impunity.''
	   Reed Brody, a former team member and currently the advocacy
director of Human Rights Watch, said in an interview that the
report was damning because it confirmed long-held suspicions about
the extent of the massacres and the involvement of foreign troops.
	   ``The question now is whether the international community has
the political will to take the next step which is to identify the
killers and bring them to justice,'' said Brody, who said he left
the team in November for personal reasons.
	   He said the United States in particular had to lead the way and
``decide if it is willing to support the main recommendation of the
report, which is that an international tribunal determine the
responsibility for these massacres.''

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded
Albanian rebel strongholds in Kosovo with tanks and mortars
Tuesday, sending thousands of villagers streaming toward safety on
the second day of a major offensive that threatens to engulf a
wider region.
	   One human rights group accused the Serbs of rape and other war
crimes in the conflict. Another said both sides were guilty of
excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to the steadily worsening conflict.
	   Fighting continued Tuesday between Yugoslav and Serbian security
forces and the fast-growing Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Serb forces, intent on retaking the strategically important
Belacevac open-pit mine which fell to the KLA last week, trained
heavy firepower on the area.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance. Ninety percent of the province's population is
ethnic Albanian, but the Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their
culture. International sentiment is against granting the province
independence because frontier changes in the volatile Balkans often
lead to more bloodshed.
	   Throughout the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   From the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and mortars,
well-camouflaged in the lush green foliage, all fired on the
KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment, Serb forces ceased their fire for a
few hours, then resumed after changing their positions. At least
four other villages were also shelled Tuesday.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked Saban Gadeni, 19,
an economics student at the University of Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, said in
Oslo, Norway, that the conflict has reached a critical stage. He
said Americans were still trying to mediate.
	   ``One problem is that, on the military side, there is no clear
Albanian chain of command with which to deal when on talks about a
cease-fire. This is a marked difference from Bosnia,'' said
Holbrooke, who mediated the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, however, that the KLA
should not be part of talks with its ally Yugoslavia.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ for war crimes or violations of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to Associated Press offices in the Balkans,
the respected private watchdog group said it had ``powerful
evidence'' that Serb police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified
number of ethnic Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The KLA was faulted for ``detentions and attacks on Serbian
civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said its siege of Kijevo
``affects civilians and other non-combatants in the town.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International said the vast
majority of the victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90
percent of the population in Kosovo. But it said Serbs also are
suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' the international human rights organization said.
	   The wife and mother of two Serbs kidnapped by the KLA appealed
to the militants Tuesday to release them.
	   ``My 18-year-old son Ivan's childhood was ruined by the war in
Croatia where we lived, now his youth is ruined in Kosovo,'' said
Vesna Bakrac. The men were reportedly taken off a bus by armed
ethnic Albanians on Monday along with two other Serbs.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday in Shanghai, China.

Chirac seeks deeper trade and political links with Angola 
</HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said
Tuesday he wanted France and Angola to engage in ``a comprehensive
economic partnership'' driven by private investment.
	   ``Angola can count on France,'' Chirac told the National
Assembly during an official visit to expand French business and
political ties with this former Portuguese colony.
	   He held private talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
while some 50 top French businessmen traveling with him met local
officials and business leaders.
	   The large trade delegation ``demonstrates our interest in Angola
and our determination to develop an ambitious, confident, solid and
long-lasting relationship'' between the two countries, Chirac said.
	   The two leaders signed a general cooperation agreement and
separate agreements on trade and the media.
	   Speaking on the last day of his six-day tour of four southern
African nations, Chirac said he was committed to helping revive
Angola's ailing peace process. Chirac returns to Paris Tuesday.
	   Dos Santos said he had asked Chirac to make ``discrete'' efforts
towards consolidating the country's 1994 peace pact which ended a
two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA rebels, but
declined to give details.
	   Talks between the two leaders had been ``very fruitful,'' dos
Santos told a joint news conference.
	   Lingering hostility between the former foes has stymied
implementation of the accord, which is running more than a year
behind schedule and has placed a brake on foreign investment.
	   The southwest African country has vast untapped natural
resources, including oil, diamonds and other minerals, as well as
agriculture and forestry.
	   United Nations officials have blamed UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ for dragging its feet on the peace deal. UNITA must still hand
over its central highland strongholds to government control.
	   Dos Santos also asked for Chirac's help in persuading the
International Monetary Fund to show ``greater comprehension and
flexibility'' over Angola's foreign debt payments.
	   Chirac has said France favors debt relief in southern Africa to
give momentum to democratic and economic reforms.
	   Angola's foreign debt is estimated at more than dlrs 10 billion.
Repayments have been made difficult by the falling world price of
oil, the country's main source of revenue.
	   Chirac's tour was aimed at forging closer political and economic
ties in nations with little French presence.
	   French economic cooperation in Angola is restricted mainly to
offshore oil production, with the companies Total and Elf investing
dlrs 3 billion in the petroleum sector over the past 15 years,
according to the French embassy in Luanda.
	   French companies are keen to strengthen their presence in
Cabinda, an Angolan enclave wedged between Congo and the Republic
of Congo, where deepwater finds in recent months are estimated to
hold billions of barrels of recoverable oil.
	   Chirac also visited Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique during
his tour.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Presidents Geidar Aliev of Azerbaijan
and Emil Constantinescu of Romania discussed prospects for a new
transportation route along the legendary Silk Road between Europe
and Central Asia during a meeting Tuesday.
	   Energy cooperation was also raised during Constantinescu's visit
to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Azerbaijan's Turan news agency
reported. Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil reserves are believed to be
the world's richest, after the Middle East.
	   Romania is interested in being a transit country for the oil,
Constantinescu said.
	   ``Romania has all the necessary infrastructure for this,'' he
told reporters.
	   Constantinescu and Aliev signed agreements on bilateral
relations, transport cooperation, and cooperation between state-run
news agencies.
	   Azerbaijan and Romania have long been planning to create a trade
and transportation route between Europe and Central Asia, to go
across the Black and Caspian Seas and through the Caucasus
Mountains.
	   The route would cover part of the ancient Silk Road _ a passage
that for centuries connected China and Europe, allowing mutual
trade and bringing power and prosperity to many cities along the
way.

Vatican closes canon law loophole on theological dissent 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has clamped down further
on theological dissent, issuing a document Tuesday that closes a
loophole in church law on doctrinal matters.
	   The pope did not say what specific teachings he was taking aim
at. But in a commentary on the document, the Vatican's chief of
doctrine named the church's bans on women priests, euthanasia and
sexual intercourse outside of marriage.
	   The pope was acting out of ``imperative necessity to prevent and
refute the opinions of theologians who resist'' definitive Catholic
teachings, the Vatican said.
	   The document, an apostolic letter, concerns the church's
``profession of faith,'' a summation of essential Catholic beliefs
re-formulated in 1989.
	   Many Catholic theologians, particularly in the United States,
protested the profession and the requirement they publicly adhere
to it. They saw it as an attempt to control dissent and to brand
public disagreement as defiance.
	   Prelates, parish priests, Catholic theology teachers and
religious superiors are among those required to adhere to the
profession of faith.
	   The latest decision is sure to cause more chafing by liberal
theologians.
	   The profession of faith calls on all Catholics to accept the
religion's fundamental truths as ``divinely revealed.''
	   The new profession added a category: teachings on faith and
morals that must be ``definitively held.''
	   The pope said there was no provision in church law to cover the
category. John Paul said he was acting to ``fill this gap.''
	   ``Whoever refuses'' teachings that are ``to be definitively held
is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic church,'' the new law
reads.
	   Believers are ``required to give firm and definitive assent to
these truths,'' Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, wrote in an
accompanying document.
	   ``Whoever denies these truths would ... therefore no longer be
in full communion with the Catholic Church,'' he said.
	   Along with the requirement of an all-male priesthood and the ban
on euthanasia and ``fornication,'' Ratzinger included as ``truths''
the illegality of prostitution, the legitimacy of papal elections
and canonization of saints and the ``invalidity'' of Anglican
ordinations.
	   John Paul in the past has called to task Roman Catholic
theologians who deviated from Vatican teachings.
	   Most recently, the Vatican excommunicated a Sri Lankan priest,
Tissa Balasuriya, last year for allegedly challenging papal
authority and the church teaching on baptism, original sin and the
virginity of Mary. The censure was repealed when he signed the
profession of faith.
	   Other punished theologians include the Rev. Hans Kung of
Switzerland, who was stripped of his right to teach theology in
1979, and the Rev. Charles E. Curran, barred from teaching at
Catholic University in 1987.

Iraq denies its radar locked on to allied planes saying missile fell on water tanks, quotes. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Iraqi news agency quoting spokesman
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq denied Tuesday that its radar locked
on to four British patrol planes and called the firing of a U.S.
missile ``proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pentagon officials said a U.S. F-16 fighter fired the missile at
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq Tuesday
after Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes.
	   The fighter was accompanying the British Tornadoes enforcing the
southern no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to base.
	   But the Iraqi official said no radar was illuminated. Another
Iraqi spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency, said no
air defense units in the area sent electronic signals at the time.
	   The missile fell 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the nearest
radar, the official said. The spokesman quoted by the news agency
said the missile hit water tanks 12 kilometers (seven miles) north
of Umm Kasr, an Iraqi port near the Kuwaiti border.
	   ``This aggression is probably a plan for a new all-out
aggression against Iraq,'' the Information Ministry official said.
``This is the proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   The incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq. The firing of
the missile was standard response to Iraq's locking its radar on
any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.
	   In November 1996, the last time the United States fired at radar
sites, Iraq also denied that its radar locked on the planes.

	   Kabila denies that his forces targeted refugees, but has
acknowledged that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by Mobutu to fight the
rebels, may have been killed in battle along with the women and
children they hid among.
	   The refugees were ethnic Hutus who had fled Rwanda to escape
punishment for the 1994 massacre of an estimated half million
Tutsis. The massacres were allegedly committed by Rwandan Tutsis
who fought for Kabila.
	   Even before the team was finally withdrawn, and despite
assurances from Kabila's government that it would cooperate, the
investigation had been delayed by numerous disagreements over its
scope and conduct.
	   ``It is a source of deep regret that, between its first
deployment in August 1997 and its withdrawl in April 1998, the team
was not allowed to carry out its mission fully and without
hindrance,'' Annan said in a letter to the Security Council
accompanying the team's report.
	   Despite the interference, the team was able to come to some
solid conclusions, he wrote: that all parties involved in the
violence ``have committed serious violations of human rights or
international humanitarian law,'' and that some of those violations
may constitute genocide.
	   He called for further investigation of those crimes and of their
motivation.

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Newcomer Croatia advanced to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup on Tuesday, beating Romania 1-0 on
Davor Suker's penalty kick in first-half injury time.
	   Croatia became the first nation to make the final eight in its
World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974. The Croats next face
Germany on Saturday at Lyon.
	   ``We have eliminated a team with a great tradition,'' Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Our players achieved a big goal.
We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   Germany and Croatia have already met once in the quarterfinals

Iraq denies its radar locked on to allied planes saying missile fell on water tanks, quotes.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with Iraqi news agency quoting spokesman
With BC-US-Iraq Missile
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq denied Tuesday that its radar locked
on to four British patrol planes and called the firing of a U.S.
missile ``proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pentagon officials said a U.S. F-16 fighter fired the missile at
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq on Tuesday
after Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes.
	   The fighter was accompanying the British Tornadoes enforcing the
southern no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to base.
	   But another Iraqi spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News
Agency, said no air defense units in the area sent electronic
signals at the time.
	   The missile fell 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the nearest
radar, the official said. The spokesman quoted by the news agency
said the missile hit water tanks 12 kilometers (seven miles) north
of Umm Kasr, an Iraqi port near the Kuwaiti border.
	   ``This aggression is probably a plan for a new all-out
aggression against Iraq,'' the Information Ministry official said.
``This is the proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   The firing of the missile was standard response to Iraq's
locking its radar on any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.
	   In November 1996, the last time the United States fired at radar
sites, Iraq also denied that its radar locked on the planes.

Russia seeks loan to improve highways 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will hold talks with the World Bank for a
dlrs 300 million loan to repair highways in Siberia and the Far
East, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The government wants to undertake a five-year program to repair
roads and bridges in the Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk regions and to
purchase machinery, equipment and materials to maintain them, the
news agency said.
	   Much of Russia's Soviet-era infrastructure is falling apart and
the country lacks the money to repair it.

German star to play in Dallas

Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Nowitski quotes; EDITS
By DAVID KOENIG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Dirk Nowitzki, the 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) German
basketball star, plans to give up European ball to play for the
Dallas Mavericks next season.
	   Nowitzki, who had said he would need two more seasons before he
was ready for the U.S. National Basketball Association, was drafted
ninth overall by Milwaukee last week, then traded to Dallas.
Mavericks officials flew to Germany the next day to recruit him.
	   Nowitzki arrived in Dallas on Sunday and stayed at the home of
coach-general manager Don Nelson. He held a news conference Monday
and attended a barbecue with prospective teammates that night.
	   Another news conference was scheduled for Tuesday to discuss his
decision.
	   ``Nellie called me 20 minutes ago and said he's agreed to play
here,'' team spokesman Tony Fay said of his conversation with
Nelson.
	   The 20-year-old player said he was concerned his game wasn't
polished enough for the NBA and he wanted to make sure he was free
to help the German national team qualify for the Olympics.
	   Nelson assured Nowitzki he's ready and the Mavericks have agreed
to let him leave the team in the fall and winter to play for his
country's squad.
	   Nowitzki faced a Tuesday deadline to decide whether he would
play for the Mavericks. Negotiations would be barred after midnight
because of a lockout. He planned to leave Tuesday for Germany.
	   Nelson did not want Nowitzki to return to Germany unsigned
because he would be free to negotiate with European clubs.
	   The Mavericks cannot offer him a contract because the rookie
salary scale is one of the items in the labor dispute between the
owners and players.

Chirac seeks deeper trade and political links with Angola 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: to CORRECT spelling of discreet in 7th graf
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said
Tuesday he wanted France and Angola to engage in ``a comprehensive
economic partnership'' driven by private investment.
	   ``Angola can count on France,'' Chirac told the National
Assembly during an official visit to expand French business and
political ties with this former Portuguese colony.
	   He held private talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
while some 50 top French businessmen traveling with him met local
officials and business leaders.
	   The large trade delegation ``demonstrates our interest in Angola
and our determination to develop an ambitious, confident, solid and
long-lasting relationship'' between the two countries, Chirac said.
	   The two leaders signed a general cooperation agreement and
separate agreements on trade and the media.
	   Speaking on the last day of his six-day tour of four southern
African nations, Chirac said he was committed to helping revive
Angola's ailing peace process. Chirac returns to Paris Tuesday.
	   Dos Santos said he had asked Chirac to make ``discreet'' efforts
towards consolidating the country's 1994 peace pact which ended a
two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA rebels, but
declined to give details.

Clay-court, first-time grass player Sanguinetti into quarters AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Davide Sanguinetti, who had never
played a grass court tournament before, now finds himself about to
face former champion Richard Krajicek for a place in the Wimbledon
semifinals.
	   The 25-year-old Italian, who has played 10 of his 16 tournaments
this year on clay, defeated Francisco Clavet of Spain Tuesday 7-6
(7-3), 6-1, 6-4 to line himself up against the 1996 champion.
	   ``I'm surprised,'' Sanguinetti admitted, ``because I didn't know
how I would respond to grass. But as soon as I came here and
started to practice I felt really good.''
	   Sanguinetti is moving up in the rankings, and his place in the
Wimbledon quarterfinals will carry him higher than at any time in
his career. Beginning the year ranked 92, a march to the final of
the tournament in Coral Springs, Fla. in May helped boost him to a
current high of 65.
	   ``I have flat shots, and the grass is like soap,'' said
Sanguinetti, who studied for two years at UCLA. ``It's slippery and
they have a lot of trouble putting their shots on the other side
(of the net), especially my serve.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO. 1? &LR;  Marcelo Rios, the surly Chilean who went out in the
first round, could still claim the top spot in next week's ATP Tour
rankings. Rios will move into No. 1 if neither Pete Sampras nor
Petr Korda reaches the Wimbledon final. Sampras will hold onto No.
1 if he beats Mark Philippoussis and Petr Korda en route to the
final. If he reaches the final without beating those two, he must
win the final to stay No. 1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DON BUDGE: &LR;  American Don Budge, who won all four Grand Slams in
1938, was presented Tuesday with a Waterford glass vase to
commemorate the occasion by the Duke of Kent. ``Presented to Donald
Budge in celebration of 60 years since winning his first Grand Slam
title,'' was the inscription.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DENNIS RODNEY, MBA? &LR;  The NBA and Dennis Rodman may be known by
every sports fan in the United States. But that's not the case in
England. At least not at the All England Club.
	   In Pete Sampras' interview Tuesday, he talked about the
marketing success of the NBA and also made reference to Rodman. The
stenographer transcribed Rodman as ``Dennis Rodney'' and the NBA as
``MBA.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GO ENGLAND: &LR;  Britain's Tim Henman, set to play Wednesday in a
quarterfinal against Petr Korda, had Tuesday off to watch England's
crucial World Cup match against Argentina.
	   ``I'll have the opportunity of watch the whole 90 minutes,'' he
said. ``But it wouldn't distract me from what I'm doing. Obviously,
what I'm doing is a lot more important to me.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VAYA ARGENTINA: &LR;  Argentine mixed doubles team of Mercedes Paz
and Pablo Albano arrived at their match Tuesday wearing blue and
white Argentine soccer jerseys. It could have been a bad omen for
England. The Argentines won their match over England's Julie Pullin
and Danny Sapsford 6-1, 7-6 (7-2).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  The headline in the tabloid Sun newspaper
after Serena Williams retired from her match Monday with a minor
calf injury: ``Surrender Williams.''
	   If Venus and Serena Williams ever make the Wimbledon final
together, they won't be the first sisters to do it. Maud and Lilian
Watson played for the title in 1884, the first year women were
allowed to compete. Serving underhand _ as all women did then _
Maud took the title.
	   Martina Hingis on Tamarine Tanasugarn hitting so many winning
shots down the line in Tuesday's fourth-round match won by Hingis:
``She could go play in a casino today, or something.''
	   Jan Novotna on the cocky ways of Serena and Venus Williams: ``I
guess that's the way the young American kids are brought up
nowadays.''
	   French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario on why she's
started slowly in her matches at Wimbledon. ``I am Spanish. I'm a
slow starter. The later I play the better it is.''

Court will consider Yeltsin candidacy in 2000 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Constitutional Court is preparing to set a
date to consider whether President Boris Yeltsin can seek a third
term in 2000, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The date will be determined at a closed meeting of the court's
presidium after the summer recess, court chairman Marat Baglai told
the Interfax news agency.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, has asked the court to
determine whether Yeltsin was constitutionally eligible to run for
another term.
	   Russia's constitution sets a two-term limit for the president.
However, Yeltsin aides have hinted that the 67-year old leader may
run again, arguing that his first term began during Soviet times
and should not count toward the two-term limit.
	   Yeltsin has said repeatedly that he won't run.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin fired Sergei Shakhrai, his representative to
the Constitutional Court.
	   Although no reason for the dismissal was given, Shakhrai said
later it might have been in part because he voiced support for
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to be the next president, and did not
push for a third Yeltsin term.

Vatican, PLO lay groundwork for agreement on Catholic institutions 
</HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian-Vatican committee began talks
here Tuesday aimed at normalizing relations and mutual interests
regarding Catholic institutions in the Palestinian territories.
	   The Palestinians voiced concerns last year after Israel and the
Vatican signed an agreement defining the legal status of Catholic
institutions in Israel, including those situated in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. The Palestinians however, claim the
eastern sector as the capital for a future state.
	   Though the Vatican assured Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that
the agreement with Israel does not translate into a recognition of
Israel's sovereignty over the disputed city, the Palestinians
pushed for their own agreement.
	   In April, the two sides established a bilateral committee to
formulate an agreement and Tuesday held talks in the
Palestinian-controlled city of Bethlehem, West Bank and later in
Jerusalem. A third meeting is scheduled for mid-October at the
Vatican.
	   Palestinian official Assad Abdel Rahman, who sits on the
committee, said any signed agreement would mean an official
recognition by the Vatican of the Palestinian Authority and
Palestinian rights in Jerusalem.
	   ``The PLO has a right to look for and define its interest and to
build a relationship with the Holy See,'' said Hana Nasr, mayor of
Bethlehem and member of the Palestinian delegation.
	   Monsignor Celestino Migliore, who headed the Vatican delegation,
would not comment on the meeting.

Sampras says tennis needs a Rodman, but it won't be Pete AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBELDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras says tennis needs a
Dennis Rodman, but don't look for him to sport dyed hair and a
tattoo anytime soon.
	   After his three-set, fourth-round victory over qualifier
Sebastien Grosjean, Sampras _ never known for colorful, flamboyant
interviews _ spoke with unusual candor about what ails men's
tennis, particularly in the United States.
	   ``Really when the game was successful you had four guys in the
top five,'' said Sampras, going for his fifth Wimbledon title in
six years.
	   ``They played each other in the semifinals and finals of all the
Slams, they had different personalities _ and they all hated each
other.
	   ``So that's great theater. And now _ it's sad but true _ that's
probably what the game needs. It needs a little controversy. It
needs a little Dennis Rodman type of guy.
	   ``It needs a little more hatred, or whatever you want to call
it,'' Sampras went on. ``That's kind of where we're at, you need a
rivalry, you need something so that people not following the game
might follow the game.''
	   A look at Wimbledon's men's quarterfinals makes the point with
three of the eight remaining players virtually unknown out of their
own countries _ Davide Sanguinetti of Italy, Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa and Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands.
	   Sampras, saying there's ``only so much I can do,'' applauded the
return to form of Andre Agassi.
	   ``When Andre and I had our rivalry a couple of years ago, tennis
in the States was great,'' he said. ``And now it seem to have
fizzled.''
	   Revealing a little-known aspect of his life, Sampras admitted
recently he slept blindfolded. Was there another little-known side
of his life to divulge?
	   ``Just because I play good tennis everyone thinks there's got to
be something a little bit quirky, but there really isn't,'' he
said. ``I'm a normal guy that just happens to play good tennis.''

Russia welcome's lifting of U.S. ban on Cuban overflights 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Tuesday the American decision to
change its airspace restrictions to allow Cuban jetliners to fly
over the eastern United States en route to Canada.
	   Russia regards this ``as a positive step toward the long overdue
normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The United States lifted the ban in mid-June after Cuba filed a
complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization.
	   The United States banned Cuban flights over its territory in the
1960s, citing national security security concerns. As a result,
Russian-made Air Cubana jets have flown a circuitous route to
Canada just off the east coast.
	   The no-fly rule was eased in 1988, when Cuban jets were allowed
to cross land at New York City and approach Toronto and Montreal
over upstate New York. The planes have also been allowed to cross
land in bad weather or emergencies.
	   Under the new policy, the Cuban planes will be allowed to fly
directly to Montreal and Toronto over the eastern United States.
	   The change is expected to save wear-and-tear on Air Cubana's
planes and about a half-hour in flight time.

HIV/AIDS drugs can cause abnormal obesity and high cholesterol With MED-Aids-Drugs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Drugs which have contributed to a dramatic decline
in AIDS death rates could be a cause of extreme shifts in body fat
and diabetes, experts said Tuesday.
	   ``This is a very large problem,'' David Cooper, an Australian
expert in HIV, said at the 12th World Aids Conference in Geneva.
	   Research has shown that users of protease inhibitors, which stop
HIV from multiplying, have suffered unusual fattening. Women
treated with the drugs have experienced breast enlargement.
	   The treatments have also been associated with increased
triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which can lead to greater risk
of heart disease, say specialists.
	   In a study by Krista Dong of the Miriam Hospital in Providence,
Rhode Island in the United States, and researchers at the Brown
University in Providence, 19 out of 118 women treated with a
protease inhibitor were said to have complained of changes in their
bodies.
	   Some 71 percent of the women are reported to have said their
breasts had got bigger, a further 71 percent complained of an
enlarged abdomen, 47 percent said their limbs had wasted and 23
percent said they were experiencing so-called ``buffalo hump'' _
abnormal fat in the neck and shoulders.
	   In another study of 110 HIV-positive patients at the Civic
Hospital in Lugano, Switzerland, researcher Enos Bernasconi and
others said they had observed higher cholesterol levels in patients
treated with inhibitors against those who received other forms of
treatment.
	   Research carried out by Ravi K. Walli and colleagues at the
University of Munich in Germany showed use of inhibitors in therapy
is linked with the occurrence of irreversible hyperglycemia and
manifest diabetes mellitus.
	   They said further investigation was needed to confirm inhibitors
as a cause of these phenomena.
	   Cooper agreed that more evidence was needed. Experts must look
at whether, and how fast, patients recovered from abnormalities
after ceasing treatment with inhibitors, he said.
	   In the meantime, experts would monitor the situation and try to
make people more aware, said Cooper.
	   Scientists currently considered that the benefits of treatment
with inhibitors outweighed their disadvantages, he said.

UN human rights team for Congo calls for international tribunal byline.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. human rights team that investigated
massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Congo called Tuesday for an
international tribunal to try Congolese and foreigners responsible
for ``serious violations of human rights.''
	   The report was the first from the team withdrawn in April from
Congo because of what the United Nations said was a ``total absence
of cooperation'' from the government of President Laurent Kabila.
	   The team had been sent last August to investigate massacres of
Rwandan Hutu refugees allegedly committed by forces loyal to Kabila
during their sweep across the vast African country formerly known
as Zaire to oust President Mobuto Sese Seko.
	   The refugees were ethnic Hutus who had fled neighboring Rwanda
to escape punishment for the 1994 massacre of an estimated half
million Tutsis.
	   In the report, the team said the difficulties and obstacles
imposed by Kabila's government made it impossible to confirm or
disprove most of the allegations, but that it could verify certain
human rights violations.
	   In particular, the team said it was able to confirm that former
Rwandan army soldiers participated in the killings. It also said it
verified the capture and execution of hundreds of unarmed refugees
after an attack on Mugunga camp in November 1996.
	   Others were executed after fleeing camps in South Kivu,
Tingi-Tingi, Kasese and Obiro camps, the report said.
	   The team said Congolese authorities had shown no interest in
investigating responsibility for ``the serious violations of human
rights and grave breaches of humanitarian law which occurred in its
territory.''
	   ``Consequently, the interests of justice can only be served by
endowing an international tribunal with competence over these
crimes,'' the report said.
	   Failure to prosecute such crimes could cast doubt on the
impartiality of the international community, and would ``nurture
collective feelings of victimization and of denial of justice,
contributing to the cycle of reprisals and the culture of
impunity,'' the report said.
	   The Congolese government rejected the report as a ``dangerous
document that, contrary to the ideals of international peace and
security propagated by the United Nations, exacerbates the ethnic
hatred between Hutu and Tutsi.''
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Congolese
ambassador, Andre Mwamba Kapanga, said the report was politically
motivated and revealed many gaps, contradictions and untruths.
	   ``That being so, the government simply rejects the conclusions
of the report as being a collection of unfounded allegations,'' he
wrote.
	   Reed Brody, a former team member and currently the advocacy
director of Human Rights Watch, said in an interview that the
report was damning because it confirmed long-held suspicions about
the extent of the massacres and the involvement of foreign troops.
	   ``The question now is whether the international community has
the political will to take the next step which is to identify the
killers and bring them to justice,'' said Brody.
	   He said the United States in particular had to lead the way and
``decide if it is willing to support the main recommendation of the
report, which is that an international tribunal determine the
responsibility for these massacres.''
	   Kabila denies that his forces targeted refugees, but has
acknowledged that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by Mobutu to fight the
rebels, may have been killed in battle along with the women and
children they hid among.
	   Even before the team was finally withdrawn, and despite
assurances from Kabila's government that it would cooperate, the
investigation had been delayed by numerous disagreements over its
scope and conduct.
	   ``It is a source of deep regret that, between its first
deployment in August 1997 and its withdrawal in April 1998, the
team was not allowed to carry out its mission fully and without
hindrance,'' Annan said in a letter to the Security Council
accompanying the team's report.
	   Despite the interference, the team was able to come to some
solid conclusions, he wrote: that all parties involved in the
violence ``have committed serious violations of human rights or
international humanitarian law,'' and that some of those violations
may constitute genocide.
	   He called for further investigation of those crimes and of their
motivation.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With temperatures expected to hit 42
degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) this weekend, the
government on Tuesday ordered hospitals and other care facilities
to prepare for a heat wave.
	   Industry Minister Vasso Papandreou also called an emergency
meeting at the Public Power Company, or DEI, after increased use of
domestic air conditioners caused a short circuit at a main power
substation and blacked out more than 25 percent of the capital.
	   ``The network was overloaded because too many air conditioners
were working,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   Temperatures in Athens hit 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees
Fahrenheit) on Tuesday and the National Weather Service forecast
temperatures around Greece would peak at about 42 degrees (108
degrees Fahrenheit) from Friday until Sunday.
	   Although power was restored by early afternoon, DEI officials
said two power stations under repair would be on-line by Friday.
The blackout trapped about 2,000 people in elevators, while a lack
of traffic lights jammed streets in this city of nearly five
million.
	   ``Consumers have to be careful with their air conditioners
during peak hours,'' warned DEI official Nikos Metaxas.

Russia welcomes lifting of U.S. ban on Cuban overflights 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS overline to CORRECT spelling `welcomes'
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Tuesday the American decision to
change its airspace restrictions to allow Cuban jetliners to fly
over the eastern United States en route to Canada.
	   Russia regards this ``as a positive step toward the long overdue
normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The United States lifted the ban in mid-June after Cuba filed a
complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization.
	   The United States banned Cuban flights over its territory in the
1960s, citing national security security concerns. As a result,
Russian-made Air Cubana jets have flown a circuitous route to
Canada just off the east coast.
	   The no-fly rule was eased in 1988, when Cuban jets were allowed
to cross land at New York City and approach Toronto and Montreal
over upstate New York. The planes have also been allowed to cross
land in bad weather or emergencies.
	   Under the new policy, the Cuban planes will be allowed to fly
directly to Montreal and Toronto over the eastern United States.
	   The change is expected to save wear-and-tear on Air Cubana's
planes and about a half-hour in flight time.

now that it has happened, I, together with my people, will do my
best to make the sky clear and cloudless.''

Thirty-nine nations launch search for loot taken from Holocaust victims With US-Swiss Banks-Nazis AP Diplomatic Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Thirty nine-nations launched a drive Tuesday
to identify art stolen from Holocaust victims and to compensate
their heirs.
	   The session at the U.S. Holocaust Museum marked a new chapter in
uncovering the misdeeds of the Germans and their collaborators in
World War II a half-century after the killing of 6 million Jews and
millions of other Nazi victims.
	   The search also will deal with unpaid life and property
insurance claims.
	   U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who has
spearheaded inquiries into the theft of gold, told the delegates
there is a risk of reviving latent anti-semitism.
	   But, he said, ``this can be a healing process, which can
strengthen each of our countries and bring this century to a close
on a high note of justice.''
	   In a related development, five survivors of Nazi concentration
camps sued the Swiss central bank in a U.S. court Monday to try to
recover plundered gold accepted by Switzerland during World War II,
	   The class-action suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages
from the Swiss National Bank, which, like the better-known private
Swiss banks, accepted Nazi deposits.
	   Paul T. Gallagher, a lawyer for five survivors, said the suit is
the first against the Swiss National Bank.
	   In early June, the Association of Art Museum Directors
recommended American art museums check their collections to
determine if any works were stolen during the war and to set up a
worldwide database for tracking.
	   ``By adopting the report, America's museums place themselves on
record as committed to acting swiftly,'' Philippe de Montebello,
director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, said after the
meeting in Worcester, Massachusetts.
	   The Museum of Modern Art in New York recently stopped
prosecutors from seizing two Egon Schiele paintings on loan from
the Leopold Foundation of Vienna. Two families claim the works were
plundered during the Nazi era from relatives.
	   In May, the Dutch government widened its own investigation into
the ownership of thousands of artworks recovered from Nazis but
never claimed.
	   The 4,000 items ranged from paintings to ceramic objects and
including pieces by the Dutch masters Vincent van Gogh and
Rembrandt.
	   Eizenstat acknowledged Tuesday that ``the debate over
Nazi-confiscated art often intrudes on questions of sovereignty and
the sacred ground of national heritage.''
	   But, he said, ``we also have a great responsibility to Holocaust
survivors, and their heirs and survivors to shed light on these
issues.''
	   Germany and its collaborators across Europe from France to
Russia not only sought to exterminate all European Jews but stole
their assets, even to the point of extracting gold from the teeth
of victims.
	   Also, the Germans systematically looted insurance policies,
collecting from companies on deaths and property losses. The amount
potentially at stake is incalculable.
	   The major German insurance company, Allianz, is in the midst of
a research program under the direction of Gerald Feldman, a
professor of modern German history at the University of California
at Berkeley.
	   Research is under way, as well, at the Generali insurance
company in Trieste. The city was part of the Austro-Hungarian
empire before the war and many Jews who lived in that area placed
their insurance with Generali.
	   A conference will be held in Washington in November to assess
progress on the art and insurance fronts.
	   In another action Tuesday, Austria, Greece, Italy, The
Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Poland decided to
turn most or all of their shares of 6 million tons of gold seized
by Germany from their central banks during the war to funds for
Holocaust victims.
	   The gold, now worth about dlrs 41 million, has been held by a
three-nation commission formed by the United States, Britain and
France.
	   Eizenstat called the decision ``very encouraging news'' and said
it closed out an important chapter in postwar history. A total of
about 337 tons of gold was seized. All but the 6 million was
returned earlier to the central banks.
	   Three countries not involved in the seizure, Argentina, Brazil
and Sweden, made contributions to the fund, while in what Eizenstat
called a ``moral gesture,'' the three overseers of the fund, the
United States, Britain and France, made donations.
	   Britain contributed dlrs 1.62 million, the United States dlrs 4
million and France dlrs 3.3 million.

Prisoners assault Tamil lawmaker in Sri Lanka 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos Upcoming
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Tamil lawmaker was seriously injured
Tuesday when some prisoners attacked him in a jail he was visiting,
his party spokesman said.
	   Douglas Devananda, the leader of the Eelam People's Democratic
Party (EPDP), was being treated in the intensive care unit of
Colombo's National Hospital, said Ravi, an EPDP spokesman, who uses
only one name.
	   ``Four or five inmates surrounded him and assaulted him with a
blunt weapon,'' said Ravi. He was repeatedly hit on the head.
	   The prisoners are believed to be supporters of the Tamil Tigers
rebel group, which has been fighting for a separate homeland since
1983.
	   Their ire was directed at Devananda whose party broke ranks with
the rebel groups in 1985. Later, Devananda's party contested the
1994 general elections, winning nine seats in 225-seat Sri Lankan
Parliament.
	   The EPDP also won the majority of seats in 10 of 17 councils in
local elections in the northern Jaffna Peninsula earlier this year.
	   Devananda visited the prison to win over the support of Tamil
prisoners who had started a hunger strike. The prison is located at
Kalutara, a southern Sri Lankan city, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
south of Colombo.
	   The EPDP has been helping the government troops in northern
Jaffna Peninsula. Suspected Tamil rebels have in the past tried to
kill Devananda.
	   The Tamil Tiger rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in the nations north and east, claiming they were
widely discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control
the government and the military.
	   More than 52,000 people have been killed in the fighting.

U.S. jet fires on Iraqi installation AP Military Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOP 7 grafs new with Defense Secretary Cohen comments
By SUSANNE SCHAFER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 attack jet fired on an Iraqi
surface-to-air missile site after its radar locked on British
patrol planes, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday. He
called the split-second response ``an act of self-defense.''
	   Iraq denied any aggressive act.
	   Cohen said he hoped the incident was an isolated one. But he
told reporters: ``If our aircraft, or those or our allies are
threatened, it will be met with a very vigorous response.''
	   The defense secretary said he would make no move to bolster the
20,000 U.S. forces now in the region _ but could if the situation
takes a turn for the worse. Of late, the Iraqis have had no
heightened military alerts, no changes in their air defense systems
or taken any other aggressive moves that would call for such a
change, Cohen said.
	   Cohen also said it was not clear whether the missile site that
was targeted by the U.S. F-16 had been hit. British officials said
they believe it was destroyed.
	   The fighter, one of four U.S.-F16CJs on the patrol, had been
accompanying four British Tornadoes and other allied warplanes
enforcing the southern no-fly zone. The planes returned safely to
base.
	   The Iraqi radar at the site had illuminated the British jets,
signaling an intention to fire, said Pentagon spokesman Col.
Richard Bridges.
	   A White House official traveling in China with President Bill
Clinton said the patrol involved 10 U.S.-allied planes.
	   In Baghdad, an Iraqi official called the incident ``proof of the
aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Vice President Al Gore, speaking to reporters at the White
House, said there should be no rush to assume the incident was a
deliberate provocation. ``We do know from the history of patrolling
the no-fly zones that there are a lot of incidents like this from
time to time and there are other possible explanations,'' he said.
	   ``But just so the message is clear, we are going to continue to
patrol, and anytime there is any kind of threatening act we will
take decisive action to respond immediately,'' Gore said.
	   The incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq at about
0530GMT. The firing of the missile was standard response to Iraq's
locking its radar on any U.S.-allied aircraft, the Pentagon said.
	   No U.S. warplanes were fired upon and there was no report from
U.S. officials on whether the missile fired by the F-16 struck its
target. But British officials said they believe the target was
destroyed.
	   The U.S. aircraft fired because it was armed with the special
HARM air-to-ground missiles and had the role of protecting the
British aircraft during their patrol mission, Pentagon officials
said.
	   An administration official traveling with President Clinton in
Shanghai, China, said the president was informed of the Iraqi
incident.
	   In London, the British Defense Ministry confirmed the missile
firing.
	   ``The Defense Ministry can confirm that a coalition aircraft
launched a missile at an Iraqi defense system this morning when
that system threatened coalition aircraft on a patrol in the south
no-fly zone,'' a ministry statement said.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, speaking as is customary
on condition of anonymity, said the Iraqi radar locked on to six of
the 10 aircraft in the patrol, which included the four British
Tornadoes, prompting the U.S. jet to fire.

Finance Minister, key free market reformer, resigns 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's finance minister, a key
figure in the country's drive to open up its economy to trade and
investment, resigned Tuesday.
	   Freddy Rojas Parra, 54, cited personal reasons for his decision
to vacate the position he has held for about a year. He had tried
to push through a new sales tax in recent weeks, but President
Rafael Caldera's opposition to the idea had reportedly caused
friction between the two men.
	   Maritza Izaguirre, Venezuela's current representative to the
Inter-American Development Bank, will replace Rojas as finance
minister. Information Minister Fernando Egana described her Tuesday
as ``one of the most respected economists in Venezuela.''
	   Plummeting oil prices and one of the continent's most bloated
bureaucracies have left the country in a financial crisis.

Romania lawmakers keep law against homosexual relations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with human rights group criticizing vote
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Legislators voted Tuesday to keep
homosexual activity a criminal act in Romania, despite pressure
from the government and the European Union to decriminalize it.
	   Lawmakers rejected a government proposal to abolish a law that
makes homosexual relations punishable by one to five years in
prison, instead voting to reduce the minimal sentence to three
months.
	   ``Integration in Europe does not presuppose sodomy,'' deputy Dan
Barbaresso said last week in arguing against legalization.
	   Baptist priest Matei Boila also invoked family, moral and
Christian values.
	   ``The vote will ... weigh negatively on whether we enter NATO
and the European Union,'' said Nicolae Stefanescu, head of the
Human Rights' League, criticizing the action.
	   The main opposition for legalizing homosexual activity is the
Romanian Orthodox Church, which is strongly opposed to any form of
homosexuality. Almost 90 percent of Romanians adhere to the
Orthodox creed.

	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ Fifteen cattle herdsmen were killed and
four others seriously wounded in a cross-border attack by marauding
nomad cattle raiders from Mali, Niger's state-run radio reported
Tuesday.
	   The attack was launched by a group of Tuareg nomads on a desert
camp near the village of Abalek about 150 kilometers (100 miles)
northeast of Niger's capital of Niamey early Sunday morning, the
radio station said.
	   An attempt by soldiers from Niger to chase down the raiders, who
stole an unknown number of cattle, failed, said Niger army
commander Lawal Chekou Kore.
	   The Tuaregs, a light-skinned ethnic Berber race, have inhabited
the Sahara for centuries. Although many have given up their nomadic
existence, others continue to roam across borders.

Synagogue a link to Shanghai's Jewish past 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The memories that echo through Ohel
Rachel Synagogue trace the triumphs and trials of life for the Jews
of Shanghai.
	   The synagogue that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visits on
Wednesday opened in March 1920 as a testament to Shanghai's
then-thriving Jewish community.
	   In World War II, Japanese soldiers used the synagogue as a
stable; until recently, it was used as a storage building by local
education officials.
	   So little remains of its early days that the synagogue is being
restored in part from the childhood memories of a Shanghai-born
Israeli whose family lived down the street.
	   It is one of the last links to an era when Shanghai was home to
tens of thousands of Jews who played a prominent role in its
business and cultural life.
	   By the time Ohel Rachel was built, the Kadoories, Sassoons and
other Jewish families from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere had grown rich
running banks in Shanghai and trading tea, silk and opium. The
Kadoories had one of the city's most opulent mansions, and Victor
Sassoon built the famed Cathay Hotel.
	   Its status as a trading center with a liberal immigration policy
made Shanghai a haven for thousands of Russian Jews fleeing
revolution in the 1920s. In the next decade, some 20,000 Jews came
to escape Hitler's Germany.
	   Among the refugees were Michael Blumenthal, who later became
Treasury secretary during the Carter administration, and the late
Shaul Eisenberg, who ran and founded the Eisenberg group of
companies in Israel.
	   But after the communist victory in 1949, the Jews of Shanghai
scattered, many to Israel or the United States. The Kadoories left
for Hong Kong. Ohel Rachel and other synagogues and Jewish schools
were demolished or turned into warehouses, dining halls or
workshops.
	   Now, after 40 years of neglect, Ohel Rachel is being restored,
though it isn't clear whether China will allow Jews to worship
there. State controls on religion are strict, and Judaism isn't
officially recognized. The Jewish community of Shanghai today
numbers only about 200, all of them foreigners. They hold services
in hotel rooms or private homes.
	   The restoration was spurred by a promise by Mayor Xu Kuangdi to
Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a member of a U.S. religious delegation that
visited this year, to reopen the synagogue as a historic site.
	   Schneier told The Asian Wall Street Journal that during a visit
Wednesday by Mrs. Clinton, he plans to present the synagogue with a
Torah, the Jewish holy book, ``authenticating the sanctuary.''
	   Ohel Rachel was once one of six synagogues in Shanghai. Four
have been destroyed, and the fifth _ the Moshe Ohel _ is used as an
office building, with a small section set aside as a museum of the
Jewish era in Shanghai.

Civic leaders ask Mandela to help strike a peace in Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Two civic leaders are asking a veteran
of racial conflict, South African President Nelson Mandela, to help
ease ethnic tensions in Guyana during a visit to the Caribbean this
week.
	   David Yhann II, president of the Non-Governmental Forum, and Al
Haj Fazeel Ferouz, a well-known Muslim cleric, sent a letter
Tuesday to Mandela asking him to meet with President Janet Jagan
and opposition party leader Desmond Hoyte during a Caribbean
Community meeting in St. Lucia.
	   They urged Mandela to use his ``tremendous moral authority and
impeccable democratic credentials'' to strike a peace between the
two leaders.
	   Demonstrations and firebombings have swept through Georgetown in
recent weeks as Guyanese of African descent renewed protests that
Jagan's party rigged the December elections.
	   Jagan's People's Progressive Party is mostly supported by people
of East Indian descent. Guyana's history is marked by friction
between the two ethnic groups.
	   The letter to Mandela noted that the Caribbean Community lobbied
against apartheid, the government-sanctioned system of racial
discrimination in South Africa.
	   A Caribbean Community audit of the Guyanese election said June 2
that the vote was fair, but Hoyte's People's National Congress
disagrees. Hoyte led a protest march of more than 7,000 people on
Monday.
	   ``All this poses a serious threat to the future of the country
as a whole and threatens to undermine the economic recovery and
democratic gains that have been achieved in recent years,'' the
letter said. ``The economy continues to deteriorate and racial
tensions deepen.''
	   Many stores in Georgetown closed during the worst of the
demonstrations, and the government has warned that the unrest is
scaring away investors. A Canadian firm called off the purchase of
the government's electric utility in January, citing the violence.
	   Hoyte said protests would continue until Jagan's party agrees to
revamp the constitution to balance power between the races.

Italian premier's visit expected to improve Iran-EU relations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Prodi arriving, quotes.
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In a sign of Iran's growing international
acceptance, the Italian prime minister arrived Tuesday to improve
ties between the European Union and the Islamic republic.
	   Relations with the EU were strained after a German court
implicated the Tehran government last year in the assassination of
four Iranian dissidents.
	   Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi is the first EU leader to
travel to Iran since the 1992 visit by Greek Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis. After his arrival, Prodi declared that Iran
had ``a very important role'' to play.
	   ``Of course, I'm here only as the Italian prime minister but I
have talked with my colleagues and my counterparts in the European
Union and all of them are very well informed about the importance
of this trip,'' he said.
	   Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Ahani said the trip would
``result in an immediate thaw in relations between Tehran and the
European Union.''
	   The 15-nation EU broke off regular meetings with Iranian
officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after a German
court accused Iranian leaders of ordering the 1992 assassination of
four Kurdish Iranian dissidents in Berlin.
	   The ambassadors returned late last year and in March the EU
agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Relations also have long been strained by Iran's 1989 death
sentence against the British author Salman Rushdie which considers
his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' as blasphemous.
	   In addition to EU relations, Iran hopes to do more business with
Italy, whose trade with Iran totaled dlrs 2.3 billion last year,
making it Tehran's fourth biggest trading partner. Prodi will be
accompanied by his minister of foreign trade.
	   During his visit, which ends Wednesday, the Italian prime
minister is expected to hold talks with Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami and business leaders.
	   He will also address a cultural conference at Tehran University
called ``Look to the East,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West. He has promoted
cultural and sporting exchanges with the United States and has
eased social restrictions imposed by the clergy after the 1979
revolution.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expressed regret Tuesday over the death of

	   A charter plane carrying Beye, two pilots and five other members
of the U.N. observer mission for Angola crashed Friday in the Ivory
Coast.
	   Beye, a former foreign minister of Mali, was traveling in the
region seeking support for the peace process from African leaders.
	   ``The creative potential of that well-known statesman manifested
itself especially brightly in his U.N. peacemaking activities,''
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.

Mandela calls for accelerated redistribution of wealth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
called Tuesday for accelerated redistribution of the country's
wealth to overcome the legacy of apartheid which left an
impoverished black majority.
	   ``Many years will be needed to achieve the equitable
redistribution of wealth to which we aspire,'' Mandela said. ``But
having made a good start, the challenge now is to increase the pace
of delivery to further better the lives of the people.''
	   Speaking at the Sowetan, a Johannesburg-area daily with a large
black readership, Mandela said that although the pace of getting
non-whites a bigger slice of the pie was proceeding slowly,
progress was being made.
	   ``Against heavy odds a pioneering entrepreneurial sector is
emerging among non-whites,'' Mandela said, noting that
black-controlled firms now account for 6 percent or 66.7 billion
rand (dlrs 11.3 billion) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's total
market capitalisation.
	   Mandela said those who held a privileged status under apartheid
and those who have made headway since apartheid ended should take
the initiative in providing resources and skills to improve the
lives of the poor.
	   ``As we destroyed apartheid, so too can we defeat poverty and
discrimination if we are united,'' said Mandela, who became
president in the nation's first all-race elections in 1994, an
event which marked the end of apartheid.
	   During his presidency, Mandela has held off on radical
transformation, instead promoting reconciliation by allowing the
privileged a few years' grace.
	   That is apt to change under Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy
president who is likely to succeed Mandela as president in the 1999
elections.
	   The civil service, a bastion of Dutch-descended Afrikaners under
apartheid, would be forced to shed white workers for blacks. An
affirmative action bill heading to Parliament would require
companies to show what steps they are taking to make their work
forces reflect the national racial breakdown.
	   However Mbeki wouldn't be likely to adopt policies that would
unduly frighten white businessmen and skilled professionals who are
crucial to the economy.

Serbs retak coal mine after fierce offensive on Kosovo rebels 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with mine retaken

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo's capital on Tuesday after
a withering offensive that sent thousands of villagers streaming.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on the area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had
captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes in the conflict this year. Another said
both sides were guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to halt the steadily worsening conflict.
	   Throughout the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and
mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _ all fired on
the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment of the area, Serb forces ceased
their fire about 6 a.m., then resumed it a few hours later after
changing their positions. At least four other villages also were
shelled Tuesday.
	   They finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the
late afternoon.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses hit by small-arms
fire and artillery. Police captured several KLA uniforms as well as
rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades.

Croatia upsets Romania; Saint-Etienne thankful for no upsets WILL be UPDATED with England-Argentina. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: NEW throughout with Tuesday's developments; CHANGES byline;
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In Bordeaux, Croatia got its upset over Romania. In
Saint-Etienne, residents hoped that their match, too, would be
remembered for what happened on the field and not in the streets.
	   While Croatia on Tuesday became the first team to reach the
quarterfinals in its World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974,
the people of the central southern city that hosted Argentina and
England's second-round match were just hoping for a quiet night.
	   With about 1,600 police patrolling the city of 250,000, things
were relatively quiet in Saint-Etienne hours before the match. The
night before, incidents between English fans and local North
African youths, eager to gain retribution for clashes two weeks ago
in Marseille, resulted in 10 arrests, nine French and one English.
	   On Tuesday, police arrested one English fan, identified by
British police as a ``category C'' hooligan _ the most dangerous
type _ as he disembarked a train. Authorities said the suspect was
subject to expulsion or a quick French court trial.
	   Croatia expelled its Balkan neighbor Romania from the World Cup
on a first-half disputed penalty by Davor Suker, who had to take
the kick twice.
	   Argentine referee Javier Castrilli pointed to the spot after
whistling a foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, who went down with
Aljosa Asanovic as they chased a ball in the penalty area.
	   Suker casually drove a right-footed shot just inside the right
post, but had to take it again after Castrilli waived it off
because at least two Croatians had crossed into the penalty arc
before Suker struck the ball.
	   The Croatian forward, whose Real Madrid teammate from
Yugoslavia, Predrag Mijatovic, missed his penalty Monday night,
lined up again. This time he struck a more confident penalty,
putting it past the stretching Romanian keeper Bogdan Stelea.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''
	   The goal came amid Croatia's control of the game, in which
Stelea was tested several times in the first half alone.
	   ``We have eliminated a team with a great tradition,'' Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Our players achieved a big goal.
We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   The victory put Croatia into a quarterfinal meeting with Germany
on Saturday at Lyon, giving organizers a break after a string of
politically charged matches.
	   So far, the World Cup has had to deal with several games between
political foes: United States-Iran, United States-Yugoslavia and
Argentina-England.
	   Germany was one of the first nations to recognize Croatia's
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, making the match a friendly
non-friendly.
	   About the only sporting animosity between the two is Germany's
2-1 quarterfinal victory in England two years ago, a match which
sent the Germans on the way to their European Championship title.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia. There is no
greater pleasure in sport than beating a friend.''
	   If Croatia were to advance to the semifinals, its trip would not
be unprecedented. Portugal reached the semis in its first try in
1966.
	   Meanwhile, doctors treating Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old police
officer beaten into a coma in Lens by German neo-Nazis more than a
week ago, said he was reacting to stimulation and there were signs
he was gradually recovering. He remains listed in critical
condition.

Serbs retak coal mine after fierce offensive on Kosovo rebels

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo's capital on Tuesday after
a withering offensive that sent thousands of villagers streaming.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on the area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had
captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes in the conflict this year. Another said
both sides were guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to halt the steadily worsening conflict.
	   Throughout the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and
mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _ all fired on
the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment of the area, Serb forces ceased
their fire about 6 a.m., then resumed it a few hours later after
changing their positions. At least four other villages also were
shelled Tuesday.
	   They finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the
late afternoon.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses hit by small-arms
fire and artillery. Police captured several KLA uniforms as well as
rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customs officers arrested a 70-year-old man trying
to smuggle 800 grams (28 ounces) of heroin into Russia in his

First spread found of AIDS virus resistant to most powerful drugs With AIDS Drugs AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For the first time, doctors reported Tuesday the
ominous spread of a strain of AIDS virus resistant to the medicines
that have revolutionized care of the disease over the past two
years.
	   AIDS viruses have long circulated that are impervious to AZT and
other older AIDS medicines. But now people are beginning to catch
viruses that are also resistant to protease inhibitors, the pivotal
ingredients of the drug cocktails that have made AIDS a survivable
disease.
	   These infections will almost certainly be difficult and perhaps
impossible to treat _ at least with the medicines now on the
market.
	   Some believe that the availability of AIDS treatment with
protease inhibitors has made some people less diligent about
safe-sex practices to prevent infection.
	   ``This is a wake-up call to people who assume that since we have
adequate therapy, if they get infected they will be easily
treated,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ``If you get this multi-drug
resistant virus, it will be just as if you got infected in 1983
when we had absolutely no antiretroviral drugs.''
	   At the 12th International AIDS Conference, San Francisco doctors
reported one new infection with a highly resistant virus, while a
Swiss team said they had seen several more. No one knows yet how
frequently these untreatable strains are spreading.
	   The San Francisco case was described by Dr. Frederick Hecht of
the University of California, San Francisco. A report on it will be
published later this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   ``We are seeing the emerging edge of a new aspect of the
epidemic,'' said Hecht. ``These people are at high risk of failing
treatment right from the outset.''
	   The patient, a middle-aged San Francisco man, caught the virus
last fall. He was infected by a man whose own infection was
diagnosed in 1990 and had taken many different AIDS drugs off and
on, including protease inhibitors.
	   The man's virus is resistant to four different protease
inhibitors, plus the drugs AZT and 3TC.
	   From the start of treatment with the three-drug cocktails,
doctors have worried about the spread of resistant strains.
Following the regimens means taking 15 or 20 pills a day on a
precise schedule. Missing even a few doses lets mutant viruses
emerge that are resistant to protease inhibitors.
	   Until now, some experts wondered if these protease-resistant
viruses might spread poorly, because their mutations inhibited
their ability to reproduce.
	   Hecht said doctors first became concerned about the San
Francisco patient after he responded much more slowly than usual to
drug treatment. After learning his virus was resistant to the
drugs, he stopped therapy entirely but is still healthy.
	   The Swiss cases were reported at the conference by Dr. Sabine
Yerly and others from University Hospital in Geneva.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's finance minister, a key
figure in the country's drive to open up its economy to trade and
investment, resigned Tuesday.
	   Freddy Rojas Parra, 54, cited personal reasons for his decision
to vacate the position he has held since December. He had tried to
push through a new sales tax in recent weeks, but President Rafael
Caldera's opposition to the idea had reportedly caused friction
between the two men.
	   Maritza Izaguirre, Venezuela's current representative to the
Inter-American Development Bank, will replace Rojas as finance
minister. Information Minister Fernando Egana described her Tuesday
as ``one of the most respected economists in Venezuela.''
	   Plummeting oil prices and one of the continent's most bloated
bureaucracies have left the country mired in a financial crisis.
	   In another cabinet change announced Tuesday, Interior Minister
Jose Guillermo Andueza and presidential chief of staff Asdrubal
Aguiar switched jobs.

German star to play with Mavericks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with news conference; EDITS
By DAVID KOENIG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Dirk Nowitzki, the 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) German
star, said Tuesday he plans to give up European ball to play for
the Dallas Mavericks next season.
	   ``I spoke to my parents this morning and they said ... `OK, if
you want to do it,' '' Nowitzki said at a news conference. ``The
coach was nice to me and I met some players. They were pretty nice.
The decision was easy this morning.''
	   Nowitzki, who was headed home Tuesday, said he's not worried
about the labor dispute. He said that if it becomes prolonged, he
hopes to stay sharp by playing for his German club team.
	   Don Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and general manager, did not
want Nowitzki to return to Germany unsigned because he would be
free to negotiate with European clubs.
	   The Mavericks cannot offer him a contract because the rookie
salary scale is one of the items in the labor dispute between the
owners and players.
	   Nowitzki, who had said he would need two more seasons before he
was ready for the NBA, was drafted ninth overall by Milwaukee last
week, then traded to Dallas. Mavericks officials flew to Germany
the next day to recruit him.
	   Nowitzki arrived in Dallas on Sunday and stayed at Nelson's
home. He held a news conference Monday and attended a barbecue with
prospective teammates that night.
	   The 20-year-old player said he was concerned his game wasn't
polished enough for the NBA and he wanted to make sure he was free
to help the German national team qualify for the Olympics.
	   Nelson assured Nowitzki he's ready and the Mavericks have agreed
to let him leave the team in the fall and winter to play for his
country's squad.
	   ``I think my offense is pretty good,'' Nowitzki said. ``Defense,
I have to work hard, learn a bit more. I hope it works out.''
	   Added Nelson: ``I told him not to worry about his reservations
of the NBA or his skill level. That's our job. We evaluate talent
all the time. We know that he's good enough, that he can play at
age 20.''

Russia denies tax delinquents access to oil export pipeline 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five oil companies that have not paid their taxes
will be denied access to an export pipeline, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's chronic tax collection problem is partly to blame for
the country's current financial crisis, and oil companies are the
biggest debtors.
	   Starting Wednesday, Bashneft, SIDANCO, the Tyumen Oil Company,
Tatneft and ONACO will be denied access to the export pipeline
until they pay their bills, said Vice Premier Viktor Khristenko.
	   ``The government is determined to have all market players
fulfill their liabilities to the state,'' he told reporters. ``We
will watch closely to see to it that oil companies earnestly pay
taxes to the federal budget.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One day after being blamed by Israel's
president for failing in Mideast peacemaking, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu struck back Tuesday, accusing the president of
siding with the opposition.
	   President Ezer Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when
he went on national television and blamed Netanyahu for the
deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and said it
was time to call early elections.
	   Tuesday, Netanyahu did the same, accusing Weizman of breaching
the presidential role by siding with Israel's political left, in
opposition since Netanyahu's narrow election two years ago.
	   ``The fact is that the President, to my sorrow, took a stand
with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV.
	   Netanyahu said he had hoped that when Weizman was re-elected to
a second term in March, he would ``behave like his predecessors,''
who kept to the largely ceremonial role of the office.
	   ``The president is attacking the prime minister on a personal
basis, it's not a healthy thing for Israel.'' Netanyahu said,
adding that Weizman's ``blunt involvement in internal politics,''
crossed lines.
	   The president, elected by Israel's parliament, has no authority
to determine the date of the next elections. However, Weizman is
Israel's most popular politician, and with his stinging criticism
of Netanyahu he lent greater credibility to opposition claims that
early elections are the only way to rescue the peace process with
the Palestinians.
	   Cabinet ministers and legislators close to Netanyahu launched a
counterattack, saying Weizman overstepped his authority and called
for his resignation.
	   Separate photographs of both leaders in combative stances with
their fists clenched were splashed across the front page of the
Yediot Ahronot daily. A poll of 507 Israelis in Yediot indicated
that 50 percent of Israelis favored early elections and 39 percent
did not. The margin of error was 4.5 percent.
	   In an interview with Yediot, Weizman questioned Netanyahu's
qualifications to be prime minister.
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality. The nation does not know where the prime minister is
leading them,'' Weizman said.
	   ``He rules by trial and error. If Netanyahu wants to know what
the nation thinks, he should go to polls,'' Weizman said.
	   Weizman will continue his campaign for new elections as long as
there is no breakthrough in the negotiations with the Palestinians
over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, his aides told
Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu has dismissed early elections and said they would be
held as scheduled in the year 2000. He also blamed the Palestinians
and not his government, for the stalemate in progress towards
peace.
	   The United States is awaiting a long-overdue answer from Israel
on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Israel radio reported that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright telephoned Netanyahu from China Tuesday and urged him once
again to move forward with a promised Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo's capital on Tuesday after
a withering offensive that sent thousands of villagers streaming
toward safety.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks

captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo, as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak

	   Also Tuesday, one human rights group accused the Serbs of rape
and other war crimes in the conflict. Another said both sides were
guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to the steadily worsening conflict.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance. Ninety percent of the province's population is
ethnic Albanian, but the Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their
culture. International sentiment is against granting the province
independence because frontier changes in the volatile Balkans often
lead to more bloodshed.
	   Throughout the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   From the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and mortars,
well-camouflaged in the lush green foliage, all fired on the
KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment, Serb forces ceased their fire for a
few hours, then resumed after changing their positions. They
finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the late
afternoon. At least four other villages were also shelled Tuesday.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses hit by small-arms
fire and artillery. Police captured several KLA uniforms as well as
rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades.

Clinton visits China's shining stock exchange AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Speech to business leaders at 0100GMT Wednesday
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ At a showcase of capitalism in communist
China, President Bill Clinton is extolling the benefits of open
markets for the Chinese and opportunities for American businesses
in the world's largest country.
	   ``China is a major economic power that will grow only larger
over time,'' the president said Tuesday. On Wednesday, he tours
Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering symbol of China's march
toward a market economy.
	   In the towering steel and glass building housing the exchange,
the president will have lunch with young Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   The United States insists that China open its markets and allow
investment opportunities as a condition for joining the World Trade
Organization, which sets the rules for global trade. But U.S.
officials said they were disappointed by a lack of progress on that
front during talks in Beijing.
	   On Tuesday, the president was whisked around this bustling city
of skyscrapers, from a roundtable discussion with opinion leaders
to a fast-paced radio call-in show. He finished the day with dinner
at the Peace Hotel, an art deco building overlooking Shanghai's
neon-lit waterfront. It was at the Peace Hotel where novelist Noel
Coward wrote his famous ``Private Lives.''
	   Returning to his hotel suite, Clinton was told that a U.S. F-16
fighter had fired a missile at an Iraqi radar installation after it
locked on U.N. planes. By then, eight hours had elapsed since the
firing. An administration official could not explain the delay.
	   In Beijing, the government said Clinton's visit ``achieved full
success.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang pointed to a
string of agreements between Clinton and President Jiang Zemin _
from an accord not to aim missiles at each other's country to
cooperation on environmental protection and legal reforms.
	   Clinton, stopping by a reception at Shanghai Museum, spoke of
China's economic progress over the past two decades. ``I have seen
the Chinese people rising, millions of them, out of poverty.
Millions more finding interesting work of their own choice,
pursuing more educational opportunities, having more say in their
local affairs.''
	   The U.S. is unhappy about a dlrs 50 billion trade deficit with
Beijing. Commerce Secretary William Daley said he had ``been made
once again well aware of the lack of opportunities for American
businesses'' as he met with U.S. business leaders in China.
	   ``But at the same time, every one of the businesses I spoke to
... have indicated strongly that they believe that there is a
change that has occurred over the last two years and it is
extremely positive,'' Daley said.
	   Unlike Clinton's trip to Africa in March, business leaders were
not invited to be part of Clinton's delegation in China. Daley said
that dealings with China had not been affected by investigations
back home about Clinton's authorization of U.S. satellites on
Chinese rockets.
	   Earlier in the trip, Daley said he expected U.S. businesses to
sign deals worth as much as dlrs 1.5 billion in connection with
Clinton's visit.
	   At Tuesday's roundtable, Clinton dealt with one of the most
sensitive issues in U.S.-Chinese relations: America's ties with
Taiwan. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is unhappy
about U.S. arms sales to the Tapei government.
	   Clinton carefully adhered to long-standing policy and spelled it
out carefully. But in the world of diplomatic nuance, it was seen
as significant that Clinton himself stated it publicly for the
first time.
	   ``We don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or
one Taiwan-one China,'' he said. ``And we don't believe that Taiwan
should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a
requirement.''

First spread found of AIDS virus resistant to most powerful drugs With AIDS Drugs AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITS to RESTORE HFR slug
Eds: Hold for release at 0600 GMT Wednesday.
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For the first time, doctors reported Tuesday the
ominous spread of a strain of AIDS virus resistant to the medicines
that have revolutionized care of the disease over the past two
years.
	   AIDS viruses have long circulated that are impervious to AZT and
other older AIDS medicines. But now people are beginning to catch
viruses that are also resistant to protease inhibitors, the pivotal
ingredients of the drug cocktails that have made AIDS a survivable
disease.
	   These infections will almost certainly be difficult and perhaps
impossible to treat _ at least with the medicines now on the
market.
	   Some believe that the availability of AIDS treatment with
protease inhibitors has made some people less diligent about
safe-sex practices to prevent infection.
	   ``This is a wake-up call to people who assume that since we have
adequate therapy, if they get infected they will be easily
treated,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ``If you get this multi-drug
resistant virus, it will be just as if you got infected in 1983
when we had absolutely no antiretroviral drugs.''
	   At the 12th International AIDS Conference, San Francisco doctors
reported one new infection with a highly resistant virus, while a
Swiss team said they had seen several more. No one knows yet how
frequently these untreatable strains are spreading.
	   The San Francisco case was described by Dr. Frederick Hecht of
the University of California, San Francisco. A report on it will be
published later this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   ``We are seeing the emerging edge of a new aspect of the
epidemic,'' said Hecht. ``These people are at high risk of failing
treatment right from the outset.''
	   The patient, a middle-aged San Francisco man, caught the virus
last fall. He was infected by a man whose own infection was
diagnosed in 1990 and had taken many different AIDS drugs off and
on, including protease inhibitors.
	   The man's virus is resistant to four different protease
inhibitors, plus the drugs AZT and 3TC.
	   From the start of treatment with the three-drug cocktails,
doctors have worried about the spread of resistant strains.
Following the regimens means taking 15 or 20 pills a day on a
precise schedule. Missing even a few doses lets mutant viruses
emerge that are resistant to protease inhibitors.
	   Until now, some experts wondered if these protease-resistant
viruses might spread poorly, because their mutations inhibited
their ability to reproduce.
	   Hecht said doctors first became concerned about the San
Francisco patient after he responded much more slowly than usual to
drug treatment. After learning his virus was resistant to the
drugs, he stopped therapy entirely but is still healthy.
	   The Swiss cases were reported at the conference by Dr. Sabine
Yerly and others from University Hospital in Geneva.

Italian prepared to play France in wolf's den 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy is prepared to play in the wolf's
den.
	   As the French ``cocks'' _ the emblem of country and its national
team _ turned wolves in the imagination of Italian coach Cesare
Maldini, the Italy-France World Cup quarterfinal got a fabled tint
with the Italians in the hoped-for role of hunters.
	   ``We are going to play one of the top title contenders, which
has lot of motivations to continue in the tournament because it
plays at home and has never won a World Cup,'' Maldini said at
Italy's training camp Tuesday.
	   ``We have our own motives and the possibility to do well in the
wolf's den, and come out with a victory.''
	   Friday's quarterfinal match at Saint-Denis will feature duels
between teammates. Several French internationals play with Italian
clubs in the Seria A.
	   Italian forward Alessandro Del Piero plays with French stars
Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps with Juventus of Turin.
France's Lilian Thuram teams with Italy's Dino Baggio and Fabio
Cannavaro at Parma.
	   ``We know each another very well,'' Baggio said. ``But I don't
think this is going to give any advantage to one of the two
sides.''
	   Baggio is expected to play a key role in Friday's quarterfinal
match as he may mark Zidane, France's midfield mastermind.
	   Zidane, who's returning from a two-game suspension, is the most
respected and feared player in the opinion of the Italians.
	   ``He's one of the strongest world players. We must try to limit
his imagination, but must not concentrate our attention only on
him. France has a lot of good players,'' said AC Milan defender
Alessandro Costacurta, who will have teammate Marcel Desailly on
the rival side.
	   Maldini said Zidane ``is a very important player for France, but
he's one of the many champions fielded by the French team.''
	   The Italian coach did not expect an exhausted opponent. France
needed extra time to defeat Paraguay in its second-round match
Sunday.
	   ``You overcome tiredness quickly when you win. Paraguay proved a
tough opponent, but France deserved the golden goal victory with an
all-attack match,'' Maldini said.
	   Maldini suggested that Del Piero, much criticized by Italian
media for missing some scoring chances against Norway, will be
starting Friday in a pair with striker Christian Vieri.
	   Maldini also hinted that midfield defender Gianluca Pessotto
will team with Baggio, Luigi Di Biagio and Francesco Moriero.
	   Roberto Baggio, Italy's World Cup hero in 1994, was expected to
be sitting on the substitutes bench, ready to enter at any moment.
	   ``I have the starting 11 already in my mind, but I still have
three training sessions before taking a final decision, including
possible substitutions during the match,'' Maldini said.
	   The Italian coach said he expected quality of play to improve
dramatically beginning with the quarterfinals.
	   ``There are many big matches in the calendar (of the
quarterfinals), and all look like potential finals,'' Maldini
added.
	   ``We know France very well and I hope to have understood
everything of our next opponent.''

Iraq denies its radar locked on to allied planes

Eds: AMs. UPDATES with streets in Baghdad quiet, quotes.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq declared Tuesday that a U.S. missile
struck a water tank instead of a military site in an attack it said
proved ``the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act,'' an official at the
Information Ministry said on condition of anonymity.
	   Pentagon officials said a U.S. F-16 fighter fired the missile at
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern Iraq Tuesday
after Iraqi radar locked on four British patrol planes.
	   The fighter was accompanying the British Tornadoes enforcing the
southern no-fly zone, set up to protect Shiite Muslims from
reprisals by the Iraqi government. The planes returned safely.
	   But the Iraqi official said no radar was illuminated. Another
Iraqi spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency, said no
air defense units in the area sent electronic signals at the time.
	   The missile fell 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the nearest
radar, the official said. The spokesman quoted by the news agency
said the missile hit water tanks 12 kilometers (seven miles) north
of Umm Kasr, an Iraqi port near the Kuwaiti border.
	   ``This aggression is probably a plan for a new all-out
aggression against Iraq,'' the Information Ministry official said.
``This is the proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.''
	   The streets in Baghdad were quiet, and there was no indication
that the attack had occurred. The Iraqi News Agency carried word of
the strike, but most Iraqis were not aware of it.
	   The Pentagon said the firing of the missile was standard when
Iraq locked its radar on any U.S.-allied aircraft. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen called it an ``act of self-defense.''
	   In November 1996, the last time the United States fired at radar
sites, Iraq also denied that its radar had locked on the planes.

Serbs retake coal mine after fierce offensive on Kosovo rebels Tuesday's; combines previous

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo's capital on Tuesday after
a withering offensive that sent thousands of villagers streaming.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on the area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had
captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes in the conflict this year. Another said
both sides were guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to halt the steadily worsening conflict.
	   For much of the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and
mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _ all fired on
the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment of the area, Serb forces ceased
their fire about 6 a.m., then resumed it a few hours later after
changing their positions. At least four other villages also were
shelled Tuesday.
	   They finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the
late afternoon after KLA forces fled.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said earlier Tuesday
that three Albanians were killed Monday in fighting around
Belacevac. There was no immediate word on casualties from Tuesday's
clashes.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses hit by small-arms
fire and artillery. Police seized several KLA uniforms as well as
rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked 19-year-old Saban
Gadeni, a 19-year-old economics student at the University of
Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, said in
Oslo, Norway, that the conflict has reached a critical stage. He
said Americans were still trying to mediate.
	   ``One problem is that, on the military side, there is no clear
Albanian chain of command with which to deal when on talks about a
cease-fire. This is a marked difference from Bosnia,'' said
Holbrooke, who mediated the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, however, that the KLA
should not be part of talks with its ally Yugoslavia.
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to Associated Press offices in the Balkans,
the respected private watchdog group said it had ``powerful
evidence'' that Serb police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified
number of ethnic Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.'' Human Rights Watch also said the
KLA siege of Kijevo town ``affects civilians and other
non-combatants in the town.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International also said the vast
majority of the victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90
percent of the population in Kosovo. But it said Serbs also are
suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' the international human rights organization said.
	   The wife and mother of two Serbs kidnapped Monday by the KLA
appealed to the militants Tuesday to release them.
	   ``My 18-year-old son Ivan's childhood was ruined by the war in
Croatia where we lived, now his youth is ruined in Kosovo,'' said
Vesna Bakrac. The men reportedly were taken off a bus by armed
Albanians on Monday along with two other Serbs.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Kosovo
violence ``unacceptable'' and again demanded that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said Tuesday in Shanghai, China.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to halt
growing resistance.

World Cup: Dutch play down Van der Sar-Bogarde incident 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ The day after beating Yugoslavia to reach the
World Cup quarterfinals, the Dutch were in damage limitation mode
Tuesday, playing down an on-field scuffle between two players.
	   Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar appeared to hit replacement
defender Winston Bogarde during wild celebrations following Edgar
Davids' last-gasp goal that gave the Netherlands a 2-1 victory in
Toulouse Monday night.
	   But in a blaze of media attention at training Tuesday, Van der
Sar dismissed the incident as an overreaction on his part.
	   ``We've talked it out,'' the lanky goalkeeper said. ``People are
looking for something that is not there. It is being taken the
wrong way by people.''
	   The interest was high because the incident hinted at a repeat of
the racial rift within the team that soured the 1996 European
Championship for the Dutch. Van der Sar is white and Bogarde is
black. At Euro 96, the team reportedly split along black-white
lines.
	   Bogarde, who plays for Barcelona, did not speak to the press
Tuesday _ but he rarely speaks to the press anyway.
	   Van der Sar said the scuffle broke out after he was grabbed from
behind by Pierre van Hooijdonk. Unable to breathe properly, he
lashed out with his arms and caught Bogarde with a flying hand. Van
der Sar called it ``an overreaction by me.''
	   Dutch captain Frank de Boer said the team had learned the
lessons of Euro 96 and was not disturbed by the incident _ or the
media attention.
	   ``In the past this might have led to tension,'' he said. ``But
we are two years further and everyone is more adult.''
	   Both players involved quickly sat down in the changing room and
talked over the incident, De Boer said.
	   ``You have to react quickly and not let it get a life of its
own,'' De Boer said.
	   Davids was sent home by coach Guus Hiddink, who said the
midfielder insulted him, at Euro 96 as the tensions bubbled over.
This time, Hiddink said the atmosphere is totally different.
	   ``We all laughed about it before training,'' he said. ``We know
that there are a lot of people around, and if there is nothing else
to do, it is interesting to make a lot of fuss about nothing.''

Vatican closes canon law loophole on theological dissent throughout; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with canon lawyer comments on significance, RECASTS
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican cracked down harder on dissent
Tuesday, ruling out any challenge to church policy such as the bans
on women priests and euthanasia.
	   Pope John Paul II issued a document that declares deviations
from Catholicism's ``definitive truths'' a violation of canon law.
	   The pontiff did not say what specific areas he was taking aim
at. But in a commentary on the document, the Vatican's chief of
doctrine named the church's bans on women priests, euthanasia and
sexual intercourse outside of marriage.
	   Dissenters could be declared ``no longer ... in full communion
with the Catholic Church,'' said Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in an
accompanying document.
	   The pope was acting out of ``imperative necessity to prevent and
refute the opinions of theologians who resist'' definitive Catholic
teachings, the Vatican said.
	   The document, an apostolic letter, concerns the church's
``profession of faith,'' a summation of essential Catholic beliefs
re-formulated in 1989.
	   Many Catholic theologians, particularly in the United States,
protested the profession and the requirement they publicly adhere
to it.
	   Prelates, parish priests, Catholic theology teachers and
religious superiors are among those required to declare it.
	   The latest decision is sure to cause more chafing by liberal
theologians.
	   ``It's not making any practical change, but when you start
saying things like this in formal documents, it will have a
chilling effect,'' said the Rev. James Provost, a professor of
canon law at Catholic University in Washington D.C.
	   ``It's clear they're after theologians on this,'' he said.
	   The profession of faith calls on all Catholics to accept the
religion's fundamental truths as ``divinely revealed.''
	   The new profession added a category: teachings on faith and
morals that must be ``definitively held.'' John Paul has often
applied the label to his moral and doctrinal stands.
	   In his document, the pope said there was no provision in church
law to cover the category. John Paul said he was acting to ``fill
this gap.''
	   ``Whoever refuses'' teachings that are ``to be definitively held
is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic church,'' the new law
reads.
	   Provost said violators are subject to a wide range of
punishments, from a warning to excommunication -- depending on the
gravity of the violation.
	   Other ``definitive truths'' include the legitimacy of papal
elections and canonization of saints and the ``invalidity'' of
Anglican ordinations, said Ratzinger, head of the Congregation of
the Doctrine of the Faith.
	   John Paul in the past has called to task Roman Catholic
theologians who deviated from Vatican teachings.
	   Most recently, the Vatican excommunicated a Sri Lankan priest,
Tissa Balasuriya, last year for allegedly challenging papal
authority and key teachings. The censure was repealed when he
signed the profession of faith.
	   Other punished theologians include the Rev. Hans Kung of
Switzerland and the Rev. Charles E. Curran, barred from teaching at
Catholic University in 1987.

U.N.'s Annan meets Nigerian leader, pro-democracy activists dismissal of hardline advisors, Ghana president expected at Wednesday's talks. Trims and edits to conform. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Anyaoku meeting Abubakar, several grafs on
By GILBERT DA COSTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Bidding to bring democracy to an
international pariah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held talks
Tuesday with Nigeria's new military ruler and was due to meet the
country's most prominent prisoner.
	   Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than an hour at the
military leader's state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   The U.N. secretary-general was expected to see Moshood Abiola,
the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been imprisoned since
1995, said human rights and government officials on condition of
anonymity.
	   It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur.
	   Amid the talks, the government announced the dismissal of four
key officials viewed as hardline militants.
	   Those fired included the country's top intelligence official,
national security advisor Ismalia Gwarzo, a former policeman. He
was replaced by retired Maj. Gen. Abdullah Mohamed.
	   The others dismissed were special advisors Laz Unaogu, Alhaji
Wada Nas and Wole Oylese. No reason was given for the dismissals
although some observers interpreted the move as a sign the military
regime was shedding itself of hardliners opposed to democratic
reforms.
	   Abubakar has raised expectations for democratic reform by
releasing more than 40 political prisoners and suggesting that
Abiola too may eventually be freed.
	   Annan declined to speak to reporters, although a member of his
delegation, Ahmad Fawzi, said he had ``frank discussions'' with
Abubakar.
	   The meeting was regarded by both Abubakar and Abdulsalam as the
first in a series that will continue after the U.N. team has left
Nigeria, Fawzi added.
	   Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku also met Abubakar
later Tuesday and would be given the chance to speak to Abiola
later, human rights activists and government officials said.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, and the Nigerian-born Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995.
	   Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was quickly succeeded
by Abubakar, a career soldier with little political experience.
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation grouping of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks following the execution.
	   Annan was sitting down with a wide range of pro-democracy and
opposition activists during his visit, which he said was meant to
ease Nigeria's transition to democracy and civilian rule while
improving strained international ties with the country.
	   Former Nigerian Vice President Alex Ekueme, who was strongly
opposed to Abacha's rule, was among the first to meet the U.N.
chief.
	   ``The secretary-general's main preoccupation is the acceleration
of a credible political transition program,'' Fawzi said.
	   On Wednesday, Annan was to attend a ``mini heads-of-state
summit'' organized by the Nigerian government, Fawzi said.
	   A government spokesman said Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings was
expected and others been invited. It was not clear what was on the
agenda.

U.N. human rights team for Congo calls for international tribunal gravesite; Rwandan government rejecting findings as biased. Amnesty also calling for justice. TRIMS. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with forensic evidence of attempt to clean up
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. human rights team for Congo, in a
report on its aborted inquiry into alleged massacres of refugees,
called Tuesday for an international tribunal to try Congolese and
others for ``serious violations of human rights.''
	   The report was the first from the team withdrawn from Congo in
April because of what the United Nations said was a ``total absence
of cooperation'' from President Laurent Kabila's government.
	   The team was sent to investigate massacres of Rwandan Hutu
refugees allegedly carried out by Kabila's forces during their
victorious sweep across the African nation. In May 1997, Kabila
took power of the country then known as Zaire, and renamed it
Congo.
	   In its report, the team said obstacles raised by Kabila's
government made it impossible to confirm or disprove most of the
allegations. But the team said it could confirm certain types of
human rights violations occurred.
	   In particular, the team said it was able to confirm that former
Rwandan army soldiers took part in some killings. It also verified
the capture and execution of hundreds of unarmed refugees after a
November 1996 attack on Mugunga camp in the eastern part of the
country. Many other refugees were later hunted down and executed,
the report said.
	   It said forensic evidence showed that bodies were removed from
mass graves at Mbandaka ``corroborating testimony that an effort
was made to `clean up' such sites prior to the arrival of the
investigative team.'' Hundreds of refugees were massacred there and
in the neighboring village of Wendji by Congolese troops ``under
effective Rwandan Army command'' in May 1997.
	   The Congolese government rejected the report as a ``dangerous
document'' that only ``exacerbates the ethnic hatred between Hutu
and Tutsi.''
	   The report said Congolese authorities showed no interest in
looking into who was responsible for ``the serious violations of
human rights and grave breaches of humanitarian law which occurred
in its territory.''
	   ``Consequently, the interests of justice can only be served by
endowing an international tribunal with competence over these
crimes,'' the report said.
	   The Congolese government rejected the report as a ``dangerous
document that, contrary to the ideals of international peace and
security propagated by the United Nations, exacerbates the ethnic
hatred between Hutu and Tutsi.''
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Congolese
ambassador, Andre Mwamba Kapanga, said the report was politically
motivated _ a ``collection of unfounded allegations.''
	   Rwanda's U.N. ambassador, Gideon Kayinamura, also rejected the
report as biased.
	   ``The government of Rwanda categorically denies and resents the
insinuation in the report that Rwandan government soldiers
committed any human rights violations,'' Kayinamura said in a
letter to Annan.
	   Kabila denies that his forces targeted refugees, but has
acknowledged that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by former President
Mobutu Sese Seko to fight the rebels, may have been killed.
Kabila's men drove Mobutu into exile, where he died.
	   The Hutu refugees fled Rwanda to escape punishment for the 1994
massacre of an estimated half-million Tutsis.

Poland plans 40,000 job cuts in restructuring of steel industry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government proposed a plan Tuesday to
cut 40,000 of the 93,000 jobs Poland's steel industry as part of
restructuring required for membership in the European Union.
	   The plan by the rightist, Solidarity-led government anticipates
no change in steel production capacity and aims at complete
privatization of the industry by 2001.
	   Most of the job cuts in the government-owned plants are to be
achieved through attrition. Layoffs and severance packages are
planned for about 10,000 workers, Industry Minister Janusz
Steinhoff said.
	   The government hopes to forge a consensus on the plan with union
representatives by December. Parliament also must approve the
restructuring.
	   Jan Zub from the federation of steel workers' unions said his
group would seek to make sure that other jobs are found for workers
who are laid off. ``This is what we will fight for,'' Zub said.
	   The European Union, which is negotiating conditions to accept
Poland into the bloc, had asked Poland to submit the plan by the
end of June. Steinhoff forwarded it Tuesday to Rolf Timans, the EU
representative in Warsaw.
	   Steinhoff has called the plan a ``test of Poland's
credibility,'' and says he hopes EU officials provide dlrs 33
million to support the industry restructuring.
	   The plan aims to make the steel industry, which accounts for 4.5
percent of industrial production in Poland, independent of
government subsidies and competitive with foreign producers. Raw
steel capacity would remain unchanged at 13.2 million tons a year.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One day after being blamed by Israel's
president for failing in Mideast peacemaking, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu responded Tuesday by accusing the president of
siding with the opposition.
	   President Ezer Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when
he went on national television and blamed Netanyahu for the
deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and said it
was time to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday accused Weizman of breaching the
presidential role by siding with Israel's political left, in
opposition since Netanyahu's narrow election two years ago.
	   ``The fact is that the president, to my sorrow, took a stand
with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV.
	   Netanyahu said he had hoped that when Weizman was re-elected to
a second term in March, he would ``behave like his predecessors,''
who kept to the largely ceremonial role of the office.
	   ``The president is attacking the prime minister on a personal
basis, it's not a healthy thing for Israel.'' Netanyahu said,
adding that Weizman's ``blunt involvement in internal politics''
crossed lines.
	   The president, elected by Israel's parliament, has no authority
to determine the date of the next elections. However, Weizman is
Israel's most popular politician, and with his stinging criticism
of Netanyahu, he lent greater credibility to opposition claims that
early elections are the only way to rescue the peace process.
	   Cabinet ministers and legislators close to Netanyahu launched a
counterattack, saying Weizman overstepped his authority and called
for his resignation.
	   Separate photographs of both leaders in combative stances with
their fists clenched were splashed across the front page of the
Yediot Ahronot daily. A poll of 507 Israelis in Yediot indicated 50
percent of Israelis favored early elections and 39 percent did not.
The margin of error was 4.5 percent.
	   In an interview with Yediot, Weizman questioned Netanyahu's
qualifications to be prime minister.
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality. The nation does not know where the prime minister is
leading them,'' Weizman said. ``He rules by trial and error. If
Netanyahu wants to know what the nation thinks, he should go to
polls.''
	   Weizman will continue his campaign for new elections as long as
there is no breakthrough in the negotiations with the Palestinians
over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, his aides told
Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu has dismissed early elections and said they would be
held as scheduled in 2000. He blamed the Palestinians, not his
government, for the stalemate in peace talks.
	   The United States is awaiting a long-overdue answer from Israel
on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Israel radio reported that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright telephoned Netanyahu from China on Tuesday and urged him
again to move forward with a promised Israeli troop withdrawal.

US aircraft carrier close by Kosovo violence 
</HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (AP) _ U.S. military
officials sent a clear message Tuesday to combatants in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo that heavy Western firepower was
nearby.
	   ``I can't make a conjecture on what the battalion will be asked
to do,'' said Rear Admiral Scott A. Fry, commander of the battle
group centered around this U.S aircraft carrier. ``But we are ready
for crisis deployment,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Journalists were invited aboard for an opportunity to observe
operations while fighting continued between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian fighters seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The carrier was cruising in a rectangular pattern halfway
between Italy and the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia in the
Adriatic Sea.
	   It has been launching about 100 flights per day over Bosnia in
support of NATO's Deliberate Forge mission monitoring the Bosnian
peace.
	   The Eisenhower is providing about two-thirds of the aircraft
participating in the multinational operation, including F-14 Tomcat
and F/A-18 Hornet warplanes and SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters.
	   ``It is a great chance to train among ourselves as well as with
our allies,'' said Capt. Gregory C. Brown, the carrier's commanding
officer. ``As technology changes we need to continously work side
by side with our allies,'' said Brown.
	   Brown said the crew was closely monitoring events in the Serb
province, but called the training ``routine.''
	   He said the nuclear-powered carrier would make its planned port
stop in Naples July 4th.

Failed diplomacy, trade threats confront Caribbean leaders 
</HEADLINE>
By GUY ELLIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Faltering attempts to solve Guyana's
smoldering political crisis and fears that free trade will
overwhelm their tiny economies confront Caribbean leaders at a
summit opening Tuesday.
	   The summit, which runs through Saturday, marks the 25th
anniversary of the 16-member Caribbean Community trade bloc,
encompassing more than 6 million people and a dlrs 30 billion
combined national product. But the celebration has been dampened by
recent riots in Caricom's hometown of Georgetown, Guyana.
	   In Guyana, Caricom leaders failed to broker a truce between
Janet Jagan, elected president Dec. 15, and Desmond Hoyte, a former
president who claims Jagan won through fraud. Both are attending
this week's summit.
	   Caricom agreed to audit the vote to stop post-election rioting
by Hoyte's followers. It also got both sides to agree to draft a
new constitution to replace a system of government that is
paralyzed by racial politics.
	   Voting in Guyana runs along racial lines, and Jagan's party,
backed by the country's majority Indo-Guyanese, shut Hoyte's party
_ supported by the black minority _ out of government.
	   Caricom auditors concluded the vote was fair. But Hoyte's
supporters resumed rioting last week, charging the government was
victimizing black civil servants and refusing to talk about
constitutional reforms.
	   ``There is great anger among the people of this country,'' Hoyte
said in an interview last week in which he vowed more protests.
	   Caricom faces perhaps greater challenges on the trade front.
With talks about to begin on a Free Trade Area of the Americas, its
members fear their economies, many of them dependent on tourism,
textiles and bananas, will be swamped by trading giants in North
and South America.
	   Many insist on favorable access for their products in Europe and
the United States _ and they point to possible political unrest, or
a surge in regional drug trafficking by the unemployed, if they
don't get it.
	   Last year, the Caribbean lost special access for bananas in
Europe after a U.S. challenge in the World Trade Organization. The
ruling could eliminate the local banana industry altogether.
	   Thousands of textile jobs have been lost, meanwhile, because
Mexico's exports enjoy fewer U.S. trade barriers under the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela will be a special guest
at the summit. South African-Caribbean trade reached dlrs 104
million in 1997.
	   Yet another challenge comes from Europe, where Caribbean leaders
fear a divide-and-conquer strategy in upcoming aid negotiations.
	   Caricom members want to bargain alongside their colleagues from
developing African and Pacific nations when the Lome Convention aid
pact comes up for renewal by 2000. The pact guarantees dlrs 15
billion in annual trade and aid benefits for 71 African, Caribbean
and Pacific countries.
	   The EU claims the pact is incompatible with new World Trade
Organization guidelines. It proposes to renegotiate aid terms
separately with African, Caribbean and Pacific nations.
	   Caribbean leaders also will discuss closer ties with communist
Cuba. Despite pressure from Washington, which maintains a trade
embargo of the Caribbean nation, Caricom plans to establish a trade
office in Havana.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said recently it was
``high time to cross the ideological divide and fully embrace Cuba
as part of the hemisphere family.''
	   Trade between Caricom and Cuba reached dlrs 35 million last
year.

Turkey allows IMF to scrutinize its economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Relying on the recent positive results of
his economic policies, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared on
Tuesday that Turkey has accepted scrutiny by the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Yilmaz said Turkey relayed its consent to the financial body on
June 26 for quarterly IMF surveys for the next 18 months.
	   Yilmaz said he expected inflation to be cut in half and register
50 percent annually at the end of 1998. It has reached around 30
percent since the beginning of the year.
	   As part of the government's program to reduce inflation, a tax
reform is being debated in Parliament and privatization of state
enterprises has been speeded up.
	   On Monday, two private companies made a joint bid worth dlrs 1.1
billion for a 51 percent stake in the state-run petroleum
distributor, Petrol Ofisi A.S., which operates 5,677 gas stations
around the country.
	   ``The agreement does not include any IMF loans to Turkey but it
is expected to help Turkey in finding favorable credits abroad,''
Yilmaz said. ``It is a message of support to international
markets.''
	   Turkey is seeking about 2 billion dollars of credit in the world
markets.
	   The government's target is to pull down inflation to 20 percent
at the end of next year.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A painting by Claude Monet sold for a record 19.8
million pounds (dlrs 32.9 million) Tuesday, Sotheby's auction house
said.
	   The buyer, who bid by telephone, was not immediately identified.
The seller was not identified.
	   The painting, ``Waterlily Pond and Path by Water,'' was one of a
series painted by Monet at his garden in Giverny, France.
	   The previous auction record for a Monet was 13 million pounds
(dlrs 21.6 million), Sotheby's said. That was also the record for a
painting auctioned in England.
	   The highest price ever paid for a painting was dlrs 75 million
for Vincent Van Gogh's ``Portrait du Dr. Gachet,'' sold by
Christie's in New York in 1990, according to the Guinness Book of
Records.

party leader on Tuesday said corruption and theft were the greatest
dangers to the country.
	   ``Terms such as republic or secularism should not be used to
camouflage corruption,'' Recai Kutan told Virtue Party deputies in
a meeting at Parliament, in reference to widespread allegations
that officials profit from their positions to accumulate personal
wealth.
	   Turkey's outspoken deputy chief of general staff, Gen. Cevik
Bir, on Monday evening declared that radical Islam was still the
country's No. 1 threat.
	   Bir was also quoted as saying in the daily Hurriyet Tuesday that
Virtue was the leader in public opinion polls conducted by the
army.
	   Kutan said there was speculation that even if his party won the
next elections it would not be allowed to come to power.
	   Kutan had been maintaining a low profile since his predecessor,
former Premier Necmettin Erbakan, was banned from active politics
in January by the supreme court. The court also shut down Erbakan's
pro-Islamic Welfare Party.
	   A trial accusing Erbakan of insulting the supreme court's
verdict opened in Ankara Monday. If convicted, he faces up to 1 1/2
years prison.

Pakistan unfreezing foreign currency accounts, Nawaz Sharif says exchange freeze.

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan,
touring the Gulf to explain the nuclear tests his country conducted
last month, said Tuesday that his government has lifted its freeze
on foreign currency accounts.
	   Pakistan froze the accounts as part of an austere, protectionist
move after it detonated six nuclear devices in response to similar
nuclear tests by neighboring India.
	   Facing international sanctions imposed by the United States and
other countries, Pakistan feared its foreign exchange reserves
would be depleted by panicky investors, both large and small.
	   Sharif announced the lifting of the freeze on foreign currency
accounts before leaving Kuwait on Monday.
	   Speaking to some of the 80,000 Pakistanis working in Kuwait _
who send large shares of their earnings home to Pakistan, Sharif
declared:
	   ``From now on, at the demand of the Pakistani community in
Kuwait, I hereby declare that the foreign currency frozen accounts
are unfrozen.''
	   But the Pakistani prime minister added: ``I request you not to
withdraw the money from these accounts for the time being.''
	   It was not clear how much weight this ``request'' would carry.
	   By the time news of the Urdu-language speech was reported,
Sharif was in Qatar, where members of his delegation could not be
contacted immediately for comment.
	   Last week, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves stood at less
than dlrs 1 billion _ barely enough to cover the bills for six
weeks of imports.
	   While he was in Kuwait, Sharif met the ruler, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and other officials.
	   Upon arriving in Qatar, the Pakistani prime minister was greeted
at the airport by Qatari Crown Prince Sheik Jassem bin Hamad Al
Thani.
	   Sharif will meet Qatar's ruler, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al
Thani, on Wednesday, according to a Pakistani diplomat, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear if Sharif would request any aid to offset the
sanctions.
	   Earlier this month, Sharif visited Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates. He reportedly sought Saudi help in lifting
sanctions.

World Cup: Jubilant Croatians join world soccer's top eight 
</HEADLINE>

By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ The fans wearing the unmistakable
red-and-white checks were euphoric. The coach ran out of words to
express his joy. The young nation of Croatia had achieved its
greatest soccer success.
	   Croatia became the first nation in 28 years to make the final
eight in its World Cup debut Tuesday, defeating Romania 1-0 on
Davor Suker's nerve-rattling penalty kick in first-half injury
time.
	   ``We have eliminated a team with a great tradition,'' Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Our players achieved a big goal.
	   ``We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   The victory for Croatia, the first newcomer to reach the
quarterfinals since East Germany in 1974, sets up an emotional
clash with Germany on Saturday in Lyon.
	   Germany was also one of the first countries to recognize
Croatia's independence in 1991. The two countries have already met
once in the quarterfinals of a major tournament, when the Germans
won 2-1 en route to capturing the 1996 European Championship.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia. There is no
greater pleasure in sport than beating a friend.''
	   The winning goal wasn't without dispute. Argentine referee
Javier Castrilli called the crucial foul on midfielder Gabriel
Popescu, whose legs became entangled with those of Aljosa Asanovic
as they chased Dario Simic's pass in the penalty area. Popescu
protested with arms raised high, but to no avail.
	   ``The penalty was imaginary,'' Romanian defender Dan Petrescu
said. ``Or if the referee wanted to give a penalty on that play, we
should have gotten at least one, if not two.''
	   Then Suker had to take the kick twice. His first attempt was
good, but Castrilli ordered a repeat because Croatian players had
run into the penalty arc before the shot.
	   Suker stepped up again and whipped a left-footed drive into the
same spot _ the lower right corner of the net. Romanian goalkeeper
Bogdan Stelea guessed the right way, but the shot was too
well-placed to save.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' said Suker, who
has three goals in the tournament. ``My heart was beating.''
	   Suker's cold-blooded finishing contrasted with that of his Real
Madrid teammate Predrag Mijatovic, whose missed penalty kick
weighed heavily Monday in Yugoslavia's 2-1 loss to Germany in the
second round.
	   Romania, a quarterfinalist at the 1994 World Cup, was a shadow
of its past despite winning its qualifying group ahead of England.
Playmaker Gheorghe Hagi's most spectacular move was a wasted free
kick in the 41st minute, and he was substituted after halftime.
	   ``Croatia deserved to win,'' said Anghel Iordanescu, whose
five-year stint as Romanian coach came to an end with the loss. He
has signed a two-year deal to coach Greece's national team.
	   ``They played with more cohesion throughout and had more scoring
chances,'' Iordanescu said. ``Romania's quality of play was quite
low.''
	   Croatia used a disciplined counterattack strategy to dominate an
often mediocre game. Romania never seriously cracked the opposing
defense, leaving the Croats to unfold a one-touch passing game that
occasionally sparkled.
	   The Croatians kept Stelea busy from the opening whistle. The
keeper denied Suker from close range, leaped to push away Goran
Vlaovic's long drive and made a reflex save on Asanovic's shot _
all in the first 15 minutes.
	   Adrian Ilie had one of Romania's best chances when Popescu
lifted a cross toward the far post. Croatian keeper Drazen Ladic
rushed out to block Ilie's angle, forcing a weak shot.
	   Although Romania replaced two midfielders with strikers in the
second half, Croatia continued to create the better scoring
chances. Romanian defender Liviu Ciobotariu nearly had to tackle
Zvonimir Boban to keep him from converting Suker's cross in the
55th minute, and Stelea had to stop two point-blank shots from
substitute Petar Krpan in second-half injury time.

Netanyahu strikes back at president in high office mudslinging

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One day after being blamed by Israel's
president for failing in Mideast peacemaking, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu struck back Tuesday, accusing the president of
siding with the Arabs and Israel's opposition.
	   President Ezer Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when
he went on national television and blamed Netanyahu for the
deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and said it
was time to call early elections.
	   Tuesday, Netanyahu did the same, accusing Weizman of breaching
the presidential role by siding with Arab countries and Israel's
political left, in opposition since Netanyahu's narrow election two
years ago.
	   ``The fact is that the President, to my sorrow, took a stand
with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV.
	   Netanyahu said Weizman was also siding with Egypt and the
Palestinians, who have said Netanyahu's policies are hurting
chances for peace.
	   ``The President has strengthened and hardened the Arab
position,'' Netanyahu said in another interview with Israel's
Channel 2 TV.
	   Netanyahu said he had hoped that when Weizman was re-elected to
a second term in March, he would ``behave like his predecessors,''
who kept to the largely ceremonial role of the office.
	   ``The president is attacking the prime minister on a personal
basis, it's not a healthy thing for Israel.'' Netanyahu said,
adding that Weizman's ``blunt involvement in internal politics,''
crossed red lines.

Serbs retake coal mine after fierce offensive on Kosovo rebels elsewhere, Pristina shooting; trims 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with eight Albanian militants reported killed

By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo's capital on Tuesday after
a withering offensive that sent thousands of villagers streaming.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on the area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had
captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes in the conflict this year. Another said
both sides were guilty of excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement to halt the steadily worsening conflict.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
in fighting this year between Serb security forces and the KLA.
	   Violence was also reported elsewhere in the explosive province
on Tuesday.
	   Eight Albanian militants were killed after they attacked a
Yugoslav army border patrol near the southwestern town of
Djakovica, close to the Albanian border, the pro-government Serbian
Media Center said.
	   In a shooting in downtown Pristina, Serb police guards wounded
an ethnic Albanian trying to escape from a court hearing where he
was facing charges of conspiring to commit ``acts hostile to the
(Serbian) state.'' Albanian sources claimed a passerby also was
wounded in the shooting.
	   For much of the day Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of
a ridge overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared.
	   Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers, cannons and
mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _ all fired on
the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment of the area, Serb forces ceased
their fire about 6 a.m., then resumed it a few hours later after
changing their positions. At least four other villages also were
shelled Tuesday.
	   They finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the
late afternoon after KLA forces fled.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said earlier Tuesday
that three Albanians were killed Monday in fighting around
Belacevac. There was no immediate word on casualties from Tuesday's
clashes.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses hit by small-arms
fire and artillery. Police seized several KLA uniforms as well as
rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked 19-year-old Saban
Gadeni, a 19-year-old economics student at the University of
Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, indicated
in Oslo, Norway, that diplomatic efforts remains snagged, with the
Americans still trying to mediate.
	   In New York, the Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes or violation of human rights.
	   In a statement faxed to Associated Press offices in the Balkans,
the private watchdog group said it had ``powerful evidence'' that
Serb police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International also said the vast
majority of the victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90
percent of the population in Kosovo. But it said Serbs also are
suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' the international human rights organization said.
	   The wife and mother of two Serbs kidnapped Monday by the KLA
appealed to the militants Tuesday to release them.
	   ``My 18-year-old son Ivan's childhood was ruined by the war in
Croatia where we lived, now his youth is ruined in Kosovo,'' said
Vesna Bakrac. The men reportedly were taken off a bus by armed
Albanians on Monday along with two other Serbs.

Dangerous Ivanisevic shakes slump at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Davide in 12th graf is CQ
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Never mind the scruffy beard framing
the scowl on his face. It's the grass underfoot and the racket in
his hand that make Goran Ivanisevic look dangerous.
	   The mercurial Croat is again on a roll at his favorite
tournament, beating American Todd Martin 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6
(7-2) Tuesday to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   Pairing his swift serve with the sport's fastest surface,
Ivanisevic is back on track after a long slump. A runnerup at
Wimbledon in 1992 and 1994, he's in the hunt once more for his
first Grand Slam title at age 26.
	   ``It would be nice if I can win it,'' Ivanisevic said. ``This
year is a good chance for me. I'm playing maybe the best tennis
ever I play here, and so now it's three more matches to go.''
	   Ivanisevic is always quick to complain about bad breaks, but at
Wimbledon the luck of the draw has gone his way. He'll be favored
Wednesday against Jan Siemerink, and the only seeded player in his
path to the final is No. 9 Richard Krajicek, who is slowed by a
knee injury.
	   Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, poses perhaps the biggest threat to
four-time champion Pete Sampras. They could meet for the title
Sunday.
	   ``It seems like Goran has been playing well,'' Sampras said.
``He's very much a threat. Grass is his best surface, and he's got
one of the biggest serves ever.''
	   The top-seeded Sampras must deal with other problems first. His
opponent Wednesday will be another heavy hitter, Mark
Philippoussis.
	   Sampras became the lone American to reach the men's
quarterfinals when he beat qualifier Sebastien Grosjean of France
6-3, 6-4, 6-4. Philippoussis rallied past fellow Australian Jason
Stoltenberg 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, and Siemerink overtook Magnus
Larsson 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 champion, beat Wayne Ferreira 6-3, 6-3, 7-5,
then complained about his right knee, which required surgery in
December.
	   ``I overstretched it, and I just felt a sharp pain in my knee,
basically on my scar from my operation,'' he said. ``If it stiffens
up and gets worse, I don't know what's going to happen the next
match.''
	   Krajicek's opponent Wednesday will be Davide Sanguinetti, the
first Italian man to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals since
Adriano Panatta in 1979. He advanced by beating the last Spaniard
in the field, Francisco Clavet, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, 6-4.
	   The other match Wednesday will pit Australian Open champion Petr
Korda against Tim Henman, who is trying to become the first
Englishman to win Wimbledon in 62 years.
	   Ivanisevic hopes to become the first Croatian champion. With
career earnings of more than $16 million, he has long been regarded
as the most talented active player without a Grand Slam title.
	   Lately he has gone in reverse, slipping to 25th in the rankings
after being fourth in early 1997. He arrived at Wimbledon with just
one match victory in his past five Grand Slams.
	   ``It has been very bad,'' he said. ``Maybe this is the
breakthrough. After five poor ones, there has to come one good
one.''
	   Ivanisevic tends to be more entertaining in conversation than on
the court. The big left-hander's style of play can be mind-numbing,
with plenty of aces, double faults and short points. But in
interviews, where he reveals a quick wit in slightly fractured
English, Goran is never boring.
	   ``My matches are like horror thrillers,'' he said after a
third-round win. ``It's like a movie. I made the movie, but I don't
know the end.''
	   Ivanisevic attributed his recent resurgence to a change in
attitude. He has long been regarded as a hothead who easily comes
unhinged, but he decided the problem lately has been playing with
too little passion.
	   ``I did a mistake,'' he said. ``I tried to play cool, you know,
which I am not cool. It's best to break the racket. It's better to
explode straightaway and be OK.''
	   Temper tantrums have been unnecessary during the Wimbledon
fortnight. After belting 44 aces in the third round, Ivanisevic
struggled with his serve Tuesday. But he compensated at the net,
consistently putting away winners and even hitting a volley between
his legs.
	   Ivanisevic said he's playing better than when he reached the
Wimbledon finals.
	   ``I'm volleying much better,'' he said. ``Sometimes I rely too
much on my serve, but now I don't panic when the volley comes.''
	   The crowd on Court 13 was solidly behind Ivanisevic, with shouts
of ``C'mon, Goran!'' preceding almost every point. Fans at the All
England Club regard him with the same affection as they do Jana
Novotna, another two-time runnerup.
	   There was a final cheer when Ivanisevic won an exchange at the
net on match point. Martin cocked his racket as if to smack
Ivanisevic with it, then hugged him instead. They walked off the
court arm in arm, and for the moment, the scowl was gone.

Bodyguard wants Ritz management questioned in Diana probe 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A lawyer for bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, sole
survivor of the crash that killed Princess Diana, is asking the
judge heading the case to question Ritz Hotel management about
possible security lapses and about driver Henri Paul.
	   Lawyer Christian Curtil told The Associated Press he has sent a
letter to the judge making the request.
	   Though Curtil would only say that certain issues need
clarifying, his request appeared to stem from a belief that the
photographers trailing Diana the night of the crash may soon be
exonerated.
	   ``The investigation is nearly over concerning the photographers
and there are some issues to be clarified,'' Curtil said in an
interview. ``That is, concerning the directors of the Ritz, what
they knew and what they did not know.''
	   ``There are issues concerning security problems, issues
concerning possible pressures, issues concerning drunkenness of the
driver. Was he obviously drunk to the knowledge of the Ritz, or was
he not?''
	   Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Paul, a Ritz
employee, were killed in the Aug. 31 crash in a Paris traffic
tunnel. They had just left the hotel, which is owned by Dodi's
father, Mohamed Al Fayed.
	   Paul was heavily drunk at the time, and believed to have been
driving at a very high speed.
	   Nine photographers and a press motorcyclist are still under
official investigation _ a step short of being charged _ in the
case, but many expect they will soon be exonerated.
	   Curtil said he also wants Ritz management questioned on alleged
``witness bribing'' among the staff.
	   ``Apparently some employees of the Ritz have been pressured _
and we have to find out whether this is true or not,'' Curtil said.
``We are looking for the truth and what exactly happened.''
	   A Ritz barman has told police he was told not to reveal that
Paul had been drinking heavily, ``for the good of the royal
family.''
	   Curtil said he also wants to know, ``Was everything done to
guarantee the security of the passengers?''
	   Although investigating judge Herve Stephan has seen the police
file of interviews with Ritz management, judicial sources say he
hasn't spoken to Ritz management directly.
	   Curtil didn't say what Ritz managers he had mentioned in his
letter to Stephan, but the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they were Ritz president Franck Klein and his
assistant, Claude Roulet.
	   Curtil said Rees-Jones, who no longer works for Al Fayed, has
requested a hearing in July with Judge Stephan to comment on
testimony by fellow bodyguard Kes Wingfield, who is due to meet
with co-investigating judge Marie-Christine Devidal on Friday, at
his own request.
	   Wingfield, who worked for Al Fayed, resigned in June, and has

Reformist Serb leader to run again in September elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Reformist Biljana Plavsic
will run for re-election to the presidency of the Bosnian Serb half
of the country in general elections this September, a legislator
said Tuesday.
	   Krstan Simic confirmed that Plavsic is to be the candidate of
the Independent Social Democrats, her coalition partner.
	   ``Banja Luka has become an embryo of democracy, not only for the
Serb Republic but for all of Bosnia,'' Simic said at a news
conference in the city, the Bosnian Serbs' administrative center.
	   The three reformist Bosnian Serb parties _ Plavsic's Serb
National Alliance, the Socialist Party and the Independent Social
Democrats _ united forces earlier in the month by forming a
coalition entitled ``Harmony.''
	   The three parties, with Western support, already dominate the
government of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia. Their alliance
intends to secure them the three top positions: the republic's
presidency and two posts reserved for Serbs in Bosnia's joint
presidency and government.
	   Simic also said Tuesday that Zivko Radisic from the Socialists
would be the coalition's candidate for the Serb post in Bosnia's
tripartite presidency.
	   Harmony will be running against a coalition formed by Bosnian
Serb hardliners, loyalists to former war-time leader and Bosnia's
top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   If successful, Plavsic's alliance could unseat two key Bosnian
Serb hardliners: Momcilo Krajisnik, currently the Serb member of
the three-man Bosnian presidency, and Boro Bosic, who is a
co-chairman in Bosnia's joint government.

39 nations to search for loot taken from Holocaust victims Trieste part of Italy before WWI. TRIMS. AP Diplomatic Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: EDITS throughout to CLARIFY Generali's insurance of Jews,
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and 38 other nations
announced a drive Tuesday to identify art stolen from Holocaust
victims and to compensate their heirs.
	   The session at the Holocaust Museum marked a new chapter in
uncovering the misdeeds of the Germans and their collaborators in
World War II a half-century after 6 million Jews and other victims
of the Nazis perished.
	   The search also will deal with unpaid life and property
insurance claims.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who has spearheaded
inquiries into the theft of gold, told representatives of nations
participating in the drive that there is a risk of reviving latent
anti-Semitism.
	   But, he said, ``this can be a healing process, which can
strengthen each of our countries and bring this century to a close
on a high note of justice.''
	   In a related development, five survivors of Nazi concentration
camps sued the Swiss central bank in a U.S. District Court here
Monday to try to recover plundered gold accepted by Switzerland
during World War II.
	   The class action seeks compensatory and punitive damages from
the Swiss National Bank, which, like the better-known private Swiss
banks, accepted Nazi deposits.
	   In early June, the Association of Art Museum Directors
recommended that U.S. art museums check their collections to
determine if any works were stolen during the war and to set up a
worldwide database for tracking.
	   ``By adopting the report, America's museums place themselves on
record as committed to acting swiftly and proactively,'' Philippe
de Montebello, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art,
said after the meeting in Worcester, Massachusetts.
	   The Museum of Modern Art in New York recently stopped
prosecutors from seizing two Egon Schiele paintings on loan from
the Leopold Foundation of Vienna. Two families claim the works were
plundered during the Nazi era from relatives.
	   In May, the Dutch government widened its own investigation into
the ownership of thousands of artworks recovered from Nazis but
never claimed. The 4,000 items ranged from paintings to ceramic
objects and included works by Dutch masters Rembrandt and van Gogh.
	   Eizenstat acknowledged Tuesday that ``the debate over
Nazi-confiscated art often intrudes on questions of sovereignty and
the sacred ground of national heritage.''
	   But, he said, ``we also have a great responsibility to Holocaust
survivors, and their heirs and survivors to shed light on these
issues.''
	   Germany and its collaborators across Europe not only sought to
exterminate all European Jews but stole their assets, even to the
point of extracting gold from the teeth of victims.
	   The Germans also looted insurance policies, collecting from
companies on deaths and property losses. The amount potentially at
stake is incalculable.
	   The German insurance company Allianz is in the midst of a
research program under the direction of Gerald Feldman, a professor
of modern German history at the University of California at
Berkeley.
	   Research also is under way at the Generali insurance company in
Trieste, Italy. The city was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire
before World War I, and insured many Jews throughout easterna nd
central Europe.
	   A conference will be held in Washington in November to assess
progress on the art and insurance fronts.
	   In another action Tuesday, Austria, Greece, Italy, The
Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Poland decided to
turn most or all of their shares of 6 million tons of gold seized
by Germany from their central banks during the war to funds for
needy Holocaust victims.
	   The gold, now worth about dlrs 41 million, has been held by a
three-nation commission formed by the United States, Britain and
France.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Bidding to bring democracy to an
international pariah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held talks
Tuesday with Nigeria's new military ruler and was due to meet the
country's most prominent prisoner.
	   Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than an hour at the
military leader's state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   The U.N. secretary-general was expected to see Moshood Abiola,
the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been imprisoned since
1995, said human rights and government officials on condition of
anonymity.
	   It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur.
	   Amid the talks, the government announced the dismissal of four
key officials viewed as hardline militants.
	   Those fired included the country's top intelligence official,
national security adviser Ismalia Gwarzo, a former policeman. He
was replaced by retired Maj. Gen. Abdullah Mohamed.
	   The others dismissed were special advisers Laz Unaogu, Alhaji
Wada Nas and Wole Oylese. No reason was given for the dismissals
although some observers interpreted the move as a sign the military
regime was shedding itself of hardliners opposed to democratic
reforms.
	   Abubakar has raised expectations for democratic reform by
releasing more than 40 political prisoners and suggesting that
Abiola too may eventually be freed.
	   Annan declined to speak to reporters, although a member of his
delegation, Ahmad Fawzi, said he had ``frank discussions'' with
Abubakar.
	   The meeting was regarded by both Abubakar and Annan as the first
in a series that will continue after the U.N. team has left
Nigeria, Fawzi added.

Alternatives to DDT sought in global war against malaria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Environmentalists are urging use of alternative
tactics in the war on malaria so a global ban can be imposed on
DDT, the dangerous pesticide still widely used against
disease-bearing insects in the tropics.
	   In a report released Tuesday in Montreal, the World Wildlife
Fund said DDT is still used in dozens of countries even though most
industrialized nations banned it decades ago.
	   Many tropical nations use DDT against mosquitoes which spread
malaria, the second-leading cause of death of in the developing
world.
	   The World Wildlife Fund released its study during a weeklong
U.N.-sponsored negotiating session, where delegates from 100
nations are working on a global treaty to ban or curtail the use of
12 toxic, long-lasting chemicals, including DDT.
	   ``The task ahead is to eliminate both an ultra-nasty disease
like malaria and an ultra-nasty chemical like DDT in a way that
protects both human health and the environment,'' said Julia
Langer, a World Wildlife Fund toxicology expert.
	   The fund's report studied alternative techniques used in
disease-control programs in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Effective programs included eliminating mosquito breeding grounds,
using lower-risk pesticides, and introducing predators who eat
mosquitoes.
	   The World Wildlife Fund said about 39,000 U.S. tons (35,000
metric tons) of DDT are produced each year. It urged a global
phaseout of the pesticide by 2007.

Eds: UPDATES death toll to seven, police confirming boat found
<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ Coast guard officials pulled seven bodies
out of the sea Tuesday near the north African Spanish enclave of
Ceuta, authorities said.
	   The seven men were probably would-be immigrants who drowned
while making the dangerous crossing from neighboring Morocco to
mainland Spain, Interior Ministry spokesman Ricardo Franca said.
	   Authorities later located the remains of a makeshift boat near
Ceuta's beach, said police, who added that they were still
searching for more bodies. It was unknown how many people were on
the boat and what caused it to sink.
	   Every year, thousands of people fleeing poverty and unemployment
in north Africa make the overnight sea journey to southern Spain in
makeshift boats. The Strait of Gibraltar separating Morocco from
Spain is as narrow as 12 miles (20 kilometers) in some places.
	   Coast guard officials from the southern province of Cadiz, the
destination of most of the immigrants, arrested 691 would-be
immigrants from January to June 28 this year as their boats
approached the shore or soon after they reached land.
	   Authorities are expecting an increase in the number of crossings
with improved summer weather. More 100 people were intercepted last
weekend alone.

Reformist Serb leader to run again in September elections candidate

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Reformist Biljana Plavsic
will run for re-election to the presidency of the Bosnian Serb half
of the country in general elections this September, a legislator
said Tuesday.

sub-state in Bosnia's first post-war elections in September 1996.
	   She gained international support last summer following her open
confrontation with hardliners, when she voiced her intentions to
stick to the Dayton peace accord for Bosnia.

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Who cares if a healthy
21-year-old is a smidgen over his normal weight? When it's Ronaldo,
just about everybody.
	   Ronaldo's 1.83-meter (6-foot-0) frame was the target of scrutiny
after Brazilian team physician Dr. Lidio Toledo said he thought the
star striker looked ``a little fat'' and promised to investigate.
	   Photos of Ronaldo in a swimsuit at the team's barbecue lunch
appeared on the Internet on Tuesday, and readers were asked to vote
whether he appeared pudgy.
	   The Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo quoted Toledo as
saying that Ronaldo was ``a half-kilo (1.1 pounds) over his normal
weight,'' adding that the player had begun treatment to lose the
excess.
	   The story seemed to gained momentum when Ronaldo didn't train
with the team Tuesday, and took laps around the practice field
instead.
	   But Ronaldo denied he was overweight, noting that team physio
Paulo Paixao closely watched the athletes' physical condition. And
after practice, coach Mario Zagallo said Ronaldo had been spared
from regular training because he had a sore knee.

Pakistan says six people killed on disputed border 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUZZAFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Flames leapt through several
Pakistani villages on the troubled Kashmir border Tuesday as Indian
shells pounded the area, killing six people, all civilians, said
police officials.
	   The hardest hit area was in the Neelum Valley, some 100
kilometers (60 miles) from Muzzafarabad, the capital of
Pakistan-held Kashmir.
	   Eyewitnesses and police officials said at least 20 shops and 25
homes were destroyed by fire after being hit by shells. There were
some reports of as many as 300 shells landing in the area.
	   Divided between India and Pakistan, Kashmir has been the flash
point of two previous wars between the uneasy neighbors, who both
lay claim to a united Kashmir.
	   India rules two-thirds of the Himalayan state and Pakistan the
remaining one-third.
	   Recently, both Pakistan and India have reported heavy
cross-border firing along the contested border. In the past one
week, Pakistani officials say more than 30 people have been killed
by Indian shells, artillery and gun fire.
	   Kashmir grabbed the world's attention in May when both India and
Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests and threatened to
induct nuclear weapons into their considerable arsenals.
	   Pakistan is seeking international mediation to settle the
51-year-old Kashmir dispute. India has flatly rejected outside
interference, saying the issue is a bilateral one that can be
solved if Pakistan gives up its one-third of the territory.
	   Pakistan is calling for a plebiscite among all Kashmiris on both
sides of the disputed border to decide whether to join Pakistan or
India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence on its territory
where a Muslim-led secessionist uprising has been raging since
1989.

Sharansky meets U.S. diplomat he had contact with as dissident

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Natan Sharansky met an old
acquaintance Tuesday _ an American diplomat he contacted in Moscow
when he was a dissident accused of anti-Soviet activities 22 years
ago.
	   Today, Sharansky is Israel's trade minister and diplomat Josef
Presel is the American ambassador to Uzbekistan.
	   ``Finally, after 22 years, I met my friend again,'' Sharansky
said in Tashkent, where he is seeking new trade and investment
opportunities. ``I did not expect this to happen.''
	   Sharansky spent nine years in Soviet prisons before being
allowed to move to Israel in 1986.
	   Sharansky is scheduled to meet Uzbek President Islam Karimov on
Wednesday. He said they will discuss the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
Karimov is scheduled to visit Israel in September.
	   Sharansky also thanked Uzbekistan for sheltering 200,000 Jews
who were evacuated from war-torn parts of the Soviet Union during
World War II.
	   ``We'll never forget the role of the Uzbek people in saving Jews
from the territories that were occupied,'' he said.

	   ``France deplores the incident,'' she said, calling it
``potentially dangerous.''
	   She spoke hours after a U.S. F-16 attack jet fired on an Iraqi
surface-to-air missile site after its radar locked on British
patrol planes.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen called the split-second
response an act of self-defense, and Iraq denied any aggressive
act.
	   Gazeau-Secret noted it still wasn't clear whether the Iraqi
missile site had been hit. British officials believe it was
destroyed.
	   ``We call on Iraq to show the utmost restraint after this
regrettable incident,'' Gazeau-Secret said.
	   The incident occurred while coalition aircraft were conducting
Operation Southern Watch, the name given to the deny-flight mission
established by allies who fought in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   France is part of the mission, though it did not join in the
decision to expand the zone north from the 32nd to the 33rd
parallel.

U.N. human rights team for Congo calls for international tribunal commends Congolese suggestion that OAU take it over. TRIMS. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with team member saying investigation should continue,
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. human rights team for Congo, in a
report on its aborted investigation into alleged massacres of
Rwandan Hutu refugees, called Tuesday for an international tribunal
to try cases of ``serious violations of human rights.''
	   The report, which detailed evidence of current and former
Rwandan Army involvement in the massacres and Congolese government
attempts to cover them up, was the first from the team withdrawn in
April from Congo.
	   The United Nations pulled the team back because of what it said
was a ``total absence of cooperation'' from the government of
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The team was sent to investigate massacres of Rwandan Hutu
refugees allegedly carried out by Kabila's forces during their
victorious sweep across the African nation. In May 1997, Kabila
took power of the country then known as Zaire, and renamed it
Congo.
	   In its report, the team said obstacles raised by Kabila's
government made it impossible to confirm or disprove most of the
allegations. But the team said it could confirm certain types of
human rights violations occurred.
	   In particular, the team said it was able to confirm that current
and former Rwandan army soldiers took part in some killings. It
also verified the capture and execution of hundreds of unarmed
civilians after a November 1996 attack on Mugunga camp in the
eastern part of the country. Many others were later hunted down and
executed, the report said.
	   It said forensic evidence showed that bodies were removed from
mass graves at Mbandaka ``corroborating testimony that an effort
was made to `clean up' such sites prior to the arrival of the
investigative team.'' Hundreds of civilians were massacred there
and in the neighboring village of Wendji by Congolese troops
``under effective Rwandan Army command'' in May 1997.
	   The Congolese government rejected the report as a ``dangerous
document'' that only ``exacerbates the ethnic hatred between Hutu
and Tutsi.''
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Congolese
ambassador, Andre Mwamba Kapanga, said the report was politically
motivated _ a ``collection of unfounded allegations.''
	   Rwanda's U.N. ambassador, Gideon Kayinamura, also rejected the
report and ``categorically denies and resents the insinuation in
the report that Rwandan government soldiers committed any human
rights violations.''
	   The report said Congolese authorities showed no interest in
looking into who was responsible for ``the serious violations of
human rights and grave breaches of humanitarian law which occurred
in its territory.''
	   ``Consequently, the interests of justice can only be served by
endowing an international tribunal with competence over these
crimes,'' the report said.
	   Team member Daniel Michael O'Donnell welcomed a suggestion by
Congo to have some other entity, such as the Organization for
African Unity, continue the inquiry.
	   Kabila denies that his forces targeted refugees, but has
acknowledged that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by former President
Mobutu Sese Seko to fight the rebels, may have been killed.
Kabila's men drove Mobutu into exile, where he died.
	   The Hutu refugees fled Rwanda to escape punishment for the 1994
massacre of an estimated half-million Tutsis.
	   Reed Brody, a former team member and now advocacy director of
Human Rights Watch, said in an interview that the report was
damning because it confirmed long-held suspicions about the extent
of the massacres and the involvement of foreign troops.
	   ``The question now is whether the international community has
the political will to take the next step which is to identify the
killers and bring them to justice,'' said Brody.
	   Amnesty International also called on the Security Council to
take immediate action to make sure justice is served.

Mastering grass, Venus Williams faces Novotna in big test AP Tennis Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Like a schoolgirl cramming for a final
_ a Wimbledon final, she hopes _ Venus Williams cribs notes to
herself that she sneaks peeks at during matches.
	   They are daily affirmations and reminders that she pulls out of
her bag on changeovers. Bend your knees. Get down low to the grass.
Prepare for the ball.
	   ``I think it makes me play better,'' said Williams, who also
jots down lines from songs to help her relax.
	   It must be working because her learning curve on grass is
soaring sharply in only her second trip to Wimbledon, landing her
Tuesday in the quarterfinals for her biggest test yet against
two-time finalist Jana Novotna.
	   Joining them in Wednesday's quarters are defending champion
Martina Hingis versus French champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario; No.
2 Lindsay Davenport against No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat; and No. 6
Monica Seles against Natasha Zvereva.
	   Williams showed her budding grasscourt mastery in a 6-3, 6-1
rout of Virginia Ruano-Pascual, the Spanish woman who beat her
little sister, Serena.
	   ``I wanted to win every point, all the points that Serena
couldn't win yesterday,'' the 18-year old Williams said. ``I didn't
like it that she came back to 4-3. I thought that was really
negligent on my part. So I had to get serious and make sure that
she didn't get too many more games.''
	   Williams sliced and slugged with equal control, punched solid
volleys and flicked deft drop shots and lobs. She did everything a
player should do on grass as she revealed an all-court game that
could make her a serious title threat either this week or in the
not-too-distant future. A first-round loser in her debut last year,
she's played better and more confidently with every match the past
week.
	   The surest sign that Williams is ready to challenge for the
championship came after Tuesday's match, when she said that no
matter how well she seemed to play, and no matter the score, she
still wasn't satisfied. She criticized herself for moments of
inconsistency, but was pleased with the way she attacked the net
more frequently.
	   ``I'm trying to get as serious as possible,'' Williams said. ``I
want to have every point. I think that I should deserve every
point, and not the other person. If I want to win something like
this, I'm going to have to work for it. It's not just going to
come. The people that win the Slams are the people that work the
hardest ... It all starts right now. There has to be a point when
you make up your mind that you're going to do something.''
	   Novotna, who has come so close to winning Wimbledon only to lose
leads in the final twice, raised an eyebrow at Venus and Serena
Williams' cocky attitude toward winning.
	   ``I guess that's the way the young American kids are brought up
nowadays,'' said Novotna, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Irina Spirlea.
	   Hingis overcame a sleepy start in a 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, setting up a match against Sanchez
Vicario, who downed Belgium's Dominique Van Roost 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I had to wake up 8:30-9 for a 10 o'clock practice,'' said
Hingis, whose match started unusually early at 11 a.m. on Court 2,
the storied ``graveyard of champions.'' ``Everything was kind of
fast in the morning. I was still sleeping in practice.''
	   The men's quarters, also on Wednesday, were set with defending
champion Pete Sampras going against Mark Philippoussis, 1996
champion Richard Krajicek taking on Italy's Davide Sanguinetti,
two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic playing Jan Siemerink, and Petr
Korda meeting Tim Henman.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set so far, served his 13th and
14th aces to finish off French qualifer Sebastien Grosjean, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4.
	   ``To start a match and complete a match in one day was nice,''
said Sampras, whose previous match spanned four days.
	   Sampras wore a brace on his left knee for the first time to
relieve soreness in the back of the knee. Krajicek, who beat Wayne
Ferreira 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, hyperextended a knee when he slipped at the
end of the second set.
	   ``I slipped, and then my knee bent the other way,'' Krajicek
said. ``I overstretched it, and I just felt a sharp pain in my
knee, basically on my scar from my operation. It's not the tendon.
It's something inside the knee, and sometimes I've got an
unbelievably sharp pain. It's not comfortable, and I've no idea
what it is.''
	   Krajicek rolled through the first two sets, then struggled in
the third set after the injury.
	   ``I was basically serving with one leg,'' he said. ``That's why
I lost my aim and hit more double faults. And it was also a little
bit of a mental thing. I just didn't really want to go for the
volleys any more.''
	   Krajicek didn't know whether the injury might limit him in the
quarters, or even cause him to default.
	   ``If this stiffens up and gets worse, I don't know what's going
to happen in the next match,'' he said. ``But I'm lucky that there
was another invalid on the court and he couldn't serve and that I
won it in straight sets.
	   ``In a way, I hope maybe it's raining tomorrow. But in another
way, I hope that if I can play well, I can win and then have a day
off on Thursday and it might help me for Friday's match. I don't
know if it's a threat or not. But it's not feeling very good at the
moment.''

U.N. Angola envoy's final tribute draws diplomats, civilians byline. Edits to conform. No pickup.

Eds: UPDATES with details of ceremony, burial, tributes. Adds

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAMAKO, Mali (AP) _ Foreign diplomats, relatives and ordinary
civilians gathered Tuesday to pay homage to Mali-born Alioune
Blondin Beye, the U.N. envoy to Angola whose plane crashed into a
swamp in Ivory Coast on Friday.
	   The ceremony, attended by more than 1,000 people from all walks
of life including U.N., Malian and other dignitaries, was held
Tuesday at the Palais de Congres, a large public courtyard in the
dusty capital of Bamako in this desert-bound country.
	   The ceremony was led by Mali President Alpha Konare, who offered
tributes to his former colleague.
	   The gathering was followed by a burial with military music and
honors reserved for state heroes at an Islamic cemetery in Bamako's
Hamdallaye quarter, just several hundred meters (yards) from Beye's
birthplace.
	   Beye, the U.N. special envoy to Angola, was among eight people
who died when their small charter plane went down Friday as it
tried to land in Abidjan, the commercial capital of the Ivory
Coast.
	   The crash deeply shook the people of Mali, where the 59-year-old
Beye _ a former university professor and cabinet minister _ had
been well-known for years.
	   The top U.N. official at the funeral, Undersecretary-General for
Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet, described Beye as the ``heart and soul
of the U.N. mission in Angola.''
	   One of Beye's two wives, Kadiatou, received condolences from Sao
Tome's President Miguel Trovoada during a brief stopover in the
island state prior to the funeral.
	   Angola, which was torn by nearly 20 years of civil war following
independence from Portugal in 1975, was represented at Tuesday's
ceremony by representatives from both the government and the former
rebel group, UNITA.
	   Beye mediated a 1994 peace pact but had threatened to resign
last month, saying neither UNITA nor the Angolan government had the
``political will'' to fully comply with the accord.
	   Russia's Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov expressed regret
Tuesday over Beye's death.
	   ``The creative potential of that well-known statesman manifested
itself especially brightly in his U.N. peacemaking activities,''
Primakov said according to the Interfax news agency.
	   A Muslim, Beye leaves behind 2 wives and 4 children.

Serbs retake coal mine after fierce offensive on Kosovo rebels elsewhere, Pristina shooting; trims 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with eight Albanian militants reported killed

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces overran a
strategic coal mine just west of Kosovo province's capital on
Tuesday after a withering offensive that sent thousands of
villagers streaming.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on the area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army
captured last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   Amid the fighting, a human rights group accused the Serbs of
rape and other war crimes. Another said both sides were guilty of
excessive use of force.
	   This week's eruption of major clashes west of Pristina, capital
of the secessionist Serbian province, has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
in fighting this year between Serb security forces and the KLA.
	   Violence was also reported elsewhere Tuesday in Kosovo.
	   Eight Albanian militants were killed after they attacked a
Yugoslav army border patrol near the southwestern town of
Djakovica, close to the Albanian border, the pro-government Serbian
Media Center said.
	   In a shooting in downtown Pristina, Serb police guards wounded
an ethnic Albanian trying to escape from a court hearing where he
was facing charges of conspiring to commit ``acts hostile to the
(Serbian) state.'' Albanian sources claimed a passerby also was
wounded.
	   For much of Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of a ridge
overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared. Throughout the surrounding hills, police snipers,
cannons and mortars _ well-camouflaged in the lush green hills _
all fired on the KLA-held area.
	   After a 24-hour bombardment, Serb forces ceased their fire about
6 a.m., then resumed a few hours later after changing their
positions. At least four other villages also were shelled Tuesday.
They finally retook the mine and surrounding villages in the late
afternoon after KLA forces fled.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said earlier Tuesday
that three Albanians were killed Monday in fighting around
Belacevac. There was no immediate word on casualties from Tuesday's
clashes.
	   Journalists allowed into the area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses. Police seized
several KLA uniforms as well as rocket-propelled grenades and hand
grenades.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked Saban Gadeni, a
19-year-old economics student at the University of Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, indicated
in Oslo, Norway, that diplomatic efforts remain snagged.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch blamed both sides _ but
primarily the Serbs _ for war crimes or human rights violations.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press offices in the
Balkans, the private watchdog group said it had ``powerful
evidence'' that Serb police ``summarily executed'' an unspecified
number of ethnic Albanians between February and May.
	   It also cited eyewitnesses reporting the rape of three women in
the village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross
markings fired on fleeing refugees on at least two occasions in
early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International said the vast
majority of the victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90
percent of the population in Kosovo. But it said Serbs also are
suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' the international human rights organization said.
	   The wife and mother of two Serbs kidnapped Monday by the KLA
appealed to the militants Tuesday to release them.
	   ``My 18-year-old son Ivan's childhood was ruined by the war in
Croatia where we lived, now his youth is ruined in Kosovo,'' said
Vesna Bakrac. The men reportedly were taken off a bus Monday by
armed Albanians along with two other Serbs.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One day after being blamed by Israel's
president for failing in Mideast peacemaking, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu responded Tuesday by accusing the president of
siding with the Arabs and Israel's opposition.
	   President Ezer Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when
he went on national television and blamed Netanyahu for the
deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and said it
was time to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday accused Weizman of breaching the
presidential role by siding with Arab countries and Israel's
political left, in opposition since Netanyahu's narrow election two
years ago.
	   ``The fact is that the President, to my sorrow, took a stand
with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV.
	   Netanyahu said Weizman was also siding with Egypt and the
Palestinians, who have said Netanyahu's policies are hurting
chances for peace.
	   ``The President has strengthened and hardened the Arab
position,'' Netanyahu said in another interview with Israel's
Channel 2 TV.
	   Netanyahu said he had hoped that when Weizman was re-elected to
a second term in March, he would ``behave like his predecessors,''
who kept to the largely ceremonial role of the office.
	   ``The president is attacking the prime minister on a personal
basis, it's not a healthy thing for Israel.'' Netanyahu said,
adding that Weizman's ``blunt involvement in internal politics,''
crossed red lines.

Brazilian doctor suspects Ronaldo is overweight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Who cares if a healthy
21-year-old is a smidgen over his normal weight? When it's Ronaldo,
just about everybody.
	   Ronaldo's 1.83-meter (6-foot-0) frame was the target of scrutiny
after Brazilian team physician Dr. Lidio Toledo said he thought the
star striker looked ``a little fat'' and promised to investigate.
	   Photos of Ronaldo in a swimsuit at the team's barbecue lunch
appeared on the Internet on Tuesday, and readers were asked to vote
whether he appeared pudgy.
	   The Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo quoted Toledo as
saying that Ronaldo was ``a half-kilo (1.1 pounds) over his normal
weight,'' adding that the player had begun treatment to lose the
excess.
	   The story seemed to gained momentum when Ronaldo didn't train
with the team Tuesday, and took laps around the practice field
instead.
	   But Ronaldo denied he was overweight, noting that team physio
Paulo Paixao closely watched the athletes' physical condition. And
after practice, coach Mario Zagallo said Ronaldo had been spared
from regular training because he had a sore knee.

Grains, soybeans rise sharply on weather, USDA forecasts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report and weather
forecasts sparked optimism about tighter supplies.
	   Corn futures were buoyed by the U.S. Agriculture Department's
report that farmers planted 80.798 million acres of corn, slightly
larger than last year but below expectations of 81.248 million
acres.
	   Soybean plantings were slightly above expectations, but prices
were buoyed by a surprisingly low inventories. The USDA said that
as of June 1, stocks stood at 593 million bushels, 43 million
bushels below average estimates.
	   Wheat futures also were boosted by lower than expected total
stocks as feed demand remained unexpected strong. The government
also reported a sharply lower spring wheat acreage estimates.
	   Prices also were supported by a private forecast that suggested
hot, dry weather could build again in Midwest regions by late next
week, at the start of a crucial growing period for corn crops.
	   Wheat for December delivery, representing prices after the fall
harvest, rose 6 cents, or 2 percent, to dlrs 3.03 1-4 a bushel;
December corn rose 7 cents, or 2.8 percent, to dlrs 2.59 1-2 a
bushel; December oats rose 2 3-4 cents, or 2 percent, to dlrs 1.38
1-4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 10 3-4 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to dlrs 6.16 3-4 a bushel.

Brazilian doctor suspects Ronaldo is overweight

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Who cares if a healthy
21-year-old is a smidgen over his normal weight? When it's Ronaldo,
just about everybody.
	   Ronaldo's 1.83-meter (6-foot-0) frame was the target of scrutiny
after Brazilian team physician Dr. Lidio Toledo said he thought the
star striker looked ``a little fat'' and promised to investigate.
	   Photos of Ronaldo in a swimsuit at the team's barbecue lunch
appeared on the Internet on Tuesday, and readers were asked to vote
whether he appeared pudgy.
	   The Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo quoted Toledo as
saying that Ronaldo was ``a half-kilo (1.1 pounds) over his normal
weight,'' adding that the player had begun treatment to lose the
excess.
	   The story seemed to gained momentum when Ronaldo didn't train
with the team Tuesday, and took laps around the practice field
instead.
	   But Ronaldo denied he was overweight, noting that team physio
Paulo Paixao closely watched the athletes' physical condition. And
after practice, coach Mario Zagallo said Ronaldo had been spared
from regular training because he had a sore knee.

Eds: UPDATES with heavy fighting in Bissau and Mansoa; peace talks
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ The promise of peace talks in
Guinea-Bissau was muffled by the crash of a massive rocket assault
Tuesday on the capital and fierce fighting in the nearby town of
Mansoa.
	   Just hours before a government delegation was to meet with rebel
military leaders to discuss terms of a cease-fire, volleys of
artillery and rocket fire slammed in on the capital of Bissau and
its outlying areas.
	   The echoing crash of the fighting could be heard in Mansoa,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Bissau.
	   The talks were abruptly canceled as both sides accused the other
of launching the volley. It was unclear who fired the first shot.
	   In Mansoa, rebel forces used rocket-propelled grenades and
machine guns to drive away loyalist forces.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira had been holding
a key road junction linking Bissau and Mansoa to the country's
northern interior.
	   Earlier, the rebellious military leaders had demanded that
Senegal and Republic of Guinea, fighting in support of Vieira,
withdraw all troops before the rebels will continue peace
negotiations.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a cease-fire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers, rebel officials said.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes, the rebels' spokesman, asked Portuguese
ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva to press the government to
stop the attacks.
	   ``If one of ours dies, you can be sure we'll retaliate,''
Fernandes told da Silva in a phone call quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, Francisco Henriques da Silva,
was following up on the mediation efforts launched at the weekend
by Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman said in Lisbon.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane tried to topple
Vieira earlier this month. The coup attempt degenerated into near
civil war in and around the capital and some nearby towns.
Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira and
Mane.
	   The government has offered a pardon to rebel soldiers who lay
down their arms and a life in exile to the officers who
masterminded the uprising that began on June 7.
	   Rebel-controlled Radio Bombolon said Tuesday that Mane's forces
would only consider a cease-fire when Senegal's more than 1,500
troops withdraw from Guinea-Bissau.
	   Over the weekend, Senegal sent additional troops to Bissau to
counter increasing support for the rebels. A growing number of
people support the rebel claim that Vieira's government was riddled
with corruption.
	   In the countryside, more and more former guerrilla rebels from
Guinea-Bissau's 1960s and '70s independence war against Portugal
have been rearming and coming out in favor of Mane's uprising.
	   Many civilians complain of alleged corruption in Vieira's
government.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's displaced population _ many of
whom have moved to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata and
Canchungo _ are putting enormous pressure on food reserves.
	   The World Food Program said Monday that Bafata's population of
160,000 has doubled, while rice stocks have dwindled, with only a
few days' worth remaining.

World Cup: Argentina and England 2-2 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Javier Zanetti made it 2-2 seconds
before the interval as Argentina hit back to go into half time tied
with England in an action-packed World Cup second round match
Tuesday.
	   After teen-age striker Michael Owen had fired England ahead 2-1
with one of the best goals of any World Cup, Zanetti took a pass
from Juan Veron at a free kick on the edge of the England area to
curl a left-footed shot into the roof of the net for the equalizer.
	   Gabriel Batistuta fired Argentina ahead in the sixth minute for
his fifth goal and second penalty of the championship and England
captain Alan Shearer made it 1-1 from the spot three minutes later.
	   The two penalties in the opening nine minutes set the game
alight in an already super-charged atmosphere in the
Geoffrey-Guichard stadium.
	   England goalkeeper David Seaman needlessly brought down Diego
Simeone after a mixup in the defense and Batistuta drove home the
sixth-minute spot kick via the 'keeper's fingertips.
	   Three minutes later it was 1-1 when Paul Scholes released Owen,
who raced into the Argentina area only to be upended by Roberto
Ayala. Shearer powered the ball into the roof of the net.
	   With the game bubbling and the dangerously unsegregated fans
already exchanging unpleasantries behind one of the goals, England
took the lead with a wonder goal from Owen.
	   Paul Ince broke up a menacing Argentina move on the edge of his
own area and fed Beckham who was well placed just short of the
halfway line. The Manchester United midfielder found Owen 45 meters
from the goal and the Liverpool teen-ager started his amazing run.
	   He beat Jose Chamot for pace and cut to his right to drift past
Ayala and make for goal. Owen, with only 'keeper Carlos Roa to
beat, even had the unmarked Paul Scholes in support but was
confident to go it alone drove the ball home from 12 meters.
	   But Argentina's army of fans were cheering at halftime after
Zanetti made it 2-2. Batistuta pulled the English defense one way
with a decoy run and Veron slipped the ball to his co-midfielder
who curled the ball past Seaman.
	   Lineups
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala, Jose
Chamot; Javier Zanetti, Diego Simeone, Juan Veron, Matias Almeyda,
Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez, Gabriel Batistuta.
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton, David Beckham, Paul Ince, Paul Scholes, Graeme Le
Saux; Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.

Macedonian police intercept largest arms smuggling channel 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonian police intercepted the
largest arms smuggling channel to date, close to the border with
neighboring Albania, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Police discovered an underground, specially built bunker in the
vicinity of Veleste village, close to Struga _ about 160 kilometers
(100 miles) southwest of capital Skopje and only a couple of miles
from the border itself.
	   The ministry did not state whether the arms were intended for
the neighboring Serbian province of Kosovo, where
independence-seeking ethnic Albanian militants are battling Serb
police and military.
	   The day of the discovery was not specified.
	   The arms cache included 23 automatic rifles, more than 16,000
bullets, 86 hand grenades and eight casings of explosives. A
smaller cache was found in the nearby village of Radoliste.
	   The arms had been illegally smuggled into Macedonia from
neighboring Albania, the statement said.
	   Two Macedonian residents, one of whom is on the run, have been
charged in connection to the arms smuggling chain.
	   Separately, authorities in Serbia, which borders Macedonia to
the north, reported three border incidents over the past month. All
involved armed groups of Albanians attempting to enter Kosovo by
way of Macedonia.

Mastering grass, Venus Williams faces Novotna in big test AP Tennis Writer 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to remove garble in header
EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Like a schoolgirl cramming for a final
_ a Wimbledon final, she hopes _ Venus Williams cribs notes to
herself that she sneaks peeks at during matches.
	   They are daily affirmations and reminders that she pulls out of
her bag on changeovers. Bend your knees. Get down low to the grass.
Prepare for the ball.
	   ``I think it makes me play better,'' said Williams, who also
jots down lines from songs to help her relax.
	   It must be working because her learning curve on grass is
soaring sharply in only her second trip to Wimbledon, landing her
Tuesday in the quarterfinals for her biggest test yet against
two-time finalist Jana Novotna.
	   Joining them in Wednesday's quarters are defending champion
Martina Hingis versus French champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario; No.
2 Lindsay Davenport against No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat; and No. 6
Monica Seles against Natasha Zvereva.
	   Williams showed her budding grasscourt mastery in a 6-3, 6-1
rout of Virginia Ruano-Pascual, the Spanish woman who beat her
little sister, Serena.
	   ``I wanted to win every point, all the points that Serena
couldn't win yesterday,'' the 18-year old Williams said. ``I didn't
like it that she came back to 4-3. I thought that was really
negligent on my part. So I had to get serious and make sure that
she didn't get too many more games.''
	   Williams sliced and slugged with equal control, punched solid
volleys and flicked deft drop shots and lobs. She did everything a
player should do on grass as she revealed an all-court game that
could make her a serious title threat either this week or in the
not-too-distant future. A first-round loser in her debut last year,
she's played better and more confidently with every match the past
week.
	   The surest sign that Williams is ready to challenge for the
championship came after Tuesday's match, when she said that no
matter how well she seemed to play, and no matter the score, she
still wasn't satisfied. She criticized herself for moments of
inconsistency, but was pleased with the way she attacked the net
more frequently.
	   ``I'm trying to get as serious as possible,'' Williams said. ``I
want to have every point. I think that I should deserve every
point, and not the other person. If I want to win something like
this, I'm going to have to work for it. It's not just going to
come. The people that win the Slams are the people that work the
hardest ... It all starts right now. There has to be a point when
you make up your mind that you're going to do something.''
	   Novotna, who has come so close to winning Wimbledon only to lose
leads in the final twice, raised an eyebrow at Venus and Serena
Williams' cocky attitude toward winning.
	   ``I guess that's the way the young American kids are brought up
nowadays,'' said Novotna, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Irina Spirlea.
	   Hingis overcame a sleepy start in a 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, setting up a match against Sanchez
Vicario, who downed Belgium's Dominique Van Roost 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I had to wake up 8:30-9 for a 10 o'clock practice,'' said
Hingis, whose match started unusually early at 11 a.m. on Court 2,
the storied ``graveyard of champions.'' ``Everything was kind of
fast in the morning. I was still sleeping in practice.''
	   The men's quarters, also on Wednesday, were set with defending
champion Pete Sampras going against Mark Philippoussis, 1996
champion Richard Krajicek taking on Italy's Davide Sanguinetti,
two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic playing Jan Siemerink, and Petr
Korda meeting Tim Henman.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set so far, served his 13th and
14th aces to finish off French qualifer Sebastien Grosjean, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4.
	   ``To start a match and complete a match in one day was nice,''
said Sampras, whose previous match spanned four days.
	   Sampras wore a brace on his left knee for the first time to
relieve soreness in the back of the knee. Krajicek, who beat Wayne
Ferreira 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, hyperextended a knee when he slipped at the
end of the second set.
	   ``I slipped, and then my knee bent the other way,'' Krajicek
said. ``I overstretched it, and I just felt a sharp pain in my
knee, basically on my scar from my operation. It's not the tendon.
It's something inside the knee, and sometimes I've got an
unbelievably sharp pain. It's not comfortable, and I've no idea
what it is.''
	   Krajicek rolled through the first two sets, then struggled in
the third set after the injury.
	   ``I was basically serving with one leg,'' he said. ``That's why
I lost my aim and hit more double faults. And it was also a little
bit of a mental thing. I just didn't really want to go for the
volleys any more.''
	   Krajicek didn't know whether the injury might limit him in the
quarters, or even cause him to default.
	   ``If this stiffens up and gets worse, I don't know what's going
to happen in the next match,'' he said. ``But I'm lucky that there
was another invalid on the court and he couldn't serve and that I
won it in straight sets.
	   ``In a way, I hope maybe it's raining tomorrow. But in another
way, I hope that if I can play well, I can win and then have a day
off on Thursday and it might help me for Friday's match. I don't
know if it's a threat or not. But it's not feeling very good at the
moment.''

	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ The promise of peace talks in
Guinea-Bissau was muffled by the crash of a massive rocket assault
Tuesday on the capital and fierce fighting in the nearby town of
Mansoa.
	   Just hours before a government delegation was to meet with rebel
military leaders to discuss terms of a cease-fire, volleys of
artillery and rocket fire slammed in on the capital of Bissau and
its outlying areas.
	   The echoing crash of the fighting could be heard in Mansoa,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Bissau.
	   The talks were abruptly canceled as both sides accused the other
of launching the volley. It was unclear who fired the first shot.
	   In Mansoa, rebel forces used rocket-propelled grenades and
machine guns to drive away loyalist forces.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira had been holding
a key road junction linking Bissau and Mansoa to the country's
northern interior.
	   Earlier, the rebellious military leaders had demanded that
Senegal and Republic of Guinea, fighting in support of Vieira,
withdraw all troops before the rebels will continue peace
negotiations.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a cease-fire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers, rebel officials said.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes, the rebels' spokesman, asked Portuguese
ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva to press the government to
stop the attacks.
	   ``If one of ours dies, you can be sure we'll retaliate,''
Fernandes told da Silva in a phone call quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Da Silva was following up on the mediation efforts launched at
the weekend by Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, a foreign
ministry spokeswoman said in Lisbon.

Prominent Swiss say anti-American backlash growing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A group of prominent Swiss said Tuesday
that ``defamation'' from the United States was producing an
anti-American and anti-Semitic backlash in Switzerland.
	   ``For the Swiss people the threshold of what is bearable has
been surpassed, and we will no longer allow our national dignity to
be stepped on,'' said the group in an open letter to U.S.
Ambassador Madeleine May Kunin.
	   The organization, including former ambassadors and other retired
government, civic and professional leaders, said they had formed a
working group of people who had experienced World War II.
	   They said recent reviews of history, including U.S. attacks on
Switzerland's wartime dealings with Nazi Germany, had
``overvalued'' incomplete archival records while ignoring the
``equally important'' testimony of people who lived through the
period.
	   Switzerland should be judged, not from today's perspective, but
by the reality of the wartime era, when as a surrounded, small
neutral nation its first challenge was to survive according to the
principles of international law at the time, the letter said.
	   The Swiss government's policy, backed by the support of the
great majority of the Swiss people for the Allies, made it possible
for the country to save ``numerous, predominantly Jewish refugees,
as well as interned Allied forces,'' who had escaped capture by the
Germans.
	   U.S. class-action suits and boycott threats against Swiss banks
amount to ``extortion,'' they said.
	   ``As a result of the defamation of Switzerland on the part of
American and international Jewish organizations, in part seconded
by officials in the United States, not only is anti-Semitism
regrettably on the rise, but also the beginnings of an unfortunate
anti-Americanism,'' it said.
	   The attacks have fueled latent anti-Semites, and more alarmingly
have started to spread anti-Semitism to parts of the population
that previously have worked for good relations between Jews and
non-Jews.
	   The letter signers described themselves as a ``politically and
religiously independent group of concerned Swiss citizens.''
	   They included an architect, a journalist, former head of the
Swiss Red Cross, and Raymond Probst, the Swiss ambassador to the
United States when Switzerland began caring for U.S. interests in
Iran after the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

Shaq, Reebok part endorsement ways 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ When Shaquille O'Neal could no longer deliver shoe
sales for Reebok, the sneaker marketer decided to end its
relationship with the Los Angeles Lakers' center.
	   Company spokesperson Dave Fogelson said Tuesday that the
agreement not to renew O'Neal's dlrs 15 million, five-year deal was
mutual.
	   But Reebok reported a 12.2 percent drop in U.S. shoe sales
during the first three months of this year, prompting it to trim 50
NBA players from its list of 70 endorsers. Rival companies Nike,
Fila and Converse are also considering cuts.
	   Reebok will continue using star athletes to endorse its
products, but Fogelson said ``the message is about the product, and
what the product brings the athlete.''
	   O'Neal's agent, Leonard Armato, said he expects to announce soon
another footwear and apparel deal for O'Neal. Armato said that
O'Neal will take this opportunity to develop a ``whole new
direction.''

U.S. envoy: Kosovo crisis at a critical stage address. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Leads with four grafs to UPDATE with quote from evening
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Tuesday said the conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province is in a
critical stage, and that the United States' efforts to cool off the
situation were continuing.
	   ``Kosovo is a crisis on the edge of becoming an emergency,''
Holbrooke said in a Tuesday night address. ``One group of drunken
soldiers goading another could turn very ugly.''
	   Holbrooke, recently nominated to become U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, left Yugoslavia on Friday after four days of
shuttle diplomacy without coming up with a formula for ending the
fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``Diplomatic and political efforts to resolve the problem are
intense and ongoing. Many press reported that my mission ended last
week in failure, so let me clarify something: The mission didn't
end. It is continuing even though I left Kosovo,'' Holbrooke told
reporters earlier in the day.
	   He said Americans were still engaged in mediation, but that he
did not want to disclosed details. The United States and NATO have
also warned of possible military intervention unless the fighting
stops.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28. The forces are
trying to halt growing resistance by Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   ``One problem is that, on the military side, there is no clear
Albanian chain of command with which to deal when on talks about a
ceasefire. This is a marked difference from Bosnia,'' he said,
speaking briefly to reporters.
	   Holbrooke mediated the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war.
	   Holbrooke was in Oslo for a meeting of Turks and Greeks on the
tensions in Cyprus.
	   Cyprus was divided after Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974. Greek and Turkish Cypriots
now live separated by a U.N.-patrolled line running across the
island.
	   The meeting was called to bring together private citizens from
both sides of the island in hopes of building contact and trust.
	   ``I want to stress these are not negotiations. These are
meetings between private citizens,'' Holbrooke said.

French official spotlights US on Rwanda policy 
</HEADLINE>
By DENIS BOULARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Trying to defend France's role in Rwanda in the
period surrounding that country's genocide, a former foreign
minister turned the spotlight on the United States Tuesday, saying
the Americans as well had strategic goals to serve there.
	   The testimony of Roland Dumas, now head of France's highest
court, came as part of a parliamentary fact-finding mission. The
mission was launched this year after reports that France continued
to arm and support Rwanda's French-speaking, Hutu-led government
even after the genocide of Tutsis began in April 1994.
	   The legislative probe, expected to produce its findings this
fall, is the first time French foreign policy has been subject to
such parliamentary scrutiny.
	   ``Contrary to what one may imagine,'' Dumas said, ``I think
there was long an American aim, not to destabilize the region, but
to be a force in the region.''
	   Dumas was foreign minister from 1988 to 1993, under President
Francois Mitterrand.
	   Last month, Hubert Vedrine, the current foreign minister and
former chief of staff for Mitterrand, tried to defend France's
maintaining links to the Rwandan Hutu regime in 1994.
	   France has been accused of mounting Operation Turquoise not to
protect refugees but to protect its old Hutu friends, many involved
in the massacres that killed 500,000, mostly Tutsis.
	   Vedrine argued that France's policy of seeking a cease-fire,
then mounting Operation Turquoise despite a lack of international
support, was meant to maintain stability in Francophone Africa,
where Paris has numerous mutual defense treaties.
	   Critics of Mitterrand's Rwanda policy called the policy an
effort to stave off the advance of Anglophone, particularly
American, influence in Francophone Africa.
	   Dumas said Tuesday that the United States, at the time, was
particularly concerned about terrorism, and wanted to plant itself
strategically near Sudan, which it saw as a key source of support
for terrorists.
	   Also testifying was Michel Rocard, prime minister from May 1988
to May 1991. He said he ``wasn't in the loop'' regarding Rwanda.
``I never, and I affirm it here, heard talk of Rwanda during that
period,'' he said, stressing that such affairs were handled by the
Foreign Ministry and the presidential Elysee Palace.
	   Another former prime minister, Edith Cresson, who served only a
year starting in May 1991, said simply that the prime minister
``doesn't play a major role'' in France's African policy.

	   TRAN, Bulgaria (AP) _ American and Bulgarian engineering troops
started a joint humanitarian exercise Tuesday in which they will
rebuild a municipal hospital in this western Bulgarian town, close
to the border with Yugoslavia.
	   Both Bulgarian and U.S. military denied suggestions that the
exercise, dubbed Cornerstone '98, might be a preparation for a
possible outbreak of a war in the region stemming from Yugoslavia's
tense province of Kosovo.
	   ``Our mission here is strictly humanitarian,'' said Col. William
McCoy of the U.S. National Guard. He said his troops would not be
involved in case of possible NATO intervention in Kosovo.
	   The exercise, which is under NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, will last till Aug. 8. It includes 207 U.S. servicemen and
women from the 194 Engineering Brigade of the National Guard, based
in Jackson, Tennessee, and 218 servicemen from Bulgaria's
engineering troops.
	   They will work together to renovate the 91-bed hospital in Tran,
a town of 3,000 located 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of the
capital Sofia and 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border with
Yugoslavia.
	   The hospital serves an area population of 6,300.
	   The dlrs 500,000 repair will be entirely funded by the U.S.
government, said Maj. William Wenzler, commander of the American
contingent.
	   ``For the first time we meet foreign troops who are neither
conquerors, nor liberators,'' said Tran's mayor Alexandar Nenkov.
``They are not armed and come here to build, that's why they are
welcome.''

Bird, Haynes thrilled fans, reach basketball's shrine AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ For 12 National Basketball Association seasons
during the Larry Bird era, Boston Garden was sold out for every
game as he treated fans to clutch shots and eye-opening passes.
	   In more than 12,000 games, Marques Haynes of the Harlem
Globetrotters and Harlem Magicians dazzled crowds in 106 countries
with his dribbling and showmanship.
	   Entertainers of different eras, Bird and Haynes were voted into
basketball's Hall of Fame on Monday, along with one player, Arnie
Risen, and coaches Alex Hannum, Jody Conradt and Aleksandar
Nikolic.
	   Bird was elected in his first year of eligibility, having been
retired for five years. Haynes, who graduated from college 33 years
before Bird, was honored in the first year he was nominated.
	   Both had a knack for thrilling fans and winning games.
	   ``I don't think there's anybody who didn't admire what he (Bird)
did,'' said Conradt, who will begin her 23rd season at Texas as the
winningest women's coach in history. ``You can't love the game of
basketball and not love the way he played the game with passion and
intensity and success.''
	   He took Indiana State to the 1979 NCAA finals, then led the NBA
into an era of unprecedented popularity and the Boston Celtics to
three NBA titles in a 13-year career filled with awards, but cut
short by back problems.
	   He was rookie of the year in 1980, a two-time finals MVP,
three-time regular-season MVP and 12-time All-Star.
	   Need a steal? He had more than any Celtics player since the
statistic was first kept in 1973-74. A game-winning shot? Bird had
plenty of those, too. And with the Indiana Pacers, he was coach of
the year last season.
	   He seemed to take it all in stride, just as he reacted calmly to
his widely anticipated election. He and Risen bring to 25 the
number of Celtics elected to basketball's shrine in Springfield,
Mass.
	   ``This is a very exciting day for me. It's one of the greatest
things that can happen to a sports figure,'' Bird said at a news
conference Tuesday in Indianapolis.
	   Bird said it is hard to compare the Hall of Fame selection with
other awards he has won, but he said probably his most memorable
experience before this was his first NBA championship with the
Celtics in 1981.
	   ``You have to win championships, you have to win MVP awards to
get here,'' he said of making the Hall of Fame. I guess it means I
had success along the way. It's a great feeling, no question about
it.''
	   Haynes joined the Globetrotters in 1947 before blacks played in
the NBA. He likened such teams to basketball's version of
baseball's Negro leagues, which had outstanding players who weren't
fully appreciated in their playing days.
	   The Globetrotters beat the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers in 1948 and
1949 and held their own against a group of college all-stars in a
series of games in 1950. Like the Magicians formed by Haynes in
1953 after a contract dispute, the Globetrotters were known
primarily for on-court hijinks that had fans laughing and the
opponent invariably losing.
	   Another crowd-pleasing star, Magic Johnson, lost his chance to
be elected this year when he ended 4 1/2 years of retirement by
returning to the Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 29, 1996. He won't be
eligible until 2002.
	   Bird will be the focus of the induction ceremony Oct. 2 in
Springfield.

Puerto Rico strike costs reaching dlrs 100 million ADDS economist's comments 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A strike by state telephone workers
has cost Puerto Rico's economy as much as dlrs 100 million, a
figure that could skyrocket with a two-day general strike next
week, an economist says.
	   Since the strike began June 18, sabotage of phone lines and
service outages have affected banks, Internet and cellular phone
services and other businesses that depend on the government's
Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   Damages have reached dlrs 100 million, said Santos Negron, a
private economic consultant and former member of the government's
planning board.
	   In remarks published Tuesday, Negron told El Nuevo Dia newspaper
that figure could multiply with a general strike _ and a labor
union has threatened an open-ended general strike if the sale isn't
called off.
	   The labor union, General Committee of Labor Organizations, voted
Monday to stage a general strike July 7-8, joining some 6,400
unionized telephone workers protesting government plans to sell the
company to GTE Corp. for dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   The proposed sale is part of Gov. Pedro Rossello's drive to
privatize utilities, health care and the sugar industry.
	   The union, whose Spanish acronym is CAOS, represents more than
12,000 workers with the state water and electricity unions. Its
strike vote _ targeting essential services such as power and sewers
_ upped the ante in the battle between the unions, which are
fighting to save their government jobs, and Rossello.
	   On Tuesday at least 150,000 of the company's 1.3 million
customers had no service, said company president Carmen Ana
Culpeper, who added that the strike is costing dlrs 700,000 a day.
	   Police have reported more than 300 acts of sabotage against the
company and a bank involved in the privatization, including damage
to lines that has topped dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Saboteurs on Monday burned a trunk cable in the south coast city
of Ponce and toppled an antenna at a telephone company building,
knocking a radio station off the air.

Notes, quotes and news from the world of golf AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Team competition came to tennis and now someone
is trying to bring it to golf. Edward Kehrli, a stock broker and
former minor league baseball pitcher, announced Tuesday the
formation of Major League Golf.
	   The plans are for 12 teams composed of 10 players each and
divided into two conferences. There will be a six-week spring
training period and then an 18-week regular-season followed by a
world series.
	   The only problem is that it's not clear who the owners will be,
who the players will be, who will televise it and even what the
rules of competition will be.
	   Other than that, everything seems to be going nicely.
	   ``We feel we will be extremely competitive'' with the purses on
the PGA Tour, Kehrli said Tuesday after a news conference in New
York. ``We want to fill the pockets of a lot of golfers who
typically don't make as much money as they should.''
	   Kehrli said a draft will be held in July of next year.
	   ``Only the best players will be drafted,'' he said. ``We are
aggressively going after only the best players in pro golf as we
speak. We are going to parallel other sports in terms of
salaries.''
	   As for specific players, owners and TV possibilities, Kehrli
could only say some talks have begun
	   And as for the competition itself, Kehrli said ``the rules
committee is still drawing up rules and regulations.''
	   If Major League Golf is going to go after PGA Tour members it
will have to work around tour regulations restricting participation
by its members in events that compete against PGA Tour tournaments.
	   ``That is another rule and regulation we are trying to work
out,'' Kehrli said. ``I don't have an answer yet.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MONTY MANIA: &LR;  Colin Montgomerie, who was heckled nearly every
day at the U.S. Open in San Francisco, has received dozens of
e-mails from fans who thought he was treated unfairly.
	   ``I've appreciated it very much and I've responded to every
one,'' said Montgomerie, who believes he has made enemies simply by
being the man who won the deciding Ryder Cup match at Valderrama
last year.
	   ``Some were from Europe but there were many from America and it
means a lot to me that they took the trouble to write,'' he said.
``They said they were disgusted with how some of their fellow
countrymen acted. You don't feel alone when people get in touch
with you like that.''
	   If Montgomerie wins the Murphy's Irish Open this week he will
become the first player to win a European Tour event three
consecutive times since Nick Faldo won the Irish Open from 1991-93.
	   Faldo makes his first appearance of the season in Europe as part
of his preparation for the British Open at Royal Birkdale in two
weeks. Ernie Els is also in the field.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IT'S A LOCH: &LR;  Jose Maria Olazabal, who won in Dubai and was
runner-up two other times, committed to play the Standard Life Loch
Lomond tournament next week and amateur Matt Kuchar has been given
a spot in the field.
	   Also playing at Loch Lomond will be Colin Montgomerie, Lee
Westwood, defending champion Tom Lehman and Nick Faldo.
	   Kuchar was one of three amateurs given a spot in the 148-man
field, joining teen-age phenoms Justin Rose of England and Sergio
``El Nino'' Garcia of Spain.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IT'S A MATCH: &LR;  The inaugural Andersen Consulting World Match
Play Championship next February at the La Costa Resort and Spa will
feature the top 64 players from the World Golf Rankings.
	   If the tournament were held this week, No. 1 Tiger Woods would
draw No. 64 Craig Stadler in the first round, while No. 2 Ernie Els
would be matched against No. 63 Dudley Hart.
	   One of the more fascinating matchups would be No. 5 Colin
Montgomerie against No. 60 Tom Kite in a match that would carry
some Ryder Cup memories.
	   A difficult first-round match for a top player would be No. 7.
Justin Leonard drawing No. 58. Paul Stankowski. And a competitive
match would be No. 27 Payne Stewart against No. 38 Thomas Bjorn.
	    &UR; Divots: &LR;  The Buick Challenge raised its purse dlrs 300,000 to
dlrs 1.5 million, nearly double of what it paid out in 1994. The
Buick Challenge is Oct. 1-4 at Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain,
Ga. ... Joe Durant at the Western Open was the fifth first-time
winner on the PGA Tour this year. There were six all of last year.
... Jim Furyk has 21 top-10 finishes in the last 18 months, best on
the PGA Tour, but has not won during that period. ... Nancy Lopez
really wants to make the Solheim Cup team. She is playing six
consecutive events beginning with the ShopRite LPGA Classic and
including the U.S. Open and the JAL Big Apple Classic. Lopez
currently has the 10th and final guaranteed spot. ... Casey Martin,
who needed to finish in the top 15 on the Nike Tour money list to
earn his PGA Tour card for next year, is 17th. ...

Dolphins' Phillips under investigation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Lawrence Phillips, whose professional U.S. football
career has been plagued by violent outbursts, is under
investigation for punching a woman in the face at a suburban
nightclub, police said Tuesday.
	   The 23-year-old Miami Dolphins running back hit the woman after
she refused to dance with him, according to police Plantation,
about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of here. At one point, he
became belligerent.
	   ``Do you know who I am? You don't know me?'' he asked. The
police report said he threatened the woman that he would ``break
your jawbone and pull the weave out of your head.''
	   Michelle Black of West Palm Beach chipped a tooth, cut her lip
and later told officers she temporarily blacked out. She was
treated and released from a hospital in Plantation.
	   ``Right now it's an ongoing investigation,'' Plantation police
Detective Steve Geller said, adding that a report would be
forwarded to the state attorney's office.
	   Detectives have no timetable for completing the investigation,
Geller said.
	   The alleged assault marks Phillips' fourth brush with the law
since he turned professional, after a college career that included
a lengthy suspension for assaulting a former girlfriend. The
troubled running back joined the Dolphins Dec. 2 after his release
by the St. Louis Rams.
	   The latest incident allegedly took place shortly before 3 a.m.
Saturday at the Brickhouse Restaurant and Lounge after Ms. Black
told Phillips she doesn't dance. She said Phillips hit her in the
face twice with a closed fist, then ran off.
	   Phillips was stopped by three off-duty officers working security
at the nightclub, where he loudly denied hitting Ms. Black. The
report said he was told to calm down or he would be arrested for
disorderly conduct.
	   He was allowed to leave, but was ordered not to return or he
would be arrested for trespassing.
	   Phillips has been a controversial figure since his college days
at the University of Nebraska.
	   He was a leading Heisman Trophy contender as a junior until his
suspension two games into the 1995 season after he pleaded no
contest to assaulting a former girlfriend. He was reinstated for
the Fiesta Bowl and scored three touchdowns as the Cornhuskers beat
Florida for the national championship. He gave up his senior season
to turn professional.
	   St. Louis chose Phillips as the sixth pick of the 1996 draft,
but he was arrested three times and spent 23 days in jail during 19
months with the team. The Rams released him Nov. 20 after he
reacted to being benched by skipping a team meeting and practice.

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces recaptured a
coal mine that provides power to Kosovo in a withering offensive
against rebels Tuesday that sent thousands of villagers streaming
into the woods west of the capital.
	   The heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a
diplomatic settlement of the Kosovo conflict. A U.S. envoy said
Tuesday that the ethnic Albanian rebels have no clear military
chain of command to negotiate a cease-fire with, and a human rights
group accused both sides _ but primarily the Serbs _ of war crimes
and other abuses.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb police took the Belacevac
open-pit mine near the end of a second day of pulverizing attacks
on an area that the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had
taken last week.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak
summer months.
	   The steadily worsening conflict threatens to engulf the entire
region in war. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics making up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday that American
diplomats have held several unpublicized meetings with leaders of
the political wing of the militant KLA, which had been branded a
terrorist group. Until recently, the United States concentrated its
attention on Ibrahim Rugova, a more moderate leader of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians.
	   Throughout Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of a ridge
overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared. Police snipers, cannons and mortars _ well-camouflaged
in the lush green surrounding hills _ all fired on the KLA-held
area.
	   After a bombardment that lasted for more than 24 hours, Serb
forces finally retook the mine and villages around it after the KLA
fled.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said three Albanians
were killed Monday in fighting around Belacevac. Eight Albanian
militants were killed Tuesday after they attacked a Yugoslav army
border patrol near the southwestern town of Djakovica, the Serbian
Media Center said.
	   Journalists allowed into the mine area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses. Police seized
several KLA uniforms as well as rocket-propelled grenades and hand
grenades.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked 19-year-old Saban
Gadeni, an economics student at the University of Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who has conducted a series of
talks with both Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian officials, indicated
in Oslo, Norway, that diplomatic efforts were stymied.
	   ``Kosovo is a crisis on the edge of becoming an emergency,''
Holbrooke said in a Tuesday night address.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   In New York on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch accused both sides of
war crimes and human rights violations. In a statement faxed to The
Associated Press' offices in the Balkans, the respected private
watchdog group said it had ``powerful evidence'' that Serb police
``summarily executed'' an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
between February and May.
	   It also cited witnesses reporting the rape of three women in the
village of Ljubenic and said helicopters with Red Cross markings
but apparently flown by Serbs fired on fleeing refugees on at least
two occasions in early June.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was faulted for ``detentions and
attacks on Serbian civilians.''
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International said civilians have
been displaced, tortured and killed. About 70,000 people have fled
their homes _ about 45,000 to other parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, and another 13,000 to
northern Albania.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again demanded
Tuesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic withdraw Serb
special forces and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said in Shanghai, China, where she was accompanying
President Bill Clinton on a nine-day state visit.

World Cup: Argentina wins 4-3 on penalties after 2-2 tie AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Argentina knocked England out of
the World Cup 4-3 on penalties Tuesday to advance to the
quarterfinal after the two teams had tied 2-2 after extra time.
	   David Batty missed the vital spot kick for England after Roberto
Ayala had converted for the two-time champion from South America.
	   Sergi Berti, Juan Veron and Marcelo Gallardo also scored from
the penalty spot in the shootout while Alan Shearer, Paul Merson
and Michael Owen replied for England.
	   In an action-packed game, Gabriel Batistuta and Shearer swapped
penalties in the opening nine minutes, teen-age striker Owen fired
England ahead 2-1 with one of the best goals of any World Cup and
Javier Zanetti curled a left-footed shot into the roof of the net
for the equalizer.
	   And that was all in the first half.
	   England midfielder David Beckham was expelled in the first
minute of the second for needlessly kicking out at Diego Simeone
after a foul and his team was forced the complete the game with 10
players, under pressure from a well-organizer Argentina team.
	   Batistuta fired Argentina ahead in the sixth minute for his
fifth goal and second penalty of the championship and England
captain Shearer made it 1-1 from the spot three minutes later.
	   The two penalties in the opening nine minutes set the game
alight in an already super-charged atmosphere in the
Geoffrey-Guichard stadium.
	   England goalkeeper David Seaman needlessly brought down Simeone
after a mixup in the defense and Batistuta drove home the
sixth-minute spot kick via the 'keeper's fingertips.
	   Three minutes later it was 1-1 when Paul Scholes released Owen,
who raced into the Argentina area only to be upended by Roberto
Ayala. Shearer powered the ball into the roof of the net.
	   With the game bubbling and the dangerously unsegregated fans
already exchanging unpleasantries behind one of the goals, England
took the lead with a wonder goal from Owen.
	   Paul Ince broke up a menacing Argentina move on the edge of his
own area and fed Beckham who was well placed just short of the
halfway line. The Manchester United midfielder found Owen 45 meters
from the goal and the Liverpool teen-ager started his amazing run.
	   He beat Jose Chamot for pace and cut to his right to drift past
Ayala and make for goal. Owen, with only 'keeper Carlos Roa to
beat, even had the unmarked Paul Scholes in support but was
confident to go it alone drove the ball home from 12 meters.
	   But Argentina's army of fansl, there were
more fireworks on the field as Beckham, scorer of a memorable
30-meter free kick against Colombia, was shown the red card in the
opening minute of the second half for a retaliatory kick at Simeone
after he had been flattened by the Argentina midfielder.
	   The Manchester United midfielder, lying face down, kicked
upwards, catching Simeone as he fell. Danish referee Kim Milton
Nielsen showed the yellow card to Simeone and, inevitably, the red
one to Beckham.
	   Making intelligent use of the extra man, Argentina looked
threatening when it attacked the center of the English defense and
a low shot from Carlos Lopez was deflected wide by England defender
Sol Campbell with 'keeper Seaman under pressure.
	   Then Shearer got back to clear when Lopez got behind the English
defense and beat Seaman with a low cross towards Batistuta.
	   Fiorentina star Batistuta was taken off in the 69th minute and
replaced by Hernan Crespo, of another Italian club, Parma, while
10-man England sent on defender Gareth Southgate for the more
attack-minded Graeme Le Saux.
	   Although England now looked lightweight in attack, a midfield
header by Shearer sent Owen sprinting through again in the 75th
minute. The youngster again beat Ayala and Matias Almayda for speed
but lifted his left-foot shot over the bar.
	   Argentina appealed for a penalty when a cross from Chamot struck
Tony Adams on the hands but the referee waved play on.
	   Eleven minutes from the end, Sol Campbell headed in a corner and
ran to the England bench to celebrate. While he was away, referee
Nielsen ruled it out for a foul by Shearer and, with Argentina
chasing downfield from a quickly taken free kick, Campbell had to
chase back and join the rest of his under-pressure defenders.
	   With the game in extra time, England claimed a penalty for
handball in the Argentina defense and then Chamot headed a corner
from substitute Marcelo Gallardo just too high.
	   Seaman saved at the foot of his right hand post from substitute
Sergio Berti in the 103rd minute and then Owen shot too high after
he was put through again by Shearer.
	   After Seaman had saved a long-range shot from Veron, Adams
climbed to a free kick from substitute Paul Merson two minutes from
the end of extra time but headed wide.
	   Lineups
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala, Jose
Chamot; Javier Zanetti, Diego Simeone (Sergio Berti, 92nd), Juan
Veron, Matias Almeyda, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Marcelo
Gallardo, 69th), Gabriel Batistuta (Hernan Crespo, 69th).
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton (David Batty, 97th), David Beckham, Paul Ince, Paul
Scholes (Paul Merson, 78th), Graeme Le Saux (Gareth Southgate,
71st); Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.

Four hurt in Guyana protests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police fired shotguns at a crowd in
front of Guyana's Supreme Court on Tuesday, injuring four people
amid escalating anti-government protests.
	   Witnesses said the shooting occurred after police broke up a
group of protesters marching on a downtown street. Demonstrators
regrouped in front of the Supreme Court, where court employees
gathered because of a bomb threat.
	   Police arrived and began shooting buckshot into the crowd of
protesters and employees.
	   ``We were standing out in the street because of the bomb scare
when these fools started to shoot,'' said Fey Naugton, a court
employee hit in left ankle by steel pellets.
	   A 28-year-old accounting assistant, Paula Sealey, was struck
five places in the the back and leg. Delon George, 15, was hit in
the back and the back of his head. Melina Kaizer, 24, was shot in
the right knee.
	   Police quickly took the injured to hospitals.
	   Police and opposition demonstrators have clashed repeatedly in
recent weeks during protests against the government of President
Janet Jagan, which is backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian
descent.
	   Former President Desmond Hoyte's opposition party, backed by
Guyanese of African descent, claim Jagan's party used fraud to win
Dec. 15 elections.
	   Protesters firebombed the labor and finance ministries last week
and planted an explosive in police headquarters. They also attacked
journalists, including a photographer and reporter from the
state-owned Guyana Chronicle.
	   On Tuesday, crowds surrounded four journalists and threatened
them.
	   The Chronicle announced it was suspending coverage of the
demonstrations to protect its employees.

World Cup: Vieri, Batistuta, Hernandez, Chilavert among top stars so far 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with late 2nd round games
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Italy's Christian Vieri made his mark at this World
Cup. Gabriel Batistuta didn't have to. The Argentine striker just
confirmed it.
	   Both have scored five times in four games and both are still in
the running to become the sole player with which the Coupe du Monde
will be identified with in years to come.
	   Others don't have that luxury.
	   Luis Hernandez, little known outside of Latin America, became a
star in just two weeks at France 98 before Mexico was eliminated.
	   Teenager Michael Owen gave England hope, sparkle, and a great
World Cup goal against Argentina Tuesday, but the South Americans
stopped him in his tracks in a penalty shootout that capped the
star game of the tournament so far.
	   Ronaldo was supposed to be the ultimate superstar of this World
Cup. Hyped by a massive marketing campaign, the Brazilian striker
was been reduced to the level of mere greatness along with a few
others among the 704 players who have taken the field since the
tournament began June 10.
	   If the Coupe du Monde has taught us anything, it is that in
soccer's global village, surprises are ever harder to come by.
Almost everybody knows one another and any blase armchair fan can
always blurt out he's seen it all before _ and probably be right
too.
	   That's why the sudden emergence of Hernandez, all long blond
manes and good looks, and boyish Owen, warms the heart.
	   Out of the blue, Hernandez scored four goals for outsider Mexico
and gave Germany a mighty fright Monday before the European
champions eventually emerged 2-1 victors.
	   Then again, one can never aspire high enough in the World Cup.
With the Germans trailing and being outplayed, Hernandez missed the
simplest of tap-ins from close range, keeping Germany in the game
and ending his World Cup heroics on a sour note.
	   Owen, too, will be left feeling bitter. His daring slalom
through the Argentine defense and cool finishing is something many
would have liked to see him do more over the final two weeks.
	   For Atletico Madrid's Vieri, the World Cup run is still alive.
With a build seemingly chiseled out of granite, he has rumbled home
five goals in just four games and is hot and ready for Friday's
quarterfinal against the host nation.
	   ``I'm going through a great spell,'' he said, hoping to enter
World Cup history alongside such national heroes as Paolo Rossi and
Toto Schillachi, top scorers in 1982 and 1990.
	   Despite four goals, Ronaldo is on no such high. He's hit the
woodwork from several angles. Brazil is through to the
quarterfinals, yet he has his work cut out to make sure the 1998
finals will be identified with him.
	   ``He's still not the Ronaldo we all want to see. He has a lot
more to give,'' said Brazil's coach Mario Zagallo.
	   Of course, Ronaldo has to live up to being selected FIFA Player
of the Year twice. At 21, that is some task.
	   Ronaldo, Batistuta and Shearer were on a different level going
into the tournament and only Shearer dropped off that pedestal so
far. With two goal, one a penalty at that, he is on his way home.
	   Something else has been missing, too.
	   A true No. 10, a playmaker that can singlehandedly turn a game
and is an inspiration to his team, still has to emerge. Argentina's
Ariel Ortega has shown some glimpses but still needs to confirm.
	   France's Zinedine Zidane could have been one, but kicking an
opponent cost him a two-match suspension, and he's lucky that
France won without him and scraped into the quarterfinals.
	   Italy's Alessandro Del Piero got his opportunities but was so
ineffectual, especially against Norway, that it seemed he was only
stealing playing time from veteran Roberto Baggio.
	   In other positions, the aura of Jose Luis Chilavert stands out.
The goalkeeper was great as underdog Paraguay sent Spain and
Bulgaria packing in the first round, and he was even better when he
kept France at bay for 114 minutes in Sunday's second-round match
before conceding the first World Cup ``golden goal.''
	   It could have been different, if France's defense had not been
led by Marcel Desailly, truly a giant among the World Cup defenders
so far.
	   Sometimes it only takes a few seconds to become a World Cup
shooting star. Cameroon's Pierre Njanka set loose from his own
half, slalomed past opponent after opponent and a handful of
seconds later unleashed a most incredible drive past Austria's
Michael Konsel. It is still on daily newsreels all over France.
	   Danish substitute Ebbe Sand only needed half a minute after
entering the game to seal Nigeria's fate with the third goal in a
4-1 drubbing of Nigeria.
	   Meanwhile, sidestepping most of the spectaculars, Germany keeps
marching on, with singularly solid performances, underlining it
takes more than a few flashes to win the Cup.

Defense urges jury to ignore the power of government 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Don King's defense lawyer portrayed his
celebrity client Tuesday as the victim of overzealous prosecutors,
intoxicated by power to prove he committed insurance fraud.
	   Peter Fleming Jr. told the jury in U.S. District Court that
jurors hold the real power even though prosecutors sometimes refer
to themselves as the ``United States'' and the ``government.''
	   ``You may find that they are not the government,'' he told them.
``You are the people. You are the protection against the power of
government.''
	   Throughout the 10-week trial, prosecutors have tried to convince
the jury that the case is a simple one involving lies, tricks and
thievery by King to force Lloyd's of London to pay him what he lost
in a canceled 1991 bout.
	   Defense lawyers have tried to poke holes in the prosecutor's
neat vision of how a fraud was engineered. The effort has already
paid off once. A jury deadlocked on the same charges against King
in 1995, leading prosecutors to indict Don King Productions Inc. as
well.
	   ``This is obviously complicated, detailed, smoky, obscure,
confusing,'' Fleming told the jury Tuesday, a day after a
prosecutor told them the evidence against King is clear and
overwhelming.
	   ``I believe you may find this case to be a case of guesswork, an
invitation to speculate,'' Fleming added.
	   The lawyer even suggested it did not matter that a dlrs 2
million fight contract was submitted to Lloyd's of London that
contained wording that had not been seen by the person who signed
it.
	   ``You may find that when a page of the contract is changed, that
can bother ordinary people, raise some sort of concern, some sort
of suspicion. You may find also that the real question is whether
the new page is honest and accurate and reflects, shows, the
agreement,'' Fleming said.
	   ``If it is fairly reflective on the first page, on the changed
page, the modified page, then you may ask yourself, `Where is the
fraud? Where is the crime?''' he said.
	   King is charged with nine counts of wire fraud that could bring
him up to 45 years in prison if convicted.
	   The jury was expected to get the case Wednesday.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One day after being blamed by Israel's
president for failing in Mideast peacemaking, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu struck back Tuesday, accusing the president of
siding with the Arabs and Israel's opposition.
	   President Ezer Weizman sent out political shockwaves Monday when
he went on national television and blamed Netanyahu for the
deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and said it
was time to call early elections.
	   Tuesday, Netanyahu did the same, accusing Weizman of breaching
the presidential role by siding with Arab countries and Israel's
political left, in opposition since Netanyahu's narrow election two
years ago.
	   ``The fact is that the President, to my sorrow, took a stand
with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV.
	   Netanyahu said Weizman was also siding with Egypt and the
Palestinians, who have said Netanyahu's policies are hurting
chances for peace.
	   ``The President has strengthened and hardened the Arab
position,'' Netanyahu said in another interview with Israel's
Channel 2 TV.
	   In response, an angry Weizman announced he would hold a news
conference to respond to Netanyahu's comments. His press secretary
Batya Keinan said the conference was scheduled for Wednesday at
8:30am (5:30gmt).

World Cup: Argentina wins 4-3 on penalties after 2-2 tie AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes, trims detail
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Argentina knocked England out of
the World Cup 4-3 on penalties Tuesday to advance to the
quarterfinal after the two teams had tied 2-2 after extra time.
	   David Batty's vital spot kick for England was saved by
Argentina's goalkeeper, Carlos Roa, after Roberto Ayala had
converted for the two-time champion from South America.
	   Sergi Berti, Juan Veron and Marcelo Gallardo also scored from
the penalty spot in the shootout while Alan Shearer, Paul Merson
and Michael Owen replied for England.
	   But Argentina's Hernan Crespo and England's Paul Ince also had
their spot kicks saved.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella, who captained the team to its first World
Cup triumph in 1978. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines.''
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle said his team, who played for almost
75 minutes with 10 men after David Beckham was sent off early in
the second half, were bitterly disappointed.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' he said. ``It's a bitter, bitter
pill to take. Even with 10 men we set up so many set pieces we
could have won it.''
	   In an action-packed game, Gabriel Batistuta and Shearer swapped
penalties in the opening nine minutes, teen-age striker Owen fired
England ahead 2-1 with one of the best goals of any World Cup and
Javier Zanetti curled a left-footed shot into the roof of the net
for the equalizer.
	   And that was all in the first half.
	   The two penalties in the opening nine minutes set the game
alight in an already super-charged atmosphere in the
Geoffroy-Guichard stadium.
	   England goalkeeper David Seaman needlessly brought down Simeone
after a mixup in the defense and Batistuta drove home the
sixth-minute spot kick via the 'keeper's fingertips.
	   Three minutes later it was 1-1 when Paul Scholes released Owen,
who raced into the Argentina area only to be upended by Ayala.
Shearer powered the ball into the roof of the net.
	   With the game bubbling and the dangerously unsegregated fans
already exchanging unpleasantries behind one of the goals, England
took the lead with a wonder goal from Owen.
	   Ince broke up a menacing Argentina move on the edge of his own
area and fed Beckham who was well placed just short of the halfway
line. The Manchester United midfielder found Owen 45 meters from
the goal and the Liverpool teen-ager started his amazing run.
	   He beat Jose Chamot for pace and cut to his right to drift past
Ayala and make for goal. Owen, with only 'keeper Roa to beat, even
had the unmarked Paul Scholes in support but was confident to go it
alone drove the ball home from 12 meters.
	   But Argentina's army of fans were cheering at halftime after
Zanetti made it 2-2. Batistuta pulled the English defense one way
with a decoy run and Veron slipped the ball to his co-midfielder
who curled the ball past Seaman.
	   Although the fans had quietened down behind the goal, there were
more fireworks on the field as Beckham, scorer of a memorable
30-meter free kick against Colombia, was shown the red card in the
opening minute of the second half for a retaliatory kick at Simeone
after he had been flattened by the Argentina midfielder.
	   The Manchester United midfielder, lying face down, kicked
upwards, catching Simeone as he fell. Danish referee Kim Milton
Nielsen showed the yellow card to Simeone and, inevitably, the red
one to Beckham.
	   Making intelligent use of the extra man, Argentina looked
threatening when it attacked the center of the English defense and
a low shot from Carlos Lopez was deflected wide by England defender
Sol Campbell with 'keeper Seaman under pressure.
	   Batistuta was taken off in the 69th minute and replaced by
Crespo, of another Italian club, Parma, while 10-man England sent
on defender Gareth Southgate for the more attack-minded Graeme Le
Saux.
	   Eleven minutes from the end, Sol Campbell headed in a corner and
ran to the England bench to celebrate. While he was away, referee
Nielsen ruled it out for a foul by Shearer and, with Argentina
chasing downfield from a quickly taken free kick, Campbell had to
chase back and join the rest of his under-pressure defenders.
	   With the game in extra time, Chamot met a corner from substitute
Marcelo Gallardo but headed just too highand then Seaman saved at
the foot of his right hand post from substitute Sergio Berti.
	   After Seaman had saved a long-range shot from Veron, Adams
climbed to a free kick from substitute Paul Merson two minutes from
the end of extra time but headed wide.
	   Lineups
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala, Jose
Chamot; Javier Zanetti, Diego Simeone (Sergio Berti, 92nd), Juan
Veron, Matias Almeyda, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Marcelo
Gallardo, 69th), Gabriel Batistuta (Hernan Crespo, 69th).
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton (David Batty, 97th), David Beckham, Paul Ince, Paul
Scholes (Paul Merson, 78th), Graeme Le Saux (Gareth Southgate,
71st); Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.

Orioles prepare to unload pricey free agents AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ U.S. baseball's highest-paid team has been the
season's biggest flop.
	   The Baltimore Orioles are sinking toward last place in the
American League East and showing no sign of making even a modest
run at the wild-card spot.
	   Owner Peter Angelos, conceding that the ``situation is pretty
grim,'' said Tuesday that the Orioles have two weeks to turn things
around before he begins the process of unloading veterans in order
to free up spending money for next season.
	   ``I'm not too optimistic,'' Angelos said. ``If we conclude in
the days ahead that we're not going to make a run at the playoffs,
then we will make the moves necessary to ensure that we are
prepared to win in 1999.''
	   The Orioles traditionally spend this time of year looking for
talent to aid their pennant drive.
	   Barring an unexpected turn of events, Baltimore will likely
spend July unloading several of its 11 pending free agents _
including All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar and former World
Series hero Joe Carter.
	   ``Whether or not we maintain anyone will be decided soon
enough,'' Angelos said. ``If we don't re-sign some of those free
agents, that will give us literally tens of millions of dollars to
correct our pitching problems and some of the deficiencies in
various positions on the field.''
	   Baltimore entered Tuesday night's game against the Florida
Marlins a season-high eight games under .500 and mired in a
six-game losing streak. The Orioles can't do anything about their
injuries _ starting pitchers Jimmy Key and Scott Kamieniecki have
long been on the disabled list _ but they're not going to wait for
everyone to heal, either.
	   In another effort to salvage a season gone bad, manager Ray
Miller shook up the team Tuesday by dropping Brady Anderson and his
.210 batting average to sixth in the lineup and replacing him at
the leadoff spot with Alomar. The Orioles also activated pitcher
Nerio Rodriguez from the disabled list and designated reliever
Terry Mathews for assignment.
	   Although his dlrs 69 million team has been a bust, Angelos will
not abandon his effort to field the best club money can buy. Put it
this way: he's not going to make changes with the next millennium
in mind.
	   ``I predict we'll be contenders next year for the AL East title.
We're certainly not going to stand still,'' he said. ``We are not
going though a long, structured rebuilding program.''

Croatia upsets Romania; Saint-Etienne thankful for no upsets 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with England-Argentina.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In Bordeaux, Croatia got its upset over Romania. In
Saint-Etienne, residents hoped that their match, too, was
remembered for what happened on the field and not in the streets.
	   While Croatia on Tuesday became the first team to reach the
quarterfinals in its World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974,
the people of the central southern city that hosted Argentina and
England's second-round match were just hoping for a quiet night.
	   With about 1,600 police patrolling the city of 250,000, things
were relatively quiet in Saint-Etienne as Argentina outlasted
England 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 extra-time draw.
	   The night before, incidents between English fans and local North
African youths, eager to gain retribution for clashes two weeks ago
in Marseille, resulted in 10 arrests, nine French and one English.
	   On Tuesday, police arrested one English fan, identified by
British police as a ``category C'' hooligan _ the most dangerous
type _ as he disembarked a train. Authorities said the suspect was
subject to expulsion or a quick French court trial.
	   Croatia expelled its Balkan neighbor Romania from the World Cup
on a first-half disputed penalty by Davor Suker, who had to take
the kick twice.
	   Argentine referee Javier Castrilli pointed to the spot after
whistling a foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, who went down with
Aljosa Asanovic as they chased a ball in the penalty area.
	   Suker casually drove a right-footed shot just inside the right
post, but had to take it again after Castrilli waived it off
because at least two Croatians had crossed into the penalty arc
before Suker struck the ball.
	   The Croatian forward, whose Real Madrid teammate from
Yugoslavia, Predrag Mijatovic, missed his penalty Monday night,
lined up again. This time he struck a more confident penalty,
putting it past the stretching Romanian keeper Bogdan Stelea.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''
	   The goal came amid Croatia's control of the game, in which
Stelea was tested several times in the first half alone.
	   ``We have eliminated a team with a great tradition,'' Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Our players achieved a big goal.
We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   The victory put Croatia into a quarterfinal meeting with Germany
on Saturday at Lyon, giving organizers a break after a string of
politically charged matches.
	   So far, the World Cup has had to deal with several games between
political foes: United States-Iran, United States-Yugoslavia and
Argentina-England.
	   Germany was one of the first nations to recognize Croatia's
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, making the match a friendly
non-friendly.
	   About the only sporting animosity between the two is Germany's
2-1 quarterfinal victory in England two years ago, a match which
sent the Germans on the way to their European Championship title.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia. There is no
greater pleasure in sport than beating a friend.''
	   If Croatia were to advance to the semifinals, its trip would not
be unprecedented. Portugal reached the semis in its first try in
1966.
	   Argentina, after celebrating its shootout victory over England,
will be trying to get to the semifinals for the fifth time and the
first since 1990.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella, who captained the team to its first World
Cup triumph in 1978. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines.''
	   Penalties were England's curse for the third time in eight years
in a major championship. After losing to the Germans in the 1990
World Cup semifinals on penalties, it was ousted again by Germany
in the 1996 European Championship semis on home soil by spot kicks.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle said.
``It's a bitter, bitter pill to take.''
	   Penalties played a major part in regular time as well.
	   Gabriel Batistuta and Alan Shearer traded penalties in the first
10 minutes before Michael Owen gave England the lead in the 16th
minute. Javier Zanetti then deadlocked the game just before
halftime.
	   But England's demise was foreshadowed in the second minute of
the second half when midfielder David Beckham was expelled by
Danish referee Kim Nielsen for kicking Argentine counterpart Diego
Simeone after a foul.
	   That forced England to play a man down for the final 73 minutes
and its hopes of avenging its 1986 World Cup semifinal loss to
Argentina, the infamous ``Hand of God'' game, dwindled.
	   The match was a focus of many because of the tensions between
the two countries and teams. Besides Diego Maradona's divine
intervention that lifted Argentina to victory in 1986, the two
fought a war in 1982 over the Falklands Islands just off the coast
of South America.
	   ``It's very sweet to send the English back home,'' Passarella
said. ``Very sweet.''

Police officers suspended after sinking of Haitian boat returned to duty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Three maritime police
officers suspended after the fatal capsizing of a Haitian refugee
boat more than three weeks ago have been returned to duty, Turks
and Caicos police said Tuesday.
	   They said in a written statement that the three officers were
temporarily removed from duty while investigators looked into the
June 8 sinking. The officers were not identified.
	   Investigators have visited Haiti to conduct interviews in
connection with the sinking and are still trying to locate two
yachts in the area at the time, police said.
	   The Haitian sloop capsized about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from
the island of Providenciales after maritime police fired shots.
Police claim they fired warning shots across the boat's bow, while
some of the 70 survivors said police shot at refugees.
	   Officials retrieved six bodies. None had bullet wounds. They are
investigating survivors' claims that about 30 people died.
	   Turks and Caicos authorities have suggested the Haitians
panicked at the shots and rushed to one side of the boat, causing
it to capsize.

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services when council would take up issue. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with meeting adjourning; no indication
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council overruled U.S.
objections Tuesday and heard Arab calls to condemn Israel's
decision to extend municipal services from Jerusalem to Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
	   The daylong open meeting adjourned without a vote on an
Arab-sponsored resolution, which Washington has said would inflame
passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled
Middle East peace process.
	   It wasn't clear when the 15-member council would revisit the
issue again.
	   Mindful of the U.S. position, Britain's ambassador, John Weston,
suggested Tuesday the council might instead adopt a presidential
statement. Such a statement wouldn't carry the weight of
international law as a resolution would.
	   Council sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and the Palestinians could live with such a
presidential statement _ but that the exact language was still up
for negotiation.
	   The Palestinian U.N. representative, Nasser Al-Kidwa, opened the
debate by urging the 15-member council to adopt a resolution that
calls on Israel to stop what it called illegal settlement expansion
because it constitutes ``a major obstacle to peace.''
	   ``We hope that the council will have the sufficient will to
finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee the
rescinding of the plan and to prevent Israel, the occupying power,
from undertaking any further illegal actions in Jerusalem and the
rest of the occupied territories,'' Al-Kidwa said.
	   Israel responded by saying the council had no role in the
dispute.
	   ``This is entirely an internal Israeli matter on the municipal
administrative level rather than on the international level,'' said
Israel's ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   He defended Israel's June 21 decision to put some Jewish
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning, as a move to bolster the
city's economy.
	   ``This is not a new political program affecting the political
status of Jerusalem,'' Gold told the council. ``This is not a plan
to gerrymander district lines in order to affect political
outlines.
	   ``It consists of a municipal blueprint for bolstering the city's
economy and infrastructure.''
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said he welcomed
Israel's assurances that the decision wasn't political in nature,
but he said the United States nevertheless regretted it.
	   ``Logic suggests and reality demands that no action be taken
that would prejudge or prejudice an issue of such sensitivity,'' as
the status of Jerusalem, which he called ``one of the most
sensitive and emotionally charged issues in the Arab-Israeli peace
process.''
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But resorting to a veto is considered
a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent member is
unable to muster majority support.
	   Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved the plan over U.S.
protests.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help restart
the stalled peace talks.

World Cup: Argentina wins 4-3 on penalties after 2-2 draw AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional, recasts
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ This game didn't need hype.
	   Argentina eliminated long-time rival England from the World Cup
on Tuesday by the cruellest means possible _ a penalty shootout _
following a 2-2 draw that had flair, passion and courage at every
twist and turn.
	   Two penalties in the first nine minutes lit the fuse and the
expulsion of David Beckham only seconds into the second half added
to the drama.
	   A memorable goal by England's 18-year-old striker Michael Owen
seemed to put his team in control until Javier Zanetti equalized
just before halftime. And, after Beckham's expulsion, came a
stunning defensive display by the English playing for 75 minutes
with only 10 men.
	   Then came the shootout, which has cursed England twice before in
major championships in the last eight years.
	   Sergio Berti, Juan Veron and Marcelo Gallardo also scored from
the penalty spot while Alan Shearer, Paul Merson and Owen replied
for England. Argentina's Hernan Crespo and England's Paul Ince had
their spot kicks saved.
	   After Roberto Ayala put Argentina ahead on Argentina's last
attempt, David Batty's kick was blocked by Argentina goalkeeper
Carlos Roa.
	   While the Argentina players ran round the field and hugged each
other in celebration, the England team trudged off in despair.
	   England was ousted in a penalty shootout by Germany in the
semifinals of the 1990 World Cup and the '96 European Championship.
It's becoming a familiar feeling to lose that way.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella, who captained the team to its first World
Cup triumph in 1978. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines.
	   ``There's no doubt it was the toughtest second-round match of
the World Cup.''
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle said his players were bitterly
disappointed.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' he said. ``It's a bitter, bitter
pill to take. Even with 10 men we set up so many set pieces we
could have won it.''
	   Quite apart from the political hype built up after the Falklands
War between Britain and Argentina in 1982, Argentina-England soccer
games are written in soccer folklore.
	   Diego Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal in the quarterfinals of
the 1986 World Cup, when he fisted the ball into the net on the way
to a 2-1 victory, still rankles with the English.
	   This game added a new chapter.
	   The two penalties in the opening minutes set the game alight in
an already super-charged atmosphere in the Geoffroy-Guichard
stadium.
	   England goalkeeper David Seaman needlessly brought down Diego
Simeone after a mixup in the defense and Batistuta drove home the
sixth-minute spot kick via the keeper's fingertips.
	   Three minutes later it was 1-1 when Paul Scholes released Owen,
who raced into the Argentina area only to be upended by Ayala.
Shearer powered the ball into the roof of the net.
	   England then took the lead with a wonder goal from Owen.
	   Ince broke up a menacing Argentina move on the edge of his own
area and fed Beckham who was well placed just short of the halfway
line. The Manchester United midfielder found Owen 45 meters from
the goal and the Liverpool teen-ager started his amazing run.
	   He outraced Jose Chamot, who had to back off for fear of a foul
from behind, and cut to his right to drift past Ayala. Owen, with
only Roa to beat, even had the unmarked Paul Scholes in support but
was confident to go it alone drove the ball home from 12 meters.
	   But Argentina's army of fans were cheering at halftime after
Zanetti made it 2-2. Batistuta pulled the English defense one way
with a decoy run and Juan Veron slipped the ball to his
co-midfielder who curled the ball past Seaman.
	   Beckham, who scored a memorable 30-meter free kick against
Colombia, was shown the red card in the opening minute of the
second half for a retaliatory kick at Simeone after he had been
flattened by the Argentina midfielder.
	   The Manchester United midfielder, lying face down, kicked
upwards, catching Simeone as he fell. Danish referee Kim Milton
Nielsen showed the yellow card to Simeone and, inevitably, the red
one to Beckham.
	   Eleven minutes from the end, Sol Campbell headed in a corner and
ran to the England bench to celebrate. While he was away, referee
Nielsen waived it off for a foul by Shearer and, with Argentina
chasing downfield from a quickly taken free kick, Campbell had to
chase back and join the rest of his scrambling defenders.
	   With the game in extra time, Chamot met a corner from substitute
Marcelo Gallardo but headed just too highand then Seaman saved at
the foot of his right hand post from substitute Sergio Berti.
	   After Seaman had saved a long-range shot from Veron, Adams
climbed to a free kick from substitute Paul Merson two minutes from
the end of extra time but headed wide.

Croatia upsets Romania; Saint-Etienne thankful for no upsets 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: CORRECTS to two goals in nine minutes in 24th graf.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In Bordeaux, Croatia got its upset over Romania. In
Saint-Etienne, residents hoped that their match, too, was
remembered for what happened on the field and not in the streets.
	   While Croatia on Tuesday became the first team to reach the
quarterfinals in its World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974,
the people of the central southern city that hosted Argentina and
England's second-round match were just hoping for a quiet night.
	   With about 1,600 police patrolling the city of 250,000, things
were relatively quiet in Saint-Etienne as Argentina outlasted
England 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 extra-time draw.
	   The night before, incidents between English fans and local North
African youths, eager to gain retribution for clashes two weeks ago
in Marseille, resulted in 10 arrests, nine French and one English.
	   On Tuesday, police arrested one English fan, identified by
British police as a ``category C'' hooligan _ the most dangerous
type _ as he disembarked a train. Authorities said the suspect was
subject to expulsion or a quick French court trial.
	   Croatia expelled its Balkan neighbor Romania from the World Cup
on a first-half disputed penalty by Davor Suker, who had to take
the kick twice.
	   Argentine referee Javier Castrilli pointed to the spot after
whistling a foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, who went down with
Aljosa Asanovic as they chased a ball in the penalty area.
	   Suker casually drove a right-footed shot just inside the right
post, but had to take it again after Castrilli waived it off
because at least two Croatians had crossed into the penalty arc
before Suker struck the ball.
	   The Croatian forward, whose Real Madrid teammate from
Yugoslavia, Predrag Mijatovic, missed his penalty Monday night,
lined up again. This time he struck a more confident penalty,
putting it past the stretching Romanian keeper Bogdan Stelea.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''
	   The goal came amid Croatia's control of the game, in which
Stelea was tested several times in the first half alone.
	   ``We have eliminated a team with a great tradition,'' Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Our players achieved a big goal.
We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   The victory put Croatia into a quarterfinal meeting with Germany
on Saturday at Lyon, giving organizers a break after a string of
politically charged matches.
	   So far, the World Cup has had to deal with several games between
political foes: United States-Iran, United States-Yugoslavia and
Argentina-England.
	   Germany was one of the first nations to recognize Croatia's
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, making the match a friendly
non-friendly.
	   About the only sporting animosity between the two is Germany's
2-1 quarterfinal victory in England two years ago, a match which
sent the Germans on the way to their European Championship title.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia. There is no
greater pleasure in sport than beating a friend.''
	   If Croatia were to advance to the semifinals, its trip would not
be unprecedented. Portugal reached the semis in its first try in
1966.
	   Argentina, after celebrating its shootout victory over England,
will be trying to get to the semifinals for the fifth time and the
first since 1990.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella, who captained the team to its first World
Cup triumph in 1978. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines.''
	   Penalties were England's curse for the third time in eight years
in a major championship. After losing to the Germans in the 1990
World Cup semifinals on penalties, it was ousted again by Germany
in the 1996 European Championship semis on home soil by spot kicks.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle said.
``It's a bitter, bitter pill to take.''
	   Penalties played a major part in regular time as well.
	   Gabriel Batistuta and Alan Shearer traded penalties in the first
nine minutes before Michael Owen gave England the lead in the 16th
minute. Javier Zanetti then deadlocked the game just before
halftime.
	   But England's demise was foreshadowed in the second minute of
the second half when midfielder David Beckham was expelled by
Danish referee Kim Nielsen for kicking Argentine counterpart Diego
Simeone after a foul.
	   That forced England to play a man down for the final 73 minutes
and its hopes of avenging its 1986 World Cup semifinal loss to
Argentina, the infamous ``Hand of God'' game, dwindled.
	   The match was a focus of many because of the tensions between
the two countries and teams. Besides Diego Maradona's divine
intervention that lifted Argentina to victory in 1986, the two
fought a war in 1982 over the Falklands Islands just off the coast
of South America.
	   ``It's very sweet to send the English back home,'' Passarella
said. ``Very sweet.''

HIV/AIDS drugs can cause abnormal obesity, high cholesterol With MED-Aids-Drugs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Drugs which have contributed to a dramatic decline
in AIDS death rates could be a cause of extreme shifts in body fat
and diabetes, experts said Tuesday.
	   ``This is a very large problem,'' David Cooper, an Australian
expert in HIV, said at the 12th World Aids Conference in Geneva.
	   Research has shown that users of protease inhibitors, which stop
HIV from multiplying, have suffered unusual fattening. Women
treated with the drugs have experienced breast enlargement.
	   The treatments have also been associated with increased
triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which can lead to greater risk
of heart disease, say specialists.
	   In a study by Krista Dong of the Miriam Hospital in Providence,
Rhode Island, in the United States, and researchers at the Brown
University in Providence, 19 out of 118 women treated with a
protease inhibitor were said to have complained of changes in their
bodies.
	   Some 71 percent of the women are reported to have said their
breasts got bigger, a further 71 percent complained of an enlarged
abdomen, 47 percent said their limbs had wasted and 23 percent said
they were experiencing so-called ``buffalo hump'' _ abnormal fat in
the neck and shoulders.
	   In another study of 110 HIV-positive patients at the Civic
Hospital in Lugano, Switzerland, researcher Enos Bernasconi and
others said they observed higher cholesterol levels in patients
treated with inhibitors against those who received other forms of
treatment.
	   Research carried out by Ravi K. Walli and colleagues at the
University of Munich in Germany showed use of inhibitors in therapy
is linked with the occurrence of irreversible hyperglycemia and
manifest diabetes mellitus.
	   They said further investigation was needed to confirm inhibitors
as a cause of these phenomena.
	   Cooper agreed that more evidence was needed. Experts must look
at whether and how fast patients recovered from abnormalities after
ceasing treatment with inhibitors, he said.
	   Meantime, experts would monitor the situation and try to make
people more aware, said Cooper.
	   Scientists currently consider that the benefits of treatment
with inhibitors outweigh their disadvantages, he said.

Lockout might be key for Bulls AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Go ahead, Michael, take all the time you need to
decide whether you want to keep playing. Scottie Pippen isn't going
anywhere, and neither is Dennis Rodman.
	   The National Basketball Association lockout is on, and that
means no one can do anything. It might be the best news the Chicago
Bulls have heard since all this talk about a Last Dance began.
	   ``From the Bulls' standpoint, if there's any team that it
benefits right now, it's them,'' Mark Bartelstein, who represents
Bulls free agents Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler, said Tuesday. ``In
the short term, it benefits the Bulls a great deal.''
	   With collective bargaining talks at a standstill, the league
announced a lockout Monday. As of midnight Tuesday night, all
trades, free agent signings, negotiations and almost everything
else having to do with the NBA stopped.
	   Had free agency begun Wednesday as planned, the Bulls would have
been in a tough spot. Michael Jordan is still on the fence, trying
to decide whether he wants to play another season or head for the
golf course.
	   And as His Airness goes, so go the Bulls. If Jordan stays,
there's a good chance Pippen and Rodman will, too. Leave, and the
dynasty is over and it's rebuilding time.
	   But there's one slight problem: The rest of the NBA isn't
operating on Jordan time. While Jordan mused, other teams would
have been wooing Pippen with the big contract he's wanted for
years.
	   Pippen, feeling undervalued and unappreciated by management for
years, said repeatedly he'd go elsewhere when he became a free
agent this year. But he softened his stance after the Bulls beat
the Utah Jazz to win their sixth title.
	   Already one of the NBA's 50 greatest players ever, Pippen's
stock rose even higher with his outstanding defense during the
finals.
	   ``It might be difficult for him to turn (an offer) down not
knowing whether Michael was coming back,'' Bartelstein said. ``I
think Scottie would probably make a decision. He couldn't afford to
take that risk.''
	   Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, did not return a phone call
Tuesday from The Associated Press. Neither did David Falk, Jordan's
agent, nor Dwight Manley, Rodman's agent. Bulls general manager
Jerry Krause was unavailable.
	   The Bulls also would have been at a standstill as far as the
rest of the team. Including Jordan, Pippen and Rodman, nine of the
players on Chicago's 12-man playoff roster are free agents. The
only starters under contract next season are Toni Kukoc and Ron
Harper.
	   If Jordan retires, Chicago would have to rebuild primarily
through free agency, at least this season. But until Jordan makes
his decision, his $33 million salary would limit what the Bulls
could do _ and, more important, who they could get _ under the
existing salary cap.

World Cup: Argentines revel in settling old score with English AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Argentines gone wild danced out of
the stadium Tuesday night, already forgotting the English they had
just outlasted in an overtime World Cup grudge match. They were
already looking ahead.
	   ``We're going to be champions,'' clusters of fans chanted in
unison, jumping in jubiliation, ``just like in '86.''
	   Jose Furlano, a stocky man in blue paint who had flown from
Argentina for the match, watched them with a worried look. ``Now,''
he said, ``we've got to think about the final.'' Argentina must win
two more games just to get that far.
	   English supporters, who had desperately wanted victory for a lot
of reasons, filed out in silence. Some seemed dejected. Others
looked ready for an immediate return match in the streets of this
grim industrial town.
	   One group of four simply scowled and muttered racist obscenities
when asked for their reaction.
	   As the game began, there was as much action in the stands as on
the field. Argentines far outnumbered the English because they
could buy tickets allotted to South American teams already
eliminated.
	   And because many English fans bought tickets from scalpers,
groups of them ended up sitting among Argentines. Red-shirted
security men ran up and down stairs separating the bitter opponents
and breaking up tugs-of-war over flags.
	   The English sang ``Rule Britannia'' during the Argentine
national anthem, and loud boos and insults drowned out ``God Save
the Queen.'' Englishmen yelled, ``How did it feel to lose the
war?'' bringing back the Falkland Islands war of 1982.
	   But the breath-catching match kept fans too excited to fight. It
ended in a 2-2 tie, forcing sudden-death overtime. It stayed tie
after that, so the game was decided by a shootout of penalty kicks.
After each scored three, Argentina won with a fourth.
	   For both sides, the game was about more than soccer.
	   Scott Astle wanted England to win because Argentina sank the
frigate HMS Coventry off the Falklands, and his team is Coventry.
Other English soccer fans remembered the despised ``Hand of God''
dealt to them in 1986.
	   And the Argentines were desperate to be champions of the world
for the third time. They particularly wanted to defeat the English,
whose long-since retired coach called them ``animals'' in 1966.
	   On the sun-splashed plaza by City Hall, the match was previewed
with opposing cheers by enthusiastic rival hordes.
	   Argentines, leaping in the air in their sky blue and white
striped shirts, chanted a Spanish word insulting English manhood.
Few of their adversaries understood. Instead, they raised glasses
of beer for an answering chant:
	   ``You'll never touch the Falklands.''
	   Argentina declared war in 1982 when the military government in
Buenos Aires tried to end Britain's presence on the Falklands.
Possession of the small South Atlantic islands remains a sore
point.
	   For the English, the conflict is now mostly folklore. They worry
about the 1986 World Cup when Diego Maradona punched in a goal with
his fist unseen by the referee. Argentina won the match, 2-1, and
two games later won the Cup.
	   When questioned about his goal after the game, Maradona
responded: ``It was the hand of God.''
	   Astle, a student, had more than a sunken frigate in mind.
	   He came to France three weeks ago to follow his team. Robbed the
first day, he has worn the same gamy red shirt and floppy off-white
hat to Marseille, Toulouse, Lens and Saint-Etienne.
	   He got a ticket in England to the Lens game against Colombia,
but this one, like two others, had to be watched on television in a
bar.
	   ``It's worth it,'' he said. ``I'm English.''
	   The lack of tickets and French fears about English fans added to
the highly charged atmosphere. Only 2,000 tickets were available to
Britons, and up to 30,000 of them were expected in Saint-Etienne
for the game. Scalper prices were up to nearly dlrs 800.
	   On Monday night, as the city's temporary alcohol-ban took effect
and fans learned that the big video screen in the park would not
show the match, hundreds of riot police showed up to clear the
area.
	   That triggered insults, scuffles, and wild baton charges in the
city center.
	   Young ethnic North Africans joined in, beating up English
stragglers. Other youths attacked English fans near the stadium and
they burned several cars. Police arrested nine locals and an
Englishman.
	   Until the police appeared, hundreds of Englishmen, Argentines
and Frenchmen had been drinking peacefully together in the balmy
open air. A band played on a makeshift stage, and stands served
beer and hot dogs.
	   The police said they wanted to separate potentially violent
fans, but some people blamed them for overreacting.
	   ``Why did they do that?'' asked Ben Murphy, an English
engineering student, as he watched columns of police in riot gear
tighten cordons around the brightly lighted City Hall square.
	   ``This was ridiculous, just looking for trouble,'' said Mariano
Recalde, a lawyer who flew in from Buenos Aires. ``We're just
trying to get to our hotel, but we're blocked in on all sides. The
cops panic easily here, don't they?''
	   Recalde and his friends laughed when asked if the Argentine fans
would get violent.
	   ``We want to beat them on the field, and badly,'' he said. ``But
that's all.''

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Mike Blowers had a two-run single as
the Oakland Athletics scored four in the eighth to complete their
first winning month in two seasons with a 12-10 victory Tuesday
over the San Diego Padres.
	   With one out in the eighth and the score 8-all, Rickey Henderson
walked and Rafael Bournigal singled off Dan Miceli (7-3). Trevor
Hoffman, who leads the National League in saves, came in and walked
Ben Grieve.
	   Hoffman then walked Matt Stairs to drive in the go-ahead run,
walked Jack Voigt, forcing in another run, and allowed Blowers'
single, which made it 12-8. Hoffman had walked only eight batters
in 36 innings coming into the game.
	   San Diego loaded the bases in the ninth off Bill Taylor (3-5)
and Wally Joyner hit a two-run, two-out single off Mike Fetters,
giving him five RBIs. Then, with a 2-2 count on Mark Sweeney,
pinch-runner Ruben Rivera was picked off first and tagged out at
second base,
	   Joyner's three-run homer against Taylor in the eighth had tied
the game at 8.
	   Jason Giambi drove in three runs and Ben Grieve added his 12th
homer for the A's. Giambi had an RBI double in the second, a
sacrifice fly in the fifth and an RBI single in the seventh. Grieve
hit a solo homer in the third.
	   Miguel Tejada and Mike Macfarlane added RBI singles and Blowers
had a sacrifice fly for the A's, who went 15-13 in June for their
first winning month since going 17-10 in June 1996.

	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Rival groups of fans brawled in
Saint-Etienne's city center and train station into the early
morning hours Wednesday, and local youths broke store windows and
damaged cars after Argentina defeated England in a closely fought
game.
	   A number of fans and locals were arrested, but police couldn't
say how many. No injuries were immediately reported.
	   Police closed off much of the town center, and trams and buses
were diverted to avoid further trouble.
	   In the afternoon, five French youths who were arrested during
disturbances Monday night were sentenced to prison terms of eight
days to one year.
	   And earlier in the day, French police aided by a British
hooligan-spotter arrested an English suspect, in a town tense from
overnight clashes between soccer fans and local youths, officials
said.

One dead in Philippine hotel fire 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least one guest died and another
was critically injured in a fire early Wednesday at a Philippine
hotel frequented by foreigners, officials said.
	   The dead man, Rey Goroste, was a Filipino visiting with his wife
and two daughters from Maui, Hawaii, the officials said. His wife,
Flory, was unconscious and in critical condition, they said.
	   Many of the 34 guests registered at the three-story Camelot
Hotel in Quezon City in metropolitan Manila said they were forced
to escape through windows because of heavy smoke in the hallways.
	   ``I was awakened by a phone call from the hotel,'' said Peter
Ashworth, 39, from Manchester, England. ``But there was very thick
smoke and I couldn't go out the door so I had to go out through the
window.''
	   Others said they heard no fire alarm and received no warning of
the fire.
	   Fire officials said the fire apparently broke out in one room
and were still investigating the cause.
	   A fire at a government-run hospital in Quezon City in May killed
25 people and another at a disco in the city in 1996 killed 162.
Inadequate fire safety equipment was blamed for the high toll in
each case.

Asian crisis to cause some job losses in Australia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis will cause
the loss of more than 4,000 jobs in Australia during the next three
months, an employment survey released Wednesday predicted.
	   The survey of 3,700 Australian organizations by Drake
International said that around 108,000 jobs were expected to be
lost between July 1 and September 30. Four percent, or about 4,200,
of those jobs losses would be directly attributable to the Asian
crisis, Drake said.
	   Worst hit would be the manufacturing, tourism, hospitality and
retail sectors.
	   However, employers expected that overall employment in Australia
will grow by 0.2 percent in the next three months, the survey
found.
	   That would be the fourth consecutive quarter of employment
growth, and compares to a 0.5 percent increase predicted in April.
	   Drake spokesman John Troughton said retrenchments are on the
rise due to the Asian meltdown.
	   ``Until recently, our surveys have revealed that although
companies have been feeling the heat from the currency meltdown in
terms of lost business, few retrenchments have actually occurred.
	   ``However, what we're now seeing are dampened opportunities
being translated into tangible job losses.''
	   He said manufacturers were predicting more job losses as a
result of the influx of competitively priced Asian products into
Australia.
	   Job losses would be offset by jobs growth in the information
technology, telecommunications and business services sectors,
taking in accounting, legal and stockbroking firms.
	   In these areas, computer upgrades, electronic commerce and
website installations were expected to create jobs in the next
decade along with the Internet, digital and pay-TV installations
and an increase in mobile phone usage.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An American F-16 fired on an Iraqi missile
site that had threatened British warplanes, a jolt to U.S.-Iraq
relations after several months of relative calm. ``The message is
very simple: Our forces are going to protect themselves. This is an
act of self-defense,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen, describing
the event to reporters Tuesday at a Pentagon briefing. Cohen said
he hoped the incident was an isolated one and did not presage a
renewal of tensions. But he warned: ``If our aircraft, or those or
our allies are threatened, it will be met with a very vigorous
response.'' In Baghdad, an Iraqi official called the incident
``proof of the aggressiveness of Americans.'' It was the first time
U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi radar site since November 1996.
(US-IRAQ)
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces recaptured a
coal mine that provides power to Kosovo in a withering offensive
against rebels that sent thousands of villagers streaming into the
woods west of the capital. The heavy fighting in recent days has
dimmed chances of a diplomatic settlement of the Kosovo conflict. A
U.S. envoy said Tuesday that the ethnic Albanian rebels have no
clear military chain of command to negotiate a cease-fire with, and
a human rights group accused both sides _ but primarily the Serbs _
of war crimes and other abuses. The Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serb
police took the Belacevac open-pit mine on Tuesday, near the end of
a second day of pulverizing attacks on an area that the ethnic
Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army had taken last week.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ At a showcase of capitalism in communist
China, President Bill Clinton is extolling the benefits of open
markets for the Chinese and opportunities for American businesses
in the world's largest country. ``China is a major economic power
that will grow only larger over time,'' the president said Tuesday.
On Wednesday, he tours Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering
symbol of China's march toward a market economy. In the towering
steel and glass building housing the exchange, the president will
have lunch with young Chinese entrepreneurs. The United States
insists that China open its markets and allow investment
opportunities as a condition for joining the World Trade
Organization, which sets the rules for global trade. But U.S.
officials said they were disappointed by a lack of progress on that
front during talks in Beijing. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Bidding to bring democracy to an
international pariah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held talks
with Nigeria's new leader and was granted permission to meet the
country's most prominent prisoner. Annan spoke privately with Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for
about an hour Tuesday at the military ruler's residence in the
capital, Abuja. A member of Annan's delegation, Ahmad Fawzi, said
they were ``frank discussions.'' ``The secretary-general's main
preoccupation is the acceleration of a credible political
transition program,'' Fawzi said. Annan has been given permission
to see Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of annulled 1993
elections who has been imprisoned since 1995, human rights and
government officials said on condition of anonymity. It was unclear
when the meeting would occur. (NIGERIA)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fresh from his high-profile summit with
President Bill Clinton, Chinese leader Jiang Zemin has arrived in
Hong Kong to celebrate the first anniversary of the territory's
handover. But with Hong Kong now suffering economically,
Wednesday's anniversary ceremonies will be muted compared to the
1997 extravaganza that ended more than a century and a half of
British colonial rule. Military bands and schoolchildren waving
flags greeted Jiang on Tuesday as he stepped from his plane
accompanied by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. Neither
made a statement. About 10 pro-democracy activists demonstrated
Tuesday night outside the hotel where Jiang is staying under tight
security. (HONG KONG-HANDOVER)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A big drop by Disney held back the Dow
industrials, but most stocks rose Tuesday after overcoming some
mild profit-taking on the market's two-week rally. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 45.34 points to 8,952.02 halting a
five-session winning streak that added 286 points to the barometer
of 30 big companies. An early 23-point gain made it the fourth
straight session that the Dow couldn't sustain a move above 9,000.
Even so, the Dow finished out the first half of 1998 with an
impressive gain of 13.2 percent, well beyond what most analysts
expected for the entire year. Most broad-market indicators turned
higher late in the session, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index padding its 10 percent surge of the past two weeks
and pushing this year's gain to 20.7 percent.Disney plunged the
equivalent of 32 Dow points after several top analysts lowered
their profit forecasts and ratings on the entertainment
conglomerate. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Consumer confidence in the economy rose in June
to a new 29-year high, as Americans remained optimistic that the
strong labor market and healthy economic growth will continue in
coming months. But in a separate note of caution, the Federal
Reserve on Tuesday warned banks to be prudent in their lending
practices as a hedge against the chance the economy will slow and
business borrowers will then struggle to make loan payments. The
Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its index of consumer
confidence rose from a revised 136.3 in May to 137.6 in June, a
larger rise than Wall Street analysts had expected. June's gain
pushed the index above the 29-year high of 137.4 set in February.
The last time it was higher was the 137.9 reached in June 1969.
(US-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's governing party agreed Tuesday to allow
``bridge banks'' based on a U.S. model to take over failed
financial institutions, news reports said. Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's party has been studying various proposals for a bridge
bank system to clean up mountains of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
Japan's financial institutions are saddled with 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse in the early
1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and real estate
speculation. Under the proposed system, government officials would

	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. said Tuesday that the cost
of two strikes at key parts plants totaled dlrs 1.18 billion in the
second quarter, exceeding the dlrs 900 million price tag of a
similar walkout in 1996. In a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, GM said its second-quarter earnings would be
reduced by dlrs 1.79 a share after taxes because of a strike-caused
production loss of 227,000 cars and trucks. When GM issues its
second-quarter report July 14, the earnings of the world's largest
automaker should fall well below those of Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. Healy estimates GM's earnings should total about
dlrs 439 million, or 62 cents a share for the three months ended
Tuesday. Other analysts' strike-adjusted estimates issued before
GM's announcement Tuesday ranged as high as dlrs 1 a share. (US-GM

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers predicted Tuesday that many of
the government's anti-crisis economic measures will get preliminary
approval before parliament begins its summer recess on Friday.
Swift passage of the austerity program could help pull Russia out
of its current financial tailspin and would give President Boris
Yeltsin's government some breathing space. It would also give the
International Monetary Fund additional impetus to grant Russia a
new loan and ease fears about the stability of the ruble. He said
he expected most bills will be given final passage in special
sessions of parliament to be held July 15 and 16. Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko was to appear in parliament Wednesday to explain
the government's austerity plan, Seleznyov said. Wednesday's debate
could determine the fate of the ruble, said a spokesman for Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

Eds: Contains items on Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Woody Allen, Mia
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's the battle of the bottles.
	   Calvin Klein says Ralph Lauren's soon-to-be-marketed women's
perfume comes in a bottle that looks just a little too familiar.
	   In papers filed in federal court, Klein claims the upcoming
Romance is identical in appearance to Klein's Eternity. Eternity
comes in a silver-capped rectangular bottle with a collar shaped
like a wedding band. Ditto for Lauren's Romance.
	   Also, the Eternity and Romance bottles contain an inner bottle
shaped like an hourglass that ``emulates the curves of a woman's
body,'' according to the court papers.
	   Klein claims Lauren's bottle is likely to confuse shoppers.
	   Not so, Lauren responded.
	   ``This lawsuit is ill-conceived. The bottles are different. The
packaging is different. The advertising is different,'' the company
said in a statement Tuesday.
	   A court hearing is set for July 20.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Eduard Shevardnadze received a
glittering prize Tuesday _ a newly discovered star.
	   At a ceremony in Tbilisi, the Russian Space Academy gave the
Georgian president a certificate saying that a star in the Big
Dipper constellation had been named in his honor.
	   ``I've never experienced how it feels when a distant star bears
your name,'' Shevardnadze said. ``But now that it has happened, I,
together with my people, will do my best to make the sky clear and
cloudless.''
	   Earlier celestial discoveries have been named for Princess
Diana, pianist Van Cliburn, and actor Peter Ustinov.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Woody Allen is upset that he learned about the
death of Mia Farrow's mother, actress Maureen O'Sullivan, from
reading the newspaper.
	   ``He had a great deal of affection for Maureen,'' said Allen's
spokeswoman, Leslee Dart. Ms. Dart added that the director wasn't
invited to Ms. O'Sullivan's funeral, which was held Monday in
suburban Albany, capital of New York state.
	   Ms. Farrow's close friend and former spokesman, John Springer,
said Allen shouldn't be surprised.
	   Allen and Ms. Farrow, longtime lovers, had a bitter and very
public split in 1992 after she found he was having an affair with
her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. Allen and Ms. Previn were
married last year.
	   ``Maureen was very fond of Woody,'' Springer said. But when Ms.
Farrow felt betrayed, ``Maureen disliked him intensely.''
	   Allen had cast Ms. O'Sullivan, who was 87 when she died June 22,
in his 1985 movie ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' as Ms. Farrow's
mother.
	   Ms. O'Sullivan played Jane in the ``Tarzan'' movies.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Yes, that was George Bush eating pasta and
drinking wine with fashion designer Giorgio Armani the other night.
	   The two Georges were introduced by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger
after the Emporio Armani menswear show Monday.
	   Apparently Schwarzenegger had bumped into the former U.S.
president in the lobby of a Milan hotel where both were staying and
suggested he come along to the show.
	   Bush, who was in town for meetings with Italian business people,
was unable to catch the show but dropped in for the mega-party of
1,500 afterward.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky met an old acquaintance Tuesday _ an American diplomat he
contacted in Moscow when he was accused of treason 22 years ago.
	   Today, Sharansky is Israel's trade minister and diplomat Josef
Presel is the American ambassador to Uzbekistan.
	   ``Finally, after 22 years, I met my friend again,'' Sharansky
said in Tashkent, where he is seeking new trade and investment
opportunities. ``I did not expect this to happen.''
	   Convicted of spying for the United States, he spent nine years
in custody before being freed in an East-West prisoner swap in
1986.
	   Sharansky also thanked Uzbekistan for sheltering 200,000 Jews
who were evacuated from the former Soviet Union during World War
II.
	   ``We'll never forget the role of the Uzbek people in saving Jews
from the territories that were occupied,'' he said.

order of our thoughts. Many complain of the want of memory, when
the defect is in their judgment; and others, by grasping at all,
retain nothing _ Margaret Fuller, American critic and social
reformer (1810-1850).

Taiwanese officials sensitive to Clinton summit; public more relaxed With Clinton-China, Bjt 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In one cartoonist's view, Taiwan is little
more than an afterthought tied to the tail of Air Force One as
President Bill Clinton jets around China. In another, it's the main
course at a U.S.-Chinese state dinner.
	   Taiwan has been watching carefully as the leader of its great
ally visits its great adversary; 21 million Taiwanese know their
future might be riding on what happens.
	   Touchiness about the trip pervades the country's government
halls and newspaper and academic offices. On Taipei's busy streets,
however, the mood is more relaxed.
	   Taiwan bristled Tuesday when Clinton _ restating long-held
policy _ rejected Taiwan's independence or its entry into
organizations such as the United Nations that require its members
to be sovereign states. The Foreign Ministry called his comments
``unnecessary.''
	   ``The United States and Communist China have no right to discuss
Taiwan's affairs,'' said ministry spokesman Roy Wu.
	   Clinton's comments represented the first time the president
himself explicitly spelled out the policy on Taiwan, and some
warned that could severely restrict Taiwan's international
breathing space.
	   Others were less worried.
	   Buddhist monk Wu Hung, dressed in flowing gray robes under a hot
sun, said Taiwan ought to take courage from its own strong economy
and political and religious freedoms, instead of fretting about
what Clinton is up to on the mainland.
	   And taxi driver Tsai Jung-hsing found reaction to Clinton's trip
to be much ado about nothing.
	   ``People have been scaring themselves,'' he said. ``One visit is
no big deal.''
	   Besides, Tsai noted, the last time there was trouble with China
_ in 1996, when China conducted military exercises including firing
missiles into the sea during Taiwan's presidential elections _ the
United States sent aircraft carriers in support.
	   Taiwan divided from China politically in 1949, when Communists
defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists on the mainland and Chiang
moved here. Beijing considers the island a breakaway province, to
be reunited by force if necessary.
	   Even though Washington broke diplomatic relations with Taipei
nearly 20 years ago to establish ties to Beijing, the United States
and Taiwan remain very close in many ways.
	   Thousands of visas are issued weekly for Taiwanese to visit the
United States.
	   Even though Clinton's China visit has been marked by repeated
expressions of good will, the mainland does not share the economic,
cultural, and person-to-person relations that Taiwan has with
Washington.
	   With only a fraction of China's population, Taiwan imports
almost twice as much from the United States.
	   Politically, Taiwan has turned itself in the past decade from
strict authoritarian rule to a model of what Washington espouses:
parliamentary democracy and a capitalist economy.
	   Still, when its closest ally snuggles up to its nemesis, Taiwan
worries it'll get caught in the squeeze.
	   Taiwanese newspapers have published four or more pages daily on
the summit. Television stations broadcast Clinton's appearances
live.
	   The interest went beyond curiosity, with many looking for signs
of reassurance that the United States wouldn't abandon Taiwan, said
Tim Ting, chief consultant for pollster Gallup Taiwan.
	   Pro-independence groups held a sit-in at Washington's de facto
embassy, burned a Chinese flag and marched in protest against any
relinquishing of U.S. support for Taiwan.

Serb forces eye KLA stronghold after taking back mine With Kosovo-Determined Rebels 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After recapturing a regional center
from Kosovo Albanian fighters, Serb forces were positioned
Wednesday to target a guerrilla stronghold that international
officials fear could erupt into major bloodshed.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement of the Kosovo conflict. A U.S. envoy said Tuesday that
the ethnic Albanian rebels have no clear military chain of command
to negotiate a cease-fire with.
	   Along with the Belacevac coal mine region, which was overrun
Tuesday, Serbian media have suggested the other goal of this week's
offensive was to break the 2-week-old standoff at Kijevo.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, the crossroads village has been a flashpoint since the
Kosovo Liberation Army surrounded it earlier this month and cut off
its Serb inhabitants and police. The KLA fighters themselves were
surrounded by Serb police checkpoints.
	   Journalists have been kept out of the blocked-off area, about 30
kilometers (20 miles) south of Belacevac. But both sides still see
it as an important strategic spot in the battle for control of the
road.
	   The steadily worsening conflict threatens to engulf the entire
region in war. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics making up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic was likely to use massive firepower in
an effort to break the KLA's grip on Kosovo, and if he did, ``such
an action would have tragic consequences.''
	   Speaking Tuesday in Oslo, Norway, Holbrooke indicated diplomatic
efforts aimed at producing a cease-fire have taken on more urgency.
	   ``Kosovo is a crisis on the edge of becoming an emergency,'' he
said.
	   A senior U.S. official in Washington acknowledged that the
United States is continuing to hold private talks with leaders of
the political wing of the KLA, who were said to have responded
positively to U.S. conditions for negotiations.
	   Serb forces recaptured Belacevac after two days of nearly
non-stop fighting in the village. The mine is strategically
important because it supplies coal to the nearby Obilic power
plant, which provides electricity for most of Kosovo as well as to
Macedonia and northern Greece during peak summer months.
	   Throughout Tuesday, Serb tanks rolled up to the edge of a ridge
overlooking Belacevac, fired into the village, then rapidly
disappeared. Police snipers, cannons and mortars _ well-camouflaged
in the lush green surrounding hills _ all fired on the KLA-held
area.
	   After a bombardment that lasted for more than 24 hours, Serb
forces finally retook the mine and villages around it after the KLA
fled.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said three Albanians
were killed Monday in fighting around Belacevac. Eight Albanian
militants were killed Tuesday after they attacked a Yugoslav army
border patrol near the southwestern town of Djakovica, the Serbian
Media Center said.
	   Journalists allowed into the mine area with the Serbs saw stray
cattle wandering among burned-out cars and houses. Police seized
several KLA uniforms as well as rocket-propelled grenades and hand
grenades.
	   Dozens of tractors leaving the area towed wagons packed with
villagers, many of whom said they would spend the night in nearby
woods. Several asked foreign reporters about the possibility of
foreign help.
	   ``Have you heard when NATO will come?'' asked 19-year-old Saban
Gadeni, an economics student at the University of Kosovo.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   In a separate report, Amnesty International said civilians have
been displaced, tortured and killed. About 70,000 people have fled
their homes _ about 45,000 to other parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, and another 13,000 to
northern Albania.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again demanded
Tuesday that Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said in Shanghai, China, where she was accompanying
President Bill Clinton on a nine-day state visit.

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs GUYANA: Four hurt in protests 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police fired shotguns at a crowd in
front of Guyana's supreme court Tuesday, injuring 12 people amid
escalating anti-government protests.
	   Witnesses said the shooting occurred after police had broken up
a group of protesters marching on a downtown street. Demonstrators
regrouped in front of the supreme court, where court employees had
gathered because of a bomb threat.
	   Police arrived and began shooting buckshot into the crowd of
protesters and employees.
	   ``We were standing out in the street because of the bomb scare
when these fools started to shoot,'' said Fey Naugton, a court
employee who was hit in left ankle by steel pellets.
	   Among the injured where Paula Sealey, a 28-year-old accounting
assistant for the court, who was struck five places in the the back
and leg. Delon George, 15, was hit in the back and the back of his
head. Melina Kaizer, 24, was shot in the right knee.
 &UR; GUYANA: Civic leaders ask Mandela to help strike a peace
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Two civic leaders are asking a veteran
of racial conflict, South African president Nelson Mandela, to help
ease ethnic tensions in Guyana during a visit to the Caribbean this
week.
	   David Yhann II, president of the Non-Governmental Forum, and Al
Haj Fazeel Ferouz, a well-known Muslim cleric, sent a letter
Tuesday to Mandela asking him to meet with President Janet Jagan
and opposition party leader Desmond Hoyte during a Caribbean
Community meeting in St. Lucia.
	   They urged Mandela to use his ``tremendous moral authority and
impeccable democratic credentials'' to strike a peace between the
two leaders.
	   Violent demonstrations and firebombings have swept through
Georgetown in recent weeks as Guyanese of African descent renewed
protests that Jagan's party rigged the December elections.
	   Jagan's People's Progressive Party is mostly supported by people
of East Indian descent. Guyana's history is marked by friction
between the two ethnic groups.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Economist says Puerto Rican strike costs reach $100
million
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A strike by state telephone workers
has drained as much as $100 million from Puerto Rico's economy, a
figure that could skyrocket with a two-day general strike next
week, a leading economist said Tuesday.
	   Since the strike began June 18, sabotage of phone lines and
service outages have affected banks, Internet and cellular phone
services and other businesses that depend on the government's
Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   That sabotage coupled with revenue losses by the telephone
company and other businesses have reached $100 million, said Santos
Negron, a private economic consultant and former longtime member of
the government's planning board.
	   Puerto Rico's important tourism industry has been hit hard and
telephone company president Carmen Ana Culpeper said her business
is losing $700,000 a day in revenue.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Failed diplomacy, trade threats confront leaders
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Faltering attempts to solve Guyana's
smoldering political crisis and fears that free trade will
overwhelm their tiny economies confront Caribbean leaders at a
summit opening Tuesday.
	   The summit, which runs through Saturday, marks the 25th
anniversary of the 16-member Caribbean Community trade bloc,
encompassing more than 6 million people and a dlrs 30 billion
combined national product. But the celebration has been dampened by
recent riots in Caricom's hometown of Georgetown, Guyana.
	   In Guyana, Caricom leaders failed to broker a truce between
Janet Jagan, elected president Dec. 15, and Desmond Hoyte, a former
president who claims Jagan won through fraud. Both are attending
this week's summit.
	   Caricom agreed to audit the vote to stop post-election rioting
by Hoyte's followers. It also got both sides to agree to draft a
new constitution to replace a system of government that is
paralyzed by racial politics.
 &UR; TURKS AND CAICOS: Suspended police returned to duty
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Three maritime police
officers suspended after the fatal capsizing of a Haitian refugee
boat on June 8 have been returned to duty, Turks and Caicos police
said Tuesday.
	   They said in a written statement that the three officers were
temporarily removed from duty while investigators looked into the
sinking. The officers were not identified.
	   Investigators have visited Haiti to conduct interviews in
connection with the sinking and are still trying to locate two
yachts that were in the area at the time, police said.
	   The Haitian sloop capsized about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from
the island of Providenciales after maritime police fired shots.
Police claim they fired warning shots across the boat's bow, while
some of the 70 survivors said police shot at refugees.
 &UR; SURINAME: Oil company director back on job
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ An oil company executive whose
firing touched off an eight-week strike in Suriname is back on the
job.
	   Eddy Jharap, the managing director of the government-controlled
State Oil Co., began his first full day of work Tuesday after
winning a lawsuit Monday against the Natural Resources Ministry.
	   Jharap had opposed President Jules Wijdenbosch's dlrs 60 million
privatization of the company's Tambaredjo oilfield, and 700 workers
walked off the job to protest his dismissal by natural resources
minister Errol Alibux on May 4. They returned to work on Friday.
	   Judge John von Niesewand ruled that only the board of directors
had the authority to fire Jharap. The government, which is
technically a shareholder in the company, cannot hire or fire, he
said.
	   Von Niesewand also ruled that the company also violated laws
requiring firms to request permission from the Labor Ministry to
fire employees.
 &UR; CUBA: Government complains cattle theft on upswing
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban officials called Thursday for tougher
measures to halt the theft of cattle in a country struggling to
increase supplies of meat and milk.
	   The Communist Party newspaper Granma reported that as of May 15,
cattle theft increased 15 percent over the same period last year
despite official campaigns to crack down on the problem.
	   With meat in short supply, a thriving black market has developed
in beef stolen from state herds.
	   ``The theft and illegal sacrifice of cattle returns anew to
public debate because in spite of all measures it continues to
increase,'' Granma said, according to a version relayed by the
government's Prensa Latina news agency, monitored here.
	   The newspaper said most state farms lack efficient systems to
watch their herds and it reported that in the central province of
Villa Clara, 12 cattle are stolen every day.

World Cup: Danes looking for another upset _ this time against Brazil AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATING from previous cycle with Argentina beating England.
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Denmark is proving to be the upset champion of
world soccer.
	   Gaining a backdoor entrance to the 1992 European Championship
when Yugoslavia was kicked out, the Danes went home with the title,
beating hot favorite Germany in the final.
	   After ousting 1996 Olympic gold medalist Nigeria from World Cup
'98 by a surprising 4-1 score, they now face defending titlist and
four-time world champion Brazil for a place in the semifinals.
	   Another upset? Why not.
	   ``Everybody expects Brazil to win,'' said Danish striker Brian
Laudrup. ``We might be able to do it again. You never know. I think
we showed the whole football world that we can play attractive
football as well.''
	   Brazil-Denmark takes place Friday at Nantes the same day that
host France takes on three-time winner Italy at the Stade de
France.
	   Reigning European champion Germany and the Netherlands have also
made it to the last eight. Germany, a three-time winner, will face
debutant Croatia at Lyon while the Dutch meet Argentina in
Marseille, both on Saturday.
	   The Croatians made it to the quarterfinals at their first
attempt and got there after beating Romania 1-0 Tuesday at Bordeaux
on a disputed, twice-taken penalty by Real Madrid striker Davor
Suker.
	   While the France-Italy quarterfinal could go either way _ the
French with home advantage and the Italians with a wealth of World
Cup experience _ the Danes aren't expected to beat the mighty
Brazilians.
	   But that's their strongest weapon, and they like it that way.
	   They exposed Nigeria's weakest point _ the defense _ and led 2-0
before the Olympic champion's feared strikeforce had barely touched
the ball.
	   Brazil's only weakness happens to be its defense, too. Norway
proved that in a come-from-behind 2-1 victory in Group A and the
Norwegians are no longer in the competition, beaten 1-0 by Italy in
round two.
	   The Italians look more assured as the championship goes on,
while the French struggled to put out the modest Paraguayans.
	   The host needed an extra time goal by defender Laurent Blanc _
the first sudden death or ``golden goal'' in the history of the
World Cup _ to beat the South Americans with a penalty shootout
only six minutes away.
	   Despite scoring nine goals in three Group C games, the French
showed against Paraguay they need a scorer of the quality of
Italy's Christian Vieri or Alessandro Del Piero.
	   The tireless Youri Djorkaeff set up chance after chance but
David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede and Thierry Henry couldn't finish
the job.
	   Italy, with Vieri leading the scorers' list with five goals in
four games, has strength throughout the team. Del Piero is back to
full fitness to partner Vieri, plus the Italians have Roberto
Baggio in reserve.
	   The Germans are nowhere near their best form, but have shown
once again they refuse to be beaten. During the Group F games, they
hit back from 2-0 down to secure a 2-2 tie with Yugoslavia and
overturned Mexico's 1-0 lead with late goals from Juergen Klinsmann
and Oliver Bierhoff to win 2-1 and reach the last eight.
	   Berti Vogts' team also appears to have the easiest route to the
semifinal. Romania has never reached the World Cup semifinals while
Croatia is making its debut.
	   The prospect of facing Argentina looks far tougher for the
Dutch, a World Cup losing finalist in 1974 and '78. The Netherlands
edged Yugoslavia 2-1 on Monday thanks to an injury-time winner by
Edgar Davids.
	   Argentina, a two-time winner which beat the Dutch in the 1978
final, is striving to step out of the shadows of South American
rival Brazil.
	   In Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta, it has one of the
current superstars of international soccer and Ariel Ortega,
wearing the No. 10 shirt made famous by Diego Maradona, is on
course to be one of the stars of the championship.

Japan frets as China basks in limelight of Clinton visit 
</HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ So there he is, ally No. 1, shaking hands with
China's leaders, hailing them for their efforts to ease Asia's
financial crisis, pledging closer ties in the future.
	   As President Bill Clinton swings through China, leaders in Tokyo
are watching from the sidelines and beginning to worry that their
biggest neighbor may be stealing their best friend.
	   And, in the middle of its worst recession since World War II,
Japan needs that friend.
	   China has always weighed heavily on the Japanese mind, but
Clinton's decision not to visit Japan on his way back has generated
a good deal of fretting here.
	   Japanese newspaper editorials have written ominously of ``the
new U.S.-China era'' and ``America and China's new partnership for
the 21st Century.''
	   To make matters worse, Clinton on Tuesday pointedly praised
China's leaders for their role in keeping Asia's financial crisis
from getting out of hand, calling China a ``force of stability.''
	   He then prodded Japan to do more to boost its laggard economy.
	   For Japan, there is more at stake than pride.
	   Experts have long predicted that it could be just a matter of
time before China's steady march toward free-market liberalization
and increased democracy will make the world's most populous nation
the dominant economic power in Asia.
	   To many here, Clinton's overtures toward China are more proof
that the United States and other countries are increasingly eager
to throw in their lot with Asia's awakening giant.
	   ``The Japanese should be worried,'' said Gregory Clark, a
professor of politics at Tokyo's Tama University. ``We could be
back in the 1930s where America had to choose between Japan and
China _ and chose China.''
	   Clark acknowledged that while the United States' foreign policy
in Asia has for decades focused on its ties with Japan, it has been
careful to keep its options open.
	   But now, he said, Washington is ``beginning to play the other
option.''
	   Playing the other option could mean stepping up efforts to turn
China into a major trading partner, a move that would boost China's
economy and help it challenge Japan's pre-eminent position in the
region.
	   Closer U.S.-China ties could also lead China to rely more on the
United States for its infrastructure needs, squeezing out Japanese
companies that have long done business there.
	   Still, not all experts agree Clinton's visit to China
necessarily heralds a significant shift in the Asian balance of
power.
	   Many analysts say that while Japan's international standing is
low now, it will revive as soon as the economy picks up.
	   That economy, they note, still dwarfs that of China, and the
U.S.-Japan military alliance remains crucial to regional stability.
Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.
	   ``Japan is still America's closest ally in terms of security,''
said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg. ``In
terms of the security arrangement, China is no comparison.''
	   Much of the problem Japan is having with Clinton's visit is its
timing.
	   The visit comes as Japan is struggling to come out from under a
tidal wave of international criticism _ much of it from the United
States _ over its fumbled attempts to get out of recession.
	   But Japan also still holds bad memories of the ``Nixon shock,''
when, without prior consultations with Tokyo, President Richard
Nixon made his historic trek to Beijing in 1972.
	   The United States has scrambled to allay fears that Clinton's
overtures to China mean Washington is downgrading its relationship
with Japan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Tokyo this
week to smooth any ruffled feathers, and on Tuesday, America's
ambassador to Japan, Thomas Foley, went out of his way to be
reassuring.
	   ``I am a bit puzzled that warmer U.S.-China ties (are seen by
some to) somehow undermine the U.S.-Japan relationship,'' Foley
said at a press conference Tuesday.

Sampras: tennis lacks riveting rivalries AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; play starts at 1000 GMT
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Imagine the scene: a tattooed,
trash-talking, body-pierced, rainbow-haired dude accepting the
Wimbledon championship trophy on Centre Court.
	   All England Club members would probably choke on their Pimm's,
but Pete Sampras says that's what men's tennis needs to boost its
sagging popularity: a Dennis Rodman.
	   Sampras, on course for his fifth Wimbledon title in six years,
said the game lacks rivalries, personalities and NBA-type
marketing.
	   Referring to his short-lived rivalry with Andre Agassi a few
years ago, he said, ``You definitely need Americans playing well to
have this game be successful in the States.''
	   Sampras also reflected on the success of the 1970s and early
'80s when Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors played each
other in numerous Grand Slam semifinals and finals.
	   ``They were all different personalities and they all hated each
other,'' he said. ``It's great theater. And now, it's sad but true.
That's what the game needs. It needs a little controversy. It need
a Dennis Rodman type of guy.
	   ``You need a hatred, or whatever you want to call it. You need a
rivalry. You need something so that people not following the game
might follow the game.''
	   Sampras, who has been criticized for being ``boring'' and not
doing enough to generate interest in the game, said it's not his
job to make waves.
	   ``I'm obviously worrying about my tennis,'' he said. ``There's
only so much I can do.''
	   So don't expect Sampras to start imitating Rodman.
	   ``I'm pretty normal,'' he said. ``Because you play good tennis,
everyone thinks there's got to be something a little bit quirky
about you, and there really isn't about me. I'm kind of your normal
guy that happens to play good tennis, and that's really it. There's
not a lot to analyze with me.''
	   As Sampras likes to say, his racket has done most of his
talking.
	   He won his first four matches in straight sets, the latest a
6-3, 6-4, 6-4 cakewalk over French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean,
and looks more and more like the overwhelming favorite.
	   ``I feel like I'm playing pretty well at this point,'' he said
going into Wednesday's quarterfinal against Australia's Mark
Philippoussis.
	   Philippoussis, who had been in such a slump three weeks ago that
he considered skipping Wimbledon, has one of the biggest serves in
the game and said he doesn't fear Sampras.
	   ``I'm sure he doesn't want (to play) me also,'' Philippoussis
said. ``I think I could win.''
	   Sampras vs. Philippoussis shaped up as the main slugfest on a
day featuring all men's and women's quarterfinal matches.
	   In women's play, Venus Williams was resuming her bid for her
first Grand Slam title when she faced Jana Novotna, the No. 3 seed
and two-time runnerup.
	   Defending champion Martina Hingis was matched against Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, the French Open champion and No. 5 seed; No. 2
Lindsay Davenport met Nathalie Tauziat, and No. 6 Monica Seles
faced Natasha Zvereva.
	   In men's matches, No. 3 seed Petr Korda was pitted against Tim
Henman, bidding to become the first British man to reach the
semifinals since 1973 and the first homegrown men's champion since
1936.
	   The 1996 champ, Richard Krajicek, faced little-known Davide
Sanguinetti, a 65th-ranked Italian. Krajicek aggravated an injury
to his right knee in his fourth-round win over Wayne Ferreira and
said he wasn't sure whether he would be fully fit.
	   In the other men's quarterfinal, former two-time finalist Goran
Ivanisevic was up against Jan Siemerink.
	   ``I'm playing maybe the best tennis I've ever played here,''
said the 14th-seeded Croatian, who had won just one match in his
five previous Grand Slam events. ``Maybe this is the breakthrough,
Maybe this is the Grand Slam. After five poor ones, there has to
come one good one.''

Venus Williams takes her notes with her AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams used to come to a match
with a long list of things to remember.
	   The list is shorter nowadays.
	   ``I think my notes have gotten to be less and less since the
U.S. Open,'' said Williams, a Wimbledon quarterfinalist this year
after losing in the first round in her debut 12 months ago. ``I
don't have to write down as many things.''
	   She said she came noteless to Tuesday's match. But it didn't
matter as the 18-year-old American beat Spain's Virginia
Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1.
	   Williams typically jots the reminders on a slip of paper and
then sneaks a look on changeovers. ``Then I put a line of a song on
top,'' she said. ``That makes you relax. I love the Jackson Five.''
	   ``For me, on the grass, I'm a tall person. I have to make sure I
stay down. And you have to have correct preperation, so things like
that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DENNIS RODNEY, MBA? &LR;  The NBA and Dennis Rodman may be known by
every sports fan in the United States. But that's not the case in
England. At least not at the stuffy All England Club.
	   In Pete Sampras' interview Tuesday, he talked about the
marketing success of the NBA and also made reference to Rodman, the
Chicago Bulls' forward who wears dyed hair, tattoos and is body
pierced all over.
	   The stenographer transcribed Rodman as ``Dennis Rodney'' and the
NBA as ``MBA.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GORAN'S TATTOO: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic _ no Dennis Rodman but one of
tennis' free spirits _ has a new tattoo. He's wearing a cross,
shark and rose on his shoulder. What's it mean?
	   ``A cross is a cross. A rose _ like love _ and shark. It's a
pretty tough animal,'' said the Croatian quarterfinalist. ``It hurt
a lot. I didn't know it was going to hurt so much when I got it,
but now it's OK.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DAVIDE, WHO: &LR;  Davide Sanguinetti, who had never played a grass
court tournament before, was to face former champion Richard
Krajicek for a place in the Wimbledon semifinals after beating
Spain's Francisco Clavet in three sets.
	   ``I'm surprised,'' said 25-year-old Sanguinetti. ``I didn't know
how I would respond to grass. But as soon as I came here and
started to practice I felt really good.''
	   Sanguinetti is moving up in the rankings, and his place in the
Wimbledon quarterfinals will carry him higher than at any time in
his career. Beginning the year ranked 92, a march to the final of
the tournament in Coral Springs, Fla. in May helped boost him to a
current high of 65.
	   ``I have flat shots, and the grass is like soap,'' said
Sanguinetti, who studied for two years at UCLA. ``It's slippery and
they have a lot of trouble putting their shots on the other side
(of the net), especially my serve.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DON BUDGE: &LR;  American Don Budge, who won all four Grand Slams in
1938, was presented Tuesday with a Waterford glass vase to
commemorate the occasion by the Duke of Kent. ``Presented to Donald
Budge in celebration of 60 years since winning his first Grand Slam
title,'' was the inscription.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO. 1? &LR;  Marcelo Rios, the surly Chilean who went out in the
first round, could still claim the top spot on next week's ATP Tour
rankings. Rios will move into the No. 1 spot if neither Pete
Sampras no Petr Korda reaches the Sunday singles final. Sampras
will hold on to No. 1 if he beats Mark Philippoussis and Petr Korda
en route to the final. If he gets to the final without beating
those two, he must win the final to stay No. 1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Mark Philippoussis _ know as ``Scud'' for his
powerful serve _ doesn't mind facing Pete Sampras in the
quarterfinals. Just the opposite. ``I'm sure he doesn't want me,
also, to be quite honest.''
	   The headline in the tabloid Sun newspaper after Serena Williams
retired from her match Monday with a minor calf injury: ``Surrender
Williams.''
	   If Venus and Serena Williams ever make the Wimbledon final
together, they won't be the first sisters to do it. Maud and Lilian
Watson played for the title in 1884, the first year women were
allowed to compete. Serving underhand _ as all women did then _
Maud took the title.
	   Martina Hingis on Tamarine Tanasugarn hitting so many winning
shots down the line in Tuesday's fourth-round match won by Hingis.
``She could go play in a casino today, or something.''
	   Jan Novotna on the cocky ways of Serena and Venus Williams. ``I
guess that's the way the young American kids are brought up
nowadays.''
	   French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario on why she's
started slowly in her matches at Wimbledon. ``I am Spanish. I'm a
slow starter. The later I play the better it is.''

World Cup: Croatia beats Romania 1-0, meets Germany in quarters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ The little young kid beat the aging
warriors.
	   In its seventh year of existence, Croatia is in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup after a 1-0 victory over Romania, a
huge triumph for a nation trying to build some national pride and
international respect.
	   ``Never has a country as small as Croatia produced such a result
as we did today,'' Croatia coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``We have
eliminated a team with a great tradition. Our players achieved a
big goal. We're happy, happier, the happiest.''
	   For Romania, the defeat marked the end of an era. Playmaker
Gheorghe Hagi is retiring from international soccer, and no amount
of yellow-dyed hair sported by any of the Romanians could hide the
fact that the over-30 stars left from the team that made the
quarterfinals four years ago were playing on borrowed days.
	   Even coach Anghel Iordanescu is leaving. He has signed a
two-year, dlrs 900,000 contract to coach Greece's national team.
	   ``Croatia deserved to win,'' Iordanescu said. ``They played with
more cohesion throughout and had more scoring chances. Romania's
quality of play was quite low.''
	   Davor Suker's penalty kick in first-half injury time decided the
game, although it wasn't without dispute. Argentine referee Javier
Castrilli called the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, whose legs
became entangled with those of Asanovic as they chased Dario
Simic's pass in the penalty area.
	   ``The penalty was imaginary,'' Romanian defender Dan Petrescu
said. ``Or if the referee wanted to give a penalty on that play, we
should have gotten at least one, if not two.''
	   But Petrescu was the exception. Most of his teammates conceded
that Croatia dominated the game and should have won, regardless of
the call.
	   ``Only the (Romanian) team can be blamed for this defeat. This
was my last game for the national team,'' Hagi said. ``As for the
referee, we did not lose the match because of him. He was strict
but he did not mess about.''
	   Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea, the only starter not to dye
his hair after Romania clinched its second-round berth, said the
result was ``just.''
	   ``They could gave scored even more goals,'' he said.
	   The Croats next face European champion Germany on Saturday at
Lyon. The two teams have already met once in the quarterfinals of a
major tournament _ the Germans won 2-1 en route to capturing the
1996 European Championship. Germany was also one of the first
countries to recognize Croatia's independence in 1991.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia, but as everyone
knows, there is nothing sweeter than beating your friends.''
	   The Croats played without key central defender Zvonimir Soldo,
who was suspended after receiving two yellow cards in the first
round. His replacement, Igor Stimac of Derby County, drew praise
for his performance.
	   ``I want to congratulate Stimac, who did a fantastic job in
replacing Soldo,'' Blazevic said. ``My defense weathered the storm
well.''
	   The Croatians kept Stelea, who plays in Spain with Salamanca,
busy from the opening whistle. The keeper denied Suker from close
range, leaped to push away Goran Vlaovic's long drive and made a
reflex save on Aljosa Asanovic's shot _ all in the first 15
minutes.
	   Suker's third goal of the tournament was the highlight, although
he needed to kick the penalty twice to make it count. His first try
was waived off by Castrilli of Argentina after Croatian players
encroached into the penalty arc. His second attempt found the same
spot _ just inside the right post.
	   ``The second penalty was really tough for me,'' Suker said. ``My
heart was beating.''

World Cup: With Romanians, the most crazy hair is out of the Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the battle between the ruthless razor and the
kooky coifs at the World Cup, it is no contest.
	   With the dyed yellow hair of the Romanians, out went the
majority of crazy hair. Razorheads rule.
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella must be smiling.
	   At the origin of the fight between the disciplinarian coach and
the great Real Madrid midfielder Redondo is a quarrel over whether
the player should cut his long manes to fit in the team.
	   He refused and things got worse from there. ``It hurts not to be
at the World Cup,'' said Redondo. Especially looking at the hairdos
that have made it. In the meantime, Passarella must have having a
great time looking at the shaven face of midfielder Juan Sebastian
Veron.
	   Carlos Valderrama's hairball was looking as yellow and out of
order as ever, but the Colombian veteran playmaker was only a
shadow of his former self as the team crashed out in the first
round.
	   Taribo West had his green beads going every which way as the
Nigerians won their first two games in spectacular style. Two
losses later, the beads are only pointing one direction _ back
home. So are the Jamaican dreadlocks, even though they treated the
World Cup to one victory and loads of fun.
	   Luis Hernandez kept Mexico in the World Cup with four goals as
long as possible with his long dyed manes. But when he had a chance
to deliver a fatal blow against Germany, the striking striker
missed the easiest of tap-ins.
	   Good looks and blond hair, he's Mexico bound. That hair, though,
will long remain a World Cup memory. ``It shows my personality and
it feels good against the wind,'' he said. ``And if I can dye it a
little, why not?''
	   The Romanians dyed their hair a shocking yellow after winning
the first two games and qualifying for the second round. It hasn't
done much good. A draw against lowly Tunisia was followed by
Tuesday's second-round loss against Croatia.
	   Little wonder the best man on their team was goalkeeper Bogdan
Stelea, who is as bald as a billiard ball.
	   He is not the only shaven goalkeeper. France's Fabien Barthez
has a shiny top that is quickly becoming part of France's World Cup
cult, especially since it keeps getting kissed by central defender
Laurent Blanc.
	   ``It's our bit of superstition,'' Blanc said after he scored
Sunday's ``golden goal'' in the 1-0 thriller against Paraguay.
	   The bald shave, however, has it chief backer in superstar
Ronaldo and his left back teammate Roberto Carlos. These people are
going on.
	   That's the bandwagon France's 20-year-old David Trezeguet also
jumped on. To everybody's surprise, he shaved for Sunday's match
against Paraguay, and lo-and-behold, from whose head did that
assist to Blanc come?
	   ``It was a personal decision,'' he said about the shave, only
increasing the mystique.

	   PARIS (AP) _ First it was Batigol, now it's Batibaby.
	   Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta has become a father for the
third time. Joaquin Batistuta was born in Florence, Italy, on
Monday, the eve of Argentina's second-round victory over England on
Tuesday night.
	   Batistuta and wife Irina already have two sons, Thiago and
Lucas.
	   Argentina's star striker said fatherhood would not distract his
game.
	   ``The best thing that could happen now would be to offer Joaquin
the deciding goal against England,'' Batistuta said.
	   Batistuta didn't get the winning goal, but he did score on a
penalty kick in the first half.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazil's World Cup stars are the best-paid soccer
players in the world.
	   Brazilians held the top four spots in rankings compiled by
BusinessAge. The magazine tallied salaries, sponsorships,
endorsement offers, bonuses and investments to come up with its
numbers.
	   Striker Ronaldo was No. 1 with an estimated annual income of
dlrs 34.25 million. He was followed by teammates Denilson (dlrs
31.25 million), Rivaldo (dlrs 29.75 million) and Roberto Carlos
(dlrs 26.5 million).
	   The top non-Brazilian was Italy's Alessandro Del Piero with dlrs
25.5 million.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LA TURBIE, Netherlands (AP) _ A foot injury could force right
back Michael Reiziger to miss the Netherlands' World Cup
quarterfinal against Argentina on Saturday.
	   Reiziger's right foot, hurt in Monday's 2-1 second-round victory
over Yugoslavia, is badly bruised and swollen but not broken, Dutch
coach Guus Hiddink said Tuesday.
	   The Barcelona right back was receiving treatment while on a
brief visit to his home for what Hiddink described as ``personal
reasons.'' He would not elaborate.
	   Reiziger was expected to rejoin the team Wednesday. ``We will
have to see how the injury responds to treatment,'' team spokesman
Rob de Leede said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Four years after the World Cup was played in the
United States, half of Americans didn't even realize it's a soccer
tournament.
	   Just 52 percent of adults in the United States knew the World
Cup is a soccer competition and only 25 percent were aware it is
being played in France, according to a survey released Tuesday by
Lou Harris and Associates.
	   Just 19 percent of Americans have watched a World Cup game,
according to the survey. Of those, 24 percent said they enjoyed the
telecasts a great deal, 31 percent said they enjoyed them quite a
lot and 45 percent said not at all.
	   The poll was conducted from June 17-22 among 1,000 adults and
has an error margin of 3 percent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ What kind of soccer fans don't leave the stadium
littered with trash after a game?
	   Answer? The Japanese and Koreans, whose good manners have been a
welcome surprise to World Cup organizers.
	   ``The sector occupied by the Japanese and Korean fans at the end
of the game is actually cleaner than when they went in,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said Tuesday.
	   Cooper said Japanese fans take blue garbage bags with them,
which they wave during the game. After the final whistle, they fill
them up with their empty cans and other trash and carry them out.
	   Cooper said something like this should be introduced in England,
although he suggested the English fans will probably dump the full
garbage bags in somebody else's backyard on the way home.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police fired shotguns at a crowd in
front of Guyana's Supreme Court on Tuesday, injuring 12 people amid
escalating anti-government protests.
	   Witnesses said the shooting occurred after police broke up a
group of protesters marching on a downtown street. Demonstrators
regrouped in front of the Supreme Court, where court employees
gathered because of a bomb threat.
	   Police arrived and began shooting buckshot into the crowd of
protesters and employees.
	   ``We were standing out in the street because of the bomb scare
when these fools started to shoot,'' said Fey Naugton, a court
employee hit in left ankle by steel pellets.
	   Paula Sealey, a 28-year-old accounting assistant for the court,
was struck five places in the the back and leg. Delon George, 15,
who said he was walking home in front of the court, was hit in the
back and the back of his head. Another bystander, 24-year-old
Melina Kaizer, was shot in the right knee.
	   Police quickly took the injured to hospitals.
	   Police and opposition demonstrators have clashed repeatedly in
recent weeks during protests against the government of President
Janet Jagan, which is backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian
descent.
	   Former President Desmond Hoyte's opposition party, backed by
Guyanese of African descent, claim Jagan's party used fraud to win
Dec. 15 elections.
	   Protesters firebombed the labor and finance ministries last week
and planted an explosive in police headquarters. They also attacked
journalists, including a photographer and reporter from the
state-owned Guyana Chronicle.
	   On Tuesday, crowds surrounded four journalists and threatened
them.
	   The Chronicle announced it was suspending coverage of the
demonstrations to protect its employees.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England hates the penalty shootout. English fans
really hate the penalty shootout.
	   For the third time in eight years at a major tournament,
soccer's founding nation has fallen victim to a newfangled quirk of
the game. The seemingly random arrow of five-kicks-a-side, used to
bring an end to endless ties, pointed the other way once again.
	   To make it worse, the opponent was longtime rival and political
foe Argentina, which beat England in the Diego Maradona ``Hand of
God'' game 12 years ago.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle said
after Tuesday's loss that sent the Argentines to a quarterfinal
match against the Netherlands. ``It's a bitter, bitter pill to
take. ... It's a very difficult way to go out of the tournament.''
	   As English's notorious fans with tickets filed out of
Saint-Etienne's Stade Geoffrey Guichard and those without shuffled
out of the city's bars, police and citizens were on tenterhooks
wondering how the members of the hooligan brigade would take out
their frustrations.
	   The night passed in relative peace. There were a few brawls
involving England and Argentine fans, and local youths broke store
windows and damaged cars, but it was nothing like the mad violence
that surrounded England's match with Tunisia two weeks ago. If
anything, the fans walking out of the stadium in Saint-Etienne
seemed to depressed to rumble.
	   ``Penalties, sad. Penalties, sad,'' muttered one fan, shaking
the shaven head on which he had painted huge red intersecting
stripes to represent his country's flag. ``The best team went
out.''
	   Penalties were also England's curse in the 1990 World Cup
semifinals and in the 1996 European Championship semis. Both times,
the Germans won the shootouts _ and then went on to win both
titles.
	   The Argentines, suddenly unabashed enthusiasts of the spot-kick
roulette wheel, would like to follow the same trail.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines. ... It's very sweet to send the English back home. Very
sweet.''
	   Argentina's victory completed the quarterfinal pairings. The
Argentines will play the Dutch at Marseille on Saturday. Croatia,
which defeated Yugoslavia 1-0 in Tuesday's other game, will face
Germany in Lyon, also Saturday.
	   Friday's games are Italy-France at Saint-Denis and
Brazil-Denmark at Nantes. Wednesday and Thursday are the first off
days since the tournament began June 10.
	   At Saint-Etienne, Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa made the stop
on David Batty's penalty kick to win the shootout 4-3 after 120
minutes of gripping action left the score 2-2.
	   There were three goals, including two penalties, in the first 16
minutes. England played the last 75 minutes with only 10 men after
David Beckham was ejected for kicking Diego Simeone in retaliation.
	   ``There's no doubt it was the toughest second-round match of the
World Cup,'' Passarella said.
	   Of course, any winning coach will say that, including Croatia's
Miroslav Blazevic, who expressed superlative glee after leading his
seven-year-old nation into the final eight.
	   ``Never has a country as small as Croatia produced such a result
as we did today,'' Blazevic said. ``We have eliminated a team with
a great tradition. Our players achieved a big goal. We're happy,
happier, the happiest.''
	   Croatia is the first country to make the quarterfinals in its
World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974.
	   The lone goal in the victory was Davor Suker's penalty kick in
first-half injury time. Argentine referee Javier Castrilli called
the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, whose legs became entangled
with those of Aljosa Asanovic as they chased the ball in the
penalty area.
	   ``The penalty was imaginary,'' Romanian defender Dan Petrescu
said. ``Or if the referee wanted to give a penalty on that play, we
should have gotten at least one, if not two.''
	   In a tournament in which sport and politics are hopelessly
intertwined, Croatia's match with Germany will be a friendly
non-friendly. Germany was one of the first countries to recognize
the Balkan nation's independence in 1991.
	   However, two teams have already met once in the quarterfinals of
a major tournament _ the Germans won 2-1 en route to capturing the
1996 European Championship.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia, but as everyone
knows, there is nothing sweeter than beating your friends.''

Report: Japan to enact residential, income tax cuts next year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has decided
to enact permanent cuts in residential and income taxes in 1999 to
boost the country's sluggish economy, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may announce the cuts ahead of
elections to the upper house of Parliament on July 12, reported the
Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily.
	   The cuts, which would replace a special tax cut of two trillion
yen (dlrs 14.5 billion) now planned to take effect in 1999, will be
between two trillion yen and four trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in
scale, the Yomiuri reported.
	   According to the newspaper, Japanese government officials and
leading members of the LDP told U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers of the permanent tax cut plans when he visited
Japan in mid-June.
	   At the latest, Hashimoto will formally announce the cuts before
his scheduled meeting on July 22 with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in Washington, the Yomiuri reported.

Church asks Salvadoran prosecutors to reopen case of killing of nuns 
</HEADLINE>
By EDITH BELTRAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The Roman Catholic Church says
it has asked prosecutors to reopen their investigation into the
1980 killings of three U.S. nuns and a lay worker in an effort to
identify the mastermind.
	   But the request appears to have little likelihood of being
granted. The government announced June 4 that it couldn't reopen
the case because the 10-year statute of limitations on murder had
expired.
	   A judge was expected to rule this week on prosecutors' motion to
block the release of three of the five former national guardsmen
convicted in the killings. The judge ruled last week that the three
qualified for early release from the 30-year sentences under a new
law intended to ease prison overcrowding.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and
lay worker Jean Donovan were kidnapped, raped and killed Dec. 2,
1980. Military-backed death squads had suspected them of
sympathizing with leftist guerrillas fighting the government.
	   Church leaders and victims' relatives have argued that higher
officials were behind the killings. Some of the former guardsmen
have said they were acting on orders of superiors, whom they
haven't identified.
	   In the request filed Friday, the archbishop's office said the
case shouldn't have been closed because the killings were a crime
against humanity.
	   ``The truth and justice have not been completely discovered and
the search for it has been plagued by deficiency and obstacles,''
it said.

Key leader of Mexican kidnap gang captured, wounded 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police have captured a man accused of being a
key member of a kidnap gang known for slicing off victims' ears,
the federal attorney general's office announced.
	   Aurelio Arizmendi is the younger brother _ and by some accounts
chief partner _ of one of Mexico's most wanted fugitives, Daniel
Arizmendi, who has been linked by dozens of kidnappings in the
Mexico City area.
	   The attorney general's office said Tuesday that Arizmendi was
shot as he tried to flee and was taken to a hospital for emergency
care. He was then transferred to the central military hospital for
further treatment.
	   Mexican broadcasters reported heavy security around the
hospitals and said the arrest apparently occurred during a police
raid in southern Mexico City.
	   Newspapers have branded Arizmendi's gang the ``earloppers'' for
their practice of sending the ears of kidnap victims to relatives
to encourage ransom payments. The practice made them one of the
most feared of many kidnap rings plaguing Mexico in recent years.
	   Police throughout the country have been hunting for the
Arizmendi brothers since they evaded a May 21 raid on safehouses
south of Mexico City, where Daniel Arizmendi's wife, son and
daughter were captured.
	   Federal and state officials say they believe Arizmendi's gang
paid off dozens of policemen, prosecutors or even judges for
protection. A scandal over alleged police cooperation with
kidnappers toppled the governor of Morelos state, where Arizmendi
operated.

By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A Sao Paulo state court on Tuesday
convicted six leaders of the Landless Rural Workers Movement on
charges of organizing mob action, Globo television reported.
	   The six were charged with organizing a series of squatter
invasions in Pontal do Parnapanema region in the far west of Sao
Paulo state in January 1996.
	   Among those convicted was Jose Rainha Jr., one of the movement's
most charismatic leaders, and his wife Diolinda Alves de Souza.
	   All six were sentenced to two years in prison, but the judge
suspended the sentence. The six will, however, lose their status as
first offenders.
	   In Brazil, first offenders may be paroled after serving only a
sixth of their sentences. The sentences may still be overturned on
appeal.
	   The movement has gained national attention by promoting
large-scale invasions of farms that it considers unproductive in an
effort to pressure the government to speed its land reform program.
	   The skewed distribution of land is at the root of rural violence
in Brazil, where 88 percent of the land belongs to 20 percent of
the people. The poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent of the land.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Security forces searched remote stretches
of northern Guatemala on Tuesday for kidnappers who held four U.S.
missionaries and eight Guatemalan workers hostage for several
hours.
	   The four Americans, members of an evangelical group called Nueva
Vida, or New Life, and the eight Guatemalan workers were freed
Monday evening after the kidnappers clashed with soldiers and
police along the Usumacinta River near the Mexican border.
	   The Americans were identified as Barbara Stolfzfus, 57; Anita
Stolfzfus, 27; Jane Glick, 27; and Otto Glick, 19. Their hometowns
were unknown.
	   Police said the victims were in good condition and returned to
their ranch near Sayaxche in Guatemala's northern Peten region.
Telephone communication to the remote ranch was impossible. The
United States Embassy said it had no information on the kidnapping.
	   The 12 were kidnapped from the ranch Monday by at least four
armed men. Police said the kidnappers initially released one
hostage who told authorities that a ransom of 2 million quetzales
(dlrs 334,000) was demanded.
	   It was unclear how authorities found the kidnappers. Authorities
found blood at the sight of the gunbattle, suggesting one kidnapper
was wounded.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The number of murders in this city
dropped to the lowest rate of the year thanks to the World Cup,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Thirty-two people were killed in this city of 16 million over
the weekend, nearly half the normal murder rate, police spokesman
Benedito Domingos Mariano said.
	   Police said Brazil playing Chile last Saturday kept people off
the streets and out of trouble.
	   ``There were two hours when the population were out of the way
in their homes watching television,'' said Mariano. There was a
similar decline in violence when Brazil played Scotland in the
World Cup's opening game.
	   There are an average of 9,000 murders a year in Sao Paulo.

Argentine celebrations end on sour note with rock-throwing 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Celebrations of Argentina's World
Cup second-round victory over England collapsed Tuesday night into
rock-throwing by rowdy youths whom police dispersed with tear gas
and a water cannon.
	   Authorities said at least 20 people were injured in the
distrubances that lasted more than an hour around the soaring
Obelisk, a Buenos Aires monument that serves as a rallying point
for fans.
	   The violence tainted what had been a largely peaceful outpouring
by thousands of Argentines that paralyzed rush hour traffic in the
capital after England was knocked out of the World Cup 4-3 on
penalties.
	   The violence began about two hours after the game finished, well
after thousands of celebrants had left the area around the Obelisk.
	   ``People who had been here since the beginning of the game were
drunk,'' complained one bystander, Ernesto Molina, 22, leaving the
scene. ``They began to throw rocks and fight among themselves.''
	   Television news coverage showed youths shattering windows in a
television van and trying to wrench open the doors as police moved
in.
	   Police had no immediate reports on arrests but at least two
youths could be seen being led away by police amid flying bottles,
trash cans and metal bars hurled from a moving crowd.
	   At least two police could be seen stumbling away, one holding
his head and the other limping. One man wearing an Argentine
blue-and-white jersey was seen walking away with a bloodied head.
	   Marcelo Muro, apokesman for the municipal medical service known
as SAME, said 14 injuries had been counted, but he had no
information on their severity.
	   Hundreds of police in orange vests converged on the plaza as a
truck with a water cannon whirled around the streets, shooting
streams of water on fleeing youths. But many youths remained,
taunting police amid the beat of drums and some television cameras
nearby caught one group of youths trying to pry open the metal
grates of a downtown shop.
	   Some dazed celebrants seemed to have been caught up in the
disturbances, including a mother carying a child in her arms who
could be seen crying as she fled.
	   Earlier, the Argentines reveled in their victory by dancing in
the streets amid showers of confetti and shouts of
``Ar-gen-tin-a!''
	   One young man hung precariously out a window at the top of the
spire, waving the Argentine flag. Others leaned from bus windows,
shouting and screaming.
	   Just minutes before the victory, Buenos Aires had appeared to be
a virtual ghost town _ with electronics shops, men's clothing
stores and even a womens' dress shop idled for the 4 p.m. kickoff.
	   Tens of thousands took part in nighttime celebrations in the
capital as similar scenes played out across the country: people
poured into streets, doused each other with beer and threw toilet
paper over trees.
	   This time, Argentina didn't need Diego Maradona or the ``Hand of
God'' to beat England. It required a shootout, however, after a 2-2
draw to get to the quarterfinals.
	   It was another bitter defeat for England, which played valiantly
after David Beckham was ejected two minutes into the second half.
	   The match was closely watched by many, inside and out of the two
countries involved, mainly because of Argentina's 1986 quarterfinal
victory on Maradona's punched-in goal and due to the war over the
Falklands Islands in 1982.
	   That year the former military government in Buenos Aires tried
to end Britain's presence on the Falklands, known in Argentina as
the Malvinas. Britain's possession of the small South Atlantic
sheep-raising islands remains a sore point with Argentina.
	   ``Because of the problems we've had in the past, this was
important victory,'' said Juan Carlos Riquelme, a doorman who
cheered the victory as he watched on a small TV set.
	   At The Shamrock pub, some 25 English fans endured the
nail-biting, chain-smoking drama played out on a big screen. They
were far outnumbered by Argentines.
	   The English fans at The Shamrock made a quick exit amid
Argentine cheers. For some it was more than a soccer match. One
Argentine TV station briefly broadcast the headline: ``The Malvinas
are Argentine''
	   ``I'm disappointed with the outcome. The lads did the best they
could but it's not the first time we've lost that way to
Argentina,'' said David Deadman, 26, of Deal, England.
	   Wearing an England jersey, he held back tears as he walked away.

Princess Diana's family home opens for visitors to see her grave site

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ School girl letters. The
high-fashion outfits of a world-famous princess. The stunning silk
dress she wore on the first-day of an ill-fated royal marriage.
	   Such memorabilia from the life of Princess Diana go on display
Wednesday for the visiting public. But the highlight of the tour
for most will be a look at the lake island where she was buried
nearly a year ago in a private family ceremony after she died in an
Aug. 31 car crash in Paris.
	   Her brother, Earl Spencer, has opened the grounds of Althorp,
the family estate in rural Northamptonshire, through Aug. 30.
Visitors will not be allowed on to the island where Diana is
buried, and the exact location of the grave is unmarked.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets _ called ``invitations to visit'' _ have
been sold at prices ranging from 5 pounds (dlrs 8) for children to
7.50 pounds (dlrs 12) for senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15)
for adults.
	   Like nearly everything associated with Diana, the opening of the
family home has been controversial. The Daily Telegraph recently
described the earl as ``a lost soul now tethering himself to the
memory of his lost sister.''
	   One item on display in the imposing stable block is a first
draft of Spencer's scathing speech at Diana's funeral Sept. 6 in
Westminster Abbey in London, where he spoke bluntly about his
sister's frustration as a royal wife and his fear that the souls of
her two sons would be stifled by the pressures of palace life.
	   Displays in the museum include the dress Diana wore at her
wedding to Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981, personal
effects from her childhood including her school uniform, candy box
and school reports, family photographs and home movies.
	   Jewelry on display includes Diana's necklaces, tiaras and a
crown. And in one room, mannequins are dressed in some of the
outfits she wore at public functions, together with pictures of her
wearing them.
	   Admission to the museum is included in the ticket price.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, ``but not
cheapening her memory in any way,'' the estate says.
	   Hoever, residents in the nearby village of Great Brington have
expressed fear that the lure of Diana's grave would embroil them in
an English version of Graceland, the home and final resting place
of Elvis Presley.
	   ``We don't actually know what it's going to be like until it
starts. We're hoping for the best,'' Christine Whiley, who runs the
post office in Great Brington, said Tuesday.

Australia sticks with winning combination 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby selectors retained
their winning combination for the fourth test in row Wednesday when
they named the side to play New Zealand on July 11.
	   It is believed to be the first time Australia has picked an
unchanged side for four consecutive tests, with the players in good
form with a win over England and two against Scotland.
	   Winger Ben Tune appears certain to take his place despite being
troubled by a hip problem while reserve prop Dan Crowley is nursing
a slight calf strain which has restricted his training.
	   New Zealand named a 25-man squad Tuesday with Justin Marshall
winning a recall after a long absence because of injury.
	   Australian team:
	   Matt Burke; Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan, Joe Roff,
Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson, Matt
Cockbain, Tom Bowman, John Eales (capt), Richard Harry, Phil
Kearns, Andrew Blades. Reserves: Chris Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Jason
Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan Crowley, Jeremy Paul.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stocks rise in early trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early
Wednesday on a report that the Japanese government will cut taxes
to bolster the economy. Tokyo stock prices turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 138.32 yen in early trading, down 1.63 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
139.16 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's slip followed a similar move in New York, where the
currency was sold as traders were encouraged by positive news from
Japan.
	   Confidence that Japan will deal with its serious banking
problems grew after reports Tuesday said that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party agreed to allow ``bridge banks'' based on a U.S.
model to take over failed financial institutions.
	   Under the proposed system, government officials would be sent to
manage a failed institution until a buyer was found or its assets
were sold.
	   Also boosting the yen was a report in the Yomiuri newspaper
Wednesday that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government plans
to introduce permanent income and residential tax cuts of up to 4
trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) next year.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
22.68 points, or 0.14 percent, to 15,807.59 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 464.54
points, or 3.02 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 1.65 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,232.03. The TOPIX
closed up 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, the day before.
	   Early gainers included domestic issues, which were bought
following the Yomiuri report on tax cuts.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.330 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's
finish. Its price was marginally lower at 110.98 yen, compared with
the previous day's 110.99 yen.

Teams take care of business before lockout begins AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scottie Pippen was sitting at home in Chicago,
his moment in the free agent spotlight postponed indefinitely.
Michael Olowokandi bid the Clippers goodbye and prepared to go back
to England. Keith Van Horn finished his last workout for a while at
the New Jersey Nets' practice site.
	   All around the National Basketball Association, players and team
officials took care of last-minute business Tuesday before a
midnight lockout shut down the league. The NBA said it had no
choice but to stop operating until it could find a way to bring the
growth of player salaries in line with revenues.
	   Pippen was one of 148 free agents who had been looking forward
to July 1 as the day they would be free to shop their services to
the highest bidder.
	   Now, like everyone else, they will have to wait until the
lockout ends before they can start talking to teams.
	   ``We could have started sizing up our options, but now we'll
just have to wait,'' said Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent. ``It's
really nothing more than a delay. Whether it's resolved Sept. 1 or
Dec. 1, we'll eventually go about our business the same way.''
	   At team offices, staffs were briefed on the rules of the lockout
- for example, no direct contact with players for the duration.
Trainers and medical personnel conferred with players on moving
treatment sessions away from team facilities.
	   In the hours before the lockout began, the Houston Rockets
brought in two of their rookies, Michael Dickerson and Cuttino
Mobley, for a final workout. The coach and general manager of the
Toronto Raptors flew to Atlanta to meet with Charles Oakley and
finalize last week's trade with the New York Knicks.
	   In Orlando, the Magic decided to waive Mark Price, while the
Boston Celtics picked up the option on Bruce Bowen's contract and
declined to do the same with Tyus Edney.
	   Karl Malone basked in the afterglow of his appearance on a
wrestling show, where he bodyslammed and clotheslined Hulk Hogan.
The Utah Jazz star will face Dennis Rodman in a pay-per-view match
in mid-July.
	   ``He looked like he was trying hard not to laugh,'' Jazz
spokesman Kim Turner said, referring to Malone's performance.
	   Olowokandi, drafted by the Clippers as the overall No. 1 pick
last week, watched the Argentina-England soccer game while
preparing to fly home to England for about three weeks.
	   ``I'll keep doing the things I need to do, working on my game
and my conditioning,'' Olowokandi said. ``As much as I need
offseason work, this will only motivate me because it stacks the
odds against me even more.''
	   Olowokandi was one of the players who figured to be most
adversely affected by the lockout, since it will prevent him from
playing for the Clippers in a summer league and honing his raw
skills.

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Showing a solidarity that was seldom
displayed on the field, four members of the U.S. World Cup soccer
team distanced themselves Tuesday from teammates who have ripped
former coach Steve Sampson.
	   ``I look at it as a whole. It was everybody's fault, not one
person,'' said Brian McBride, who scored the U.S. team's lone goal
in a quick three-game, three-loss exit from the biggest stage in
soccer.
	   McBride is one of four members of Major League Soccer's Columbus
Crew who were selected to play for the U.S. team. All four returned
to Columbus on Tuesday to begin preparations for the Crew's game
Friday at San Jose.
	   Sampson, the first American-born coach of a U.S. World Cup team,
was forced out Monday.
	   Most of the team's veteran players were angered by a lack of
playing time and called for his dismissal in the wake of the team's
last-place finish in the 32-team field.
	   The United States lost 2-0 to Germany, 2-1 to Iran and 1-0 to
Yugoslavia.
	   Although none of the four said they felt Sampson did a great
job, none said much would have changed with a different coach.
	   ``The little mistakes are what cost us dearly,'' said Juergen
Sommer, a member of the 1994 U.S. World Cup team who was a backup
goalkeeper this time around.
	   When a youth-league player asked about Sampson's controversial
3-6-1 alignment, McBride said it was confidence and not a
configuration which resulted in the opening loss to Germany.
	   ``In the second half, it worked a lot better because we got our
ears chewed off and decided to play soccer,'' he said.
	   ``We could have played a 9-9-18,'' said Thomas Dooley, the U.S.
team captain. ``The difference between teams is not that big. I
still believe we came closer to Germany than a lot of teams.''
	   Dooley said the complaints from some players were distracting.
	   ``It was very difficult,'' he said. ``After the first game,
there were some comments in the paper, so I had a lot of meetings
with Steve and I had a lot of meetings with some of the other
players. I had some conversations with the players who made the
comments. You couldn't change it. They're old enough to know what
to do.''
	   Midfielder Brian Maisonneuve said part of the problem was that
the U.S. players were too timid.
	   ``I'd like to have the first half of the Germany game back,'' he
said. ``We didn't play poorly _ we just gave them too much respect.
If we could have that back, it could have been an entirely
different World Cup.''
	   Forward Eric Wynalda, midfielder Tab Ramos and defenders Alexi
Lalas and Jeff Agoos have criticized Sampson's strategy, handling
of personnel and player rotation.
	   A coach at Santa Clara before working as an executive with the
U.S. organizers of the 1994 World Cup, Sampson was derided because
he was not a veteran coach.
	   Wynalda said, ``We were naive to think an inexperienced coach
would see the value of experienced players.'' Ramos called the
entire U.S. World Cup enterprise ``a mess.''
	   Agoos saw more action than any U.S. player in World Cup
qualifying, yet he and Lalas never played a minute in France.
	   Lalas said that if the U.S. team continued to strive for
improvement instead of parity, then ``we might as well have orange
peels at halftime and it'll be a youth league.''
	   None of the Crew players said there was a schism between the
veterans and the younger players on the team.
	   ``There were 22 players out there,'' Sommer said. ``Not getting
to play is difficult for players when they've worked hard and
practiced the whole way. ... The team didn't play as well as the
expectations and people get frustrated. I think there was enough
finger-pointing.''

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Celebrations of Argentina's World
Cup second-round victory over England collapsed into rock-throwing
by rowdy youths whom police dispersed with tear gas and a water
cannon.
	   Authorities said at least 20 people were injured in the
disturbances Tuesday night that lasted more than an hour around the
soaring Obelisk, a Buenos Aires monument that serves as a rallying
point for fans.
	   The violence tainted what had been a largely peaceful outpouring
by thousands of Argentines that paralyzed rush hour traffic in the
capital after England was knocked out of the World Cup 4-3 on
penalties.
	   Tens of thousands took part in nighttime celebrations in the
capital as similar scenes played out across the country: people
poured into streets, doused each other with beer and threw toilet
paper over trees.
	   The violence began about two hours after the game finished, well
after thousands of celebrants left the area around the Obelisk.
	   ``People who had been here since the beginning of the game were
drunk,'' complained one bystander, Ernesto Molina, 22, leaving the
scene. ``They began to throw rocks and fight among themselves.''
	   Television news coverage showed youths shattering windows in a
television van and trying to wrench open the doors as police moved
in.
	   Police had no immediate reports on arrests, but at least two
youths could be seen being led away by police amid flying bottles,
trash cans and metal bars hurled from a moving crowd.
	   At least two police could be seen stumbling away, one holding
his head and the other limping. One man wearing an Argentine
blue-and-white jersey was seen walking away with a bloodied head.
	   Marcelo Muro, a spokesman for the municipal medical service said
14 injuries had been counted, but he had no information on their
severity.
	   Hundreds of police in orange vests converged on the plaza as a
truck with a water cannon whirled around the streets, shooting
streams of water on fleeing youths. But many remained, taunting
police amid the beat of drums and some television cameras nearby
caught one group of youths trying to pry open the metal grates of a
downtown shop.
	   Some dazed celebrants seemed to have been caught up in the
disturbances, including a mother carrying a child in her arms who
could be seen crying as she fled.
	   Earlier, the Argentines reveled in their victory by dancing in
the streets amid showers of confetti and shouts of
``Ar-gen-tin-a!''
	   One young man hung precariously out a window at the top of the
spire, waving the Argentine flag. Others leaned from bus windows,
shouting and screaming.
	   This time, Argentina didn't need Diego Maradona or the ``Hand of
God'' to beat England. It required a shootout, however, after a 2-2
draw to get to the quarterfinals.
	   It was another bitter defeat for England, which played valiantly
after David Beckham was ejected two minutes into the second half.
	   The match was closely watched by many mainly because of
Argentina's 1986 quarterfinal victory on Maradona's punched-in goal
and due to the war over the Falklands Islands in 1982.
	   That year, the former military government in Buenos Aires tried
to end Britain's presence on the Falklands, known in Argentina as
the Malvinas. Britain's possession of the small South Atlantic
sheep-raising islands remains a sore point with Argentina.
	   ``Because of the problems we've had in the past, this was
important victory,'' said Juan Carlos Riquelme, a doorman who
cheered the victory as he watched on a small TV set.
	   At The Shamrock pub, some 25 English fans, outnumbered by
Argentines, endured the nail-biting, chain-smoking drama played out
on a big screen. They made a quick exit amid Argentine cheers. For
some, it was more than a soccer match. One Argentine TV station
briefly broadcast the headline: ``The Malvinas are Argentine''
	   ``I'm disappointed with the outcome. The lads did the best they
could but it's not the first time we've lost that way to
Argentina,'' said David Deadman, 26, of Deal, England.
	   Wearing an England jersey, he held back tears as he walked away.

	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Rival groups of fans brawled into
the early morning hours Wednesday, and local youths broke store
windows and damaged cars after Argentina defeated England on
penalty kicks to advance to the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   A number of fans and locals were arrested, but police couldn't
say how many. About 10 people received minor injuries from thrown
bottles. Their nationalities were not immediately known.
	   Police closed off much of the town center, and trams and buses
were diverted to avoid further trouble.
	   In Buenos Aires, Argentina, meanwhile, celebrations collapsed
Tuesday night into rock-throwing by rowdy youths whom police
dispersed with tear gas and a water cannon.
	   Authorities said at least 20 people were injured in the
distrubances that lasted more than an hour around the soaring
Obelisk, a Buenos Aires monument that serves as a rallying point
for fans.
	   The violence tainted what had been a largely peaceful outpouring
by thousands of Argentines that paralyzed rush hour traffic in the
capital after Argentina defeated England 4-3 in a penalty shootout.
	   Earlier Tuesday, five French youths who were arrested during
disturbances the previous night were sentenced to prison terms of
eight days to one year.
	   Also Tuesday, French police, aided by a British
hooligan-spotter, arrested an English suspect in a town tense from
overnight clashes between soccer fans and local youths, officials
said.
	   The 25-year-old man head-butted a French policeman as he was
arrested with help from a British officer, who had spotted the fan
and alerted local authorities.
	   The man, who was not immediately identified, is considered a
``category C'' soccer fan, among the most dangerous. He could be
deported after a quick trial.
	   About 1,600 officers were brought to this city in southeastern
France for the England-Argentina game, played the night after North
African French youths clashed with English fans at an outdoor
screening of another World Cup match.
	   Authorities stopped showing the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game late
Monday while violence spread to an area around the stadium, where
the local youths burned several cars.
	   Police said the violence began when the youths, seeking to
avenge English-Tunisian clashes after a match in Marseille two
weeks earlier, insulted and struck English fans.
	   The English fought back and riot police were called in. Nine
French youths were arrested.
	   Police have arrested more than 700 people and expelled more than
a dozen since the World Cup began June 10, the Interior Ministry
says.
	   There have been at least 3,200 injuries, most of them not
serious, the ministry says. About 400 people were hospitalized,
including a policeman who beaten into a coma by German neo-Nazis in
Lens.
	   The officer's condition was improving, doctors said Tuesday.
Daniel Nivel, 44, was showing signs of gradually coming out of the
coma, although doctors stressed his condition was still critical.
	   Nivel was hit on the head with an iron bar after a World Cup
match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when groups of neo-Nazis
rampaged through Lens in northern France.
	   Two Germans have been placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.

Belfast's new Assembly brings together enemies past and present

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's new
Assembly, cornerstone of the peace agreement, convenes Wednesday
with the election of a Protestant leader and Catholic deputy its
main goal.
	   Among those who are supposed to gather together to govern this
divided country are convicted IRA bombers and gun-runners, slayers
of Catholic civilians, retired British soldiers _ and a hefty
number of Protestant hard-liners determined to scuttle the whole
thing.
	   The April agreement struck among eight parties, but rejected by
two Protestant ones, specified that the Assembly's 108 members
should take decisions with the support of majorities of both its
Catholic and Protestant members.
	   The Assembly will meet around the same 60-foot-long
(20-meter-long) table where they pursued 22 months of negotiations
in the Stormont government complex in east Belfast.
	   The most fundamental compromise will be agreeing which parties
should hold which posts in a 12-member administration, to be called
the Executive. The Executive is expected to take over six
departments from the British government next year, including
education, economic development and health.
	   It may take months of haggling to appoint most of the Executive,
chiefly because most Protestant politicians refuse to let the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party hold any posts unless the Irish
Republican Army starts to disarm. The peace agreement specifies
that the IRA and truce-observing paramilitary groups on the
Protestant side should disarm by mid-2000, something they all
refuse to do.
	   Assembly members expect to vote Wednesday on whether David
Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, should
become the Executive's ``first minister'' and John Hume, Catholic
leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, its ``deputy first
minister.''
	   Sinn Fein hasn't said whether it will vote for Trimble or
abstain. Trimble has consistently refused to talk with Sinn Fein
leaders.
	   But under the Assembly's double-majority voting rules, Sinn
Fein's 18 votes won't be necessary to pass decisions because Hume's
moderate SDLP holds 24 seats in the two-party Catholic bloc.
	   On the more complex Protestant side, the voting situation is
precariously balanced. To deliver a majority of Protestants,
Trimble will need all of his 27 Ulster Unionist colleagues, a few
of whom oppose his acceptance of the agreement.
	   As insurance, Trimble will have support from David Ervine and
Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionists, a party linked with
the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, a gang that for three decades
treated the entire Catholic community as ``legitimate targets.''
Both men spent time in prison, Hutchinson for fatally shooting two
Catholics, but today win admiration in Catholic circles for their
straight-talking style.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, who withdrew his Democratic Unionist Party
from the negotiations as soon as Sinn Fein gained admission in
mid-1997, will return Wednesday at the head of a 28-strong camp of
Protestants determined to make trouble for Trimble and heckle Sinn
Fein.
	   ``We will not be in there negotiating with Sinn Fein,'' said
Paisley's deputy, Peter Robinson. ``We will be in there countering
every move that they make. No quarter will be given.''
	   The Sinn Fein benches will include Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, whom the history books credit as architects of the
modern IRA; Gerry Kelly, convicted of bombing London's Old Bailey
courthouse in 1973; and John Kelly, who helped arm the IRA at the
start of its campaign to abolish Northern Ireland in 1970.
	   In the Ulster Unionist ranks will sit the party's deputy leader
John Taylor, who was shot 17 times by an IRA gunman in 1972 but
somehow survived. He's the only living Cabinet member from the old
Protestant-dominated government that the IRA opposed, and which the
British government duly abolished that year.
	   Also there will be John Gorman, the Ulster Unionists' most
prominent Catholic member and a highly decorated tank commander in
World War II. He served as an officer in Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force, which has had 300 members
killed by the IRA.
	   ``This should prove to be a rather exciting, and I suspect
strange, experience for us all,'' Gorman said of the Assembly.

Brawls break out after England-Argentina game violence in Argentina; also moved on news lines

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Rival groups of fans brawled into
the early morning hours Wednesday, and local youths broke store
windows and damaged cars after Argentina defeated England on
penalty kicks to advance to the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   A number of fans and locals were arrested, but police couldn't
say how many. About 10 people received minor injuries from thrown
bottles. Their nationalities were not immediately known.
	   Police closed off much of the town center, and trams and buses
were diverted to avoid further trouble.
	   In Buenos Aires, Argentina, meanwhile, celebrations collapsed
Tuesday night into rock-throwing by rowdy youths whom police
dispersed with tear gas and a water cannon.
	   Authorities said at least 20 people were injured in the
distrubances that lasted more than an hour around the soaring
Obelisk, a Buenos Aires monument that serves as a rallying point
for fans.
	   The violence tainted what had been a largely peaceful outpouring
by thousands of Argentines that paralyzed rush hour traffic in the
capital after Argentina defeated England 4-3 in a penalty shootout.
	   Earlier Tuesday, five French youths who were arrested during
disturbances the previous night were sentenced to prison terms of
eight days to one year.
	   Also Tuesday, French police, aided by a British
hooligan-spotter, arrested an English suspect in a town tense from
overnight clashes between soccer fans and local youths, officials
said.
	   The 25-year-old man head-butted a French policeman as he was
arrested with help from a British officer, who had spotted the fan
and alerted local authorities.
	   The man, who was not immediately identified, is considered a
``category C'' soccer fan, among the most dangerous. He could be
deported after a quick trial.
	   About 1,600 officers were brought to this city in southeastern
France for the England-Argentina game, played the night after North
African French youths clashed with English fans at an outdoor
screening of another World Cup match.
	   Authorities stopped showing the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game late
Monday while violence spread to an area around the stadium, where
the local youths burned several cars.
	   Police said the violence began when the youths, seeking to
avenge English-Tunisian clashes after a match in Marseille two
weeks earlier, insulted and struck English fans.
	   The English fought back and riot police were called in. Nine
French youths were arrested.
	   Police have arrested more than 700 people and expelled more than
a dozen since the World Cup began June 10, the Interior Ministry
says.
	   There have been at least 3,200 injuries, most of them not
serious, the ministry says. About 400 people were hospitalized,
including a policeman who beaten into a coma by German neo-Nazis in
Lens.
	   The officer's condition was improving, doctors said Tuesday.
Daniel Nivel, 44, was showing signs of gradually coming out of the
coma, although doctors stressed his condition was still critical.
	   Nivel was hit on the head with an iron bar after a World Cup
match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when groups of neo-Nazis
rampaged through Lens in northern France.
	   Two Germans have been placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged _ for attempted murder.

Reporters in India send news to Tibet via radio

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ When she was in Tibet, Gyaltsen Chotso
huddled under quilts to muffle the sound when she listened to news
broadcasts on her short-wave radio.
	   ``People inside Tibet feel they have missed their breakfast if
they cannot listen to the radio news for a day,'' Chotso said about
radio shows financed by the U.S. and Norwegian governments.
	   Three years ago, the 28-year-old Buddhist nun fled to
neighboring India, which is a haven for more than 100,000 other
Tibetans. She said she had been imprisoned and tortured by Chinese
authorities for shouting anti-Beijing slogans at rallies.
	   Even here, she still regularly tunes in to the Tibetan programs
on Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, both run by the United
States, and the Norway-based Voice of Tibet.
	   The services have 10 Tibetan journalists based in India to
report on events relating to Tibet.
	   For instance, they recently gave extensive coverage to a hunger
strike by Tibetan exiles in India. One group demanding Tibetan
independence fasted seven weeks before being hospitalized against
their will, and five other exiles who took up the protest fasted 18
days before giving up. A man who was to have been among the second
group set himself on fire in a protest and later died.
	   China often tries to drown politically sensitive foreign
broadcasts with shrill droning noises from jamming stations. The
radio networks then switch frequencies, with the Chinese jammers in
pursuit.
	   That kind of Cold War cat-and-mouse game seems out of place in
U.S.-Chinese relations. In 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton
decided trade with China would not be affected by human rights
issues.
	   But ever since the Chinese government put down pro-democracy
protests in 1989, the U.S. Congress has felt it had to act. The
Voice of America started its Tibetan broadcasts in 1990 and Radio
Free Asia added a Tibetan service in 1996.
	   ``Congress saw broadcasts into China as an effective tool to
break the stranglehold of the Chinese Communist Party,'' the U.S.
State Department says.
	   The Norwegian government finances voluntary groups that in turn
fund the Voice of Tibet.
	   ``There is genuine concern among Norwegian people for the
Tibetans, and this awareness has specially increased after the
Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1989,'' said Bjorn
Midthun, a spokesman for the Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi.
	   Audience figures are impossible to get, but hundreds of letters
and messages sneaked across the border from Tibet in the past few
months indicate the popularity of the broadcasts.
	   The few hours of daily programming on each station include news,
music and discussions on education, religion, literature and
Tibetan history.
	   ``People say the networks broadcast hope of independence,'' said
Tsering Migmar, a reporter for the Voice of America's Tibetan
service.
	   But the Tibetan journalist say their goal is to deliver
straightforward news reports to Tibetans.
	   ``Our focus is to stick to journalistic ethics,'' said Lobsang
Yeshi at Radio Free Asia. ``We are trying to make our (exile)
government more transparent and introduce the Tibetan people to
democratic functioning.''
	   Yeshi offended conservative Tibetans last year when he reported
on a Tibetan youth who was arrested by Indian authorities for drug
trafficking.
	   ``If it is news, it has to be reported,'' he said.
	   ``There is a saying in Tibetan: You can't shut out the rising
sun by holding up your palm against your face,'' he added.

Eds: UPDATES with 20 people injured in Argentina celebrations
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England hates the penalty shootout. English fans
really hate the penalty shootout.
	   For the third time in eight years at a major tournament,
soccer's founding nation has fallen victim to a newfangled quirk of
the game. The seemingly random arrow of five-kicks-a-side, used to
bring an end to endless ties, pointed the other way once again.
	   To make it worse, the opponent was longtime rival and political
foe Argentina, which beat England in the Diego Maradona ``Hand of
God'' game 12 years ago.
	   ``We are almost distraught,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle said
after Tuesday's loss that sent the Argentines to a quarterfinal
match against the Netherlands. ``It's a bitter, bitter pill to
take. ... It's a very difficult way to go out of the tournament.''
	   As English's notorious fans with tickets filed out of
Saint-Etienne's Stade Geoffrey Guichard and those without shuffled
out of the city's bars, police and citizens were on tenterhooks
wondering how the members of the hooligan brigade would take out
their frustrations.
	   The night passed in relative peace. In fact, there were twice as
many people injured in celebrations in Argentina than in the
aftermath of the game in France, where 10 people suffered minor
injuries after being hit with thrown bottles.
	   In Buenos Aires, authorities said at least 20 people were
injured in the disturbances Tuesday night that lasted more than an
hour around the soaring Obelisk, a monument that serves as a
rallying point for fans.
	   There were a few brawls involving England and Argentine fans,
and local youths broke store windows and damaged cars, but it was
nothing like the mad violence that surrounded England's match with
Tunisia two weeks ago.
	   If anything, the fans walking out of the stadium in
Saint-Etienne seemed to depressed to rumble.
	   ``Penalties, sad. Penalties, sad,'' muttered one fan, shaking
the shaven head on which he had painted huge red intersecting
stripes to represent his country's flag. ``The best team went
out.''
	   Penalties were also England's curse in the 1990 World Cup
semifinals and in the 1996 European Championship semis. Both times,
the Germans won the shootouts _ and then went on to win both
titles.
	   The Argentines, suddenly unabashed enthusiasts of the spot-kick
roulette wheel, would like to follow the same trail.
	   ``It's the most dramatic way to end a game,'' said Argentina's
coach, Daniel Passarella. ``It's very hard to watch it from the
sidelines. ... It's very sweet to send the English back home. Very
sweet.''
	   Argentina's victory completed the quarterfinal pairings. The
Argentines will play the Dutch at Marseille on Saturday. Croatia,
which defeated Yugoslavia 1-0 in Tuesday's other game, will face
Germany in Lyon, also Saturday.
	   Friday's games are Italy-France at Saint-Denis and
Brazil-Denmark at Nantes. Wednesday and Thursday are the first off
days since the tournament began June 10.
	   At Saint-Etienne, Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa made the stop
on David Batty's penalty kick to win the shootout 4-3 after 120
minutes of gripping action left the score 2-2.
	   There were three goals, including two penalties, in the first 16
minutes. England played the last 75 minutes with only 10 men after
David Beckham was ejected for kicking Diego Simeone in retaliation.
	   ``There's no doubt it was the toughest second-round match of the
World Cup,'' Passarella said.
	   Of course, any winning coach will say that, including Croatia's
Miroslav Blazevic, who expressed superlative glee after leading his
seven-year-old nation into the final eight.
	   ``Never has a country as small as Croatia produced such a result
as we did today,'' Blazevic said. ``We have eliminated a team with
a great tradition. Our players achieved a big goal. We're happy,
happier, the happiest.''
	   Croatia is the first country to make the quarterfinals in its
World Cup debut since East Germany in 1974.
	   The lone goal in the victory was Davor Suker's penalty kick in
first-half injury time. Argentine referee Javier Castrilli called
the foul on midfielder Gabriel Popescu, whose legs became entangled
with those of Aljosa Asanovic as they chased the ball in the
penalty area.
	   ``The penalty was imaginary,'' Romanian defender Dan Petrescu
said. ``Or if the referee wanted to give a penalty on that play, we
should have gotten at least one, if not two.''
	   In a tournament in which sport and politics are hopelessly
intertwined, Croatia's match with Germany will be a friendly
non-friendly. Germany was one of the first countries to recognize
the Balkan nation's independence in 1991.
	   However, two teams have already met once in the quarterfinals of
a major tournament _ the Germans won 2-1 en route to capturing the
1996 European Championship.
	   ``We will do everything to get revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``Let
us not forget that Germany is a friend of Croatia, but as everyone
knows, there is nothing sweeter than beating your friends.''

Salvadoran gang members unite to fight violence

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Young gang members prowl the
streets of El Salvador, baggy pants over their legs, tattoos on
their arms and anger in their eyes.
	   To many Salvadorans, they reflect the worst of the violence that
has tormented this Central American nation since its civil war
ended six years ago.
	   Members of ``Homies Unidos'' see something else: victims of
their country's past and hope for its future. They also see
themselves.
	   The group was formed by rival gang members in hopes of giving
young people _ especially gang kids _ alternatives to violence.
They see violence as the problem, not the gangs.
	   They don't advocate quitting gangs. In fact, they haven't quit
themselves.
	   ``Homies haven't stopped being proud of who we are,'' said the
group's vice president, Sigfredo Rivera, 28, who also belongs to
the 18th Street gang.
	   The group's name is Spanglish _ the mix of Spanish and English
that many gang members speak. Homies is English street slang
roughly meaning ``friends''; Unidos is Spanish for ``united.''
	   Its members talk about preserving the best aspects of gang life
_ solidarity, discipline and respect _ while phasing out the worst,
such as violence and drugs.
	   The notion of good qualities of gang life may strike some people
as absurd. Crime has skyrocketed in El Salvador since the 12-year
civil war ended in 1992, with more people dying violently now than
were killed during the war, according to government figures. Gangs
have received much of the blame.
	   But Homies Unidos members say the gangs are just an easy target.
Violence in El Salvador goes back for generations and is committed
by all types of people, they say. Young gang members have been
among the many who have suffered through war, poverty and broken
families, they add.
	   ``The youth, far from being El Salvador's problem, I believe, is
the opportunity El Salvador has to change the present,'' said
Hector Pinero, president and co-founder of Homies Unidos and a
member of the Los Angeles-based Mara Salvatrucha gang.
	   El Salvador's gangs are largely spin-offs of those in U.S.
cities. Many were formed by Salvadorans who joined gangs while
living in the United States, then got into trouble and were sent
back to El Salvador.
	   Unable to adapt to a homeland they didn't really know, and with
their parents often still in the United States, the youths turned
to their other families: their gangs.
	   ``You search out the closest thing you have,'' Rivera said.
``You search for your people. And you fall into the same vicious
cycle again.''
	   To break the cycle, Homies Unidos helps gang members channel
their energies into other areas, such as music, art or computers.
They teach peaceful ways to resolve disputes and offer advice on
drugs and AIDS.
	   It's a low-key approach. Leaders are careful not to preach.
Although they have mediated between rival gangs, they stress that
they see their main role as giving youths an opportunity to improve
their lives.
	   ``Homies is an option for change,'' Rivera said. ``It is the
open hands, the open arms that we always wanted in our lives.''
	   Homies Unidos was formed in 1996, after a meeting of rival gang
members and with the help of Magdaleno Rose Avila, a
Mexican-American political activist. It has about 40 to 60
volunteers and relies on contributions for support.
	   Its reputation is growing. It has formed a chapter in Los
Angeles and its leaders have been asked to speak in other parts of
the United States and Central America.
	   On a recent Friday afternoon, Homies Unidos members Marvin
Novoa, 21, and Edgar Sanchez, 22, were rehearsing for their first
big gig at a local club, where the rap duo would sing in Spanglish
about life on the streets.
	   A few years ago, they might have tried to kill each other. Novoa
belongs to the 18th Street gang, Sanchez to Mara Salvatrucha.
	   Novoa's story is typical of those in Homies Unidos. He moved to
the United States as an 11-year-old, joined a gang, got deported
and rejoined his gang in El Salvador.
	   One day, he was partying with his gang, taking drugs and
drinking, when he tried to kill himself with a grenade. He
survived, but lost a hand.
	   Now, he says, with the help of Homies Unidos and his church,
he's a changed person and wants to help others.
	   ``If we were the problem, we can be part of the solution,''
Novoa said. ``Who else could do this work? No one is going to pay
attention to someone who was never in a gang.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A U.S. Army helicopter crashed in a
remote area northeast of Seoul and rescue workers were searching
for its crew members, military officials said Wednesday.
	   The Black Hawk helicopter was on a training flight when it
crashed Tuesday, but the cause of the crash and the number of crew
members aboard were not known, a press release from U.S. Army's 2nd
Infantry Division said.
	   Search and rescue operations are continuing near Kapyong city,
some 45 kilometers (27 miles) northeast of Seoul, it said.
	   The helicopter was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Aviation
Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. The Black Hawk, used for air
assault, support and evacuation, is usually operated by a crew of
three, the army said.

Commerce booms between Vietnam and China despite tensions

<TEXT>
	   MONG CAI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam and China still can't agree who
owns what, but money seems to be doing more than diplomacy to ease
a tradition of acrimony.
	   The two neighbors have been swapping diplomatic barbs over a new
territorial dispute and two old ones. A deadline for settling their
conflicting claims by 2000 is unlikely to be met.
	   At the same time, residents of Mong Cai, which was flattened
during a bloody 1979 war, talk only about building for the future
and creating a ``mini-Hong Kong'' based on trade.
	   ``If you don't like your house or your neighbor, you can move.
But we are permanent neighbors, so we have to work to improve
relations,'' said Bui Huu Thiem, deputy chairman of the Hai Ninh
district People's Committee.
	   ``The town has been booming due to the mutually beneficial
trade,'' he said. ``It's like a family; brothers can fight each
other, but the main thing is that we pursue the good things. We're
confident that relations will be good forever.''
	   A 1991 agreement normalized relations for the first time since
the Chinese attacked 10 days after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in
1979. Talks under its auspices don't seem to have resolved much.
	   Both countries have been flexing their muscles in recent months
over territorial issues big and small: claims to the Paracel and
Spratly islands, both in the South China Sea, and a flareup over
manmade shifts in a river border.
	   Asked about the disputes, both countries' governments are what
can best be described as optimistically obstinate _ repeating
unequivocal claims while resolving to settle matters peacefully.
	   ``We possess an adequate historical and legal basis to confirm
our sovereignty over those archipelagos,'' said a Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Phan Thuy Thanh.
	   China is only slightly more conciliatory.
	   ``China has sovereignty over the two islands. This is an
indisputable issue,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
``However ... other countries have different views. So our proposal
on this issue is to shelve the dispute and go in for common
development.''
	   To that end, Beijing is talking about starting regular tourist
trips to the Paracels, which Chinese forces seized in 1974, a year
before the end of the Vietnam War.
	   The plan generated immediate criticism from Hanoi, which
responded by sending three high-level Vietnamese military officials
on separate trips to the Spratlys.
	   The Spratlys are believed to be rich in mineral resources and
are claimed wholly or in part by the two neighbors as well as by
the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. They were the site of
the last blowup between China and Vietnam, which fought over them
in 1988.
	   Since then, several of the islands have been fortified with
troops and concrete.
	   ``To get someone off an island, you have to attack. Now they're
stuck with a Chinese chess game,'' said Carlyle Thayer, a professor
at the Australian National University who specializes in Vietnam.
	   ``The Vietnamese don't want to offend Chinese sensibilities,''
Thayer said, pointing out the huge difference in the countries'
sizes.
	   But while ``China can find a provocation anytime it wants,''
Vietnam has steadily built up its sea and air forces in recent
years, he noted. ``Not that it makes Vietnam a superpower, but
Vietnam really has the ability to give the Chinese a bloody nose in
the South China Sea.''
	   Mong Cai is a small sign of what can happen when the two sides
cooperate. The population has jumped from 33,000 when relations
with China were normalized in 1991 to 55,000, although that still
is below the pre-war level of 60,000.
	   New houses and markets have been hastily thrown up, thanks in
part to a government incentive plan. A construction boom continues.
	   Streamlined procedures for residents of the border provinces
allow an average of 1,000 people _ mostly from China _ to cross the
rebuilt bridge over the Calong River each day.
	   Half the Chinese visitors are traders, some commuting to 300
shops they rent in Mong Cai, where most signs are in both
Vietnamese and Chinese. The other half are tourists who come over
for a little shopping or an excursion to Halong Bay, a bumpy 4 1-2
-hour drive to the south.
	   Still, there are reminders even little squabbles can quickly
escalate.
	   A witness said Vietnamese and Chinese villagers along the
border-marking Dong Mo River 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Mong
Cai fought with sticks and rocks in December over allegations of
land grabbing.
	   China claims Vietnam built a dike last August that changed the
flow of the river, causing ``grave losses'' on the Chinese side.
China responded by building a jetty to shore up its river bank,
protect farmland and prevent soil erosion.
	   Although tensions reportedly have eased, a request by The
Associated Press to visit the site was rejected. The government
instead permitted a trip to Mong Cai to show off a success story.

Draft U.N. resolution condemns Israel for extending municipal services 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After a day of debate over Israel's
decision to extend municipal services from Jerusalem to Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, the Security Council shelved the
matter indefinitely without a vote on the Arab-sponsored
resolution.
	   The Security Council had overruled U.S. objections Tuesday and
heard Arab calls to condemn Israel's decision. Washington has it
said would inflame passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to
revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Mindful of the U.S. position, British Ambassador John Weston
suggested the council might instead adopt a presidential statement.
Such a statement wouldn't carry the weight of international law as
a resolution would.
	   Council sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and the Palestinians could live with such a
presidential statement, but the exact language was still up for
negotiation.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution. But resorting to a veto is considered a diplomatic
setback because it shows that the permanent member is unable to
muster majority support.
	   The Palestinian U.N. representative, Nasser Al-Kidwa, opened the
debate by urging the 15-member council to adopt a resolution that
calls on Israel to stop what it called illegal settlement expansion
because it constitutes ``a major obstacle to peace.''
	   ``We hope that the council will have the sufficient will to
finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee the
rescinding of the plan and to prevent Israel, the occupying power,
from undertaking any further illegal actions in Jerusalem,''
Al-Kidwa said.
	   Israel responded by saying the council had no role in the
dispute.
	   ``This is entirely an internal Israeli matter on the municipal
administrative level rather than on the international level,'' said
Israel's ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   He defended Israel's June 21 decision to put some Jewish
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning, as a move to bolster the
city's economy.
	   Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved the plan over U.S.
protests.
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said he welcomed
Israel's assurances that the decision wasn't political in nature,
but he said the United States regretted it.
	   ``Logic suggests and reality demands that no action be taken
that would prejudge or prejudice an issue of such sensitivity'' as
the status of Jerusalem.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help restart
the stalled peace talks.

Argentina just makes it after penalty shootout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Argentina's seemingly impregnable
defense has been breached and its confidence has taken a battering.
Yet the South Americans are still in contention for a third World
Cup triumph.
	   Argentina earned a quarterfinal date with the Netherlands by the
slimmist of margins Tuesday night, edging England in a penalty
shootout after the teams were tied 2-2 and England had been reduced
to 10 men for 75 minutes.
	   The sending off of David Beckham for a retaliatory foul in the
47th minute should have cleared the path for a comfortable
Argentina victory, but it never materialized.
	   England's defiant defense kept Argentina at bay to such a degree
that coach Daniel Passarella substituted top-scoring striker
Gabriel Batistuta in a vain attempt to break the deadlock.
	   Even 30 minutes after extra-time failed to separate the teams,
but when it came down to the penalty shootout Argentina took it
4-3.
	   Passarella, whose team had not conceded a goal in its previous
eight matches, admitted England was tough to crack.
	   ``It was a very open game until England was down to 10-men.
After that England had to fall back into more defensive positions
and rely more on counter-attacking,'' he said.
	   ``What we saw tonight was typical English play, lots of
character. It was a tough game for us and there is no doubt that
this was the toughest second round game in this World Cup.''
	   Passarella, who captained Argentina's 1978 World Cup winning
team, expected a difficult match agianst the Netherlands in
Marseilles on Saturday.
	   ``We know that game is going to be very hard too. We saw them
beat Yugoslavia 2-1 on televison and we sent people to the ground
to watch. We know, like England, they are serious contenders. We
will start our preparations from tomorrow.''
	   It was the second major setback at the hands of Argentina for
England manager Glenn Hoddle, who was on the team which lost 2-1 in
1986 World Cup quarterfinal clash _ the match which is remembered
in soccer history for Diego Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal.
	   ``It is a bitter pill to have to take again. We are absolutley
distraught. I am not denying the sending off cost us the game, but
even with 10 men we defended like lions.
	   ``It was a magnificent performance to play that length of time
with 10 men to still nearly go and win the game.
	   ``We are proud of the way we performed and we couldn't have
asked for any more. We were so near to making it one of the most
historic victories ever.''
	   Most of the thrills, and all of the goals, came in the
first-half.
	   Argentina got off to a flying start, when England goalkeeper
David Seaman fouled Diego Simeone in the sixth minute and Batistuta
made no mistake from the penalty spot, scoring his fifth goal of
the tournament.
	   Then in the space of six minutes the match swung in England's
favor, Hoddle's team equalizing with an Alan Shearer penalty in the
10th minute after teenage prodigy Michael Owen was brought down by
Roberto Ayala.
	   In the 16th minute, Paul Ince broke up an attack and found
Beckham who released Owen. The exciting 18-year-old then set off
nearly half the length of the pitch, dribbling past Ayala and Jose
Chamot before netting with a right-footed drive.
	   England suddenly carried greater authority, despite the clever
promptings of Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega. However, Argentina
struck almost on halftime with a well-rehearsed free-kick which
ended with Javier Zanetti equalizing.
	   Then, following Beckham's dismissal, England played with its
back to the wall, defying everything Argentina could produce.
	   But, in the end, fate favored Argentina.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton called on
China Wednesday to open its trade markets, and he urged American
investors in the world's largest country to help it battle huge
environmental problems.
	   Addressing a breakfast of U.S. and Chinese business leaders in
one of the country's booming financial centers, Clinton said he
could not, as president, ask China to adopt environmental standards
that would slow economic growth.
	   ``But as a citizen of the world and the leader of my country, I
have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet
that our grandchildren can still enjoy living on,'' he said,
adding, ``And so do you.''
	   He also urged American firms to set a good example on fair labor
standards in China.

	   Clinton spoke with business leaders in the atrium of a high-rise
hotel before touring Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering symbol
of China's march toward a market economy. In the towering steel and
glass building housing the exchange, the president was having lunch
with young Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   Clinton said China must agree to ``strong terms'' to qualify for
membership in the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules
for global trade. That would require opening markets and allowing
investment opportunities here for foreign firms. The terms have to
be ``clear and unambiguous,'' the president said, although he said
China should be granted some concessions as a developing nation.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said. ``More open markets are
important to the United States, which buys today about a third of
China's exports _ and in turn should have a fair shot at China's
markets. It is important to China as it builds an economy that must
compete globally.''
	   He said rapid change and disruptions caused by economic reform
``make it tempting to turn inward and to slow down. But for China,
as for America, the promise for the future lies in helping our
citizens to master the challenges of the global economy, not to run
away from them.''

England soccer team praised for bravery after World Cup defeat by Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Heroes,'' declared a banner headline in the
tabloid Express newspaper Wednesday after England's World Cup dream
disintegrated in a nail-biting 4-3 penalty shoot-out with
Argentina.
	   The story of England's defeat Tuesday night in St. Etienne,
France, dominated the front pages of the nation's tabloids, which
tried to console the disappointment with praise for the team's
efforts in playing the second half of the game one man short and
succeeding in forcing Argentina into overtime and penalty shots.
	   The Daily Mail blamed the failure on star player David Beckham,
who was sent off the pitch moments after the second half began for
tripping up an Argentina player who had just fouled him.
	   His ``moment of lunacy'' and ``petulant act of retaliation''
shattered England's dream, the Daily Mail said.
	   ``His teammates staged one of the most courageous rearguard
actions in the tournament's history,'' the newspaper added.
	   About 28 million people were estimated to have watched England's
defeat on British television, causing one of the biggest power
surges ever recorded, the National Grid said.
	   ``The surge at half time (2,100 megawatts) was equivalent to
that reached in 1985 during an episode of ``Dallas'' when JR was
shot,'' National Grid spokesman Sean Regan said.
	   But the figure fell short of the biggest power surge ever
recorded, which occurred during the World Cup semifinal between
England and Germany in 1990, he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who watched the game on
television in his Downing Street home with his children, praised
the England team.
	   ``They showed the English spirit at its very best,'' he said.
	   Within an hour after the game, bookmaker William Hill had
already opened the betting on who will succeed England coach Glenn
Hoddle.
	   ``It's difficult to blame Glenn Hoddle for any defeat inflicted
in this manner but he may well decide to step down after a
disappointment of that nature,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham
Sharpe.
	   ``I don't know if destiny was against us. Everything went
against us. But it is not a night for excuses, it is a night for us
to be proud,'' said Glenn Hoddle, close to tears after the game.

Two moderate quakes hit Japan, but no damage or injuries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of moderate earthquakes hit separate regions
of Japan early Wednesday, but there were no reports of damage or
injuries, police said.
	   The first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.5, jolted the
city of Nagano and other parts of northwestern Japan, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The quake struck at 2:22 a.m. (1722 GMT Tuesday) and was
centered about 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground near Nagano, the
agency said.
	   Nagano, site of the Winter Olympic Games held in February, is
179 kilometers (112 miles), northwest of Tokyo.
	   The second temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.1, was
recorded in an area northeast of Tokyo at 3:03 a.m. (1803 GMT
Tuesday), the agency said.
	   That quake was centered at a depth of about 40 kilometers (25
miles) under the seabed in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
Ibaraki Prefecture, or state, 100 kilometers (63 miles), northeast
of the capital.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as its
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Prime Minister: Time running out for Aboriginal land rights deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Wednesday said time is running out for the government, a key
independent senator and state leaders to reach a compromise deal on
an Aboriginal land rights law.
	   ``The discussions continue, I'm working very hard to get an
outcome that is consistent with my strong belief that all
Australians should be treated equally,'' Howard said in a Perth
radio interview.
	   The bill would limit claims by Aborigines on the vast tracts of
lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and miners.
The lessees claim they can't manage their businesses properly if
the land is subject to Aboriginal claims.
	   Howard early Tuesday reached a broad compromise with independent
Sen. Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the Senate,
but the deal was thwarted by the leaders of Western Australia state
and the Northern Territory.
	   They say his stance on the legislation _ favoring stronger
rights for Aborigines to lay claim to land _ could jeopardize
crucial mining investment in their regions.
	   Western Australian state Sen. Ross Lightfoot has told Howard he
has been been instructed by senior officials in the state branch of
his party to vote against any compromise on native title.
	   The ruling Liberal-National coalition doesn't have a majority in
the Senate and requires one non-government vote to pass laws. If
Lightfoot voted against a compromise, it would be defeated.
	   Howard urged Western Australia to support a compromise, saying
the people of that state would lose more if native title laws
aren't changed.
	   ``We are fast running out of time, everybody understands that,
and I'm sure that Senator Harradine understands that, I understand
that, and others who have an interest understand,'' the prime
minister said.
	   The coalition had been threatening to call an election on the
issue since Harradine blocked the passage of the legislation in
April, and set July 4 as a deadline for laws to be passed.
	   The next election must be held by May 1999, but some analysts
say an August poll is likely if it is called early.
	   Compromise talks between Harradine and Howard were reopened
after the surprising success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
in Queensland state elections June 13.
	   One Nation, which opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and Asian immigration, took 11 seats in the 89-member state
Parliament, many at the coalition's expense.
	   One Nation wants to abolish native title.
	   The government introduced the so-called 10-point native title
plan to spell out the exact extent of a 1996 High Court ruling
recognizing Aborigines' right to lay non-exclusive claim to
government-held land leased to farmers and miners _ some 42 percent
of Australia's land mass.
	   The plan would weaken the power of Aborigines over development
projects on pastoral leases, restrict their ability to claim native
title, set a deadline for native title claims to be presented and
allow Aborigines to claim compensation from projects where native
title can be proved.

	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, speaking to the same
forum, said China's leaders, in meetings over the last week,
insisted they could not open their markets because domestic
industries cannot compete in the global economy.
	   ``We believe the opposite is true,'' Daley said. ``The more
China opens its markets, the more its domestic industries will be
able to compete.''
	   Clinton said China will have to develop worker retraining and

	   He said 1998 promises to be the warmest year in recorded history
and that environmental pollution in any nation is a global problem.
	   Clinton said Shanghai, a flashy center of global trade and

Clinton talks trade and environment with Chinese, U.S. business leaders AP White House Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton called on
China Wednesday to open its trade markets, and he urged American
investors in the world's largest country to help it battle huge
environmental problems.
	   Addressing a breakfast of U.S. and Chinese business leaders in a
booming financial district, Clinton said he could not, as
president, ask China to adopt environmental standards that would
slow economic growth.
	   ``But as a citizen of the world and the leader of my country, I
have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet
that our grandchildren can still enjoy living on,'' he said,
adding, ``And so do you.''
	   He also urged American firms to set a good example on fair labor
standards in China.
	   Clinton spoke with business leaders in the atrium of a high-rise
hotel before touring Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering symbol
of China's march toward a market economy. In the towering steel and
glass building housing the exchange, the president was having lunch
with young Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   Clinton said China must agree to ``strong terms'' to qualify for
membership in the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules
for global trade. That would require opening markets and allowing
investment opportunities here for foreign firms. The terms have to
be ``clear and unambiguous,'' the president said, although he said
China should be granted some concessions as a developing nation.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said. ``More open markets are
important to the United States, which buys today about a third of
China's exports _ and in turn should have a fair shot at China's
markets. It is important to China as it builds an economy that must
compete globally.''
	   He said rapid change and disruptions caused by economic reform
``make it tempting to turn inward and to slow down. But for China,
as for America, the promise for the future lies in helping our
citizens to master the challenges of the global economy, not to run
away from them.''
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, speaking to the same
forum, said China's leaders, in meetings over the last week,
insisted they could not open their markets because domestic
industries cannot compete in the global economy.
	   ``We believe the opposite is true,'' Daley said. ``The more
China opens its markets, the more its domestic industries will be
able to compete.''
	   Clinton said China will have to develop worker retraining and
social security programs as it transforms its massive state-run
industries into market-based companies. He said the United States

	   There was a strong environmental message in Clinton's remarks,

Dollar down, Tokyo stocks mixed at midday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday currency, stock and bond prices
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Wednesday
morning on a report that the Japanese government will cut taxes to
bolster the economy. Tokyo stock prices traded mixed.
	   The dollar bought 138.78 yen as of midday, down 1.17 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
139.16 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped
3.25 points, or 0.02 percent, to 15,827.02 at the close of the
morning trading session.
	   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index soared 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent, as rumors circulated that the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party will propose a sweeping tax cut ahead of upper house
elections July 12.
	   The yen also rose, boosted by optimism such a cut would spur
consumer spending and lift Japan out of its worst recession since
World War II.
	   The yen continued its gains after Japan's largest newspaper, the
Yomiuri, reported Wednesday morning that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto plans to introduce permanent income and residential tax
cuts of up to 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) next year.
	   Investors also took heart from recent signs that Japan is moving
to clean up once and for all the bad loans that have plagued its
banks since the collapse of real estate prices in the early 1990s.
	   Newspapers have cited top LDP lawmakers as supporting plans to
allow ``bridge banks'' based on a U.S. model to take over failed
financial institutions.
	   Under the proposed system, government officials would be sent to
manage a failed institution until a buyer was found or its assets
were sold.
	   Optimism about government action helped drive the broader Tokyo
Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section higher.
	   The TOPIX was up 4.47 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,234.85. The
index closed up 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, the day before.
	   Early gainers included companies with close links to the
domestic economy, which are seen as most likely to benefit from
increased consumer spending.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.345 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of
1.330. Its price fell to 110.87 yen from the previous day's 110.99
yen.

Cooperation on environment needed as China sounds alarm With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Five of the 10 cities with the world's worst air
pollution are in China. All of China's major freshwater lakes are
contaminated. A vast region in the north is being eaten away by
severe erosion.
	   China is growing increasingly aware of the deadly price it is
paying for the rapid economic growth that has brought unprecedented
affluence since it began reforms in the late 1970s _ and its
leaders are beginning to take action.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called on China Wednesday to lead
the way in environmental protection and to avoid the same polluting
energy-use patterns of major industrialized countries.
	   ``I have no right as president of the United States to ask China
to slow its economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``But as a citizen of
the world and the leader of my country, I have the responsibility
to ask us all to work together for a planet that our grandchildren
can still enjoy living in. And so do you.''
	   Clinton is expected to highlight China's environmental efforts _
and the potential for cooperation _ again in a visit Thursday to
the scenic southwestern city of Guilin.
	   There, the polluted Li River has been cleaned up and denuded
hills replanted, salvaging a picturesque landscape that has
inspired centuries of Chinese artists and now is one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations.
	   Clinton also may visit a village that has replaced wood and
coal-burning stoves with biogas generators that produce fuel by
combining pig manure and rice husks.
	   On the eve of Clinton's arrival in Beijing last Friday, the
country's top environmental official appealed for closer
cooperation, pointing to economic plans that call for a $54 billion
investment by 2000.
	   ``As two major players in the environmental field, the two
countries have broad prospects for cooperation,'' Xie Zhenhua, who
heads the country's Environmental Protection Administration, told
reporters.
	   China needs foreign technology and investment to bring pollution
under control. The United States wants China to back efforts to
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
	   By its own admission, China's environmental needs are dire.
	   In its most recent annual report on the environment, the
government warned that water pollution and water shortages were
restricting economic growth.
	   Chinese health experts attribute rising death rates from cancer
and respiratory ailments to pollution and say that smog causes tens
of thousands of premature deaths each year.
	   In addition to the lakes, pollution caused by untreated sewage
and factory waste has tainted most of China's big rivers, including
the Yangtze, the Yellow, Pearl, Huai and Yalu. Pesticides and other
chemicals are seeping into some underground water tables.
	   Due to the widespread burning of coal, acid rain affects wide
swaths of countryside, from Heilongjiang in the northeast to Yunnan
in the southwest. Forests in Japan and Korea have been hit too.
	   Some of the worst damage has been caused by farming and logging
on land vulnerable to severe erosion.
	   This spring, residents of Beijing and other eastern cities were
dismayed to discover that April showers that usually cleanse the
city of its cloak of winter dust were actually mud baths.
	   The muck that pattered down from yellow skies was raised by
massive dust storms far to the northwest on the loess plateau. The
storms were worse than usual because of widespread digging of wild
licorice plants by hungry farmers in some of China's poorest
regions, according to reports in the state-run media.
	   Government officials hastened to reassure city residents that
the rain was not ``polluted,'' just muddy.
	   But in cities with air as dirty as Beijing's, where at least
nine days out of 10 the view of encircling mountains is utterly
obscured by a thick haze, any extra dust is too much.
	   ``Yellow Sand Envelops China North of the Yangtze: Dust Storms
Sound Environmental Alarm,'' the newspaper Beijing Youth Daily said
in a front-page headline.
	   Nearly 500,000 square kilometers of the loess plateau is washing
or blowing away, depleting the soils in one of China's potentially
most fertile regions.
	   Further north, grasslands in Inner Mongolia are being stripped
bare by overgrazing and planting.
	   Despite a massive program to reseed and reforest _ anchoring the
soil and preventing further erosion _ the government predicts it
will take until the middle of the next century to bring the problem
under control.
	   Other cleanups are showing faster results.
	   China's Environmental Protection Administration noted
``remarkable achievements'' in cleaning up the putrid Huai River
after thousands of heavily polluting small factories were ordered
to close.
	   Shanghai has embarked on an ambitious program to clean up fetid
Suzhou Creek and to significantly improve air quality.
	   Beijing, along with other major cities, has banned leaded gas,
tightened emissions tests and ordered that all new cars beginning
next year must be fitted with catalytic converters.
	   Yet, a fair share of the heavy trucks that lumber into cities
from the countryside still belch out dark clouds of exhaust.

Argentine celebrations end on sour note with rock-throwing

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Celebrations of Argentina's World
Cup second-round victory over England collapsed into rock-throwing
by rowdy youths whom police dispersed with tear gas and a water
cannon.
	   Authorities said at least 20 people were injured in the
disturbances Tuesday night that lasted more than an hour around the
soaring Obelisk, a Buenos Aires monument that serves as a rallying
point for fans.
	   The violence tainted what had been a largely peaceful outpouring
by thousands of Argentines that paralyzed rush hour traffic in the
capital after England was knocked out of the World Cup 4-3 on
penalties.
	   Tens of thousands took part in nighttime celebrations in the
capital as similar scenes played out across the country: people
poured into streets, doused each other with beer and threw toilet
paper over trees.
	   The violence began about two hours after the game finished, well
after thousands of celebrants left the area around the Obelisk.
	   ``People who had been here since the beginning of the game were
drunk,'' complained one bystander, Ernesto Molina, 22, leaving the
scene. ``They began to throw rocks and fight among themselves.''
	   Television news coverage showed youths shattering windows in a
television van and trying to wrench open the doors as police moved
in.
	   Police had no immediate reports on arrests, but at least two
youths could be seen being led away by police amid flying bottles,
trash cans and metal bars hurled from a moving crowd.
	   At least two police could be seen stumbling away, one holding
his head and the other limping. One man wearing an Argentine
blue-and-white jersey was seen walking away with a bloodied head.
	   Marcelo Muro, a spokesman for the municipal medical service said
14 injuries had been counted, but he had no information on their
severity.
	   Hundreds of police in orange vests converged on the plaza as a
truck with a water cannon whirled around the streets, shooting
streams of water on fleeing youths. But many remained, taunting
police amid the beat of drums and some television cameras nearby
caught one group of youths trying to pry open the metal grates of a
downtown shop.
	   Some dazed celebrants seemed to have been caught up in the
disturbances, including a mother carrying a child in her arms who
could be seen crying as she fled.
	   Earlier, the Argentines reveled in their victory by dancing in
the streets amid showers of confetti and shouts of
``Ar-gen-tin-a!''
	   One young man hung precariously out a window at the top of the
spire, waving the Argentine flag. Others leaned from bus windows,
shouting and screaming.
	   This time, Argentina didn't need Diego Maradona or the ``Hand of
God'' to beat England. It required a shootout, however, after a 2-2
draw to get to the quarterfinals.
	   It was another bitter defeat for England, which played valiantly
after David Beckham was ejected two minutes into the second half.
	   The match was closely watched by many mainly because of
Argentina's 1986 quarterfinal victory on Maradona's punched-in goal
and due to the war over the Falklands Islands in 1982.
	   That year, the former military government in Buenos Aires tried
to end Britain's presence on the Falklands, known in Argentina as
the Malvinas. Britain's possession of the small South Atlantic
sheep-raising islands remains a sore point with Argentina.
	   ``Because of the problems we've had in the past, this was
important victory,'' said Juan Carlos Riquelme, a doorman who
cheered the victory as he watched on a small TV set.
	   At The Shamrock pub, some 25 English fans, outnumbered by
Argentines, endured the nail-biting, chain-smoking drama played out
on a big screen. They made a quick exit amid Argentine cheers. For
some, it was more than a soccer match. One Argentine TV station
briefly broadcast the headline: ``The Malvinas are Argentine''
	   ``I'm disappointed with the outcome. The lads did the best they
could but it's not the first time we've lost that way to
Argentina,'' said David Deadman, 26, of Deal, England.
	   Wearing an England jersey, he held back tears as he walked away.

U.S. eases trade curbs on Thailand in intellectual property deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United States will ease trade curbs
imposed on Thailand a decade ago as part of a new agreement by the
Southeast Asian country to protect intellectual property rights.
	   The U.S. Embassy announced that the U.S. and Thai governments
have concluded an action plan to strengthen protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights, long demanded by
Washington, to be implemented during the rest of 1998.
	   The agreement was announced following meetings Tuesday between
Thai leaders and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who is on a
tour of four Asian nations to assess the regional economic crisis.
	   As part of the agreement, the United States will restore
Thailand's duty-free access to the U.S. market for artificial
flowers, some jewelry and certain wooden furniture.
	   Duty-free access for 20 Thai products was revoked in 1989
because of intellectual property right violations, including mass

England soccer team praised for bravery after World Cup defeat by Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with more comment from England coach; no UPPICK
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Heroes,'' declared a banner headline in the
tabloid Express newspaper Wednesday after England's World Cup dream
disintegrated in a nail-biting 4-3 penalty shoot-out with
Argentina.
	   The story of England's defeat Tuesday night in St. Etienne,
France, dominated the front pages of the nation's tabloids, which
tried to console the disappointment with praise for the team's
efforts in playing the second half of the game one man short and
succeeding in forcing Argentina into overtime and penalty shots.
	   The Daily Mail blamed the failure on star player David Beckham,
who was sent off the pitch moments after the second half began for
tripping up an Argentina player who had just fouled him.
	   His ``moment of lunacy'' and ``petulant act of retaliation''
shattered England's dream, the Daily Mail said.
	   ``His teammates staged one of the most courageous rearguard
actions in the tournament's history,'' the newspaper added.
	   About 28 million people were estimated to have watched England's
defeat on British television, causing one of the biggest power
surges ever recorded, said the National Grid, which operates the
nation's network of power lines.
	   ``The surge at half time (2,100 megawatts) was equivalent to
that reached in 1985 during an episode of ``Dallas'' when JR was
shot,'' National Grid spokesman Sean Regan said.
	   But the figure fell short of the biggest power surge ever
recorded, which occurred during the World Cup semifinal between
England and Germany in 1990, he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who watched the game on
television in his Downing Street home with his children, praised
the England team.
	   ``They showed the English spirit at its very best,'' he said.
	   Within an hour after the game, bookmaker William Hill had
already opened the betting on who will succeed England coach Glenn
Hoddle.
	   ``It's difficult to blame Glenn Hoddle for any defeat inflicted
in this manner but he may well decide to step down after a
disappointment of that nature,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham
Sharpe.
	   ``I don't know if destiny was against us. Everything went
against us. But it is not a night for excuses, it is a night for us
to be proud,'' said Glenn Hoddle, close to tears after the game.
	   Later, he told SKY News that he doesn't blame any of the players
for the loss.
	   ``We have given absolutely everything, and I'm sure the nation
have realized and seen that with their own eyes and it's just a
sad, sad evening for English football,'' Hoddle said. ``It's a
football match at the end of the day. It's not life and death.''
	   ``But for the nation and ourselves, it'll be a horrible wakening
tomorrow morning. I think that's when it will really hit
everyone,'' Hoddle said.

Hong Kong marks year of reversals in subdued handover anniversary 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A subdued Hong Kong on Wednesday marked the
first anniversary of its return to China, confident that the
mainland would let it manage its own affairs but increasingly
uncertain of its ability to do so.
	   A harbor-side flag-raising ceremony on the site of last year's
handover ceremony and an all-star variety show offered Hong Kong's
6.5 million people a colorful spectacle.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin was to attend an evening banquet
in honor of the anniversary.
	   Jiang, fresh from his summit with President Clinton in Beijing,
also was to dedicate Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion international
airport before going home Thursday. Clinton was to arrive at the
airport just hours later for a brief visit ending his tour of
China.
	   Mindful of the territory's economic woes, officials this year
were spending just a fraction of what they spent a year ago to
celebrate the handover.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, speaking to an audience that
included Jiang at the start of the variety show, praised China's
non-interference in Hong Kong.
	   Jiang said that China's formula of ``one country, two systems''
was ``a guarantee for Hong Kong's prosperity, a model for the
return of Macau and the solution to the Taiwan issue.''
	   Macau, a Portuguese territory for more than 400 years, returns
to China next year. Taiwan is perhaps the most contentious issue of
all. The island categorically rejects reunficiation with China
under similar terms as Hong Kong.
	   The first year under Chinese rule proved to be just the opposite
of what most people in Hong Kong expected.
	   There were widespread fears that China would limit Hong Kong's
political freedoms, but confidence that the territory's economy
would continue humming.
	   China has kept hands off politically. However, Hong Kong's
confidence in its near-legendary economic prowess has been deeply
shaken by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Even such a determined foe of Beijing as Martin Lee, Hong Kong's
de facto opposition leader, acknowledged that the worst
pre-handover fears have not come true.
	   Lee, writing Wednesday in the English-langauge South China
Morning Post, cited examples of what he said were efforts to
undermine political freedoms. However, he said that Hong Kong
residents responded with ``courage and conviction,'' including a
record election turnout.
	   ``In this historic first year as part of China, Hong Kong people
_ who many had long suggested were interested only in their wallets
_ shattered the myth they cared nothing for their rights and
freedoms,'' Lee wrote.
	   But their wallets clearly were emptier than they expected.
Unemployment soared to a 15-year high of 4.2 percent, and was
expected to go higher. The stock market's key index dropped by
about half, and the economy plummeted into recession.
	   Many people expected it to get worse before it got better, and
officials said there was little they could do because the territory
was suffering the effects of a region-wide economic downturn.
	   Tung, Beijing's choice to run Hong Kong, expressed confidence
that Hong Kong would be among the first to rebound from the
economic downturn, but polls indicated people were souring on his
leadership.
	   A poll released shortly before the anniversary indicated Hong
Kong residents thought he was doing a worse job than the last
British governor, Chris Patten.

Japan frets as China basks in limelight of Clinton visit luncheon, not a press conference 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS last graf to clarify that Foley was speaking at a
By JOJI SAKURAI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ So there he is, ally No. 1, shaking hands with
China's leaders, hailing them for their efforts to ease Asia's
financial crisis, pledging closer ties in the future.
	   As President Bill Clinton swings through China, leaders in Tokyo
are watching from the sidelines and beginning to worry that their
biggest neighbor may be stealing their best friend.
	   And, in the middle of its worst recession since World War II,
Japan needs that friend.
	   China has always weighed heavily on the Japanese mind, but
Clinton's decision not to visit Japan on his way back has generated
a good deal of fretting here.
	   Japanese newspaper editorials have written ominously of ``the
new U.S.-China era'' and ``America and China's new partnership for
the 21st Century.''
	   To make matters worse, Clinton on Tuesday pointedly praised
China's leaders for their role in keeping Asia's financial crisis
from getting out of hand, calling China a ``force of stability.''
	   He then prodded Japan to do more to boost its laggard economy.
	   For Japan, there is more at stake than pride.
	   Experts have long predicted that it could be just a matter of
time before China's steady march toward free-market liberalization
and increased democracy will make the world's most populous nation
the dominant economic power in Asia.
	   To many here, Clinton's overtures toward China are more proof
that the United States and other countries are increasingly eager
to throw in their lot with Asia's awakening giant.
	   ``The Japanese should be worried,'' said Gregory Clark, a
professor of politics at Tokyo's Tama University. ``We could be
back in the 1930s where America had to choose between Japan and
China _ and chose China.''
	   Clark acknowledged that while the United States' foreign policy
in Asia has for decades focused on its ties with Japan, it has been
careful to keep its options open.
	   But now, he said, Washington is ``beginning to play the other
option.''
	   Playing the other option could mean stepping up efforts to turn
China into a major trading partner, a move that would boost China's
economy and help it challenge Japan's pre-eminent position in the
region.
	   Closer U.S.-China ties could also lead China to rely more on the
United States for its infrastructure needs, squeezing out Japanese
companies that have long done business there.
	   Still, not all experts agree Clinton's visit to China
necessarily heralds a significant shift in the Asian balance of
power.
	   Many analysts say that while Japan's international standing is
low now, it will revive as soon as the economy picks up.
	   That economy, they note, still dwarfs that of China, and the
U.S.-Japan military alliance remains crucial to regional stability.
Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.
	   ``Japan is still America's closest ally in terms of security,''
said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg. ``In
terms of the security arrangement, China is no comparison.''
	   Much of the problem Japan is having with Clinton's visit is its
timing.
	   The visit comes as Japan is struggling to come out from under a
tidal wave of international criticism _ much of it from the United
States _ over its fumbled attempts to get out of recession.
	   But Japan also still holds bad memories of the ``Nixon shock,''
when, without prior consultations with Tokyo, President Richard
Nixon made his historic trek to Beijing in 1972.
	   The United States has scrambled to allay fears that Clinton's
overtures to China mean Washington is downgrading its relationship
with Japan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Tokyo this
week to smooth any ruffled feathers, and on Tuesday, America's
ambassador to Japan, Thomas Foley, went out of his way to be
reassuring.
	   ``I am a bit puzzled that warmer U.S.-China ties (are seen by
some to) somehow undermine the U.S.-Japan relationship,'' Foley
said at a luncheon Tuesday.

Singapore Airlines to give frequent flyers miles for economy class 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines will begin offering its
economy class passengers a frequent flyer miles program, which has
been limited so far to first and business class travelers, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Beginning in February 1999, all SIA passengers will earn air
miles on SIA and SilkAir flights, as well as on flights with SIA's
alliance partners: Lufthansa, Air New Zealand, Ansett Australia and
Ansett International.
	   SilkAir is the holiday operator arm of Singapore Airlines.
	   SIA's marketing director Huang Cheng Eng told The Straits Times
that the new program will also offer some additional benefits and
privileges for frequent flyers.
	   Details of the program will be revealed in October, but are
likely to include more personalized service on the ground and in
the air.

McGwire ties home-run record 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire tied Reggie Jackson's record for
most homers before the All-Star break, hitting No. 37 in St. Louis'
6-1 loss to Kansas City on Tuesday night.
	   McGwire hit a 472-foot (144-meter), upper deck shot off Glendon
Rusch in the seventh inning against the Royals, who were playing in
St. Louis for the first time since the 1985 World Series.
	   Jackson had 37 homers in 92 games for Oakland before the 1969
All-Star break, but hit only 10 more the rest of the season.
McGwire has 37 homers in 81 games, with five remaining before next
Tuesday's All-Star game in Denver.
	   McGwire, who is on pace to break Roger Maris' record of 61
homers, also doubled in the first and singled in the fourth.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Expos 4 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra singled to extend his hitting
streak to 21 games _ the longest in the majors this season _ and
Damon Buford was 3-for-3 with three RBIs as Boston beat Montreal.
	   Steve Avery (5-2) allowed two runs and four hits over six
innings to rebound from his worst outing of the year. Tom Gordon
pitched the ninth for his 24th save.
	   Carlos Perez (6-8) picked up his fourth consecutive loss,
getting no help from fielders that made four errors and countless
misplays in their first regular-season game at Fenway Park. He
allowed six runs (three earned) on nine hits in five-plus innings.
 &UR; Athletics 12, Padres 10 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Mike Blowers had a two-run single as the
Oakland Athletics scored four in the eighth to complete their first
winning month in two seasons.
	   Jason Giambi drove in three runs and Ben Grieve hit his 12th
homer for the A's.
	   Wally Joyner had a three-run homer and five RBIs for the Padres.
Greg Vaughn and Carlos Hernandez also homered for San Diego.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Pirates 0 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Brian Moehler pitched a five-hit shutout for his
first road victory this season, and the Detroit Tigers won in
Pittsburgh for the first time since the 1909 World Series.
	   The Ty Cobb-led Tigers lost two of three in Pittsburgh that year
and went on to lose the World Series in seven games as Honus Wagner
outhit Cobb .333 to .231.
	   Eighty-nine years later, another Pittsburgh shortstop, Lou
Collier, played a prominent role by booting an apparent
inning-ending grounder in the seventh that led to two Tigers' runs.
 &UR; Blue Jays 6, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens struck out a season-high 11 and Jose
Canseco and Carlos Delgado hit consecutive homers for Toronto.
	   Clemens (9-6) pitched a six-hitter and walked one. It was his
second complete game of the season and 111th of his 15-year career.
	   The Blue Jays scored all their runs on four homers, including
two-run shots by Darrin Fletcher and Alex Gonzalez. Mets starter
Rick Reed (9-5) lasted just four innings and left trailing 6-1.
 &UR; Reds 6, Twins 3 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Willie Greene hit a three-run homer and the
Cincinnati Reds won their season-high, fifth straight game.
	   Brett Tomko (7-6) got his second consecutive win in interleague
play after losing five straight to National League opponents. He
gave up three runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings, and Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his 22nd save.
	   Minnesota starter LaTroy Hawkins (4-8) allowed 11 hits and six
runs in 3 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Braves 7, Devil Rays 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Andres Galarraga homered in his
first two at-bats after missing five games because of a sore back.
	   The homers were the 26th and 27th of the year for Galarraga, who
has five two-homer games this season and 24 in his career. Both
came off Tony Saunders (1-9), who was 3-0 against Atlanta as a
rookie with the Florida Marlins last season.
	   Denny Neagle (9-6) allowed five hits in six innings to win for
just the second time in his last seven decisions.
 &UR; Astros 17, White Sox 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou each hit two homers and
the Houston Astros beat up another AL team, routing the Chicago
White Sox in their highest-scoring game since 1995.
	   The Astros, coming off two wins at Cleveland in which they
outscored the Indians by a total of 21-8, set a season high with 18
hits. They had not scored more since setting a team record with 19
runs on June 25, 1995, against the Cubs.
	   Houston improved to 9-3 against AL clubs. The Astros have
outscored their AL opponents 57-13 in their last five wins in
interleague play.

Koala numbers declining as habitat makes way for development 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Koala numbers have dwindled to
between 45,000 and 80,000 from several million at the turn of the
century, the Australian Koala Foundation said Wednesday.
	   Launching the organization's self-proclaimed Save the Koala
Month, spokesman Ann Sharp said governments, forestry industries
and building developers must make protecting the marsupial's
habitat a top priority.
	   ``The koala is a national icon and everybody loves them but we
don't think saving their habitat necessarily translates to having
healthy and happy koalas in the bush,'' Sharp said.
	   As much as 80 percent of the koala habitat has been destroyed
since white settlement in 1788, and little of the remaining 20
percent is protected, she said.

ST. LOUIS: interleague play. Marlins 7, Orioles 5 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Baltimore, Cliff Floyd drove in four runs as the Florida
Marlins rallied from a five-run deficit to hand the Baltimore
Orioles their seventh straight loss.
	   Derrek Lee doubled in the go-ahead runs in the seventh inning
following a two-out intentional walk to Floyd, whose four RBIs
matched a career high. The Marlins trailed 5-0 after two innings
before rebounding for only their 10th road win in 38 games.
	   Rafael Palmeiro homered from the Orioles, who tried a new lineup
to shake up the offense but fell a season-high nine games under
.500. After getting seven hits in the first two innings, Baltimore
managed only one more hit the rest of the way.
 &UR; Yankees 9, Phillies 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, David Cone struck out 11 and pitched a five-hitter
to become the AL's third 11-game winner.
	   The Yankees, swept in a three-game interleague series last
season in Philadelphia, beat the Phillies for the first time since
the fourth and final game of the 1950 World Series.
	   Darryl Strawberry hit a solo home run and an RBI single for the
Yankees.
	   Cone (11-2) came within one out of recording his first shutout
of the season. Scott Rolen doubled with two outs and Jon Zuber
followed with his first home run.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Rangers 1 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Darren Dreifort allowed three hits over
eight innings and Adrian Beltre hit his first major league homer as
the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Texas Rangers.
	   Dreifort (4-5) retired the first 13 batters before Will Clark's
double in the fifth inning. He struck out seven and walked none to
help the Dodgers win for the third time in four games.
	   Antonio Osuna pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
	   Rangers starter Rick Helling (11-4) failed to become the first
12-game winner in the majors, giving up four runs and eight hits in
6 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Cubs 4
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 20th home run in June, wrapping
up the most prolific month in major league history, but the Chicago
Cubs lost for the eighth time in nine games, 5-4 to the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Tuesday night.
	   Sosa ended a four-game homerless streak with No. 33, a solo shot
in the eighth inning into the left-field bleachers.
	   Two fans from the standing room-only crowd of 39,307 ran onto
the field, reaching Sosa as he rounded second base, but security
guards quickly tackled them and escorted them off.
	   Sosa already had broken the record for homers in a month, set by
Detroit's Rudy York with 18 in August 1937. Sosa is second in the
majors in homers to Mark McGwire's 37.

Merrill Lynch opens first branch of new Japanese retail broker unit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States' largest brokerage opened the
first branch of its new Japanese retail unit Wednesday, formally
entering the market for managing Japan's massive pool of personal
savings.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of New York-based
Merrill Lynch and Co., opened the branch in the central Japanese
city of Nagano, the site of this year's Winter Olympic Games.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities plans to open 28 more branches by
the end of July and eventually increase that number to 33, the
company said.
	   Fidelity Investments Co. has announced similar plans.
	   Merrill Lynch and other foreign brokerages are expanding rapidly
in Japan, where domestic rivals have been plagued by repeated
scandals and are scrambling to adapt to sweeping deregulation.
	   The deregulation, called the ``big bang,'' is throwing open
Japan's financial markets to new companies and products.
	   Merrill Lynch and other foreigners are vying to get a piece of
Japan's dlrs 9 trillion pool of individual savings.
	   Merrill Lynch created its retail brokerage unit in February by
hiring 2,100 former employees and taking over several branch
offices of failed Yamaichi Securities Co., Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage.
	   Yamaichi collapsed in November after revealing it had more than
250 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in hidden losses.

Operations at shaky banks to resume partially 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Business began returning to normal at
five banks Wednesday as employees restored computer systems
sabotaged to protest a government order to shut down the
institutions.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the closure of the
five financially unstable banks Monday as part of the government's
effort to restore the confidence of foreign investors in South
Korea's shattered economy.
	   But bank regulators were unable to enforce the order and
operations at the five banks stalled because thousands of employees
refused to report for work, staged sit-downs, destroyed documents
and changed critical computer codes.
	   Officials warned further interruption of banking operations
could cause massive defaults of bonds and checks issued by the
banks.
	   Prosecutors obtained court-issued arrest warrants for 11 workers
at Kyungki Bank and planned to seek arrest warrants for some 70
other computer technicians and labor leaders at four other banks.
	   Prosecutors, however, said they would ``consider the
circumstances'' if the bank employees returned to work and
cooperated with bank regulators.
	   South Korea is undergoing radical reforms under stiff conditions
which came with a dlrs 58 billion bailout by the International
Monetary Fund in December.
	   The government previously had shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies, and named 55 heavily indebted
companies subject to liquidation.

England soccer team praised for bravery after World Cup defeat by Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix slug line
EDs: UPDATES with more comment from England coach; no UPPICK
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Heroes,'' declared a banner headline in the
tabloid Express newspaper Wednesday after England's World Cup dream
disintegrated in a nail-biting 4-3 penalty shoot-out with
Argentina.
	   The story of England's defeat Tuesday night in St. Etienne,
France, dominated the front pages of the nation's tabloids, which
tried to console the disappointment with praise for the team's
efforts in playing the second half of the game one man short and
succeeding in forcing Argentina into overtime and penalty shots.
	   The Daily Mail blamed the failure on star player David Beckham,
who was sent off the pitch moments after the second half began for
tripping up an Argentina player who had just fouled him.
	   His ``moment of lunacy'' and ``petulant act of retaliation''
shattered England's dream, the Daily Mail said.
	   ``His teammates staged one of the most courageous rearguard
actions in the tournament's history,'' the newspaper added.
	   About 28 million people were estimated to have watched England's
defeat on British television, causing one of the biggest power
surges ever recorded, said the National Grid, which operates the
nation's network of power lines.
	   ``The surge at half time (2,100 megawatts) was equivalent to
that reached in 1985 during an episode of ``Dallas'' when JR was
shot,'' National Grid spokesman Sean Regan said.
	   But the figure fell short of the biggest power surge ever
recorded, which occurred during the World Cup semifinal between
England and Germany in 1990, he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who watched the game on
television in his Downing Street home with his children, praised
the England team.
	   ``They showed the English spirit at its very best,'' he said.
	   Within an hour after the game, bookmaker William Hill had
already opened the betting on who will succeed England coach Glenn
Hoddle.
	   ``It's difficult to blame Glenn Hoddle for any defeat inflicted
in this manner but he may well decide to step down after a
disappointment of that nature,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham
Sharpe.
	   ``I don't know if destiny was against us. Everything went
against us. But it is not a night for excuses, it is a night for us
to be proud,'' said Glenn Hoddle, close to tears after the game.
	   Later, he told SKY News that he doesn't blame any of the players
for the loss.
	   ``We have given absolutely everything, and I'm sure the nation
have realized and seen that with their own eyes and it's just a
sad, sad evening for English football,'' Hoddle said. ``It's a
football match at the end of the day. It's not life and death.''
	   ``But for the nation and ourselves, it'll be a horrible wakening
tomorrow morning. I think that's when it will really hit
everyone,'' Hoddle said.

Cambodian airline suspends flights after mine explosion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's national airline
suspended flights Wednesday to the southwestern province of Koh
Kong until the airport runway is cleared of land mines.
	   The decision by Royal Air Cambodge, which has two flights a week
to Koh Kong, came after a military aircraft hit a mine on the
runway Friday, the second such explosion in six months.
	   ``We cannot have a plane land there until it has been cleared by
the Cambodian Mines Action Committee,'' the national demining
agency, said an airline official on condition of anonymity.
	   Koh Kong's top military official, Thmor Da, has been transferred
following Friday's blast for failing to maintain tight airport
security, the Cambodia Daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Antonov 24 transport was badly damaged, but no one was
injured. Authorities said following a runway mine blast in December
that they had carefully checked for other explosives.
	   Authorities speculated after the first explosion that the mine
was planted by opponents to strongman Hun Sen.

Cooperation on environment needed as China sounds alarm With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Fixes style for U.S. dlrs in 8th graf.
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Five of the 10 cities with the world's worst air
pollution are in China. All of China's major freshwater lakes are
contaminated. A vast region in the north is being eaten away by
severe erosion.
	   China is growing increasingly aware of the deadly price it is
paying for the rapid economic growth that has brought unprecedented
affluence since it began reforms in the late 1970s _ and its
leaders are beginning to take action.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called on China Wednesday to lead
the way in environmental protection and to avoid the same polluting
energy-use patterns of major industrialized countries.
	   ``I have no right as president of the United States to ask China
to slow its economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``But as a citizen of
the world and the leader of my country, I have the responsibility
to ask us all to work together for a planet that our grandchildren
can still enjoy living in. And so do you.''
	   Clinton is expected to highlight China's environmental efforts _
and the potential for cooperation _ again in a visit Thursday to
the scenic southwestern city of Guilin.
	   There, the polluted Li River has been cleaned up and denuded
hills replanted, salvaging a picturesque landscape that has
inspired centuries of Chinese artists and now is one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations.
	   Clinton also may visit a village that has replaced wood and
coal-burning stoves with biogas generators that produce fuel by
combining pig manure and rice husks.
	   On the eve of Clinton's arrival in Beijing last Friday, the
country's top environmental official appealed for closer
cooperation, pointing to economic plans that call for a dlrs 54
billion investment by 2000.
	   ``As two major players in the environmental field, the two
countries have broad prospects for cooperation,'' Xie Zhenhua, who
heads the country's Environmental Protection Administration, told
reporters.
	   China needs foreign technology and investment to bring pollution
under control. The United States wants China to back efforts to
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
	   By its own admission, China's environmental needs are dire.
	   In its most recent annual report on the environment, the
government warned that water pollution and water shortages were
restricting economic growth.
	   Chinese health experts attribute rising death rates from cancer
and respiratory ailments to pollution and say that smog causes tens
of thousands of premature deaths each year.
	   In addition to the lakes, pollution caused by untreated sewage
and factory waste has tainted most of China's big rivers, including
the Yangtze, the Yellow, Pearl, Huai and Yalu. Pesticides and other
chemicals are seeping into some underground water tables.
	   Due to the widespread burning of coal, acid rain affects wide
swaths of countryside, from Heilongjiang in the northeast to Yunnan
in the southwest. Forests in Japan and Korea have been hit too.
	   Some of the worst damage has been caused by farming and logging
on land vulnerable to severe erosion.
	   This spring, residents of Beijing and other eastern cities were
dismayed to discover that April showers that usually cleanse the
city of its cloak of winter dust were actually mud baths.
	   The muck that pattered down from yellow skies was raised by
massive dust storms far to the northwest on the loess plateau. The
storms were worse than usual because of widespread digging of wild
licorice plants by hungry farmers in some of China's poorest
regions, according to reports in the state-run media.
	   Government officials hastened to reassure city residents that
the rain was not ``polluted,'' just muddy.
	   But in cities with air as dirty as Beijing's, where at least
nine days out of 10 the view of encircling mountains is utterly
obscured by a thick haze, any extra dust is too much.
	   ``Yellow Sand Envelops China North of the Yangtze: Dust Storms
Sound Environmental Alarm,'' the newspaper Beijing Youth Daily said
in a front-page headline.
	   Nearly 500,000 square kilometers of the loess plateau is washing
or blowing away, depleting the soils in one of China's potentially
most fertile regions.
	   Further north, grasslands in Inner Mongolia are being stripped
bare by overgrazing and planting.
	   Despite a massive program to reseed and reforest _ anchoring the
soil and preventing further erosion _ the government predicts it
will take until the middle of the next century to bring the problem
under control.
	   Other cleanups are showing faster results.
	   China's Environmental Protection Administration noted
``remarkable achievements'' in cleaning up the putrid Huai River
after thousands of heavily polluting small factories were ordered
to close.
	   Shanghai has embarked on an ambitious program to clean up fetid
Suzhou Creek and to significantly improve air quality.
	   Beijing, along with other major cities, has banned leaded gas,
tightened emissions tests and ordered that all new cars beginning
next year must be fitted with catalytic converters.
	   Yet, a fair share of the heavy trucks that lumber into cities
from the countryside still belch out dark clouds of exhaust.

Sosa hits 20th in June 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 20th home run in June,
extending his own major league record for most home runs in a
month, with an eighth-inning shot Tuesday night for the Chicago
Cubs against Arizona.
	   Sosa ended a four-game homerless streak. He has 33 home runs
this season, second-most to Mark McGwire's 37.
	   Sosa had already broken the record for home runs in a month,
previously held by Detroit's Rudy York with 18 in August 1937.
	   With one out in the Cubs eighth and trailing 5-3, Sosa connected
on a 3-2 pitch from Arizona reliever Alan Embree, sending the ball
into left-field bleacher seats.
	   Two fans ran onto the field as Sosa rounded second base, but
security guards quickly tackled the fans and escorted them off.
	   Sosa has 40 RBIs in June. The only better RBI month in Cubs
history was in 1930 when Hack Wilson drove in 53 of his major
league-record 190 RBIs in August.

U.S. trade deficit with China forecast to hit dlrs 60 billion in 1998 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The U.S. trade deficit with China could
climb to dlrs 60 billion in 1998, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday.
	   Speaking to a U.S. business group, Barshefsky said Beijing
needed to open its markets wider to foreign goods and services if
it hoped to gain entry into the World Trade Organization.
	   She told the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce that China
had made progress in reforming its import regime, but U.S. exports
still had a tough time penetrating the mainland market. High
tariffs and other market barriers contributed to a dlrs 50 billion
trade imbalance in 1997, and that amount is likely to swell rather
than shrink this year, she said.
	   China claims the trade imbalance is only dlrs 16.4 billion,
excluding among other things trade through Hong Kong, but agrees
its surplus is growing.
	   Barshefsky downplayed the possibility of a congressional
backlash against China, saying Beijing was taking steps to address
the issue. She noted China recently made new offers to open its
financial services and telecommunications industries in a new
proposal to join the WTO.
	   But U.S. officials said the plan fell short of meeting
membership demands.
	   Another senior U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said any new offer for joining the World Trade
Organization will require broad liberalization of the financial
sector, and not just selective approvals for foreign banking,
securities and insurance firms.
	   Beijing's pledge not to devalue its currency _ while welcome _
also will not boost its chances for WTO membership, the official
said. A stable currency is in China's own interest as well as the
region's.
	   China's leaders have said the United States and other WTO
members should view the stable yuan pledge and its constructive
role in the crisis with a ``positive attitude'' when reviewing its
membership proposals.
	   The official declined to estimate when China might gain WTO
membership, a process that has been negotiated for more than 11
years.
	   The United States, China and other countries will meet July 20
in Geneva for a fresh round of WTO talks.
