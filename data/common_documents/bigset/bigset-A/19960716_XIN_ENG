<P>
Drawing on experience and lessons from the
economically-developed countries, China, with a huge population,
will by no means weaken its grain production, the president
said. China must rely on itself to feed its more than one billion
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has urged leading grain-producing provinces to make full
use of their superority to develop the economy in accordance with
the actual conditions of the areas.
</P>
<P>
"Interior grain-producing provinces have played a key role in
ensuring China's grain increases in recent years. This does not
mean that the coastal economically-developed areas can relax their
efforts in grain production and shift the responsibility of the
increase and stability of the grain output to interior provinces,"
Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
"To develop economy while reducing grain output is not an
option for China's development," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The central government has adopted a package of measures,
including holding provincial governors responsible for grain
production, to encourage agricultural producers to turn out more
market-oriented grain, and coastal areas to become more
self-sufficient in grain production.
</P>
<P>
The president called on localities to focus on improving rural
economic efficiency by combining farm production with the
processing, transport and comprehensive use of farm products, and
by integrating trade and industry with agriculture.

<P>
The market mangement system in rural China is far from perfect,
he said. There are too many intermediate links between the
production and marketing of farm produce and agriculture-related
materials. Overstock exists simultaneously with shortage in the
supply of some farm produce, and some localities blockade the
market for the sake of local interests, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
A solution to these problems is to increase reform in the
circulation system of farm produce and agriculture-related
materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts will be made to develop a socialized service
system, build an industrial management pattern which combines trade
with industry and agriculture, and to guide farmers to cooperate
in various ways, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of government support and protection of agriculture,
Jiang said, the state has set minimum purchasing prices of farm
produce, and built a grain reserve and risk fund, which have
helped stabilize the grain supply and safeguard farmers'
interests.
</P>
<P>
The president urged leading officials at all levels to use
farmland and water efficiently, which is essential to China's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
He said agricultural development in China remains at the stage
of extensive operation: on one hand, the per capita share of
natural resources is scarce; on the other hand, waste of
resources is serious. The effective use rate of water is below 40
percent, while that of fertilizer is 30 percent, much lower than
those in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A key to changing the growth pattern of agriculture is to
promote the development of science and technology and improve
farmers' skills, the president said.
</P>
<P>
In order to apply research results to agricultural production,
Jiang said agro-technicians should go to the countryside to
familiarize farmers with the research findings. And additional
secondary vocational schools should be built to train a large
contingent of low- and mid-level technicians and managers.

-- to vigorously improve social security in rural areas in the
current crackdown on crime.
</P>
<P>
"Those criminal gangs should be punished severely to ensure
that farmers live and work in peace and contentment," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
-- to ease the burden of farmers and ensure a friendly
relations between the Communist Party of China and farmers.
</P>
<P>
The heavy burden faced by farmers has become a major factor
affecting relations between the Party and farmers, and the
stability in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed the overload mostly to unreasonable demands
from local authorities, and he noted that the grassroots cadres'
work styles and the weakness of the collective economy were also
problematic.
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen the building of rural grassroots organizations
and the development of the collective economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called the building up of rural grassroots organizations
a fundamental project that is in keeping with the development of
the Party and the political power. He also asked the local
government to be selective in their choices of rural cadres and
concerned with the development of rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Those politically reliable and capable of leading farmers out
of poverty should be selected to the villagers' committees and
village-level Party branches, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the strong comprehensive economic strength of
villages is the guarantee that the grassroots organizations will
provide services for farmers.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the local government quicken the development of
township enterprises, and waste no efforts to develop farming.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the development of township enterprises
will help absorb rural surplus labor, increase input in farming
and strengthen the rural economy.

President Jiang Zemin called on local governments to pay close
attention to a coordinated development of rural economy and
society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that a stable rural society plays an important role
in China's development, noting that 80 percent of the population
lives in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Some problems exist in the current rural social development,
Jiang said, noting that some localities paid too little attention
to promoting the progress of socialist culture and ideology.
</P>
<P>
"In some places, the security conditions were deteriorating and
farmers feel little sense of safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, Jiang said it is necessary to pay equal
attention to the development of material civilization and the
promotion of the cultural and ideological progress. He urged
local governments to make improvements in the following sectors.
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen the ideological and political education among
farmers. Efforts should be made to educate farmers with
patriotism, collectism, socialism, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in some rural areas, feudal superstitions and
patriarchal clan activities are reviving. He called on local
officials to remain clear-headed about the trend, and to help
farmers learn to distinguish good from bad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympians Sure to Be Clean, Anti-doping Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Chinese Olympians in Atlanta
will be proved to be clean in the coming Olympic Games starting on
July 19, a Chinese anti-doping official said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianle, a member of Chinese Anti-doping Committee (CAC),
said China had stepped up its efforts in combating drug using
before sending its athletes to the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, China increased the numbers of random test over the
past few months, especially on the athletes in China's key events
like track and field, swimming, canoeing, rowing, weightlifting,
cycling and judo.
</P>
<P>
Yang said athletes from the above events had all been tested,
and all those medal hopefuls had received several
out-of-competition checks.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junxia, world record holder for the women's 10,000 meters,
has received 12 doping tests in the past 12 months. Le Jingyi,
world record holder for the women's 50-meter freestyle swimming,
also had six random tests and two normal examinations.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Yang said, all the members of the Chinese Olympic
delegation, whether officials, coaches, doctors or athletes, had
attended a training class on anti-doping issues. Those who failed
to pass the examination after the class had been deprived of the
right to go to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, CAC and China Doping Control Center (CDCC) had
strengthened cooperation with their foreign counterparts,
which helped improve the quality of the staff in CAC and CDCC.
</P>
<P>
Yang said an Australian anti-doping delegation invited to China
in late last June watched CAC and CDCC conduct tests on Chinese
athletes and appreciated China's efforts in battling doping.
</P>
<P>
Yang also reiterated China's 3S principle in the fight against
drugs, namely, strict prohibition, strict examination and strict
punishment.
</P>
<P>
"From 1995 to now, no Chinese athlete has tested positive in
international competitions," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang added that CDCC was an A Class laboratory, which has
passed the annual accreditation test from International Olympic
Committee for seven straight times.
</P>
<P>
First-class equipments ensured China to launch an effective
campaign against drug using, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Set for Economic Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean economist on Monday
predicted Zimbabwe is on the verge of an economic boom never seen
in decades.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates attending a one-day conference on the
Zimbabwen stock market, economist Mervyn Ellis said Zimbabwe's
economic growth over the next four years would average six
percent if the country does not experience drought periods.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is going to be an African dragon over the next five
years and will start to regain the recognition that it
deserves,'' Illis said.
</P>
<P>
He said the future of Zimbabwe is already assured, because of
the diversified economy, of one of the most developed in
sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the export performance of key
sub-sectors of manufacturing, mining and agricultural industries.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, some of the sectors which
would earn more than 100 million U.S. Dollars in annual export
earnings are horticulture, sugar, cotton, as well as tobacco,
itself already a billion-dollar industry, Illis said.
</P>
<P>
He said market reforms introduced in 1991 had led to a
substantial increase in new investment, particularly in
the export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
''As far as exports are concerned, ESAP (Economic Structural
Adjustment Program ) was a success,'' Ellis said, adding there
had also been a strong growth in imports during the first phase
of the reforms which ended last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Policewomen in Zimbabwe are
demanding they be sent on peacekeeping missions like their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the police magazine, Outpost, quoted two
senior policewomen, Chief Inspector Appollonia Chard and Assistant
Inspector Loveness Ndanga saying women could hold their own even in
hot spots like Angola, where male Zimbabwean police officers are on
United Nations duties.
</P>
<P>
The Outpost reported that policewomen were gaining confidence in
themselves as rapidly as the force recognised their capabilities and
promoted them.
</P>
<P>
For a force that employed women only as support staff before
independence in 1980, the Zimbabwe police now has a total of 1,211
females, among its 20,000 members.
</P>
<P>
Of these women, 93 hold commissioned ranks, including two senior
assistant commissioners and 31 commanders of stations, posts and
sections. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
(CMAG) Chairman and Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge has
written a letter to Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi seeking
permission to visit Nigeria to assess developments in that country.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said here today that there was no way his eight-member
group could recommend any action to the Commonwealth until they had
first hand information on the situation in Nigeria, which was
suspended from the Commonwealth in November last year following the
execution of human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
Ogoni leaders.
</P>
<P>
''I have written to the foreign minister saying we would like to
go to Nigeria and see for ourselves... We cannot make an informed
decision on Nigeria and we are not in a position to recommend any
definitive action until we have seen what is on the ground in
Nigeria, and that it is the only basis intelligent people make
intelligent decisions,'' said Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG, set up at the November heads of government meeting, was
mandated to investigate human rights abuses in Nigeria and monitor
progress toward a return to democratic and civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises Britain, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malaysia, New
Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> Somali Gunmen Hijack Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Somali gunmen have hijacked a
fishing vessel at Igo beach, about 350 km north of Mogadishu
three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, Farah Omar,owned by somalia, was fishing in the
Red Sea when four gunmen among its Somali employee had ordered
the captain to steer the vessel to coastal town of El-Der.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers from the Abgal clan of Aji Mahdoi Mohamed were
reportedly have been annoyed by a contract termination forwarded
to some of their co-workers on board the vessel by the ship
administration. Among the estimated 37 people on board the
vessel, 5-7 foreigners from Tanzania,Italy and Portugal are the
crew members of the ship.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the gunmen are demanding for a huge
amount of money for the release of what they called the illegal
fishing vessel.
</P>
<P>
There are under ground negotiations continuing between the
ship administration and some representatives from the gunmen for
the immediate release of the vessel. An Italian relief agency,
CISP, based in north Mogadishu, is also reported to be involved
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been used by members from the former Port
Authority of Somalia's late regime who maintain a good relation
with Italian companies ever since the late regime was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
According to sources who asked to be unidentified, the ship
has also been smuggling weapons into different parts of Somalia
while on the other hand it took part in the drug trafficking
operations across the world.
</P>
<P>
Speculations are going on in north Mogadishu over the case of
the hijacked ship. The Islamic courts are also believed to be
involved in the ship release efforts, however, north Mogadishu
politicians are, on the other hand, believed to be thinking of
ways to re-nationalize what they called the ship illegally used
by Italian mercenaries with the support of Somali fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1993, the same ship Farah Omar, was hijacked by
Somali gunmen in the coastal lines of the northeastern regions.
After serious negotiations, the ship administration paid 500,00
U.S. Dollars as a ransom and as what they called marine borders
violations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at lesast three people were killed and seven others
were wounded when the forces of Mohamed Farah Aidid and those of
Osman Hassan Ali Atto have exchanged heavy fire in Bosnia
vicinity of south Mogadishu yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to radio Osman Atto, the fighting was ignited when
the street fighters of General Aidid launched an attack on their
front line defense positions.
</P>
<P>
The radio claimed to have repulsed back the militiamen of
General Aidid, capturing one land rover vehicle mounted with a
heavy machine gun. However, there's no independent confirmation
over the claim. And there is no word yet from the government of
General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Despite yeterdays' clashes, the remaining front lines along
the green line and Medina neighborhood were quiet as the opposing
militiamen still remain at defensive positions in full alert.
More than 50 people believed to have died and hundreds of others
were wounded in the fightings since the beginning of this month.

NICOSIA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
today strongly denounced the coup d'etat against the former
legitimate President of the Republic Archbishop Makarios on the
occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the July 15, 1974 coup.
</P>
<P>
The coup, engineered by the military Junta ruling Greece, led
to the Turkish invasion five days later and the seizure of the
northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Makarios was the first President of the Cyprus
Republic, which gained independence from Britain in 1960 after a
four-year liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and the island's other officials attended
this morning a memorial service conducted by the Primate of the
Cyprus Church Archbishop Chrysostomos for those who died during
the coup.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the memorial service, President Clerides
denounced with abhorrence the military coup that toppled Makarios
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only with unity and cooperation with the
Greek government and the Greek people, the Cypriot hellenism
could secure a safe future.
</P>
<P>
Serenes sounded in Nicosia at 8:20 a.m. local time today to
mark the start of the July coup.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives held a special session today to
condemn the July coup and the Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, House President Spyros Kyprianou said
"it is our duty not to forget our recent history and not to hate
one another."
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "we should avoid the mistakes of the past
and bring forward our virtues so that we shall never allow
similar conditions to prevail."
</P>
<P>
He noted that what is needed to face national dangers is
unity.
</P>
<P>
Local radio and TV stations carried special programs to
commemorate the anniversary, while papers devoted their
editorials to the occasion and published photos, reminiscences of
personal experience or articles on the July 15 events.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a campaign began Sunday to collect as many
signatures as possible for a petition to be sent to the United
Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left here today for Moscow on a three-day visit to Russia, during
which he will hold talks with Russian senior officials on the
latest developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The visit is considered part of Egypt's diplomatic efforts to
protect the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will deliver a message from President
Hosni Mubarak to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and hold talks
with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Moscow, Moussa will underscore the exigency
of commitment to the land-for-peace principle set out by the
Madrid peace conference in 1991 and the relevant U.N. resolutions
which call for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab land,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes prior to Mubarak's visit to the United States,
slated for the end of July to balance the Egyptian endeavor to
shore up the peace.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will underline the Russian and European role in the
Middle East peace process and urge them to make more efforts to
revitalize the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has
reiterated that the great achievements made over the past years
since the Madrid peace conference should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also said it is ready to make constructive
contributions to pushing forward the peace march and creating the
common ground for improving the atmosphere in the region so that
the stalled negotiations would re-start.

<HEADLINE> Educational Level Low in Greek Rural Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One in four Greeks living in rural
areas has not finished elementary school, while 75 percent of
those living in these areas have not completed the nine-year
period of compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The results of the most recent census conducted in the country
show that illiteracy is widespread, mainly among women. University
professor Maria Iliou said Greece has one of the highest women's
illiteracy rates in the developed world and even among third world
countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 80 percent of those who were illiterate were women,
while one out of two women living in the Greek rural areas was
considered illiterate. Today things have improved, but the number
of illiterate women in the provinces remains quite high.
</P>
<P>
It seems that illiteracy and poverty are closely connected in
Greece. B. Tsaggos, also a university professor, who conducted a
recent study on this issue, has noted that illiteracy is
widespread in remote areas of the country, where the standard of
living is very low.
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of these areas, he said, suffer from food
shortages, lack of proper medical care and are plagued by
unemployment. In addition, their children have very little or no
access to education of an acceptable standard.
</P>
<P>
Another factor which appears to cause illiteracy is the
disappointment experienced by many children at school. According
to Iliou, the school system puts a high level of pressure on
children, especially those from low socio-economic backgrounds. As
a result, most of these children drop out before finishing the
government's compulsory nine-year education period.
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy, however, does not exist only in provincial areas.
Recent studies conducted in some of the poorest districts of great
Athens area reveal that 25 percent of those living in Nikaia near
Piraeus were officially illiterate, while 45 percent dropped out
of school after completing elementary education. The area has a
population of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
In Perama, another suburb of Athens, 15 percent of children
drop out before reaching secondary school, and 10.3 percent leave
during secondary school.
</P>
<P>
Similar results have been recorded in another four areas in
western Athens, where there are large Gypsy communities. According
to the Education Ministry, Gypsies have the highest illiteracy
rate among groups in the country.

<HEADLINE> China's First Automobile Works Turns out 2.45 Million Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Today is the 40th anniversary of
China's First Automobile Works (FAW), which has produced 2,454,480
automobiles in the four decades, accounting for one-fifth of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
The company, in northeast China's Jilin Province, is China's
largest automobile producer, with annual production of 360,000
automobiles, more than ten times the output when it began
production.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the company started in 1953, and three
years later, it released the Jiefang truck, thereby ending China's
lack of domestic-brand automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The company now produces small cars and larger sedans, and can
turn out more than 200 types of automobile.
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of next century, FAW is expected to
manufacture one million automobiles each year, with annual sales
reaching ten billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Greece: EU's Ban on Live Animals Export Too Harsh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that the European
Union's eight-day ban on the export of live animals from Greece
was "excessive, unjustified and harsh."
</P>
<P>
The ban, imposed Friday, came after two cases of foot and mouth
disease were reported earlier this month in the country's
northeastern prefecture of Evros.
</P>
<P>
It applies to the export of live animals, fresh meat and their
by-products.
</P>
<P>
Two European Commission experts met with their Greek
counterparts at the Agriculture Ministry in Athens earlier today,
before traveling to Evros to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that veterinary services in Evros region had
culled a further 30 animals as a precautionary measure following
the detection of another case of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The northern Greek prefectures of Drama, Kavala and Serres
stepped up measures Friday to prevent the spread of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls On Nation to Fight Environmental Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called on the whole nation to increase efforts at halting present
trends in China's environmental pollution and to improve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national environmental protection conference,
which opened here today, the Chinese premier pointed out that
China established environmental protection targets through 2010
that were approved earlier this year by the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
These are the basis of China's attempt, by the year 2000, to
halt the worsening trend in environmental pollution and ecological
damage and to improve the environment in some cities and
regions. Over the next fifteen years, China will attempt to stop
environmental deterioration and see improvements in the urban and
rural environment.
</P>
<P>
"With the change in economic system and economic growth mode,
the strategy of invigorating the country through science and
education, and the strategy of sustainable development, as well as
the increasing of national strength and joint efforts, we are
confident that the goal of environmental protection can be met in
the 15-year period," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that priority should be given to improving
people's awareness, especially that of leading officials, and
since many existing environmental problems have been caused by
improper or lax management procedures, it is important that
improvements in environmental protection start with strict
management.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis should be placed on industrial pollution prevention
and control, which accords with the country's situation, the
premier said. Increasing the management of public drinking water
sources and watersheds, for example, is an urgent matter, and it
is important that we focus on the protection of drinking water
sources and designate drinking water source protection areas.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the prevention of environmental pollution relies
ultimately upon science and technology, the optimal use of
industry and its product mix, and the change from the extensive
mode of economic growth to the intensive mode. The former has been
the fundamental cause of environmental pollution and ecological
damage.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that attention should be paid to preventing the
moving of polluting industries and products from cities to rural
areas, or from the developed eastern part of the country to the
developing central and western parts while accelerating their
economic development, but must not damaging the ecology in the
process of exploiting natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Li said that investment in environmental protection projects
must be gradually increased, and that it is an important function
of governments at all levels. Local governments should incorporate
the goals and measures of environmental protection into their own
master plans for economic and social development. In doing so, and
in readjusting industrial structure and distribution,
environmental assessments must be done to make policy decisions
better.
</P>
<P>
Clearcut results should be seen by the year 2000 in cleaning up
three major polluted rivers and three major polluted lakes and in
reducing acid rain in major acid rain areas and areas heavily
polluted by sulfur dioxide, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The rivers are the Huaihe River in central and east China, the
Haihe River in north China, and the Liaohe River in northeast
China. The three major lakes are the Taihu and Chaohu in east
China's Jiangsu and Anhui provinces respectively and the Dianchi
in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
In cities, priority should be given to controlling and
eventually stopping industrial pollution and municipal pollution
with a comprehensive management system to reduce waste water,
waste gasses, solid waste, and noise, and to improve the overall
environmental quality, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, priority should be given to pollution control
and reduction in township and village enterprises, solving the
problem of pollution caused by pesticides and chemical
fertilizers, developing more ecologically-sound farming,
afforestation on a large scale, controlling soil erosion and water
losses, and controlling desertification, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Government at various levels should increase their efforts to
protect such natural resources as fresh water, land, forests,
grasslands, minerals, and the offshore environment, and should do
better in protecting the ecology and bio-diversity, as well as in
managing the nation's territory and reasonably exploitating
natural resources, he emphasized in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Further Rural Finance Reforms Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier Zhu Rongji
has urged that financial reforms in rural areas be increased.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came when Zhu was addressing a national meeting on
the reform of rural finance system Monday, where he pointed out
that reforms of rural finance system should focus on creating a
service system consisting of various institutes, based on a
cooperative financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move will help consolidate the basic status of
agricultural sector, develop rural economy, and ensure social and
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for better management of "credit cooperatives", and
said that the Bank of Agriculture should continue to play a
leading role in rural finance, but should be turned into a
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
He also called for further rectification of the financial order
in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party central committee, added that
financial departments and governments at various levels must
strengthen their leadership and do their best to carry out the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by vice-premier Jiang Chunyun.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Jiang noted that the reform of rural
finance system must not affect the agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> US Business Inventories Down Slightly in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Business inventories in the
U.S. declined slightly by 0.1 percent in May while sales rose for
the fourth straight month, the U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that business inventories totaled a
seasonally adjusted 983.3 billion dollars in May, down from a
revised 984.5 billion in April. The original estimate of the
inventories in April was 984.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total sales in May rose by 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted
717.4 billion dollars, up from 712.3 billion dollars in April. The
sales in April were revised up from an earlier estimate of 711.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.37, down from 1.38 in April
and matching the record lows set in August and December of 1994.
It meant that it would take 1.37 months to exhaust stockpiles at
the sales rate of May.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing inventories fell 0.2 percent after remaining
unchanged in April. Inventories at the wholesale level also
declined 0.2 percent after jumping 1.2 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Retail inventories were unchanged following a 0.4 percent gain
in April.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers posted a 1.1 percent increase in sales in May
after shooting up 2 percent the previous month. Sales at the
wholesale level were unchanged following a 1.1 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales increased by 0.8 percent in May, after a 0.1
percent loss in April. But the U.S. government reported last week
that retail sales had fallen 0.2 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic analysts said that many businesses are beginning
to rebuild their inventories now to meet an anticipated increase
in demand. If demand remains strong and the restocking continues,
it could mean increased production and job gains.

<HEADLINE> Labor Shortage Threat to Zimbabwe's Tea, Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tea and coffee growers in
Zimbabwe's eastern highlands continue to face acute labor
shortages as fewer Mozambican laborers are crossing into the
country, the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growers are now concerned that a big proportion of the
crop could be lost if more of the Mozambicans are now allowed to
come and work on the estates.
</P>
<P>
Locals have traditionally shunned working on the estates as
casual laborers but stricter controls on the border and the
introduction of 20 US Dollars fee for a work permit for every
Mozambican laborer has sharply reduced flow of labor from across
the border.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, said one of the growers, Roy Richtgger, some of
those Mozambicans crossing the border were gradually moving into
the heart of the country where better job opportunities are
opening up.
</P>
<P>
He said, one farmer lost up to 80 tonnes of coffee in the past
two years and the farmers are going to face the same situation
again this year.
</P>
<P>
The picking season is nearing its peak and the whole industry,
is expecting a total crop of more than 12,000 tonnes and likely
to bring over 35 million US Dollars in terms of exports.
</P>
<P>
Problems within the industry began in 1992 with the end of the
16-year Mozambican civil war that saw the repatriation of
Mozambican migrant workers back to their country, the news agency
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> HK Western Corridor Railway Discussed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The economic panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region has discussed here Hong Kong's Western Corridor Railway and
the transfer of assets of the British Hong Kong Government.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth panel meeting which was held here in July 14-15,
the panel members explained that the panel has a positive attitude
toward construction of the Western Corridor Railway, a major
project of cost and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Because its efficiency is closely linked to the infrastructure
and economic development of China's inland areas, the British side
should increase its ties and consultation with the Chinese side to
design a plan as soon as possible in the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group on the construction of the Railway. The plan should
conform to cost and efficiency rules.
</P>
<P>
The panel members discussed this in relation to the British
Hong Kong Government's assets and debts along with the method of
transfer.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the government's assets and debts are an
integral part of the transfer of the power in Hong Kong and that
the British side should transfer its government's assets to the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region through the Chinese
Government in an accurate and complete fashion.
</P>
<P>
The panel urged the British side to respond to the just demand
put forward by the Chinese side in the joint liaison group and
take the best steps possible to ensure the smooth transfer of
assets.
</P>
<P>
The panel members also discussed several proposals raised by
the economic panel of the Preliminary Working Committee and
suggested methods for settlement.

<HEADLINE> New Rule Allows More Soccer Veterans in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 23 soccer veterans from
the 1994 World Cup will return to the pitch in Atlanta due to a
change of Olympic rules which allows each team to recruit three
players over age 23.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Brazilian star Bebeto, 32, whose trademark
rock-the-baby won the hearts of fans, Mexican goalie Jorge Campos
who ventures out of the penalty box time and again, and local hero
Alexi Lalas, a part-time rock musician.
</P>
<P>
Besides, four coaches from the 1994 World Cup Finals are also
walking in Atlanta for the centennial games.
</P>
<P>
The most striking figure was Yugoslavian native Bora
Milutinovic who took the helm of the US team for the 1994 World
Cup and later coached Mexico's national squad.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 men's teams, Nigeria boasts of the most players with
World Cup experience with five. Coach Jo Bonfrere of the
Netherlands was the assistant coach for Nigeria at the last World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
But it is Argentina, gold medal contender with four World Cup
veterans, that has the most experience. The Argentines, upset in
the second round of the World Cup by Romania, are hoping for a
better showing at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Among the other Olympic squads, Italy sent goalie Gianluca
Pagliuca with its Olympic team. Italy lost the World Cup final to
Brazil after Pagliuca failed to block three shotout goals.
</P>
<P>
Besides Campos, Mexico has bolstered its team with defender
Claudio Suarez and forward Luis Garcia who scored twice at the
1994 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Sun Hong Hwang, one of the quikest strikers in South Korea,
is also coming to Atlanta, and Saudi Arabia has four World Cup
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Whileas the Spanish squad has no World Cup veterans, coach
Javier Clemente led the 1994 team to the World Cup semifinals.

<HEADLINE> EU, Switzerland See Progress in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers said today that progress had been made in bilateral
economic talks with Switzerland, and they urged the European
Commission (EC) to pursue the negotiations at a sustained pace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the ministers had been briefed by
EC External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek, they called
for an agreement to be reached "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The EU and Switzerland have been negotiating bilateral accords
in various sectors since 1994. They were made necessary by
Switzerland's rejection in a 1992 referendum of membership in the
European Economic Area.
</P>
<P>
A number of difficulties face the two sides, notably in the
fields of air transport, the environment and the free movement of
people.
</P>
<P>
In the last case, for example, Switzerland is concerned about
an influx of EU workers given that already about one in seven
people in the country is non-Swiss. But both parties emphasized
today what had already been done.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Aims at 10 Billion Dollars Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has set its export
target at 10 billion US dollars during the fiscal year of July
1996 to June 1997, said Commerce Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar
here today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the trade policy for the new fiscal year, the
minister said, "we are planning major initiatives towards export
promotion and are confident that we will achieve this target due
to better crops and higher economic and industrial performance."
</P>
<P>
He said the new trade policy would facilitate trade and boost
export through streamlining of procedures and waiving certain
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would help create the environment for industry
to be more competitive to meet challenges of free trade and
increase Pakistan's share of trade in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The policy, he explained, would diversify exports and commodity
and help meet the country's obligations towards globalization of
trade under the World Trade Organization and to prepare Pakistan
for emerging challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the new policy would achieve quantum jumps in
exports through value additions, aggressive marketing and by
making "made in Pakistan" label more sought after.
</P>
<P>
The trade policy will promote eco-friendly and child-labor free
environments and make export procedures, rules and regulations
more transparent and simpler to apply, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Another important objective of this year's trade policy, he
said, was to realize further outward orientation of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that in accordance with the Prime Minister's
"Look East" policy, Pakistan was closely following the
developments in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"We are working towards joining APEC and also are establishing
a `full dialogue partnership' with ASEAN.  It is hoped that
Pakistan would be invited to the forthcoming ASEAN European summit
next year."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports in 1995-96 was about 8.6 billion dollars,
600 million dollars short of its original target.
</P>
<P>
He said, "as a result of export promotion initiatives taken by
the government, the exports during the January-June 1996 period
achieved an impressive growth of 14.9 per cent over the
corresponding period in 1995."
</P>
<P>
Exports in the previous six months from July to December 1995,
however, had shown a negative growth rate of 5.4 per cent, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Pakistan's imports during 1995-96 were 11.7
billion dollars as against 10.7 billion dollars during last
financial year resulting in an increase of trade deficit to three
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in imports for the full year was contained
to 12.5 per cent as against an increase of 21.4 per cent in the
import bill during the previous year.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Contacts Western Leaders on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein received here today a
message from U.S. President Bill Clinton, in which he reiterated
Washington's pledge to support the peace process and do whatever
within its capabilities to achieve the aspired goals.
</P>
<P>
This comes as part of King Hussein's coordination with Western
leaders on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the king and French President Jacques Chirac held
a telephone conversation in which the two leaders called for the
need to pursue the peace process and to remove any hurdle that
might come in its course.
</P>
<P>
The French president also briefed the king on the outcome of
his recent Gulf tour and his talks with Gulf Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein intensified his contacts with Western leaders
before the upcoming visit to the kingdom by the new Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the king is expected to explain to
the big powers their stands vis-a-vis Israel before he discusses
substantial issues of the peace process with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The contacts were of significant importance to the kingdom
particularly at a time when the Arab world is strongly accusing
the Israeli prime minister of destroying the peace process by
holding hardline policy of "peace with security" rather than
"land for peace."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister to Meet with Arafat Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said here today that his office is making preparations for a
meeting between himself and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a meeting with Jordanian
Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifa'i, Levy said that while such a
meeting would take place, it would still require examinations of
the subjects and frameworks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have expressed their belief that a
meeting between Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
essential before any serious talks can begin on the future of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
would be necessary before any Israeli redeployment in the
disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu, while not ruling out such a meeting, has
so far given no indications when and under what conditions he
would meet Arafat since he became Israel's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, U.S. President Bill Clinton has written
to reassure Arafat that the U.S. position on Palestinian-Israeli
peace-making was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in Gaza today that
Clinton sent the letter to the Palestinian leader following his
meeting with Netanyahu in Washington during the Israeli premier's
latest trip to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat returned to Gaza today from Egypt where he
met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, ahead of Netanyahu's
trip to Cairo, capital of Egypt, later this week.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Gaza, Arafat told reporters that he and
Mubarak discussed how to promote the peace process despite the
hard-line policies of the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is reportedly preparing a list of Israeli violations
of the Oslo peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians
to send to parliamentarians around the world.
</P>
<P>
The documents are being prepared in response to the list of
Palestinian violations of the peace accords Netanyahu presented
to the U.S. administration during his visit last week.
</P>
<P>
The violations included issuing Palestinian passports to
Jerusalem residents, starting work on a terminal at Rafiah
airport, and misusing Israeli-authorized VIP travel passes.
</P>
<P>
Israel's failure to redeploy in Hebron, to release all women
prisoners, and open the safe passage between the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank would lead the PNA's list of violations.

<HEADLINE> Financial Support to State-Owned Firms Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese finance official
said here today that state-owned enterprises are still the focus
of state banks' financial support, but that the support is
conditional.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of People's Bank of China, the central
bank, said that the bank has set 10 conditions that cash-starved
state enterprises must meet before getting financial support from
banks in speeding up their reforms.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that state-owned enterprises have long been major
beneficiaries of state bank loans and that it is understandable
that the banks will continue to provide financial support for
large state-owned enterprises with mangement expertise and
potential for technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
They will have to apply for the loans, and the banks can make
an independent decision about whether to grant the loans, or not,
Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The state banks will also be able to provide a kind of special
loans to those cash-starved enterprises that are not able to meet
the loan standards, he said, adding that the government will also
provide insurance to guarantee that the banks will not suffer any
losses.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that China's "Rules on Loans" will take effect on
August 1, and will enable banks to say "no" to any government body
or individuals who try to force them to make loans or provide
credit guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that statistics from last year show that
overdue loans and bad loans accounted for about 20 percent of the
country's total amount of bank loans, but that, de facto bad loans
and loans that went bad just accounted for three to four percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central bank started withholding one percent of
the total annual amount of bank loans as protection against bad
loans, with which about nine billion yuan in bad loans has been
written off.
</P>
<P>
The country will have to write off about 20 billion yuan in bad
loans this year, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that state bank loans increased by more than 100
billion yuan during the first half of the year, while
institutional deposits in financial institutions were up 26.5
percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Even though the amount of bank loans to the enterprises keeps
increasing, the ratio of production to sales continues to drop,
Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government's tight monetary policy did
not in fact worsen the situation state-owned enterprises are
facing at present, but rather that the difficulties were rooted in
the enterprises' poor economic performance and irrational economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
Dai added that China's money supply during the first half of
this year was appropriate, with narrow money (M1 - cash in
circulation plus deposits by enterprises and institutions) up 15
percent to 2.46 trillion yuan, and broad money (M2 - M1 plus
individual deposits and fixed deposits by institutions and
enterprises) up 28.2 percent to 6.8 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Dai concluded by saying that the central bank will continue its
efforts to slow the increase rate of broad money during the second
half of this year, and appropriately step up the growth rate of
narrow money so as to alleviate some enterprises' difficulties in
raising funds.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Optimism at 4-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Business optimism in the UK is
lower now than at any point for nearly four years, casting doubt
on the government's hopes of a sharp rebound in economic activity
before the general election, a new survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey of business expectations for the third
quarter of this year by Dun and Bradstreet (D and B), the business
information company, showed a drop in company optimism about
orders, sales, profits and jobs.
</P>
<P>
The survey of almost 1,800 business directors throughout the UK
showed optimism dropping to its lowest level since the first
quarter of 1993, with the proportion of companies expecting a fall
in new orders increasing from 34 percent in the second quarter to
41 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
Net sales optimism has also fallen, down from 53 points on the
D and B index to 47 now, while employment optimism is also down,
from 26 points to 19. Export optimism is at its lowest level since
1992.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conflicting with some recent official and
industrial figures, casts further doubt on the economic forecast
from the Treasury last week, already revised downwards, which is
now estimating growth this year at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration in optimism for new orders bodes ill for the
Chancellor's hopes of GDP growth reaching 2.5 percent in 1996.
Furthermore, the domestic economy has failed to take up the slack
left by the weakening of the export sector," said Philip Mellor,
senior analyst at D and B.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Promises to Support South Africa in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today promised South African President Nelson Mandela that
"France intends to stand by the side of South Africa in its
immense task of reconstruction" it is undertaking.
</P>
<P>
"France has confidence in South Africa. It is convinced that
your political and economic choices are good," said Chirac at a
dinner he gave in honor of Mandela in the Elysee Palace today.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France plans to increase its investments in South
Africa and he has asked "one of the big French enterprises" to
submit to him a report on how to best reinforce economic exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
France is the fourth largest investor in South Africa after
Britain, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also proposed to Mandela that France and South Africa,
"two great countries that share passions and concerns for Africa,"
put together "their thinkings and their efforts for improving the
development of the whole continent of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Chirac ended his speech with a phrase that has become the song
of praise of new South Africa: "Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika," which
means "God save Africa."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela called on French enterprises to join his
country in "eradicating the heritage of apartheid."
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has greatly opened its doors and has created an
environment favorable to a full blooming of business," he said,
adding that political liberties must be accompanied by the
improvement of people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier speech today at the University of Sorbonne, the
South African president said that he is convinced the French
people, who have stood alongside South Africa in its fight for
freedom, will help South Africa develop its economic relations

<HEADLINE> hke - Perkins Confident About Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's world and Olympic
1,500-meter freestyle swim champion Kieren Perkins said here on
Monday that he would regain his form in time for the upcoming
Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Every thing is back on track, " he said in the news conference
here, accompanied by his coach John Carew, " I will sit back and
concentrate myself at the Games."
</P>
<P>
Perkins, 22, one of the Australian hopefuls for the Olympic
golds, suffered from an iron deficiency several months ago and
experienced a disappointing trials on May in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He failed to qualify for the 200-meter, 400-meter
freestyle--his speciality, and finally booked a berth in the
1,500-meter after placing second, behind Daniel Kowalski.
</P>
<P>
Perkins also tipped his teammate Kowalski, Commonwealth Games
silver-medalist, as the hottest favourite for the 400m free title.
</P>
<P>
Perkins' time of 3:52.56 in the 400m was nine seconds outside
his own world record set at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria,
Canada in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He denied the possibility that he would replace Malcolm Allen, a
new face who finished second in the 400m free at the trials, if the
latter had not found his form at the time.
</P>
<P>
"I would sit there watching the final." he said.
</P>
<P>
Perkins said that for him, to chalk up an Olympic gold medal
this time would be more important than to shatter a world record.
</P>
<P>
"Winning is the first priority," he said, recalling the World
Championships in Perth in 1991, "I don't think that I would set a
new world mark and I am not even sure about if I can get close to
it."
</P>
<P>
Don Talbot, head coach of the Australian swimming squad, had
predicted that they could capture some 13 medals, including more
than one gold at the Atlanta Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. national security adviser
Anthony Lake left Ho Chi Minh city this morning for South Korea,
ending his three-day visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on July 13,
Lake highly appreciated the devoted cooperation by the Vietnamese
government and people in the search for American servicemen listed
as missing in action in the Vietnam war and expressed the desire
of the U.S. to make contributions to Vietnam's national
construction.
</P>
<P>
Lake was quoted by today's local official press as saying that
"a stable, prosperous Vietnam and Southeast Asia will facilitate
U.S.'s deeper involvement in economic development in the country
and the region."
</P>
<P>
Kiet told the U.S. adviser that Vietnam has always regarded the
search for Americans missing in action as a humanitarian issue and
will continue to cooperate effectively with the U.S. side in
settling the issue.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister hoped that the U.S. would do the same in the
search for Vietnamese soldiers listed as missing during the war
and Vietnam will do its best to further promote the bilateral ties
for mutual interests and for the benefit of the region.
</P>
<P>
Lake arrived in Hanoi on July 12 to pay a three-day visit to
Vietnam, the third leg of his Asia trip.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Lake met with Vietnam's leaders and high
ranking officials to discuss further promotion of bilateral
relations between the U.S. and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The two countries normalized relations one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Orders for Japan's Chip-Making Equipment Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Orders for chip-making equipment
are declining in Japan as chip producers cut supplies due to a
sharp drop of chip prices, the Semiconductor Equipment Association
of Japan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc., both major makers of steppers with
a combined 80 percent share of the world market, decided to
downsize their planned production.
</P>
<P>
Nikon will slash its planned annual production of 900 units to
about 700 units, the association said.
</P>
<P>
It said Canon's yearly increase rate has been reduced from 50
percent to 30 percent, and Auto Electric Co. estimated that the
sales of its memory testers would go down by some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It added that orders of 16-megabit dynamic random access
memories were hit hard as the U.S., followed by Japan, started to
cancel orders in spring.
</P>
<P>
However, producers of chip-making equipment remain calm in
face of oversupplies in the chip market, saying that they have
experienced similar situations.
</P>
<P>
A Nikon official said the next-generation chip after the
16-megabit devices will pull demand up again.

<P>
LUANDA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Untied States Agency of
International Development (USAID) today promised to provide
Angola with a two-year aid package worth 190 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Opening a USIAD office in Luanda, visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State George Moose declared the U.S.-Angolan
relationship has "entered a new era".
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. aid would be used to build Angola's national
economy, disarm fation fighters and repatriate refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's high time to usher the bilateral ties into a
new era as national reconciliation in Angola has started," Moose
told a press conference before closing his five-day Angola tour.
</P>
<P>
Peace process in the country torn apart by 20 years of civil
war achieved a major breakthrough when President Edouard Dos
Santos met the leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, in Libreville last
March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moose expressed the concern of the U.S. government
over the delayed peace process in Angola, urging the Angolan
government and the UNITA rebels to step up the process of the
integration of their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Moose arrived in Luanda on Thursday and met both government
and UNITA offcials before departing tonight.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan to Further Enhance Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkmen President Saparmurat
Niyatsov arrived here today on a three-day visit to Iran with an
aim to further enhance bilateral relations between Tehran and
Ashkhabad.
</P>
<P>
Niyatsov and his Iranian host Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani reviewed
important political, economic and cultural issues, as well as
regional and international problems.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen president was quoted by the official news agency
IRNA as saying that "The Tehran-Ashkhabad relations are based on
mutual respect and non-interference in each other's affairs."
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral trade and economic relations have been
inspired by the two countries' common culture, religion and
political will.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president also voiced its support to Iran's
policy for restoration of peace and stability in the region
especially in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
"The principled policy and good-neighborly ties between Iran
and Turkmenistan have resulted in strengthening regional
cooperation and expansion of multilateral relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway project, he said
that the railway has paved the ground for development of
cooperation between Europe and Asia as well as the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Association of South-East
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The 297-kilometers railway, which was inaugurated in May,
connects the landlocked Central Asian countries to the outside
world via the Iranian soil.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Rafsanjani said that the important goals of
expansion and cooperation between the regional countries would
further contribute to friendship and affinity among the regional
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the inauguration of the trans-Asian
railway, a joint commission of the two countries should be set up
for coordinating ways of better utilization of the railway and to
solve problems that are likely to crop up regarding the transit
of goods.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also stressed on further exchange of views between
the two countries within the framework of a political commission
for studying ways to exploit the Caspian Sea resources, to solve
the Tajik crisis, and to study the Chechn and Caucasus issues.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Iran and Turkmenistan should also enter into
trilateral cooperations involving a third country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks between the two presidents, the two
sides agreed to pursue bilateral issues through separate
political and economic committees.

<HEADLINE> Most UK Graduates Underused, Underpaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- More than half of UK graduates
regard themselves underused and underpaid at work three years
after leaving university, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
It is taking graduates longer to find a permanent job than
their predecessors, and one in three is employed on fixed-term
contracts, almost half of which are for less than a year, the
Institute for Employment Studies found.
</P>
<P>
The study of 1,000 graduates from Sussex University between
1991 and 1993 confirmed they were entering a much wider variety of
jobs, some not held by graduates in the past but by a school
leaver.
</P>
<P>
Those who held what they considered a graduate-level job fell
from 84 percent of the 1991 university leavers to 73 percent of
the 1993 group.
</P>
<P>
More than half considered they were not being used to their
full potential. A quarter felt very under-employed. Fifty percent
were earning less than 14,000 pounds (21,000 US dollars) a year,
the threshold for repaying the student loan.
</P>
<P>
"The graduate market is becoming more polarized with some
graduates continuing to find highly skilled, well-paid secure
jobs, while larger numbers have to make do with lower-skilled,
often temporary employment, at least initially," said Helen
Connor, who directed the research.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: First U.S. Trip Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, upon his return home this evening from his first
official visit to the U.S., hailed the agreements he reached with
the U.S. government as a success.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Ben-Gurion Airport upon
his return, Netanyahu said the five-day trip was a "good" one
that helped him reach "widespread understanding" with Washington.
</P>
<P>
During the first official visit since he assumed office in
June, Netanyahu held talks with President Bill Clinton and other
senior officials, addressed the joint session of the Congress and
met with American Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also traveled to New York where he visited the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu hailed a number of "important" agreements reached
between the U.S. and Israel on the development of ballistic
deterring systems and new anti-rocket laser systems in Israel,
joint efforts to combat terrorism and establishment of a joint
working group to search for the Israeli missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
However, during his meeting with President Clinton, the
differences between the two sides over the new government's
hardline approach toward future peace process were apparent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. failed to persuade Netanyahu to compromise his
tougher line by accepting the land-for-peace principle in order
to facilitate the continuation of peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu created three so-called pillars of his
peace policies: security, anti-terrorism and democratization of
Israel's Arab neighbors. These are expected to become major
obstacles in achieving future progress of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his planned visit to Egypt, Netanyahu stressed
the importance of Egypt in the peace process. He said that he
would invite Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to visit Israel when
the two meet in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the call issued by Jewish settler leaders today
for the expansion of the settlements in Palestinian territories,
Netanyahu said that his government had no difference with the
U.S. government on the need of the natural growth of Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "it is the government and not any
outside body to take the decisions."
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of cheerful right-wing activists turning
out to welcome Netanyahu and his entourage, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert said that Netanyahu's visit was very "positive and
constructive".
</P>
<P>
"I call it as an introduction of Bibi Netanyahu to the
American policy-makers and the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party has denounced Netanyahu's U.S. trip
as a "failure" that has destroyed the joint Israeli-U.S. efforts
to advance the peace process, anticipating a roll-back of the
bilateral ties to that before 1992 when the Labor took over
power.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Lift Closure of Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said today that he favored gradually lifting the closure
of Palestinian territories, adding, however, this will depend on
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks after a talk with Egyptian
Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Bassiouny. The two discussed issues
related to the Middle East peace process, the security situation
of the region and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a crippling closure of the Palestinian
autonomous areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a
series of suicide bombing attacks against Israelis by Islamic
militants, which have killed 58 people and wounded nearly 200
others since late February
</P>
<P>
The five-month long closure has inflicted severe hardships on
the Palestinians as it prevented tens of thousands of Palestinian
workers from returning to their jobs in Israel and barred the free
flow of goods.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
has repeatedly urged Israel to lift the blockade, but Israel
conditioned the lifting on the PNA's fulfillment of its commitment
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To counter Israel's accusation that it violated the Oslo
agreements in combating terrorism, the PNA has also prepared a
list on Israel's violations, including the closure, Jerusalem
settlements and land appropriations, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said that it would send a letter on Israeli violations
of Oslo accords to parliaments worldwide, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Israeli defense minister and the
Egyptian ambassador took place ahead of the scheduled first
official visit to Egypt by Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu late this week.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai called for closer ties with Egypt, the leading
peace-broker in the peace process, and demanded Cairo help Israel
with the search of the missing soldiers during the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Netanyahu briefed President Ezer Weizman on the
results of his U.S. trip, and discussed his upcoming visit to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he took good advices from the president who
knows Egypt better than him.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Weizman criticized Egypt for failing to promote the
bilateral ties. In late June, he also asked visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to convey his concern
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about Cairo's spearheading an
anti-Israeli Arab front.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Army to Resolutely Carry Out Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
again called on the country's military to "resolutely" carry out
the reform of France's national defense system.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in his traditional message addressed to the
armed forces on July 14, which was made public today by the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chirac also listed "the principal axes" of the
defense policy of France, which are "the adaptation of our nuclear
posture, affirmation of its European identity within a renewed
Atlantic Alliance, and a resolute engagement against the
proliferation of arms of massive destruction and for an increased
control of armaments."
</P>
<P>
"This global reform of our defense system accompanies and
completes the redefinition of our strategic choices that the new

European construction and the evolution of armaments as well as
the forms of conflict have profoundly changed the security needs
of our country," said Chirac.

<P>
He called on the French armed forces to maintain the best
capacity for carrying out operations, and the arms industries to
improve their productivity.
</P>

"I will see to it that you will have the means to fulfill your
new missions and successfully carry out these necessary
transformations on which the future security of our country
depends," said Chirac.

<P>
SEOUL, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security Advisor
Anthony Lake discussed the Korean Peninsula issue with South
Korean senior officials Sunday and urged Pyongyang to agree to a
four-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Lake, who arrived here Sunday afternoon for a brief visit, said
after his talks with South Korean Presidential Secretary for
Foreign Affairs and National Security Yoo Chong-ha that South
Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea(DPRK) should
play a leading role in easing the tensions on the Korean peninsula
and establishing a peace regime in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lake added that the U.S. will play a supplementary role on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the proposal on four-party peace talks
and called for an early DPRK response. The proposal, put forward
last April by the United States and South Korea, was aimed at
replacing the Korean armistice with a permanent peace regime. The
four parties are the United States, South Korea, DPRK and China.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has yet to make a formal response to the proposal.
</P>

PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake of 4.7 to 5.2 degrees
on the Richter scale struck Haute-Savoie, eastern France, in the
early hours today without making casualties.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring areas as far as Valais in Switzerland were also
shaken by the quake, which occurred at 2:15 local time.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake briefly cut electricity in Haute-Savoie, lightly
injured one person and slightly damaged some buildings, according
Agence France Presse reports quoting local prefecture authorities.

<P>
The Seismology Center of Grenoble said the quake was 4.7 to 4.9
degrees on the Richter scale, while the Physical Observatory of
the Earth in Strasbourg put it at 5.2 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake was Annemasse, Haute-Savoie,

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
arrived here today to begin his four-day Kenya tour aimed at
stepping up the economic integraion process in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda leader, boosted by his recent electoral success,
was met in a grand reception by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
at the Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were then heading for the presidential villa
for closed-door talks.
</P>
<P>
During the first talks since Museveni won Uganda's first ever
presidential election in May, the two leaders are expected to
seek ways of speeding up the East African Cooperation signed in
March.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to boost the already existing economic ties between
Kenya and Uganda. But in a broader context, he wants speedy
implementation of issues agreed under the regional economic pact
among Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania," one of Museveni's aides was
today quoted by Nairobi's local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say the Ugandan leader wants Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania to harmonise their tax regimes as a matter of priority
to discourage smuggling and to counter competition brought forth
by cheaper goods from beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Eager to attract foreign investors and boost the regional
economy, he also wants joint strategies on investment policies,
banking and currency rules.
</P>
<P>
Further down the agenda of the summit talks will be regional
trouble spots such as the central African states of Burundi and
Rwanda on which both Uganda and Kenya could exert their
influences.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expects to Dominate Long-Staple Cotton Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- With a good harvest in sight and
liberalization of cotton exports and imports, Egypt could regain
its traditional domination of the world market for long-staple
cotton in the 1996-97 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian English-language daily, The Egyptian Gazette, today
quoted Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali as saying that the
cotton crop is in good condition and the perennial problem with
pests has been under control this year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has planted nearly one million acres of cotton crop,
compared with 720,000 acres last year, the paper quoted officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well in the next few months before harvesting,
Egypt could reap 350,000 tons of cotton this year, an increase of
nearly 35 percent over the 260,000 tons produced last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers will be free to export their cotton under
the government's new policy, with which and a promising harvest,
Egypt could export more than 150,000 tons of cotton in the 1996-97
marketing year starting on August 1.
</P>
<P>
This volume of cotton exports will be enough to reinstate Egypt
as the dominant force in the long-staple market, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
For years, the government has diverted much valuable
long-staple cotton to the domestic textile industry instead of
exporting it and importing cheaper varieties in its place.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also imported cotton from California and Arizona
only, on grounds that cotton from other areas may carry dangerous
pests and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Wahba, an expert on cotton, said that the government
has allowed the import of short-staple cotton from Syria this
year. He said that Egypt has also been considering importing
cotton from Australia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and other areas of the
United States except California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
The expert admitted that the amount of Egyptian cotton
available for export will continue to bring prices down in the
long-staple cotton market, where they have already fallen to
around 1.30 U.S. dollars a lb.
</P>
<P>
"But if Egypt gains 60 percent of the market this year, then
other producers will get out of it and Egypt could end up
dominating the market," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices would also encourage foreign spinners to switch to
Egyptian cotton because of the quality advantage, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Receives Letter From Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received a letter tonight from U.S. President Bill Clinton, which
underlined an unchanged position of the U.S. on the Middle East
peace process, according to well-informed official sources.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to President Hrawi at the Beirut
Presidential Palace by U.S. Charge D'Affaires to Lebanon Ron
Schlycher.
</P>
<P>
"In his message, Clinton stressed that the U.S. position on the
peace process has not changed, and that his country is committed
to the principles on which the process is based," the Lebanese
sources disclosed on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
But the letter failed to specify what the principles were.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president noted that his administration gave the
priority to supporting the Palestinian track in the present
stage, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Schlycher expressed hope that progress on the Syrian track
would be achieved because it would "lead to progress in the
Lebanese track."
</P>
<P>
After conveying the message to the Lebanese president, the
U.S. charge d'affaires called on the Lebanese to participate in
the parliamentary election due to start on August 18 in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said the election would be "the best way for the
Lebanese to express their opinions and to strengthen their country
no matter whether they agree with the government's decisions."
</P>
<P>
He announced that he and the Lebanese president discussed a
five-state cease-fire monitoring committee to be set up in south
Lebanon, saying that Washington would work to ensure the success
of the committee's job.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising the U.S., France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon, is provided for in the cease-fire understanding reached
between Lebanon and Israel on April 26, which ended the 16-day
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Papua New Guinea to Take Part in Three Sports at Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea, an island
country in the Pacific, will take part in three sports at the
Centennial Olympic Games scheduled to open here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen athletes in the 32-member Papua New Guinean delegation
who were registered at the Olympic Village today, will compete in
athletics, boxing and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
"We have four boxers for the games," said Steven Kevi, who will
take part in the 63.5-kg category in the rings. Kevi, one of the
two athletes from the island nation to the Barcelona Olympic
Games, was stopped in the first round four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I would go into the second round this time," said Kevi.
</P>
<P>
The other Papua New Guinean athlete who had the Olympic
experience is Henry Kunsi, who managed to reach the quarter-finals
of the 60-kg category in the boxing tournament in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The Papua New Guineans will have no problem to face the steamy
heat in Atlanta since they are used to living in tropical
conditions. "Hot weather is not a problem for us," said Kevi.
</P>
<P>
According to Caroline Rittenberry, press staff at the Olympic
Village, a total of 3,967 athletes from 97 countries and regions
have registered in the village.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Eliminate Child Prostitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians were today urged
to exert their efforts to implement the policies and laws against
the expanding child prostitution in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Mitike George, Women's Affairs Department
Head in the Ethiopian Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs at
the opening ceremony of a three-day workshop on "child
prostitution and its problem in Ethiopia" at Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Mitike told participants that Ethiopia has endorsed interna-
tional children's rights conventions and the country's
constitution and criminal code protect children against child
abuses.
</P>
<P>
She said cooperation among various concerned organs is
required to support government efforts to mitigate the social
problem, adding that concerned government agencies, the mass
media, religious institutions, non-governmental and international
donor organizations should cooperate and exchange information and
experience in a bid to alleviate child prostitution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a paper presented at the workshop by Associate
Professor of Psychology in the Addis Ababa University Habtamu
Wondimu, there are about 90,000 prostitutes in Ethiopia of which
20 percent are aged between 12 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Habtamu said displacement due to civil war in the past,
unemployment and traditional practices are the main causes for
prostitution and indicated that the social problem could be
overcome through economic development and improvement of living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Restricting and monitoring the age of prostitutes in bars,
hotels and night clubs with undertakings to expand projects for
street children could serve as possible solutions to curb the
problem, Habtamu added.
</P>
<P>
According to Habtamu, close to one million children are forced
to join the rank of prostitutes each year across the world.

JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Two South African companies

</P>
<P>
The contracts, worth about 120 million Rand (about 28 million

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Clinton administration
officials have been cautious about the car that Saudi Arabia
authorities alleged to be the one used by the bombers for the
explosion at the Dhahran military compound last month.
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials said Sunday that they had located an abandoned
white Chevrolet Caprice Classic in Dammam, six miles from Dhahran,
a few days after the bombing, which killed 19 American soldiers
and injured several hundred American and Saudi servicemen,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration officials said it is not clear
that the car was the one involved in the bomb attack as the make
and model is the most popular in Saudi Arabia. The evidence
linking it to the bombing was tenuous, they added.
</P>
<P>
A sharp split between the United States and Saudi Arabia also
emerged Sunday as a top Saudi prince said he opposed moving
American soldiers from around Riyadh to remote desert air bases.
</P>
<P>
Comments by Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan came during a
visit by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, who was reportedly in Saudi
Arabia pressing Saudi officials to grant access to all evidence
gathered on the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Pentagon said it was to move some of 1,500
American soldiers based in the Saudi capital to bases more easily
defended against terrorist attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today authorized the United Nations military observers to
continue monitoring the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula
of Croatia until January 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council urged
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to abide by their
mutual commitments and to continue their negotiations with a view
to normalizing fully their bilateral relations, which are critical
for the establishment of peace and stability throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted the joint declaration signed on
September 30, 1992 by the presidents of both countries, which
reaffirmed their agreement concerning the demilitarization of the
Prevlaka peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The council emphasized the contribution that this
demilitarization has made to the decrease of tension in the
region, and stressed the need for Croatia and the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to agree on a settlement which would peacefully
resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Prevlaka peninsula is strategically important for both
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Security
Council established the United Nations Mission of Observers in
Prevlaka on February 1, 1996, which consists of 28 military
observers to monitor the demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported recently
that positive development has been achieved on both sides: the
Croatian side has withdrawn military personnel and removed mines
in the U.N. controlled zone and the Yugoslavia side has withdrawn
heavy weapons and eased restrictions of movement in the area.

Chinese delegation, who led 249 officials and athletes to Atlanta
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The sports minister came short of saying that China aims to
repeat the fourth-place finishing in the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
China collected 16 gold medals in the 1992 Olympics to finish
just after the Unified Team led by Russia, the United States and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The United States is expected to cash in on its home-turf
advantage to top the gold medal standings this time, with Russia
and Germany vying for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Among the new arrivals are reigning world table tennis women's
singles champion Deng Yaping, world badminton women's singles
champion Ye Zhaoying, and four-time Olympian basketballer Zheng
Haixia who at 2.04 meters is the tallest woman competitor of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the 495-strong Chinese delegation including
the gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting, diving, men's basketball
and women's handball teams are already in the USA for pre-Olympic
training or competitions.

<HEADLINE> Police Kill Leading Islamic Militant in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Police killed a leading Islamic
militant today in Assiut, some 320 kilometers south of Cairo, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted a source at the Interior Ministry as saying that
Sayed Abdel Rehim Mustafa, a local leader of the military wing of
al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, was killed when he was
on his way to a railway station to meet another member of the
group.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa opened fire first at the police when he felt that he
was being pursued, the source said. The police returned fire and
killed him.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa was carrying a forged identity card showing him as a
professor at the Faculty of Islamic Studies of Sohag University,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that the gun found on Mustafa's body
belongs to a police officer who was killed by Moslem militants in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa had been wanted for his involvement in about 20
terrorist operations in which 35 persons, including policemen,
were killed, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya has been blamed for much of the violence
in a campaign against the government since 1991. Moslem
fundamentalist militants have been trying to install a strict
Islamic rule in Egypt through the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security forces have fiercely cracked down on
Moslem militants and almost confined their operations in remote
villages in the South.

<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid said here today that the Arab world should strengthen
its cooperation with Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address at a meeting of the board of directors of

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in N. Ireland on Brink of Ruin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace process
is close to complete disintegration as a new wave of violence is
irresistibly happening.
</P>
<P>
Protestant politicians warned that loyalist paramilitaries were
primed to retaliate for the first bomb attack last weekend in the
province for two years.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as the Irish Republic Army (IRA) denied
responsibility for Saturday night's blast at a hotel in
Enniskillen, in which 17 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
It was a highly symbolic target to end more than two years of
uneasy peace in the province. The IRA carried out one of its worst
atrocities when it bombed a Remembrance Day service in Enniskillen
in November 1987, killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
All sides conceded that the Enniskillen bomb brought closer the
prospect of a return to bloodshed not seen in the province since
the IRA called for a cease-fire in 1994.
</P>
<P>
With the momentum of events building towards more conflict and
bloodshed since last week's controversial march, Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton attacked Britain for reversing a decision not
to allow hundreds of Protestants to stage the provocative march
through the Catholic area. He also blamed Britain for the violence
which followed because it had succumbed to Protestant blackmail.
</P>
<P>
However, the Irish Government requested an emergency meeting
this week between the British and Irish prime ministers. But there
are no plans for such a meeting at the moment, according to an
official from Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said
today he was determined to rebut "quite unjustified and
unwarranted criticism" of Britain and the troubled province's
police following the deterioration of the security situation.
</P>
<P>
But Mayhew told parliament he would establish a review of the
arrangements for handling the hundreds of traditional parades
which take place each summer throughout Northern Ireland and which
annually cause trouble there.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Sets Olympic Goal at Four Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland, spearheaded by
defending Olympic tennis champion Marc Rosset and world men's
gymnastics champion Li Donghua, would be happy to take four medals
back home from Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Steiner, press attache of the Swiss Sports Delegation
for the games, said that his country's medal chance would depend
on luck during the competitions.
</P>
<P>
"If we are lucky, we might take four medals," said Steiner,
"That would be a victory for us."
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has sent 119 athletes including 43 sportwomen for
the games, which starts on Friday. "We have some good athletes,
and they have chances to win medals," said the press attache.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, who fought his way to the Olympic title in Barcelona
four years ago, will begin his campaign next Tuesday. But it may
not be easy for him this time, with the threats from such big
names as world number one American player Pete Sampras, Andrei
Agassi, Crotian Goran Ivanisevic and Spaniard Sergi Bruguera --
who had won French Open title twice.
</P>
<P>
Li Donghua, a Chinese who lived in Switzerland, won the men's
pommel horse at the world championships in October of 1995 in
Japan. The veteran gymnast who is at his thirties may have a
chance to add a medal in the tally for Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland also lays its medal hope on Thomes Frischknedrt, a
mountain bike rider, Toni Rominger, a cyclist and Willi Melliger,
who is expected to finish in the top three of the equestrian
jumping event.

<HEADLINE> Nauru: Any Medal Would Be Too Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the first ever Nauruan
team to an Olympic Games said here today that their goal at the
Atlanta Games is not medals, but participation itself.
</P>
<P>
"Any medal would be too much for us," said Reuben Kun, leader
of the three-athlete Nauruan team. "Participation itself is
important enough."
</P>
<P>
Nauru has sent three weightlifters, the first athletes
representing the island nation, to compete at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are here mainly to show our national flag," Kun said. "We
are happy to be a member of the international Olympic family."
</P>
<P>
Nauru began to participate in international sports competitions
in 1990. That year, it sent a weightlifter to the Commonwealth
Games held in New Zealand. The weightlifter, Marcus Stephen,
brought back one gold and two silver medals to the Pacific island
with an area of only 21 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"We had the best medal hold ratio at the games," said Kun, also
finance minister of the tiny island nation. "One athlete, three
medals. That could be a world record."
</P>
<P>
But Kun said his athletes are not ready to capture medals at
the Atlanta Games. "We only has 10,000 people. It's like a
village in China," he said. "We can not compete with large nations
for medals."
</P>
<P>
Participation in the Olympics would encourage the young people
on the island to get more involved in sports, Kun said. "Sports
is something good for our young people. It will help them stay
healthy and build character."
</P>
<P>
He said Nauru would send a much larger team to the next Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our team to the next games would include a full 10-member
weightlifting team and athletes competing in other sports, such as
badminton, judo and wrestling, depending on what and how many
sports we can qualify," Kun said.

<HEADLINE> HK Stands for More Chance for First Olympics Medal: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading Hong Kong sports
official said here today that a slim but elite delegation
represents a greater chance for Hong Kong to win its first ever
Olympics medal at the coming 26th Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Chung Pang, chef de mission of the Hong Kong delegation here
and deputy secretary of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports Association
and Olympic Committee, made the comment in an interview with
Xinhua in the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of Hong Kong's 23 Olympians had already
arrived in the United States for pre-Games training. Others of
the 49-strong delegation will be here within the next two days so
as to participate in the official flag-raising ceremony in the
village scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 38 athletes at the last Olympics in
Barcelona, the smaller Hong Kong delegation for the Atlanta Games
is an elite combination, Pang said. "They have gone through
strict qualification procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's over-all sporting capability is no match to such
Asian sports powers as China, Japan and South Korea, the official
admitted. "With impressive performance at such international
events as the Asian Games in Hiroshima, we can say we are
somewhere at the second line," Pang said.
</P>
<P>
He pinned Hong Kong's Olympic hope on female table tennis
player Chai Po Wa, whose advance was stopped at the quarter-finals
at the last Olympic Games. Chai could pose for a spot in the last
four, if she survives from being drawn against such world-class
players as China's world champion Deng Yaping, Pang said.
</P>
<P>
Another Hong Kong official thought the other way. Yu Wing Lai,
deputy mission chief and deputy secretary of the Hong Kong Amateur
Sports Association and Olympic Committee, said Hong Kong's ace
cyclist Wong Kam Po is his favorite.
</P>
<P>
"He is younger and less famed as table tennis player Chai and
ace woman windsurfer and former world champion Lee Lai Shan. This
might help him off great pressure and come out as a surprise
winner at the Games here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Lai, a former soccer player, has participated
in three Olympics, four Asian Games and four Commonwealth Games.

<HEADLINE> All Livestock to Be Slaughtered in Evros, Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Agriculture Undersecretary
Apostolos Fotiadis ordered today all livestock in the country's
northeastern region of the Evros delta destroyed in an effort to
contain the spread of foot and mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
The order affects roughly 4,000 cattle and 3,000 sheep and
goats. The costs of the disease in the region are estimated at
some 1.5 billion drachmas (6.52 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The order said any stock breeders who do not comply with the
government decision and do not give their animals up for slaughter
will not receive compensation and will have to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
Fotiadis met with two European Union veterinary experts this
morning who visited the Evros border region in order to ascertain
the extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed an eight-day ban on the export of live animals
from Greece last Friday after two cases of foot and mouth disease
were reported earlier this month in the Evros region.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Permanent Veterinary Committee is expected to make its
final decision Friday.

<HEADLINE> New York City Taking Lead in Using Compressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New York City, the biggest city
of the United States which has been plagued by serious air
pollution, is taking lead in using vehicles that run on
clean-burning compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
There are 2,300 compressed natural gas cars, trucks and vans in
the city, up from a few dozen in the late 1980s, the New York
Times today quoted Brooklyn Union Gas Company as saying. Last
year, it became possible, in many parts of the city, to drive up
to a compressed natural gas pump and fill the tank.
</P>
<P>
Compressed natural gas vehicles remain a small portion of the
automotive field in New York and nationwide, with an estimated
66,000 in use.
</P>
<P>
"New York is poised to be on the leading edge of this (vehicles
using compressed natural gas as fuel)," Lizabeth A. Ardisana, an
alternative-fuels specialist at Ford Motor Company, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The appeal of compressed natural gas is that vehicles using
it emit one-tenth as much of several pollutants, including
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydro-carbons, as their
gasoline-powered counterparts do, with equal performance,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Environmental Protection and the
Taxi and Limousine Commission are pushing owners of the city's
12,000 yellow cabs to switch to compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Since natural gas-powered cars cost much more than gasoline-run
ones, the city is paying the difference for anyone who buys a
natural gas-powered taxi. It is also paying for conversions of
existing cabs.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection said
that the city is considering ways to get other industries to
convert.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 natural gas fueling stations have been opened to
the public around the city, and a handful of traditional service
stations have installed natural gas pumps.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Road Transport
Authority announced today that six new bus lines had been opened
since July 8, 1996 as the number of public transport vehicles
increased.
</P>
<P>
Head of the operation main section of the authority Ayalew
Woldeariam said all the six new lines are from Addis Ababa to
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of public transport vehicles has increased
to 1,232 against 1,170 in the previous year, because of the
import of vehicles by the authority. The authority imported 799
new vehicles in the past year.
</P>

According to Ayalew, the number of freight trucks of private
trade companies has also grown to 4,688 from 2,924 at the same

<HEADLINE> IOC Encourages Women's Participation in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The world sports governing body --
International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- will continue to promote
women's participation in sports, a high-ranking IOC official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference four days before the opening
ceremony of the 26th Olympic Games Friday, IOC Director-General
Francois Garrard said women's participation in sports is a global
problems. He said some countries constitutionally prohibited women
from participating in sports.
</P>
<P>
As in the Ancient Olympic Games, women were not allowed to
compete in the first Modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. They
competed in the Olympics only in 1900 in Paris when 19 women took
part in four sports.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Olympic Program for Women has gradurally
increased. At the forthcoming 26th Olympic Games, over 3,700
sportswomen -- by far the largest female showing -- will compete
in 21 sports.
</P>
<P>
Garrard said Canada entered more women athletes than men in the
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, 20 percent more women will compete
in the Centennial Games than ever before in history.
</P>
<P>
The new disciplines added to the Atlanta Olympic Program
include women's soccer, softball, mountain bike in cycling and
beach volleyball and the events of 5,000 meters and triple jump in
athletics, points race in track cycling, individual and team epee
in fencing, lightweight double sculls in rowing, doubles trap in
shooting and 4 by 200 meters freestyle relay in swimming.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Possible Measures Against US Anti-Cuban Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) foreign
ministers announced today a series of possible retaliatory
measures against the United States if it goes ahead with further
plans to penalize foreign companies doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Brussels during a EU Foreign Ministers Council
meeting, EC Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said, "The EU has
the right to defend itself against unfair legislations."
</P>
<P>
The EU measures have been drawn up on the eve of US President
Bill Clinton's expected announcement on whether to waive a part of
the anti-Cuba trade law, the so-called Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
These measures include taking the matter to a World Trade
Organization dispute settlement panel, introducing legislation to
allow EU companies counter-sue when their affiliates are
prosecuted, establishing a watch list of US companies filing court
actions against EU companies, and requiring visas for US
businessmen visiting EU states.
</P>
<P>
The EU council also instructed its Permanent Representatives
Committee to make necessary preparations for urgent Community and
coordinated national action.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was quoted by Reuter
as saying that the 15 EU members were also considering individual
responses to the act.
</P>
<P>
The part of the Helms-Burton Act most offensive to the EU, as
well as Washington's neighboring trade partners Canada and Mexico,
will allow Americans to sue in U.S. courts foreign companies
deemed to have profited from investments in property confiscated
by Havana.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said that even if Clinton did waive the third part of
the act, the EU would still consider what action to take over the
so-called Title IV, which has already become law.
</P>
<P>
This part allows the U.S. State Department to prohibit entry
to the United States to business executives linked to companies
profiting from Cuban investments.
</P>
<P>
The EU says it is already playing its part in isolating Cuba,
pointing to ministers' refusal to ratify a trade pact in June
because it did not give enough consideration to democracy and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
"The EU ministers are well aware of the strong domestic
pressure on President Clinton as November's presidential election
approaches, but their threat of retaliatory measures is a clear
indication that the EU is not willing to tolerate if its interests
have been obstructed by US domestic concerns," a EU diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> General Electric Orders 45 Airbus Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- GECAS, a leasing company belonging
to the U.S. General Electric group, today signed a contract with
the Airbus Industrie consortium to purchase 45 Airbus aircraft
plus 45 options, said Airbus in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
The contract, amounting to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars with
confirmed orders only, includes 40 orders and 40 options for
Airbus's A319, A320 and A321 unique corridor aircraft and five
orders and five options for its A340-300 quadri-reactor long
liaison aircraft, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft will be delivered from mid-1997 to 2001 with 10 to
15 planes to be delivered each year, and all of these aircraft
will be equipped with the CFM56 reactors of CFM International,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Agence Presse France quoted Jim Johnson, president of GECAS, as
saying that with the arrival of these planes, GECAS will be able
to conquer many markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has so far received a total of 1,060 orders from 49
clients buying its A319, A320 and A321 range aircraft, and it has
won 181 orders so far this year, as is compared with 106 in the
whole year of 1995, 125 in 1994 and 38 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The GECAS order for A330 and A340, which have 250 to 350 seats,
also raises Airbus's share of the world market selling such giant
aircraft to 44 percent with a total of 321 orders coming from 41
clients across the world.
</P>
<P>
The American Boeing still has the largest share of the global
aircraft market winning 232 orders so far this year.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Stresses Importance of Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here today that the economic development should not be
achieved at the expense of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on environmental protection, Jiang pointed
out that progress in the nation's modernization drive should be
made only by coordinating economic, social, and environmental
development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was presided over by Premier Li Peng and attended
by senior Party and state officials, and provincial heads. It was
meant to parallel the national environment protection conference.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection is very important. It is a strategic
issue and has a bearing on our country's long-term development,"
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is general secretary of the CPC central committee,
explained that the task is difficult because China has a big
population, limited resources, and weak economic and technological
bases.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, to achieve a sustainable development, the
Chinese people must save water, land, energy, materials, grains
and other resources. Meanwhile, the country must continue to
control birth rate and improve the population's quality.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that must to be done is to discover a reasonable
consumption component, and in this regard people should avoid
consuming things in an extravagant way, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, environmental awareness among the public is
needed, Jiang said, adding that the country has had a goal to
basically control environment pollution and curb the trend of
increasingly damaging environment around the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Above all, he said, the most fundamental way is changing the
country's economic structure and development mode, in order to
make them more efficient. He called for reducing the amount of
pollutants and damage to resources.
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, macro-management systems must be introduced
and then a decision-making system that deals with the environment
and economic development together must be created, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also asked Party committees and governments at all levels
to place environmental protection at the top of their agenda, and
create a regular channel by which they listen to environmental
reports every year, and examine and solve environmental problems
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"Many aspects of environmental protection have something to do
with advancements in science and technology, as well as the
betterment of people's lives," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental issues involve many international matters, such
as politics, the economy, trade, and culture. We are willing to
contribute strongly to the protection of the world's environment,
but, we will not agree to take on obligations that are not suited
to our country's level of development," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that developed countries should take more
responsibility in protecting the environment, and that China
strongly opposes the so-called "environmental diplomacy" thought
up by some developed countries, whose intention is to interfere in
other countries' internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Canada Wins Tariff Battle Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada has won a major victory over
the United States in their long-standing tariff battle in dairy,
poultry and egg trade.
</P>
<P>
A five-member panel has ruled unanimously that Canada can
maintain high border tariffs indefinitely despite the NAFTA
provisions for all tariffs between the two countries to be
eliminated within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The confidential decision by the trade panel -- two Canadians,
two Americans and a chairman from Britain chosen by the two sides
-- is an interim ruling.
</P>
<P>
A final decision won't be released until late August or early
September, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government now has two weeks to submit written
arguments that the ruling is mistaken. But given the unanimity of
the decision, it is virtually inconceivable that the final verdict
would be different from the interim one.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the panel decision as "a major relief for
the Canadian government" since the trade case is probably the most
politically sensitive cross-border battle it has fought over the
past seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Although the final ruling is not binding, a decision favoring
the U.S. would have led to massive U.S. pressure on the Canadian
government to open the border, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
If the tariff walls protecting Canadian farmers crumbled, U.S.
producers would grab about 25 percent of the Canadian market,
which will endanger the livelihood of 32,000 Canadian dairy, egg,
children and turkey farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian retail market for dairy and poultry products is
valued at about 9 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
For two decades and more, the Canadian farmers have been
protected by strict quotas on imports from fierce competition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government was forced to replace import quotas
with tariffs as high as 351 percent as part of the World Trade
Organization pact, under which those tariffs are to fall by no
less than 15 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Yet, soon after the WTO deal was initialed, the U.S. government
complained that Canada's WTO obligations conflict with its NAFTA
obligations to eliminate all tariffs between the two countries by
January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. argued before the panel that Canada's NAFTA
obligations take precedence, while Canada countered that the
Canada-U.S. trade deal, later superseded by NAFTA, left the
treatment of this agricultural sector to be determined at the WTO
talks.

BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- World women's number one Steffi Graf
has pulled out of the Olympic Games with a knee injury, the German
Tennis Federation announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the injury, Graf, who won gold in 1988 and silver in
Barcelona four years ago, must give up her quest for a third
Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
Graf was examined by a specialist who diagnosed an inflammation
of the tendon and advised her to take several weeks rest to
prevent the condition becoming chronic.
</P>
<P>
Just a week earlier, Graf was delighted at being shortlisted
for the honor of carrying the German flag at the opening ceremony
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The news comes just 10 days after defending champion Graf took
her seventh Wimbledon singles crown when she defeated her old
rival Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Graf has now won 20 Grand Slam singles titles and is in second
place behind all-time leader Margaret Court of Australia who won
24 major singles crowns between 1960 and 1975.
</P>

KATHMANDU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is to
table a bill on environment conservation at the on-going
parliament session, Minister for Population and Environment
Prakash Man Singh said here today.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if approved by parliament, is expected to help
maintain the environmental balance in the country, Singh said at a

</P>
<P>
He noted that air pollution has become a major problem in
Kathmandu valley because of the increasing number of vehicles and
rapid urbanization.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry, formed last year, would cooperate
with industrial investors on environment protection in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government has started to take
strict measures, including the compulsory vehicle emission test,
to control the worsening air pollution in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some 20 percent of the pollution in Nepal was
caused by industrial production while the remaining 80 percent
came from vehicles and human-related garbage.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Continues to Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production rose
by 0.5 percent in June, the third straight monthly advance, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that output at the nation's factories, mines and
utilities continued to grow in June after an identical 0.5 percent
gain in May and a solid 0.7 percent advance in April.
</P>
<P>
It was also the fourth advance this year and the increase
boosted production by a 5.6 percent annual rate for the second
quarter, compared with 3 percent in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was a fresh evidence that manufacturing in the
U.S. continues to rebound from last year's sluggish performance.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said the nation's industries were operating at
83.2 percent of capacity, up from 83.1 percent in May. The latest
rate suggests an absence of production bottlenecks that could
cause shortages and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
The report said production of consumer durable goods such as
automobiles and appliances, business equipment and construction
supplies all increased nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the gain was erased by a decline in utility output after a
relatively hot May. It fell 1.3 percent in June after soaring 2.6
percent in May when consumers cranked up their air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production was up 0.6 percent, and double the 0.3
percent advance in May, including a 0.1 percent increase in
nondurable goods such as food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
Output as the mines in the U.S. gained by 1.5 percent after a
0.5 percent increase a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> 100 Percent Clean Olympics Impossible, Says IOC Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A drug-free Olympics is just a
dream that will never come true, an International Olympic
Committee (IOC) anti-doping expert said in a press conference here
Today.
</P>
<P>
"A 100-percent drug-free Olympics is just an ideal situation
and it will never be achieved," said Jordi Segura from the IOC
Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Cheaters have become more sophisticated and they have been
taking design drugs that the IOC has yet to put them on the
banned-drug list," he said.
</P>
<P>
Segura is on an inspection tour of Atlanta's Smithkline Beecham
Clinical Laboratories, which will test Olympic athletes from July
20 to August 4.
</P>
<P>
The laboratories will perform testing on more than 2,000 urine
specimens through the use of high-resolution gas
chromotography/mass spectometry (HRMS) which is able to detect
traces of banned drugs dating back months ago, said SmithKline
Laboratory Director Barry Sample.
</P>
<P>
"HRMS allows a widening of the window in drug detection,"
Sample said. "While gas chromotograhy/mass spectrometry might
detect a banned substance used within two weeks of competition,
HRMS might detect the substances used within eight or more weeks
of ingestion into the athlete's system."
</P>
<P>
Joining Sample in the SmithKline Laboratory staff are Dr. Don
Catlin, director of the IOC-accredited laboratory at the
University of California in Los Angeles, who oversees HRMS, and
Dr. Steve Horning, who is affiliated with the IOC-accredited
laboratory at Cologne, Germany.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government today asked
the Fisheries Department to immediately work to resolve
environmental problems caused by shrimp farming, according to a
press release from the government house today.
</P>
<P>
A major environmental problem caused by shrimp farming is the
destruction of mangrove forests, which are breeding grounds for
fish, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Department was appointed as the main agency to
coordinate the protection of mangrove forests.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a meeting in New York in April, at which
calls were made to shrimp importing countries to consider halting
shrimp imports from countries that have mangrove and environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
Farm-produced shrimp is one of Thailand's main aquacultural
exports, with an annual export value of around two billion US

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 22 Tons of Narcotics in Three Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
seized 22 tons of narcotic drugs in the first quarter of the
Iranian year (March 20-June 20).
</P>
<P>
Reza Seifollahi, commander of Iran's Law Enforcement Forces,
said that the confiscated drugs showed a 20 percent increase over
those of the same period in last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
He said that his forces also arrested over 1,743 smugglers and
6,802 drug dealers and rounded up 18,172 addicts in the period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 411 vehicles and 112 assault rifles were seized from
the smugglers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the robbery cases have been reduced by
10 percent in the first quarter of this year as compared to the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Between March 20 and June 20, he said, the armed policemen
captured 103 billion rials (about 25.7 million U.S. dollars) worth
of contraband goods from 17 smuggling gangs.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems in
Iran since it is one of the best transit for drugs to be smuggle
to Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border
area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were
caught with more than 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of
opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran executed over 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500 foreign
smugglers still in the Iranian jails.

<HEADLINE> Nuisance Caller to Face Six-Months Jail in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nuisance callers will face six
months in jail and the Islamic retribution for their crimes,
a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Persian evening paper "Resalat" reported that the Islamic
punishment law would be used firmly and unequivocally against
those who use their telephone to disturb others.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Province Telecommunication Company issued a statement,
warning nuisance callers of punishment from one to six months
of jail sentence and special punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged families to educate their children
and other "irresponsible" family members about the matter.
</P>
<P>
The problem of nuisance telephone call is very serious in
the country. The people would receive such calls at any time,
even late night.
</P>
<P>
Iranian press reported a case of a nuisance caller last
October. According to the report, an Iranian man, who had been
refused by an Iranian girl for date and whose later phone calls
had continuously harassed her, was given six months in jail and
74 lashes by a court in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The man was identified as "Behrouz," whose phone was traced and
he was found after he called the girl's house.
</P>
<P>
It said that the girl's subsequent suitor who was to marry her
had answered the phone. In a fit of jealousy, the fiance had
called off the marriage, thus leading the family to report to
police on the nuisance calls. After the conviction of the nuisance
caller, the fiance renewed his vow to marry the girl.
</P>
<P>
If a person insults another person on the phone, he can
get up to 30 lashes. If someone uses the phone to make
death threats, or if he uses the phone for extortion, he can
get up to 74 lashes and between two months to two years in
jail.

supporting the Papua New Guinean people in their struggle for
safeguarding their country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.

<HEADLINE> Police Urged to Improve Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Police across the country should
expand the campaign of learning from Jinan's traffic police,
China's "model traffic police corps", to improve their
performance, public security officers were told today.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huanning, assistant minister of public security, made the
remark at a national telephone conference on the nine-month
"learning from Jinan traffic police" campaign.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the nation's police, especially traffic
police across the country, have taken on a new look, and improved
their image among the country's people.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security conferred the title "model
traffic police corps" on the public servants in Jinan, capital of
east China's Shandong Province, last October, for their strict law
enforment, standardized procedures in directing traffic, and good
service they have provided.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the improved performance of the nation's police
has resulted in a better law-enforcement environment, as citizens
become more co-operative with the police and more law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
Police across the country should extend the experience of the
Jinan traffic police to other areas to improve the performance of
the police force as a whole and to better serve the people, the
assistant minister said.

ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic officials worry about
lightning as their biggest weather concern next to heat and
humidity as the 26th Olympic Games are due to open Friday
afternoon.
</P>

According to the local observatory, thunderstorms hit Atlanta
one day out of three on average during July and August.

</P>
<P>
As thousands of athletes and sports officials from various
countries and regions are pouring into the Olympic Village in
Atlanta, Chef Louis Ferretti has developed what he calls a "world
menu" of 550 recipes to cater to varying tastes.
</P>
<P>
Working out of 17 trailer kitchens set up in a parking lot and
garage at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Ferretti and his
team of six executive chefs and a staff of 6,500 will be open for
business 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the Olympics
from July 19 to August 4.

They exepct to feed five million at all venues, one million in
the Olympic Village alone.

<P>
While most Atlanta residents are exicted about the upcoming
Olympic Games, the chaos and congestion from an expected two
million visitors has many residents visiting travel agents,
servicng the family car and preparing to flee the city.
</P>
<P>
A Georgia State Universirty poll shows that 34 percent of area
residents said they planned to leave. Most want to avoid hassles
but others are leaving because some companies have decided to
close and grant vacation time.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 people have been arrested over the past year in a
campaign by Atlanta officials to sweep the homeless off city
streets before the Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Provide Financial Aid to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has agreed to provide
humanitarian aid to finance three reconstruction projects in the
war-torn Bosnia, Kuwait's official news agency KUNA said today.
</P>
<P>
KUNA said an agreement under which the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED) would offer the aid was signed today
in Sarajevo by KFAED Chairman Badr Mishrari Al-Humaidi and
Bosnian Finance Minister Mirsad Kikanovic.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the signing ceremony, Al-Humaidi said that Kuwait's
Amir, government and people would spare no effort to extend all
forms of support to the brothers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Al-Humaidi began a two-day visit to Sarajevo Monday and
expected to be back later today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he met with the vice president of the
Moslem-Croat federation Ejup Ganic as well as other senior
Bosnian officials and economists.
</P>
<P>
Ganic appealed to Kuwait and other Islamic countries for
financial support during his visit here in Mid-June. Bosnia,
devastated by a three-and-half-year war with most of its
institutions and infrastructure damaged, expects to raise 1.8
billion U.S. dollars from the international community for its
reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
KFAED was set up in 1962 by the Kuwaiti government to
provide soft loans and grants to development projects in the
Arab world, but has since expanded its role.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe
have benefited from KFAED's support since it was founded.
</P>
<P>
It said KFAED also expressed readiness to finance four
projects to provide the Bosnian capital and other cities with new
water pipelines, apart from rebuilding roads and bridges in the
town of Mostar, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
It would also offer soft loans to a planned Bosnian bank meant
to finance small and medium companies and factories.

BAGHDAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. weapons inspection team,
the second of such kind in a month, arrived here Monday to start a
new investigation into Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The 30-member arms inspection team was headed by Nikita

inspection are immediately available.

Following his visit to Baghdad, Ekeus said that Iraq still
hides some U.N.-banned long-range missiles and that the

<HEADLINE> Minister Urges Limitation on Expenditures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official urged
departments at all levels to control expenditures more strictly,
to bring revenues and expenditures in line with the country's
state budget this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli, who is director of the State
Administration of Taxation, said at a national conference here
today that all departments should take steps to rein in
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance,
China's total revenues during the first half of the year were 17.7
percent more than the same period of last year, and expenditures
up by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Alarms are going off since China's total expenditures in the
first half were up five percentage points from the state's
budgeted figure, Liu pointed out, adding that government spending
still keeps on growing,
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the central government is still facing
heavy presures from expenditures in the second half of this year,
because of the disasters that hit some parts of China, and some
reform measures for the readjustment of grain prices.
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the rate of increase in fiscal revenues
declined, and revenues from enterprises' income taxes had a
negative growth rate, Liu said, adding that the state-owned
enterprises' outstanding taxes also rose too much, while economic
performance was declining.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep revenues and expenditures in line with the
state budget, the central treasury will place strict controls on
government spending in the second half of the year, Liu said, and
the central treasury will not approve any local departments to
increase their fiscal expenditures, except for disaster-relief
purposes.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary that efforts be made to collect enterprises'
outstanding taxes so that the excessive outstanding
taxes can be reduced, Liu said

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Enhances Crackdown on Inferior Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The standard Organisation of
Nigeria (SON) has warned that importers and manufacturers should
desist from dumping inferior goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
''Nigeria is not a junkyard and should not be made one,'' said
SON's Dirdctor-General J.A. Abalaka at a ceremony held at last
weekend to destroy 1,500 tyres and electric cables estimated at
5.5 million Naira (about 64,000 U.S.Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Importers should always allow their sense of reasoning to
moderate their business transactions rather than the passion for
quick wealth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organisation, he insisted, will continue to seize and
destroy substandard goods because SON cannot watch helplessly the
dumping of hazardous goods on innocent consumers.
</P>
<P>
The weekend destruction was a response to consumers' outcry
and a reinforcdment of on-going battle to protect genuine local
manufacturers from the negative attitude of some unscrupulous
Nigerians and their cohorts, Abakala said.

KUWAIT CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Prime Minister Sheikh
Khalifa Bin Sulman al-Khalifa arrived in the Saudi port city of
Jeddah today apparently for consultations on resolving its border
dispute with the neighboring Qatar, Kuwait official news agency
KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh al-Khalifa's Saudi trip was at the invitation of Saudi
Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
His arrival was precedented by a short visit by Qatari Amir
Sheikh Hamad Al-Thani to the kingdom on Sunday who met with Saudi
King Fahd and Prince Abdullah and discussed means of resolving the
long-time Qatari-Bahraini border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini prime minister was accompanied by an official
delegation including his foreign minister, minister of justice
and Islamic affairs and interior minister, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have been locked in a border dispute over a
number of potentially gas-rich islands which have been under
Bahrain's control since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been mediating between the two countries
since 1978 although no results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and consultations were conducted recently among
officials from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain which
resulted in an agreement that high-level delegations would head
to Saudi Arabia to meet King Fahd in line with the Saudi efforts
to settle the dispute between the two member countries of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
KUNA did not say how long the Bahrain Premier will stay in
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Holds Talks with Syrian, Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara here today for talks
on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mubarak held talks with visiting Jordanian Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim al-Kabariti on the same
topic.
</P>
<P>
Shara told reporters that he delivered a letter to Mubarak from
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The letter dealt with recent developments in the region and the
peace process as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shara said that the Arab world will reject any attempt by
Israel to change the land-for-peace principle governing the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to violate or change the basis of the peace
process will not succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab stance is and will remain unified and will not change
because it is based on the realization of a just and comprehensive
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Syria's demand that Israel return to Syria the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The short visits by Syrian and Jordanian officials are
apparently aimed at coordinating stances with Egypt on the peace
process prior to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit
to Egypt Thursday. Netanyahu will also visit Jordan on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he expects Egypt and Jordan to tell Netanyahu during
his visit to the two countries, Shara said that everything that
can be said was agreed upon at the Arab summit in Cairo last
month.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit called on Israel to stick to the land-for-peace
principle, embodied in relevant U.N. resolutions, and implement all
agreements it has signed with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"All what we have agreed upon during the summit should be
regarded as the bases on which peace can be established," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in the
peace process can not be separated.
</P>
<P>
Syria would reject any settlement between Lebanon and Israel
through bilateral negotiations that disregard the Syrian peace
track, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said after meeting with Mubarak that Jordan is keen on
maintaining coordination with Egypt in light of the upcoming visit
to both Cairo and Amman by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said that he delivered a letter by King Hussein of Jordan to
Mubarak, adding that the letter dealt with the latest developments
in the region as well as ongoing consultations and coordination to
resume the peace process on the basis of relevant U.N. resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Shara and Kabariti also held talks before returning to their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Shara said they discussed the expected visit by King Hussein to
Syria for talks with al-Assad, adding that Syria welcomes such a
visit.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Shara and Kabariti came after Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's talks with Mubarak in Egypt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians have all expressed
concern that Netanyahu's rejection of land-for-peace principle in
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations may destroy the whole peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also opposes the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and refuses to discuss the final status of Arab
east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians envision as the capital of
their future state.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Succeeds in Guinea Worm Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has achieved a substantial
reduction of guinea worm disease from 653,620 cases when
eradication program started in 1988 to less than 15,000 cases at
present, a global organisation has said.
</P>
<P>
Although the program did not succeed in total eradication at
the end of its 1995 target date, the reduction of 97 percent of
the cases is a ''dramatic achievement'', said Michael Street, the
out-going head of ''global 2000'' in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
If it could happen in the case of guinea worm, it could also
happen in the case of other parasitic diseases in the country,
said Street, an American who was deployed to Nigeria three years
ago from the U.S.-based organisation which has been in the
vanguard of guinea worm eradication globally.
</P>
<P>
He said at last weekend that although gurnea worm is no more
significant in the country, the remaining three percent to be
eliminated requireds more efforts than before.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the disease would have been eliminated in
Nigeria by next year.
</P>
<P>
On river blindness control program which ''global 2000'' now

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- According to a news conference
held here today to mark the rebuilding of Tangshan, a city that
was demolished by a strong earthquake on July 28, 1996, about
two-thirds of China's area have been designated protection zones
against moderate earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Buildings and facilities in the zones are equipped with
anti-earthquake devices and disaster relief measures, and have
been tested by several destructive earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide anti-earthquake and disaster relief management
system has been established, and by the end of 1995, two-thirds of
the large cities and important industrial and mining areas had
worked out their own anti-earthquake and disaster relief programs.
</P>
<P>
"They are following their plans and making great improvement in
their anti-earthquake measures," said Ye Rutang, vice-minister of
construction.
</P>
<P>
Consolidation projects have been completed for most key
infrastructure, such as for energy, communications, and water
resources, and for a number of medical facilities and residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
The anti-earthquake regulation on construction projects, issued
by the Ministry of Construction, has provided a legal basis for
carrying out the anti-earthquake and disaster relief work in
construction.

<HEADLINE> Medical Care Improvements for Farmers Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers should be
provided with better medical services and the dire medical
situation in rural areas must be improved, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting yesterday, Chen Minzhang,
minister of public health, said that the government will encourage
the establishment or reestablishment of the co-operative medical
care system in rural areas, and ensure that all farmers have basic
medical care by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The system is important in rural areas because farmers account
for 80 percent of China's population.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Chinese farmers pay for visits to
clinics themselves, in contrast to urbanites, whose medical fees
are basically covered by the state.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that by 1994 only 10 percent of Chinese
villages had cooperative clinics or similar medical
institutes. Chen urged that more cooperative clinics be created
with the help of government support and private investment.

<HEADLINE> 107 Killed in Attack on Sudanese Refugee Camp: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A toal of 107 people were killed
and 20 wounded when a Sudanese refugee camp in northern Uganda was
attacked by an armed group, according to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The dead, almost all of them women and children, were killed in
the attack on Saturday. It was launched by the so-called Lord's
Resistance Army, said the UNHCR spokesman, Ron Redmond.
</P>
<P>
Those wounded had now been evacuated to the town of Kitgum,
about 70 kilometers from the camp, he said.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said it was the second attack on the refugee camp by
the group. Some 150 members of the group raided the camp on Friday
morning, burning 48 huts and abducting two policemen and their
families.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the gunmen rampaged through the camp on
Saturday, shooting indiscriminately at refugees, looting and
burning about 350 huts.
</P>
<P>
Many refugees in the camp fled into slums in the countryside
during the attacks. There were also unconfirmed reports that about
2,000 people were abducted.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said that his agency, along with the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Food Program
(WFP), each sent a truck in a convoy to the camp. They carried
food, medicines, plastic sheeting, blankets and domestic items.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR had asked for the authorities to increase security in and
around the camp, which was the only one in the Kitgum area, said
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
The camp was isolated by landmines, and robber activities made
it a fairly risky place to work and travel, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, there are about 210,000 Sudanese refugees. There are
another 117,000 in Zaire, 63,000 in Ethiopia and 41,000 in Kenya.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 experts and scholars
from China's inland areas, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as
from the US, and Japan attended a three-day seminar on relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits that opened today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss how to reduce the state of hostility
and increase mutual trust between the two sides and promote
cultural and economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In the opening speech, Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that
the Taiwan question is China's internal affair left over from
China's civil war, which should be solved by the Chinese people
themselves.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, there have been historical changes in
cross-strait relations, he said, and that President Jiang Zemin's
speech on reunifying the motherland on January 30, 1995 has gotten
the approval of those who favor China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the experience of the past decade has shown
that the smooth development of relations across the straits is in
the vital interest of the people on both sides and is their common
aspiration.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland, the
development of cross-straits relations and the realization of an
early reunification will be more prominent, he pointed out.

NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Railway Minister R.V.
Paswan today proposed a 10-percent increase in upper class fares
of all trains and freight rates in the railway budget for 1996-97
presented to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The budget did not propose any hike in second class ordinary
fares and mail/express fares.

Items exempted from the hike of freight rates include food
grains for the public distribution system, edible salt and oil,
sugar, fruits and vegetables, chemical, fodder, kerosene, cooking
gas and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, if approved, will enter force on August 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The new railway budget has raised the freight loading target
for the current year by 20 million tons over the 390 million tons
in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that train fares have to be increased with
the price hikes of petroleum products and challenges of various
projects for the development of rail network in the backward
areas, especially in the northeastern region of the country.
</P>
<P>
The railway outlay for 1996-97 was fixed at 81,300 million
rupees (2,426.87 million US dollars), up by eight percent over

<HEADLINE> 5,700 More Vietnamese Sent to Work Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 16 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 5,700 more Vietnamese were
sent to work abroad in the first six months of this year, bringing
the total number of Vietnamese workers working abroad under labour
contracts to around 20,000, Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signing of labour contracts overseas is seen as a way to
alleviate the problem of unemployment, increase the national hard
currency earnings and intensify international labour cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 270,000 Vietnamese were sent to foreign countries,
chiefly the former Soviet Union and east Europe, under long-and
short-term labour contracts.
</P>
<P>
However these contracts, most of which have expired now, were
made on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation among
fraternal socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1991, when the market-oriented economy was
adopted after the introduction of the party's open door-policy,
that Vietnam's labour cooperation was based on supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, its labour markets have gradually expanded to
northeast Asia, southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and
more than half of them work in South Korea and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Refuses to Meet Netanyahu's Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat had refused to meet with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign policy advisor Dore
Gold, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources told Israel Radio that Gold requested by
phone to meet Arafat Monday, but Arafat turned it down because he
knew that Gold had no intention of bringing a new message from
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Gold reportedly held a secret meeting with top
Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, which was the first meeting
between a Likud government official and a PLO representative.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting have been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his election victory on May 29, Netanyahu
authorized Gold to make initial phone contact with Abbas, making
it the first official contact between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Gold then said he was "authorized to convey to Abbas that a
mechanism of contact with the PNA will be established once the
government is formed."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu repeatedly said that there would be a
variety of channels in dealing with the Palestinians, and this
could involve the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Palestinian sources as saying that
the PNA would decide on a possible meeting in the near future
between Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
This came after Levy told reporters Monday that the Foreign
Ministry was preparing for a meeting between himself and Arafat,
but he added that such a meeting would still require examinations
of the subjects and frameworks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Officials have expressed their belief that a
meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu was essential before any
serious talks can begin on the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
would be necessary before any Israeli army's redeployment in the
disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu, while not ruling out such a meeting, has
so far given no indications when and under what conditions he
would meet with the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Netanyahu and Levy had decided at today's
cabinet meeting on a series of measures to be taken to ease the
five-month-long closure imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the prime minister's office said that details of
the measures would be released later.
</P>
<P>
The closure, imposed following a series of suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in late February and early
March, has barred tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from
going back to their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials claimed that the Palestinians are losing
millions of dollars daily because of the closure, which has
caused serious problems to the already troubled economy
in the Palestinian autonomous areas.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Not to Increase Trade Protocol with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan affirmed Monday that the
Kingdom will not increase its trade protocol with Iraq despite
the fact that the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the United
Nations will provides new chances.
</P>
<P>
It also said that any new deals to provide food and medical
supplies can not be included under the agreement signed in
January between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Information minister Marwan Muasher told a weekly regular press
 briefing in Arabic that the cash-strapped Kingdom "cannot
afford" to pay more than 220 million U.S.dollars to finance
exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's industrial sector was dealt a heavy blow in January
when the government, citing mounting Iraqi debt to Jordan,
slashed its trade to just over 220 million dollars from 400
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian industrialists served as Iraq's main suppliers of
food and medicine since 1990 when the United Nations imposed
stringent economic sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that deals that were signed recently in
Baghdad between Jordanian businessmen and Iraqi importers to
provide food, medicine to Iraq, will be financed under the
oil-for-food agreement signed with the U.N. in May.
</P>
<P>
Muasher was referring to a visit by a Jordanian industrial
team to Baghdad last week which resulted in several new deals to
provide the Kingdom's eastern neighbor with food and medical
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation and President of Jordan's Chamber of
Industry Khaldoun Abu Hassan said upon his return home that the
"team succeeded in reaching an agreement with Iraqi officials on
increasing trade between the two countries," according to earlier
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
However, Abu Hassan, who has asked the government earlier to
reverse its decision to cut the trade volume with Iraq, said he
was not sure whether the deals the team signed will be included
under the protocol.

<HEADLINE> Frozen Meat to Enter Markets in Beijing and Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- "Frozen meat," said to be cleaner
and tastier than fresh meat, will soon appear in the markets in
Beijing and Shanghai, according to the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
While freshly-slaughtered meat is available at room
temperature, the frozen meat is chilled to 0-4 degrees centigrade,
then vacuum-packed.
</P>
<P>
"Because the processing, transport and sale will all be done
under low temperatures, the meat will be cleaner and more
delicious," an expert with the Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has chosen Beijing and Shanghai as the pilot
cities to sample the meat. This year, Beijing expects to receive
3,000 tons of frozen pork and 2,000 tons of frozen spareribs, and
Shanghai will get 10,000 tons of frozen pork, the expert said.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire-Monitoring Committee in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The ceasefire-monitoring committee
in south Lebanon, which was formed in according with the April
Understanding between Israel and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, will
start to work on July 25, Lebanese official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi received Monday the text of the
accord on constituting the monitoring committee, which was
reached in Washington last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the committee was delayed several months
because of variance of views on the mechanism of voting within the
committee and the alternate chairing of the committee by the
U.S. and France.
</P>
<P>
The Washington meeting came to an agreement that consensus
should be fulfilled in voting on aggression, and that the
committee should be chaired alternately by the U.S. and France for
five months.
</P>
<P>
Naqoura, where headquarters of the U.N. forces operating in
Lebanon is located, will be the place where meetings of the senior army
officers and experts charged with investigating into likely
violations of ceasefire are to be held.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon approved Monday the accord on constituting the
ceasefire-monitoring committee, while a high-ranking Syrian
official welcomed it, saying that it would spare the Lebanese
further Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official emphasized that the committee was
constituted apart from the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, think that
the constitution of the ceasefire-monitoring committee, which
groups Syria, Lebanon, France, the U.S. and Israel, is a positive
development, and that the committee should undertake the tasks
assigned to it as soon as possible.

CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara arrived here today on a brief visit to Egypt, during
which he was to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Shara said upon arrival that he would convey a letter by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The letter dealt with continuous consultation and coordination
between the two countries on issues of mutual concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mubarak held a talk with visiting Jordanian
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim al-Kabariti on the
Middle East peace process and bilateral relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Syrian and Jordanian officials are apparently
aimed at coordinating stances with Egypt on the Mideast peace
process prior to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit
to Egypt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visits came after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's talks
with Mubarak in Egypt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians have all expressed
concern that Netanyahu's rejection of land-for-peace principle in
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations may destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also opposes the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and refuses to discuss the final status of Arab
east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
their would-be state.

business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines ranked the 42nd among 101 developing
countries in reducing the number of people who lack basic human
capabilities. This assessment was made by a team of international
experts commissioned by the United Nations Development Program to
write the global human development report 1996.
</P>

Finance Department said in a report published here today. The
report said that the proceeds from the sale of the Fort Bonifacio

regardless of tax status under the controversial comprehensive tax
reform program, the Finance Department said. But the government

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Subsidize Bulgaria's Railway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will subsidize a Bulgarian
project to improve its railway network with 2.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy, which was finalized in an agreement signed Monday
by Bulgarian Transport Minister Stamen Stamenov and Director of
the U.S. Trade and Development Program Christian Holmes, will be
used for research, training and technology transfer to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The aid was granted in compliance with U.S. President Bill
Clinton's proposal of developing the southern Balkan peninsula,
the Bulgarian News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal includes offering direct technical
assistance to the East European nation.
</P>
<P>
Two million dollars of the subsidy will be used to build a
railway linking Bulgaria and Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The rest 500,000 dollars will finance the feasibility study and
design of a container train station in the capital city of Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has made it a pressing task to update its
400-kilometer railway network as part of its efforts to integrate
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lift of international sanctions against Macedonia,
overland transport with the former Yugoslav republics has become
possible now.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, located between Southern Europe and Asia, has been
the focus of the world attention. The European Union and the World
Bank have invested about 152 million dollars in improving
Bulgaria's railway system.
</P>
<P>
However, the West have shown little interest in investing in
Bulgaria's highway network. In order to attract funds, Bulgaria is
planning to lease some sections of its highway to foreign
investors.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Plans to Increase Drug Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan plans to raise the prices of
some imported medicines by 3.9 percent, the English-language daily
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at tackling the complaints of local drug firms
who accused recently the government's inflexible pricing system of
hindering the development of the pharmaceutical industry, the main
hard currency earner for Jordan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Maisaa Saket, Director of the Medicine Department at Jordan's
Ministry of Health, was quoted as saying that a technical
committee of the ministry is studying the prospects of the price
rise.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry, the country's second largest
exporter following potash, is currently facing a crisis resulting
from the old pricing policies which still evaluate the Jordanian
dinar to be equivalent to three U.S. dollars as the case had been
prior to 1989 rather than the current rate of 1.4 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry makes little profits because drug
products were priced in accordance with imported medicines and
the price kept unchanged once it is set, drug firms complained.
</P>
<P>
Jordan exports 120 million dinars (168 million dollars) worth
of medicines annually through its eight pharmaceutical plants.
</P>
<P>
"In the past seven years, the local pharmaceutical firms have
continued to supply their products despite the fact that they did
not make profit on some of the medicines," a source from the
industry said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim Issa, President of the Jordan Pharmacists
Association (JPA), confirmed that the government is planning to
raise the prices of some medicines that were registered in Jordan
since 1988, stressing that the proposed increases would not
exceed four percent.
</P>
<P>
Available figures show that Jordanian drug firms cover 56
percent of the local market's need of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians consume 85 million Jordan dinars (about 119 million
dollars) worth of medicines a year, while 84 million dollars worth
of the drugs are imported, figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita consumption of medicines in Jordan is
35.7 dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are 5,386 types of medicines on the Jordanian market, of
which 1,800 of them are imported.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Trade Relations with Cuba: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Cui Tiankai said here today that China opposes the "Helms-Burton
Act" of the U.S. government and will continue its economic and
trade relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the U.S. government's recently
prepared enforcement of the "Helms-Burton Act", Cui said the move
is in clear contravention of international law and the norms
governing international relations. "Naturally China stands opposed
to this move," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman continued that in the United Nations, the number
of countries that voted in support of Cuba's opposition to the
U.S. blockade draft resolution has increased year by year, and the
figure came up to 117 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We have all along maintained that no country has the right to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs, still less impose
its domestic laws upon other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the U.S. is now attempting to impose
sanctions upon the personnel and enterprises of a third country
conducting normal trade with Cuba, and this has already come under
the strong opposition from the international community, including
the allies of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba
does no good to either country, Cui said, expressing the hope that
the U.S.-Cuban relations will be eased through dialogues held on
an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has always been opposed to the practice of
placing the domestic laws of a certain country above international
law. "As China and Cuba are both sovereign states, we will
continue to develop our economic and trade relations with Cuba on
the basis of the principles of equality and mutual benefit and
exchange of needed goods," the spokesman added.

"The proposed sites for the shift would cause an increase in

the shift would simply strengthen the U.S. military presence in

PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Djamel Zitouni, chief of Algeria's extremist Armed Islamic
Group (GIA), has been evicted from the GIA leadership by his
brothers-in-arm. Considered to be the die-hard among the
die-hards, Zitouni, also called Abu Abderahmane Amine, was accused
of "treason" by his subordinates. His departure could lead the GIA
to even more extremist actions.
</P>
<P>
-- Monday was a splendid day for the liberals in the Kremlin.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin recalled Anatoli Chubais, the
father of Russia's privatization process, into his presidential
team. Chubais was given two key posts: chief of the Russian
presidential administration and first presidential councillor.
</P>
<P>
-- The slaves of the Third Reich ask for compensation. About
one million survivors of forced labor in Germany and other
occupied countries during World War II are still living
today. Some of them are asking the German government to "pay for"
their labor in slave camps. About 11.5 million workers were
"employed" by Nazis to serve the German war machine during the war.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac today begins a visit to
Gabon and Congo, his third tour to Africa since he became
president. Unwilling to see Africa excluded in the process of
globalization, the president will give a message of "fidelity,
confidence and hope", according to Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
-- An official report published by the New York Times on Monday
said that the high-tech arms used by American troops during the
Gulf War did not work as effectively as conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by the General Accounting Office (GAO),
a watchdog of public spending of the U.S, government. After
studying nearly one million documents, the GAO concluded that the
accuracy rate of U.S. Air Force in bombing Iraqi troops was no
more than 40 percent, instead of 80 percent as has been claimed by
the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Displeased with Britain for Inviting Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed strong
displeasure over invitations extended by the Tibet Group of the
British House of Commons to the Dalai Lama to visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said during a routine
press conference today that China has already made "solemn
representations" on this matter with Britain.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that Tibet is an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory, and the Tibet issue is solely China's internal affairs,
which allows no interference from foreign governments,
organizations, or individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama is a political exile who has long been engaged
in activities abroad aimed at splitting the motherland and
undermining the ethnic harmony of China, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that by inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Britain and
offering him a forum, the Tibet Group of the British House of
Commons supports and abets Dalai's activities to split the
motherland on the British territory.
</P>
<P>
"This not only contravenes the norms governing international
relations, but also hurts the feelings of the Chinese people, and
it will bring about an adverse effect on Sino-British
relations. We hereby express our strong dissatisfaction over the
matter," Cui said.

<HEADLINE> Military Expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa has reduced its
military expenditure to two percent from 3.2 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
a latest survey.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted the IMF survey as saying the
reduction of military expenditure has resulted in substantial
savings in terms of the GDP earnings with 36 countries
registering an average 1.8 billion US Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
As for the whole continent, the IMF survey said, ''African
countries steadily reduced their spending to 2.1 percent of the
GDP in 1995 from three percent five years earlier, implying a
saving of about three billion US Dollars last year.''
</P>
<P>
The decline in military expenditure has been widespread both
geographically and by level of development, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The IMF survey attributed the decline of military expenditure
in the African countries to a combination of factors, such as a
slowdown in world economic activities, increased democratization,
improvements in world security, and a fall in military aid.

<HEADLINE> Petrochemical Company Reduces Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- One of China's largest
petrochemical companies has expanded production and reduced
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The amount of crude oil processed by the Maoming Petrochemical
Company, in south China's Guangdong Province, rose 15.6 percent
from 1990 to reach 6.68 million tons in 1995. But waste water
discharged by the company dropped 10.7 percent in five years,
statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the company said they advocate clean production,
and that Maoming has torn apart heavily-polluted and less
efficient oil processing installations. The company spends one
million yuan annually to research technology for environmental
protection, recycling waste and developing greenery.
</P>
<P>
Maoming has also set more than 50 environmental standards for
its subsidiary companies, factories, and workshops, who must
review and meet the requirements every month.
</P>
<P>
During 1991 and 1995, the company invested 80 million yuan in
over 30 environmental projects, and recovered 76 million yuan from
recycling waste.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, fines imposed on the company's discharge of pollutants
decreased 50 percent from 1990.

<HEADLINE> Major Environmental Protection Plans to Be Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China is finalizing two
environmental protection programs as part of its efforts to halt
present pollution trends and to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the "Program to Curb the Total Amount of Discharged
Pollutants" and the "Green Project Program through 2010" have been
submitted for final consultation to the ongoing Fourth National
Conference on Environmental Protection, which is scheduled to
close Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China established environmental protection targets through 2010
that were approved earlier this year by the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The two programs are the foundation of China's attempt to halt
the worsening trend in environmental pollution and ecological
damage, and to improve the environment in some cities and regions
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 15 years, China will attempt to stop
environmental deterioration, and expects to see improvements in
the urban and rural environment.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA), said the program to curb pollutants was formulated
in accordance with national conditions, regional differences and
funding capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the program targets the major pollutants that
are considered environmentally hazardous, but are likely to be
reduced in their amount by taking effective measures, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
China has been controlling the discharge of pollutants by
limiting their density, the director said.
</P>
<P>
With the country's rapid economic development, the total amount
of discharged pollutants will continue to increase in a certain
area or industry, he said, even though the pollutants discharged
in some regions have met official requirements.
</P>
<P>
The new program requires that in developed regions or seriously
polluted or environmental-sensitive areas, pollutants discharged
by new, renovation or expansion projects of any enterprise or area
should first meet official environmental protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the enterprise or the area should cut at least
the same amount of pollutants produced by the increased capacity,
in order not to exceed discharge limits.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to encourage enterprises and local governments to
introduce advanced, environmentally-friendly technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The policy is conducive not only to environmental protection,
but also to the change and improvement of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The "Green Project Program through 2010" is a three-stage,
15-year plan.
</P>
<P>
During the first five years, priority will be given to several
of the 3,000 projects listed by local governments or central
government departments, according to the program plan.
</P>
<P>
High on the program is the battle against water pollution in
three major polluted rivers, three polluted lakes and areas
heavily polluted by acid rain or sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The rivers are the Huaihe River in central and east China, the
Haihe River in north China, and the Liaohe River in northeast
China. The lakes are Taihu and Chaohu in east China's Jiangsu and
Anhui provinces, respectively, and the Dianchi in southwest
China's Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> China to Harness Landslides in Second-largest Man-made Forest Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China has devised a plan to
harness landslides in Cuipingshan Urban Forest Park, the
second-largest man-made forest park of its kind in the country,
the "China Geology and Mineral Resources News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study report on the control of landslides in the
park, drafted by an engineering team of the Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources, recently passed experts' appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The report said that by taking comprehensive measures, such as
draining water from the soil, placing wood stakes into the ground
and planting trees, the park can be free itself from the danger of
landslides.
</P>
<P>
Landslides in the 153-ha park, in Yibin City, in southwestern
Sichuan Province, have revived after a period of inactivity that
goes back to the 1950s. The constant presence of people in the
park has induced the slides to re-occur.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, landslides there have ruined several
scenic spots, a power supply bureau and a long-distance telephone
bureau, and one twisted a railway, causing a loss of 21 million
yuan (about 2.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The landslides also pose a threat to the safety of nearly 100
firms, departments and 10,000 local residents.
</P>
<P>
Local geological survey and research departments have visited
the park several times over recent years, and in 1995 developed a
feasibility study report.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Down in Vietnam as Inflation Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The interest rate reductions become
effective as of today and are applicable for all lending by
commercial banks and credit funds in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A record low inflation rate of 3.3 percent in the first half of
the year has prompted the state bank to reduce interest rates by
between 0.05 and 0.3 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
This makes all rates introduced since December last year null
and void, according the state bank deputy governor Chu Van Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
The new ceiling rates are one of the measures the state bank is
adopting to further facilitate bank lending to cash-strapped
domestic businesses which need more long-term loans to expand
their businesses, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
The short-term rate would drop from 1.75 percent to 1.7 percent
per month.
</P>
<P>
The long and medium-term rate will be reduced by 0.05 percent
from 1.7 percent to 1.65 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
The new rates for long and medium-term loans are just 0.05
percent higher than that for short term loans.
</P>
<P>
This will encourage bankers to mobilise more funds for long and
medium-term lending, the deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
With the application of new lending rates, credit funds will be
allowed to have profit margins of up to 0.35 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
The record low inflation rate has led the state bank to believe
that Vietnam will achieve a single-digit inflation rate for the
whole year, officials here said.

<HEADLINE> First Color Silk Newspaper Debuts in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's first colored silk
newspaper debuted in Hangzhou to mark the listing of a local silk
company on the Shenzhen stock market.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is a copy of the Shenzhen-based "Securities
Times," but is made of pure white silk with Chinese characters and
color pictures. It is the size of the real newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the colored silk newspaper follows an electronic
newspaper and a silk newspaper that were issued in recent years in
this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou Kaidi Silk Ltd., the company that produced the fabric,
and the newspaper offices have received thousands of phone calls
from people asking for copies of the newspaper, which experts
claim is a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
Sources said 100 copies of the newspapers, which are marked
with official numbers, will be given as gifts to famous foreign
museums and distinguished guests. The remaining silk-papers will
be auctioned for the "Hope Project," a charity whose aim is to
help dropouts return to school.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou Kaidi Silk Ltd. is the first listing company among
more than 3,500 silk firms in China.

<HEADLINE> Hunting Licences Renewed for 35 Tourism Firms in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The government has renewed
hunting licences to 16 local, 13 foreign and six tourism joint
venture companies for the 1996/97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Juma
Ngasongwa, told newsmen in Dodoma, Central Tanzania on Monday
that all the 35 companies had been granted hunting permits after
it had been established that they had been operating legally
under contracts signed with the Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
Ngasongwa said no new applicants had been given hunting
licences for this financial year because there were no blocks
which were appropriate for commercial hunting.
</P>
<P>
At the Present, there are 136 hunting blocks for tourist
hunting countrywide, of which 10 are not economically good for
hunting activities, Ngasongwa said.
</P>
<P>
He told that revenue from the tourist industry had been
shooting up from 1.39 million U.S. Dollars annually in 1988 to
6.43 million U.S. Dollars in 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
This is not to mention money generated through hotel
accommodation, sale of souvenirs and local transport fees, the
minister said.

HANGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A granary has been built in the
dry mountainous area of east China's Zhejiang Province, known for
its large population and uncultivated dry land.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has 400,000 ha of dry land, which can be cultivated
after exploitation, but the arid soil has long been untouched by
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the shrinkage of arable farmland, caused by
rural economic development, greatly concerned governments at all
levels, and a large-scale land reclamation project was implemented
in various parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
To date, crops and beans have been planted on 90 percent of the
dry land. The province produces 2 million tons of grain from dry
land each year.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have adopted high-quality, high-yield strains on dry
land, and increased multiple cropping areas by growing three crops a
year.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Severe Flood Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rain in the past two days
has pushed the water levels of China's major rivers higher,
aggravating the current flood situation, the State Flood-Control
And Drought-Relief Headquarters said today.
</P>
<P>
On July 14 and 15, more than 100 milimeters of rainfall fell on
an area of 16,000 sq km in the valleys of the Zishui, Yuanshui
Rivers, two branches of the mighty Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 a.m. today, the water level of the Zishui River
measured 38.59 meters at Yiyang in central China's Hunan Province
-- already higher than the record flood level.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yuanshui River measured 45.04 meters,
2.54 meters higher than the danger level.
</P>
<P>
The water levels of the two rivers are still rising.
</P>
<P>
Also this morning, the water level at Dongting Lake, China's
largest freshwater lake, rose to 33.12 meters, 1.12 meters above
the alarm level, and is still rising.
</P>
<P>
By 8:00 a.m. today, water levels in all sections of the main
artery of the Yangtze River had risen above the danger level in a
range of 0.5-1.3 meters.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun on Monday urged all local
governments along the Yangtze to be prepared for flooding.
Civilians and soldiers have been mobilized to guard the banks of
the river.
</P>
<P>
Several work groups from the Beijing-based flood-control
headquarters have been dispatched to Anhui, Zhejiang and other
flooded areas to coordinate flood-relief efforts.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministerial Meeting Concludes in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) special ministerial meeting ended here
this evening after two-day discussions on trade and investment
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the closing session, New
Zealand Trade Negotiations Minister Philip Burdon, chairman of the
meeting, described the discussions as "successful" and
"constructive."
</P>
<P>
He said the participants have achieved "strong consensus" to
encourage regional grouping in the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to prepare APEC for the first WTO
ministerial meeting scheduled for December in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A "Statement of the Chair" issued today at the end of the
meeting said the participants recalled that APEC members have
committed themselves in the Osaka Action Agenda to the full and
effective implementation of their respective Uruguay Round
commitments.
</P>
<P>
On the current work in WTO, they expressed disappointment that
only one of the four areas, in which Uruguay Round negotiations
on services were extended, had been completed. "We expressed our
determination to make definitive progress in the remaining areas,
financial services, basic telecommunications services and, in due
course, maritime transport services, when negotiations resume in
accordance with respective decisions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the Osaka Plan Agenda for achieving APEC's goal contained in
the Bogor Declaration on regional trade liberalization, the
statement said the participants are encouraged that each APEC
member tabled an initial draft of its individual action plan at
the senior official meeting held in the Philippines in May, and
that a number of members have since submitted revisions of their
plans.
</P>
<P>
"We noted that APEC members are also engaging in information
exchange, dialogue and collective actions across many areas that
either form part of the WTO's agenda or have relevance to it."
</P>
<P>
On the future of the multilateral trading system, the statement
said the meeting expressed support for achieving universality of
WTO membership consistent with observance of the rules of the
multilateral trading system and based on effective market access
commitments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting considers that it is now especially important that
regional and multilateral approaches to trade and investment
liberalization support and reinforce each other.

<HEADLINE> Economic Structural Reform Urged in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Reform of Japan's economic structure
has been urged as the top priority in achieving decontrol and
improving economic efficiency, Kyodo News Service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An annual government report cited the high-cost economic
structures, including higher domestic prices than overseas prices,
as the main causes of the hollowing out of Japanese industry and
delays in tapping new areas of business.
</P>
<P>
Easing of regulations is the major way to overhaul the economic
structure, the government report proposed.
</P>
<P>
To back its case for reform, it cites examples in 13 categories
where the easing of regulations by the government over the past
year has been effective.
</P>
<P>
Among these, it cites portable phones and car phones which
previously could only be rented and not sold.
</P>
<P>
Whereas there were only 2.13 million users at the end of March
1994, the number of users rose rapidly once the market had opened
up to sales of such phones, numbering 10.2 million at the end of
March 1996, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It also says that after the government lengthened the period of
validity of passports from five to 10 years for 20-year-olds, some
70 percent of passports issued were for the 10-year period,
showing a pent-up public desire to lighten the task of passport
application.
</P>
<P>
The report was authorized by the cabinet Tuesday morning after
it was presented by Management and Coordination Agency head
Sekisuke Nakanishi.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence Rises in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence among U.S.
chief executives improved significantly in the second quarter this
year, the New York-based private research group the Conference
Board (CB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The CB's measure of business confidence now stands at 55, six
points up from the first quarter of 1996. A figure of greater than
50 indicates a larger number of positive than negative responses.
</P>
<P>
The barometer of the private research group is based on a
quarterly survey of more than 200 CEOs and other business leaders
representing a wide variety of industries.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives are considerably more positive about current
economic conditions, the survey shows. More than 40 percent feel
that the U.S. economy has improved during the past six months, up
from only 16 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 15 percent of America's business leaders say the
health of the economy has gotten worse, down dramatically from the
first quarter's reading of 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
CEOs are also more positive about conditions in their own
industries. More than 40 percent say conditions are better,
compared with less than 25 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives are also more optimistic about the short-term
economic outlook, CB researchers point out.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the CEOs predict business conditions in
their industries will improve by the end of 1996, and the majority
expect their profits to increase during the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
A separate report by the USA Today said the next recession is
at least two years away. The assumption was made by most of the 50
economists responding to the latest survey by the newspaper and
CNBC, a major financial TV station of the country.
</P>
<P>
Just 32 percent say it is coming in 1997; 17 percent say the
first half of 1998 and 52 percent say it won't come until the
second half of 1998 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic, James Smith from the University of North
Carolina, predicts the next recession won't strike until 2002.

<HEADLINE> Most Residents In Tianjin Hail Anti-Smoke Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the
majority of Tianjin residents have hailed the "No-Smoking"
regulation that goes into effect in public places this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Tianjin Academy of Social
Sciences, revealed that 95.7 percent of the respondents were in
favor of the ban. The supporters include 93.1 percent male and
98.5 percent female of those polled.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 92 percent of the people who smoke also expressed their
support for the anti-smoke movement.
</P>
<P>
"I have smoked for a long time, and it does great harm to my
health. I hope young people will abstain from smoking," said a
59-year-old housewife.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, nearly 47 percent of the citizens over
age 15 are smokers, as against the country's average rate of 33.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that smokers account for 21.7-23.6 percent
of local high school students, 16.7-18.6 percent of secondary
school students, and even 2.01-9.8 percent of primary school
pupils.
</P>
<P>
Each smoker in the city spends an average of 58 yuan on
cigarettes, which amounts to 17 percent of their monthly
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The regulation on anti-smoking in public, which has been passed
by the standing committee of the local People's Congress, will go
into effect on October 15.
</P>
<P>
About 81.5 percent of the people polled believe the new
regulation will help smokers kick the habit; 91.2 percent believe
that it will help primary and secondary students stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
Many smokers have given up their long-term habit since the
current anti-smoking regulations went into effect in Beijing and
Shanghai, where many cigarette stalls reported low sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar Chief Minister
Mohammed Bilal yesterday reaffirmed government denial of human
rights abuse in the Isles, accusing the opposition of
orchestrating the allegation to confuse the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Moving a motion to adjourn the session of the zanzibar House
of Representatives until October 1, Bilal urged the Legal and
Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House to investigate the
claims, said a report reaching here today from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident such investigation would disprove the
allegations which he described as " malicious".
</P>
<P>
The government would guarantee the freedom of the opposition
political parties but nobody would be allowed to take advantage
of that freedom to disrupt peace,he added.
</P>
<P>
Bilal stressed that representatives from both the ruling and
opposition parties are duty-bound to work for the well being of
the people.

<HEADLINE> 5,700 More Vietnamese Sent to Work Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 15 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 5,700 more Vietnamese were
sent to work abroad in the first six months of this year, bringing
the total number of Vietnamese workers working abroad under labour
contracts to around 20,000, Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signing of labour contracts overseas is seen as a way to
alleviate the problem of unemployment, increase the national hard
currency earnings and intensify international labour cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 270,000 Vietnamese were sent to foreign countries,
chiefly the former Soviet Union and east Europe, under long-and
short-term labour contracts.
</P>
<P>
However these contracts, most of which have expired now, were
made on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation among
fraternal socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1991, when the market-oriented economy was
adopted after the introduction of the party's open door-policy,
that Vietnam's labour cooperation was based on supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, its labour markets have gradually expanded to
northeast Asia, southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and
more than half of them work in South Korea and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Election Campaigning Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Robert Frowick, A U.S. diplomat
in charge of the upcoming Bosnian elections, said today that the
election campaign will not start until the controversy over Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic is solved.
</P>
<P>
Frowick, head of the Bosnian office of the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that in order to seek a
possible solution, the official start of the campaign has been
postponed from July 14 to July 19.
</P>
<P>
Frowick has insisted that Karadzic cannot be the chairman of
the ruling Serb Democratic party because he was indicted for
alleged war crimes and thus barred from "any public office" under
the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is my unalterable position that any political parties who
keep indicted war criminals in office shall be ineligible to
participate " in the upcoming elections, Frowick said.
</P>
<P>
Frowick said that he met Karadzic's deputies last week to press
them to deal with the issue and "give them a bit of space and time
for an outcome that would be mutually acceptable."

<HEADLINE> China Takes Positive Attitude Toward Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
government has always held a positive attitude toward the APEC
process of trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi today when addressing the APEC
ministerial meeting held here.
</P>
<P>
"We have applied, and will continue to apply the same attitude
to the formulation and implementation of the IAP (individual
action plan)," she said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders agreed at their meeting held in Osaka, Japan,
last year that each APEC member would table their individual
action plan to advance the goal for achieving free and open trade
and investment in the Asia and Pacific region by 2020, which was
contained in APEC's Bogor Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government holds that given the diversity within
APEC and with various levels of economic development among its
members, the IAPs should be determined by members themselves in
accordance with the principle of voluntarism established in the
APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration of Action," Wu declared.
</P>
<P>
"We agree to exchange views on each other's IAP among APEC
members to enhance mutual understanding, to learn from each
other's experience, and to enhance the comparability of these
plans. However, comparability is a relative concept, and we are
not in favor of any unrealistic and procrustean decisions, and
introducing any form of negotiation mechanism into APEC."
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated the importance of the principle of
non-discrimination among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
"Liberalization measures taken by APEC members in the areas of
trade and investment should be implemented among all members in a
non-discriminatory manner. Any statement or action that attempts
to put domestic laws or regulations above the basic principles of
the multilateral trade system and APEC economic cooperation is
destructive to the APEC trade and investment liberalization
process, and shall therefore be rightfully and firmly opposed and
abandoned by all members of APEC," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wheat Prices Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Wheat Board (AWB)
revised down its forecast for the 1996-97 wheat prices today.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the price for the Australian standard White
(ASW) category would be 225 Australian dollars (118 US dollars)
per ton free on board (FOB) this year, a 10 Australian dollar fall
from its previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
The AWB also revised down its forecast for the prices of
Australian hard wheat by 15 Australian dollars to 240 Australian
dollars (190 US dollars) per ton FOB and Australian prime hard
wheat by 15 Australian dollars to 260 Australian dollars per ton
FOB.
</P>
<P>
AWB General Manager Merchandising Ron Storey said that the down
grading of wheat prices was due to improved prospect of world
harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
There had been an unexpected recovery in the US winter wheat
crop in recent weeks and Canadian spring wheat crops were making
excellent progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Increase in wheat supply has put buyers in caution. World grain
supply has been in shortage in recent years. There are still
uncertainties about the relations between grain supply and demand
if there is a better-than-expected wheat harvest.
</P>
<P>
Storey said that they were still waiting for buyers and
suppliers to decide the direction of world grain market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of the US corn crop was of great
importance to world grain prices, because feed grain was in
particularly short supply.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Netanyahu in Wrong Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party chairman
Shimon Peres Monday evening launched a blistering attack on Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Peres as saying that Netanyahu's
first official trip "had been in the wrong direction in every
sense of word," and that his first foreign trip should have been
to an Arab country not to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Labor faction in the Knesset
(Israel's parliament), Peres said that he was "very concerned"
with the new government's attitude toward the negotiations with
the Syrians and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was causing the Arab world to unite against Israel
and killing the Middle East peace process, said the former
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Likud claimed it would not agree to
preconditions to negotiations, but stated it would not be
prepared to withdraw (from the Golan Heights).
</P>
<P>
"What is that if not a precondition?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Peres also scoffed at Netanyahu's demand that the Arab world
prove it would act democratically before continuing to make
progress with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I want to believe that peace will bring democracy," Peres
said, adding that by waiting for democracy before peace, the
government is risking being left with neither.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres warned that Iraq could have nuclear weapons
within a year after the UN supervisors leave, and stressed the
need to be prepared for non-conventional war and terror, rather
than conventional war.
</P>
<P>
"Do not underestimate fundamentalism," Peres warned, adding
"there is a need for a double coalition, with the Arab states
against fundamentalism and with the world against terror."
</P>
<P>
If the coalition against fundamentalism did not include Arab
countries, he said, "it will turn into a Jewish-Moslem conflict."

<HEADLINE> NATO Comes Under Threat Over Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Serb Police chief in Pale has
threatened to retaliate against NATO-led Implementation Force or
U.N. police if Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is arrested, a U.N.
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ivanko, spokesman for the International Police Task Force
(IPTF), said that "the Pale police chief told us he was aware of
training being conducted by IFOR to arrest Karadzic and (Serb army
chief Ratko) Mladic."
</P>
<P>
"He warned that if they are arrested, the Serb population will
be mobilized against NATO personnel," said Ivanko, adding that
IPTF officers had also been threatened.
</P>
<P>
The Serb threat came amid reports that the United States and
other Western powers are contemplating to arrest Karadzic with
special forces so as to remove the Serb hardliner's influence on
the upcoming elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanko, a bomb blew up last Friday evening outside
an IPTF base in the Serb-controlled town of Vlacenica, destroying
a car parked there. IPTF suspected that the bombing may have been
placed by Serbs who saw increasing tensions with Western
peacekeepers.

CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- An American woman, 65, was stabbed
to death by an Egyptian man at a luxury hotel in downtown Cairo
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The man, who is mentally disturbed, was arrested, the Egyptian

The assailant, 27, is an unemployed man and went to the hotel

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Man Given Death Sentence for Money Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese businessman, Gao Fuyun,
received the death sentence with two years' probation recently
from the Fujian Higher People's Court for acquiring a significant
amount of money by using invalid fund certificates.
</P>
<P>
Gao is the former vice-president of Xiamen United Investment
Consulting Company and the major defendant in a fraud case
involving a total of 160 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture company established the Xiabang Development
Fund in July 1992 illegally, and printed or issued fund
beneficiary certificates with a total value of 60 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Having gotten the approval of Zhu Wei, president of the
consulting company, and Wang Wuquan, a board member, Gao used the
bogus certificates as assets and obtained 80 million yuan in
mortgages from banks and enterprises in a number of Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Wei was sentenced to 12 years in prison for speculation,
profiteering, and negligence and Wang Wuquan was given a
three-year sentence with probation.
</P>
<P>
Gao had earlier filed an appeal on the court ruling, but it was
rejected by the provincial higher people's court.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu May Offer Mubarak Bigger Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu may offer Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a bigger
role in the Mideast peace process so as to dampen the brewing
confrontation, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold is to fly to
Cairo today or tomorrow to prepare the prime minister's scheduled
visit to Egypt on Thursday, the Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's Cairo trip will be the first meeting he holds with
an Arab leader since he took office in June.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has constantly sought a leading role in the Arab world,
and Jordan recognized this by urging Netanyahu to visit Egypt
before Amman or other Arab capitals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Signs show that the Israeli government has come to realize it
is in its interest to keep Cairo "inside the tent" by offering it
a role, rather than to risk a potentially hostile axis between
Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent move to widen a potential coalition, Syria has
recently been trying to mediate between Egypt and Iran, but Cairo
has reportedly rejected the offer, the report added.
</P>
<P>
While Egypt has been a proponent of Israeli-Syrian talks on
return of the Golan Heights, it is an even greater proponent of
the Palestinian cause. Over the weekend, Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat held talks with Mubarak to
coordinate their positions
</P>
<P>
Israel has been critical of Egypt for trying to form an
anti-Israeli Arab united front in the wake of the change in
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has expressed his "disappointment" at Egypt's hosting
 of the recent Arab summit in late June, which warned Israel
against the deterioration of the peace process unless it softened
its hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the Egyptian role has been more cooperative than
confrontational, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to host the U.S.-backed Middle East economic
summit this fall, a priority for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
However, while Egypt favors the establishment of a Cairo-based
Middle East Development Bank, Netanyahu declines to voice his
support during his visit to the U.S. last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress intends to hold back on
contributing 260 million dollars, or 21 percent, of the bank's
start-up capital over five years, which was designed to finance
infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves Multi-Million Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Export Processing Zone
(EPZ) Board has approved four multi-million Dollar development
and investment projects which will create thousands of jobs, EPZ
Chairman Elias Ngugama said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ngugama said that of the four projects, two were industrial
parks which had been issued with development licences while the
other two had been given EPZ status and investor licences.
</P>
<P>
One of the industrial parks near the Harare International
Airport has already attracted investors, who will create over
2,000 jobs and other downstream projects.
</P>
<P>
The other industrial park near the railway line at Mabvuku is
being undertaken through a joint venture between Industrial
Development Corporation and Sungei Way of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
One of the investment projects approved by the board include a
3.2 million US Dollar vegetable processing plant, that will
create 122 jobs in the first year and 289 jobs in the second
year.
</P>
<P>
The other investment project approved is the production of
sodium silicate which ngugama said had a big world demand.

<HEADLINE> Fruitful Results Scored in Cleaning Up Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Standing beside the muddy water of
the Huaihe River, Zhao Wujing, director of the Huaihe Committee of
the Ministry of Water Resources, said with delight, "The river is
becoming cleaner."
</P>
<P>
Though still murky, the water formerly was black. It is still
undrinkable in some sections of the river.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 small paper mills -- each with a yearly output of
less than 5,000 tons-- in the Huaihe River Valley were ordered to
close by June 30, which would greatly cut the number of pollution
sources along the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River, which flows across Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and
Shandong Provinces, is a major commodity grain base in China. It
has a river valley area of 270,000 sq m, a population of 143
million, and more than 13 million ha of arable land.
</P>
<P>
"The pollution of the Huaihe River Valley is serious. River
water is undrinkable in some four-fifths of the river and more
than 100 tributaries, and in some places people even can't use the
water to irrigate crops," said Cheng Xushui, deputy director of
the water pollution control department of the commission in charge
of the control of the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the State Council invested 10 billion yuan (1.14
billion US dollars) to bring the Huaihe River under control,
ordering all small paper mills along the river to close by June
30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The council also required all enterprise pollution sources
along the river to discharge less than the standard volume of
waste by 1997.
</P>
<P>
And the Huaihe River should be cleaned up by the year 2000, the
council mandated.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government departments at various levels have increased
their awareness of environmental protection, and have taken steps
to control the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Henan Provincial Government plans to raise millions of yuan
yearly to renovate large or medium-sized polluting enterprises in
the Huaihe River Valley. Anhui Province is expected to allocate an
annual fund of five million yuan for treating the
pollution. Special funds have also been established in Shandong
and Jiangsu provinces to control the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Quzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, invested 150 million
yuan to build the Kuihe wastewater processing plant, the largest
in the Huaihe River Valley.
</P>
<P>
"The enterprise has improved the water quality of Quzhou," said
Geng Deqiang, assistant to the factory director. He added that the
city will spend another 40 million yuan to further the project,
and when it is complete, all of the city's wastewater will be
treated before it is discharged.
</P>
<P>
Experts view the Chinese government's pollution control efforts
as an indication that China will not sacrifice its environment for
its booming economy.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises along the Huaihe River, which had been warned about
their pollution problems, are working hard to bring them under
control. The Lotus Gourmet Powder Group, one of the major
industrial pollution sources along the River Valley, has poured
about 100 million yuan into the anti-pollution project.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we can keep the volume of waste liquids
discharged by my enterprise under the standard volume by 1997,"
said Li Huiqing, general manager of the group.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
Speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun and some members of the 50-seat
Kuwaiti Parliament Monday presented a proposal banning state
monopoly in business activities in the country, official sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came following the recent government's decision to
allow the establishment of a new mobile telecommunications company
to break state monopoly in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun said the proposed law would help create better
investment environment in Kuwait and keep capitals from outflowing.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal which affirms the principles of free
economy practiced in Kuwait is designed to prohibit monopolies in
any industrial, commercial, craft, services and information
activities.
</P>
<P>
He argued that "we see many monopolies continuing without
regard to the law" in the country which stripped many people of
their rights to conduct competitive economic activities that
could lead to more healthy economic performances.
</P>
<P>
So far, a certain service or an industrial activity could be
practiced by three, four or five persons, but licenses are denied
to the rest wishing to enter that particular sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a person who has his capital and feasibility
studies should be given an opportunity to practice the activity
and let the market to decide his fate.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, investors who present their feasibility study to
relevant authorities for approval for an industrial project are
often surprised to find that their request was refused, but the
same project was allowed to other people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Materials Dropped Slightly in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China's materials market remained
stable in the first half of this year, with the general price
level dropping slightly.
</P>
<P>
Though demands rose, prices were brought down by acceleration
in production, increase in imports and decrease in exports, market
analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Materials Information Center, the
national general price level for materials declined by 0.4 percent
in the first half of 1996, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The national average for the price of steel products dropped by
0.1 percent in the first half, with that for thin plate rising 2.7
percent. Fine-quality steel products plunged 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price for nonferrous metals dropped by 8.2 percent, with
that for copper decreasing 7.4 percent, aluminium 12.5 percent,
zinc 8.7 percent, tin 1.1 percent. The price for lead increased by
2.2 percent owing to higher demand on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Coal prices rose by 18.9 percent due to increase in demand, the
producer price, and railway freight.
</P>
<P>
The general price level for chemical products dropped by 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The car market was sluggish in the first half, due to a
shortage of funds and consumer policy limitations, that resulted
in an 11.1 percent decrease in the price level.
</P>
<P>
The price for cement rose by 2.7 percent; that for timber by
3.4 percent as compared with the beginning of this year; and that
for alternating current electric motors by 11.1 percent.

<P>
HEFEI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese airline and good
old-fashioned courtesy helped a group of American tourists fly out
of flood-stricken Huangshan Mountain and continue their trip in
China.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, contact with the world outside Huangshan Mountain in
east China's Anhui Province was paralyzed by a major flood.
</P>
<P>
Among the tourists trapped on the mountain were more than 60
Americans, who were scheduled to be in Wuhan on July 3 for a
pleasure boat tour of the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan Airport resumed operations on July 3, and several
flights were added to serve the airline's excess of 2,000
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The sky clouded over at 3:30, when the last added flight to
Wuhan was to depart, and it could take only 50 passengers instead
of the 70 who were waiting.
</P>
<P>
Learning of the situation, Jiang Houyu, director of the
Huangshan Station of China Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
called a meeting of the Chinese passengers and persuaded them to
give up their seats for the Americans. And 14 Chinese passengers

NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao is to appeal to the Delhi high court today against a
lower court order summoning him as an accused in the L. Pathak
cheating case of 100,000 US dollars on July 24, Congress party
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party President, Rao, was summoned to answer
charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating in the court of chief
metropolitan magistrate Prem Kumar after the non-resident Indian
businessman, L. Pathak, alleged that he gave 100,000 dollars to
Indian Godman Chandraswami, who was arrested earlier, in 1983 to
secure a government order for newsprint after Rao, the then
foreign minister, assured him that his work would be done.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Working Committee, the highest policy-making body
of the party, had last week authorized Rao to appeal to a higher
court against the lower court's order to summon him.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi high court Monday dismissed a petition seeking
non-bailable arrest warrants against Rao by advocate Shyam Sunder
Sharma.

Thailand's plastic pellet exports are expected to reach 580
million US dollars in value this year, up 33.2 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yet Thailand posted a 100.5 percent increase in its plastic
pellet exports in 1995 compared with that in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The predicted lower growth would be due to new rivals from the

<HEADLINE> eds in Ancient Tomb Cereal Seeds in 2,600-year-old Tomb Sprouted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Rice and sesame seeds discovered
in a 2,600-year-old tomb have sprouted and grown 17 centimeters
high, providing a mystery for Chinese agricultural scientists to
solve.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based "Xinmin Evening News" quoted agricultural
scientists as saying that at most, plant seeds could exist for a
century in an environment with a temperature of 15 degrees
centigrade below zero and 20 percent humidity.
</P>
<P>
The seeds were found by local farmers on Dec. 20, 1995, in a
piece of pottery unearthed from a tomb located at Dahua Village in
Chenwu Township of Jurong City, in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the roughly-made pottery was typical
primitive porcelain made nearly 2,600 years ago. They said the
tomb dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-475 BC).
</P>
<P>
The seeds sprouted 17 days after local agricultural scientists
sowed them on June 8. The seedlings have grown 17 centimeters
high, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The experts believe that the seeds could not be as old as the
tomb. But how they were put into the pottery is unknown, the paper
said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- To ensure workers earn
enough money to feed their families, the Beijing municipal
government has once again raised the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 1, the minimum hour's pay was lifted to 1.60
yuan from 1.40 yuan, and the monthly pay to 270 yuan from 240 yuan.
</P>

China introduced a minimum wage system in 1994. The Ministry of
Labor has urged all provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities to work out a bottom line for workers' wages,
in accordance with local conditions.
</P>
<P>
On November 23, 1994, Beijing Municipality issued regulations
governing minimum wage requirements, with the minimum hour's pay
set at 1.10 yuan and the monthly pay at 210 yuan.

A recent survey conducted by the State Statistics Bureau shows
that 18 percent of Beijingers make less than 500 yuan a month, and
the average monthly income for urban workers was 460 yuan last
year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Foreign Secretary in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon arrived here today on a four-day visit to
strengthen ties between the two countries after the Flor
Contemplacion issue last year.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Foreign Ministry said that during his stay here,
Domingo Siazon will call on Prime Minster Goh Chok Tong and Siazon
said that he would convey the renewed invitation by the Philippine
government to Goh to visit Manila to cement the re-establishment
of full diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Goh's scheduled visit to the Philippines last year was shelved
after both countries recalled their ambassadors in the aftermath
of the hanging in Singapore of Contemplacion, a Filipino maid, who
had been convicted of two murders, on March 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also said earlier that his visit to Singapore was part
of an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) tradition in
which a new minister visited his ASEAN counterparts. Siazon is
visiting Singapore at the invitation of Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
Siazon was appointed Foreign Secretary last year but was not
able to visit Singapore because of the Flor Contemplacion issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper report, after his visit here,
Siazon will fly to Jakarta with Jayakumar for the ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting. "The flight is symbolic -- the two ministers
will be leaving the row over the Flor Contemplacion episode firmly
behind them," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the Philippines was rediscovering areas of
common interest with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We have many areas of common interest," Siazon reportedly
said. "First of all, as partners in ASEAN, our objective is to
make sure our political and security conditions are stable," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "Right now, we would really like to
cooperate more with Singapore with respect to trilateral
arrangements with China. Singapore has greater experience than
us, and long experience in dealing with Hainan, (a southern
province of China)."
</P>
<P>
"We have just established a sister relationship between Cebu
and Hainan. There are many things we can do together in terms of
Hainan and China, and Cebu and Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are other areas of cooperation, Siazon said, citing some
joint military exercises between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably essential for ASEAN countries, without
establishing official defense treaties, to have joint exercises
occasionally. It improve the esprit de corp between our armed
forces; this is useful for maintaining peace and stability among
us and in the region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange Index Down to 8-Months' Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The stock exchange of Thailand
(SET) index Monday hit its lowest point since November 16 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The index dropped 19 points, or 1.57 percent, to close on
1,187.94.
</P>
<P>
The drop stemmed from losses on the New York market, concerns
over U.S. interest rates and Thailand's political uncertainly,
according to SET analysts.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on Monday totaled 44.5 million shares worth 3.5
billion baht (140 million U.S. dollars), compared with 57 million
shares worth 4.2 billion baht (168 million dollars) on Friday, the
previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered those advancing 278 to 69, while
101 counters were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors were net sellers in big stocks and local
small-scale investors followed suit. Some foreigners were selling
at a loss as they expected the Thai economy to stay gloomy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market would continue to drift downwards now
that the 1,200-point support had been breached.
</P>
<P>
Local investors believe that second-quarter performances by
Thai listed firms were poor and foreigners see the Thai economy as
potentially risky as economic indicators pointed to less than 8
percent in gross domestic product this year, stock market analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Taka Adjusted Downward Against US dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank Monday
readjusted the taka downward against the US dollar to 41.80/42.00
from 41.65/41.85, a central bank statement said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Bangladesh Bank, the country's
central bank, devaluated the taka against the US dollar after the
new government was installed on June 23. However, the statement
gave no reason for the adjustment. The central bank also made an
adjustment on April 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said the widely-expected move was made after
the US dollar appreciated against major world currencies and the
devaluation of the Indian and Pakistani rupees.

COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to close the Yala National Park, the game sanctuary in the
deep south of the country, from today pending the conclusion of a
search operation by security forces, police sources here said

<HEADLINE> Clinton Creates Task Force To Fight Terrorism In U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered the creation of an inter-agency task force to
prevent and respond to terrorist bombings and electronic attacks
on vital U.S. infrastructure, including computers and
communications.
</P>
<P>
He also set up a presidential commission to conduct a one-year
study of the extent of threats to the nation's vital
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The order cites two types of potential threats: bombings and
other physical attacks, and computer-based electronic attacks on
the interdependent public-private computer networks that link key
services, transfer money for banks, deliver military commands and
control air traffic.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was acting on the March 14 recommendations from Attorney
General Janet Reno, who chaired a Cabinet committee formed after
the April 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
Until the commission reports, Clinton ordered that an
Infrastructure Protection Task Force, headed by the FBI, be
set up in the Justice Department. The Defense Department and
other agencies are to join the task force, devoted to improving
infrastructure protection and coordinating response to attacks.
</P>
<P>
The commission will have both government and private members,
but the chairman will come from the business community, since
most critical infrastructures are privately owned. No one has yet
been named to sit on the commission.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Cambodia to Further Diplomatic, Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-Sam
and visiting Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen exchanged
views here Monday on establishing ambassadorial-level relations
and furthering economic cooperation, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Both sides decided to open representative offices in each
other's capital in May this year, Kim told Hun Sen, which is an
important turning point for the two countries to resume ties after
more than 20 years of severance.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is the first Cambodian government leader visiting South
Korea after the bilateral ties were severed in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to strengthen trade cooperation, increase
mutual investment, and co-develop the Mekong River Delta.
</P>
<P>
South Korean firms are vying to participate in the Mekong River
Development Project in Cambodia and five neighboring nations
through which the river runs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, on his four-day visit, said he hoped South Korea
enterprises to invest in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Hun Sen and South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Soo-Cheng attended the ceremony at which the South Korea-Cambodia
Agreement on Investment Protection and the South Korea-Cambodia
Agreement on Science an Technology Cooperation were signed.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Cambodia established full diplomatic relations
in 1970 but severed ties five years later when Khmer Rouge took

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Governor Decides to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Following a day of confusion
about whether Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas of the United
States would stay in office or go, Tucker resigned without
restrictions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sequence of events began when Tucker said he considered his
conviction on Whitewater-related charges a temporary disability
and would return to office if his appeal was successful, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tucker called Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee just five
minutes before Huckabee was to be sworn in as governor to inform
him of the decision. He said Huckabee, a Republican who gave up a
promising Senate campaign in anticipation of taking over,
objected.
</P>
<P>
Huckabee said he would call an emergency session of the
Legislature to begin impeachment proceedings if Tucker's
unconditional resignation wasn't handed in by 9 a.m. Tuesday. The
state's attorney general filed a lawsuit in state court seeking
Tucker's ouster.
</P>
<P>
Tucker then said that he would step aside unconditionally.
Huckabee was sworn in later.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his conviction May 28 on fraud and conspiracy
charges, Tucker said he would resign by Monday. But when his
self-imposed deadline finally arrived, he said he had decided not
to step aside because he believes he will win his case on appeal.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is based on the fact that one of the jurors who
convicted him was married to a man whose 40-year cocaine sentence
Tucker refused to commute in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 53, said he would quit office if his motion to set
aside the verdict was rejected.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted along with James and Susan McDougal. They were
accused of scheming in the mid-1980s to make illegal loans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Meetings to Catch Right Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN's Senior officials and
its standing committee today started a three-day meeting ahead of
the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) and the Post Ministerial Conference (PMC), which will catch
the right momentum as the grouping is currently making remarkable
economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from 22 countries along with hundreds of top
foreign officials will arrive in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, in
the next two days to attend the annual meetings which mainly focus
on economic and security issues. About 500 journalists, mostly
foreigners, are expected to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam. With a population of 420 million, ASEAN is one of the
world's fastest growing regions as reflected in its success in
keeping its economic growth at 7.5 percent since 1994, ASEAN
secretary general Dato Ajit Sinh said here Monday at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In 2020 ASEAN's exports and imports would experience the
fastest growth in the world, economic experts predicted.
</P>
<P>
World Trade Organization data indicated that ASEAN exports in
1994 reached 247.7 billion US dollars while its imports were
recorded at 258.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, ASEAN is also the world's fourth largest trader
after the United States, the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Its trade with the rest of the world grew 21 percent over 1993
to 543 billion US dollars in 1994, when intra-ASEAN trade reached
110 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment flows to the region rose by 131
percent from 17.1 billion US dollars in 1993 to 39.5 billion US
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Sinh stressed the importance of the AMM and PMC
whose agenda included economic as well as political issues.
</P>
<P>
At the PMC's "seven plus one" meeting (between seven ASEAN
members and one of the dialogue partners), the agenda included
WTO-related economic problems, ASEAN economic cooperation,
ASEAN-Mekong valley, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Disarmament, Sinh
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
While at the "one plus one" meeting, each ASEAN foreign
minister would exchange views with one of the ASEAN dialogue
partners on economic relations and ASEAN regional development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the foreign ministers would also review progress made
on various proposals agreed at the fifth ASEAN summit in Bangkok.
In this regard, ASEAN was doing its best to improve the
implementation of quantitative barriers and other non-tariff
barriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which has since January 1996 started to reduce its
tariffs to meet its target of 0-5 percent by 2000, is exploring
the possibility of entirely scrapping all tariffs in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the upcoming Jakarta meetings will
give boost to ASEAN free-trade program and promote its influence
in the international community.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said here today that fully normalizing Ukrainian-Russian relations
and bringing them back on the track of good-neighborliness tops
the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Foreign Ministry officials, Kuchma said that
it is important to adjust the country's foreign policy so as to
safeguard Ukraine's interests.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, to maintain equilibrium and predictability should
always constitute the basis of the country's foreign policy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Kuchma made remarks on the country's
foreign policy after the adoption of Ukraine's new Constitution in
late May and Russia's presidential elections early this month.
</P>
<P>
Praising the work of the Foreign Ministry during the past two
years, he said the reappointment of Gennady Udovenko as the
minister demonstrates the consistency of the country's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
It is one of Ukraine's foreign policy priorities to develop
relations with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), in particular with Russia, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also of importance to develop cooperation
with Central and East European countries, so as to enable Ukraine
to participate in the Central Europe Free Trade Zone, which groups
the Czeck Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Ukraine's relations with Western Europe, he said
that it is necessary to conduct negotiations with the European
Union, to set up a special partnership with NATO (the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization), and to obtain the status of an
"associate partner" of the West European Union.
</P>
<P>
As for relations with its neighbor Romania, he said the main
task is to sign an agreement demarcating the borders between the
two countries inherited from history and recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will deepen its relations with the United States and
develop its relations with the developing countries in Southeast
Asia and Latin America, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Pursue Reforms, Says Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin
said today President Boris Yeltsin's re-election showed that
Russia would adhere to its reform policies.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments here at the opening ceremony of a
meeting of the Russia-U.S. Economic and Technological Cooperation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's re-election has opened a "practical prospect" for
building a market economy in Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, who co-chaired the session
along with Chernomyrdin, highly appraised the achievements Russia
has made in market reforms.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been trying to control inflation and cut down
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore is leading a big U.S. delegation, including deputy
secretary of state, defence minister, energy minister and health
minister, at the session which will end on July 16.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shandong Enterprises Active in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More and more enterprises in east
China's Shandong Province have engaged in imports and exports,
which used to be monopolized by foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
The number of enterprises which have the authority to handle
imports and exports independently has risen to 502, ranking second
in the country, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises, together with foreign trade companies and
joint ventures, have become the major undertakers of imports and
exports for Shandong, said vice provincial governor Du Shicheng.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shandong's earnings in foreign exchange topped 9.65
billion US dollars, up 36.2 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase is mainly attributed to the fast-growing
enterprises, which have the authority to handle imports and
exports, Du said.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises' exports hit nearly 1.1 billion US dollars in
1995, soaring 142 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China's exports
dropped. However, prompted by such enterprises, Shandong's exports
saw an increase of 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming of the enterprises which have the authority to
handle imports and exports on their own has optimized Shandong's
economic structure. Last year, Shandong's total volume of imports
and exports volume amounted to 15.4 billion US dollars, accounting
for 25.6 percent of its Gross Domestic Product(GDP).
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, such enterprises
contributed to 14.9 percent of the province's exports.

ULAN BATOR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat has issued a decree that the new parliament
will hold its first session on Thursday, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Ardyn Erh (People's Power) said that top on the
agenda of the three-day parliamentary session will be its
structure. Establishing a new cabinet and approving its platform
will be the main task of the new parliament, known in the country
as the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, formed after the June 30 general elections,
will have six committees in charge of economy, society, political
organization, jurisdiction, pasture industry and regional
development and finance, according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will be formed with 10 ministries, three less
than the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's opposition Democratic Union Coalition won 50 seats
whereas the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party lost its
70-seat majority to get just 25 in the elections.
</P>
<P>
A small independent party wrapped up the remaining seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections were the second for the Great Hural
after a constitution was adopted in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Not Political Association, Pointed Out Lacalle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Uruguayan President Luis
Alberto Lacalle said here today that the Southern American Common
Market (Mercosur) is only an economic agreement, not a political
association of the four member countries.
</P>
<P>
Lacalle made the statement at the opening ceremony of an
international seminar "The Mercosur and Small and Medium-sized
Companies", which was held in Uruguay's Technological Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
"The Mercosur's objective is only commercial. There are no
intentions to form a parliament. It is not expected that there
will be anything except the most tenuous presence of a secretariat
and, if necessary, a court at a jurisdictional level where
differences can be settled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lacalle's statement is widely seen here as a response to the
remarks made by Paraguayan Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia on
his recent visit to Uruguay, in which he said that the regional
integration of the Mercosur will someday include the military
aspect.
</P>
<P>
During his presidential term in 1990-1994, Lacalle made
contributions to the foundation of the Mercosur, which was set up
in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.

<HEADLINE> Chubais Appointed as Yeltsin's Top Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Deputy Premier Anatoly
Chubais, who was sacked by President Boris Yeltsin in January, has
returned as his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, who replaces Nikolai Yegorov as chief of personal
staff at the Kremlin, will combine the post with that of top aide
to the president, involving him in making economic decrees.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Yeltsin told him to
come up with proposals for combining the jobs within ten days.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the appointment will be a major boost for further
economic reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, 41, was a key architect of Russia's economic reform as
the chief of the State Committee for State Property Management
from 1991 to 1994 and as deputy premier from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was sacked by Yeltsin in January 1996 amid mounting
complaints about his radical privatization campaign and tight
money policy which helped lower skyrocketing inflation to a
post-reform level of 1.2 percent a month in June.
</P>
<P>
He was blamed for the poor showing of the pro-government Our
Home is Russia block in December's parliamentary election won by
the communists.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the loss of his post at the center of power,
Chubais re-emerged as a key figure in Yeltsin's successful
re-election campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
Guangzhou, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of South
China's Guangdong Province, ranked the sixth most polluted city in
the world, is getting tough on car pollution, the major source of
air pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued a circular on the last weekend to control
motor vehicle emissions, which stipulates car licences for
vehicles that fail an inspection of their emissions will be
suspended until the car passes the test.
</P>
<P>
Owners of vehicles which fail the test twice, or fail only once
but are more than six years old, must now install tailpipe gas
filters.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles in Guangzhou has ballooned in recent
years. In 1986, there were 191,000 vehicles in the city. Now, the
figure is 768,600, 4.4 times that of 1986. And only 48.7 percent
of cars passed emission inspections this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Revive Rural Co-operative Medical System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Public Health
plans to gradually resume its decade-old co-operative medical
insurance system in vast rural areas by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
At least 80 percent of the country's 900 million rural
residents are expected to be benefited from the system, which will
allow farmers to pay premiums and only part of medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the collective pays the rest of the costs,
and the state offers guidance and organization but little cash.
</P>
<P>
At present, however, nearly 90 percent of farmers have to pay
all of their medical costs, and about half of the rural poor are
reduced to poverty by disease, "China Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer let farmers be responsible for dealing with
serious diseases themselves; their incomes are too low," it quoted
Health Minister Chen Minzhang as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rural co-operative medical insurance system experienced a
boom in rural areas in the late 1960s but was largely abandoned in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At a national conference held in Zhengzhou, capital of central
China's Henan Province, Chen said that the central government is
considering legalizing the co-operative medical system with a
national law and local regulations, for the system has proven an
effective way of keeping farmers healthy and able to work.
</P>
<P>
When reviving the system, local areas are encouraged to adopt
forms which meet their economic and social conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Better organization and supervision of medical funds will help
ensure fair appropriation. The items that are free or reduced cost
with the coverage are often publicized in township hospitals and
village clinics.
</P>
<P>
The government will also provide guidance and training of
medical personnel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Long Jumper Aspiring to Grab Medal at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- It will be a golden chance for
China's long jumper Huang Geng to capture a medal if the Asian
record holder can bounce to the point near his personal best at
the upcoming 26th Olympic Games here.
</P>
<P>
"With almost all the giants suffering from injuries or out of
form, I realize if I do a big jump, I can seize a medal in this
big event," said Huang, who finished sixth at the world
championships last year.
</P>
<P>
Though Huang never wins any medal at the previous Olympics and
the Worlds, the 28-year-old Chinese is one of the few track stars
whose names are well-known in his native country. He ranked eighth
on the world list last year with a wind-aided 8.38-meter jump.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Huang has competed 13 times, producing a
8.34-meter jump in May and sailing over 8.30 meters several times.
</P>
<P>
"Huang has the ability to jump about 8.50 meters and I hope he
can reach this goal in the Olympic year," said his coach Feng
Shuyong here today.
</P>
<P>
The men's long jump, which was an eye-popping event in the
previous Olympics, is not a show case again this time after three
great long jumpers in the world struggling to regain their good
form.
</P>
<P>
Iran Pedroso of Cuba, world champion and global No. 1 last
year, had an operation on his knee and has not competed in any
meet since last April when he jumped 8.34 meters in an indoor
tournament.
</P>
<P>
With a long period of lay-out and a weak leg, the Cuban is
surely not as strong as he used to be.
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis, three times Olympic gold medalist, is turning 35
this August. The former American hero is determined to defend his
title, but his 8.34m wind-assisted jump achieved at the U.S.
Olympic trials might not be long enough to save him from defeat.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Mike Powell of the United States has lost
his sharp edge in recent years. His best performance this season
was a 8.39m jump in June, and it is hard for him to find some
extra power to do better.
</P>
<P>
With these three super stars out of form, the long jump is an
open affair at the upcoming Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If I do an 8.40-meter jump, I am sure I can finish among the
top three," the 28-year-old Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges U.S. to Settle Future of Bases On Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan has told the U.S. it hopes for
tangible results on downsizing the U.S. military structure on the
southern island of Okinawa when the two sides meet later this
year, Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Defense Agency chief Hideo Usui and Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda told visiting U.S. National Security Adviser
Anthony Lake in separate meetings that they expected progress to
be made on retrenching the huge U.S. military presence in the
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all land used by U.S. military bases in
Japan is in Okinawa, which makes up only 0.6 percent of Japan's
total land area.
</P>
<P>
Lake told Usui that Washington wants to join with Tokyo as far
as possible in reducing the burden on the people of Okinawa, Kyodo
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In September, Japan and the U.S. will hold a ministerial-level
bilateral security forum to review the 1978 defense guidelines
between the two countries. In November a special bilateral
commission will be held on U.S. military bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
There is considerable opposition on the island to the presence
of U.S. bases since three U.S. soldiers raped a schoolgirl in
September last year.
</P>
<P>
Local residents want U.S. troops to leave the island and the
governor plans to hold a referendum on September 8, ahead of the
bilateral defense talks, to determine whether people support a
reduction in U.S. bases.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Workers Protest Against Privatization of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Unionized employees of the Costa
Rican Electricity Institute (ICE, its acronym in Spanish) marched
today through the main streets of San Jose as they declared a
six-hour strike in protest against measures that seek private
investments in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The union members demand that President Jose Maria Figueres
take a stand to defend the institute, but analysts here said they
will not refuse alternatives that protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government has in the past months adopted a
series of measures to attract national and foreign capitals that
it believes are indispensable to meet the current and future
demands for electricity.
</P>
<P>
Constitutionally, the ICE has a monopoly over
telecommunications in the country but it has opened up the
possibility of allowing private investments in the generation of
power.
</P>
<P>
President Figueres has indicated he will introduce the legal
reforms required for opening up the sector to joint investments to
terminate, ultimately, the ICE'S monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The topic has sparked profound controversy here, since the ICE
has been able to develop telecommunications efficiently in the
country, with telephones available even in the remotest corners.
</P>
<P>
The ICE development is now being limited by the government's
new policy, which seeks a reduced role and resources for the state.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the ICE will need 500 million dollars a
year for five years for its investment projects, but the
government does not have that money.

<HEADLINE> UN Helps China Eliminate Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the World
Bank representatives yesterday expressed readiness to cooperate
with China in wiping out endemic iodine deficiency disorders (IDD)
by the year 2000, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
For its part, China pledged to further tighten quality control
and market management of iodized salt and carry out publicity
urging the population to have such salt.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign experts agree that eating iodized salt is
the easiest and cheapest way to prevent IDD, which usually leads
to mental retardiness in children and sometimes causes miscarriage
and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health, and Fu Limin, deputy
director of the National Council of Light Industry, announced the
pledge yesterday at the conclusion of a two-week national and
international evaluation of the country's national program for
elimination of IDD by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
About 20 experts from the United Nations Children's Fund
(Unicef), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), World Health
Organization (WHO), the World Bank and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (Unido) participated in the
event, which was supported by the Canadian Government.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation mission inspected the IDD situation and
marketing of iodized salt in five localities: Beijing, Tianjin,
and Henan, Jilin and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
It recommended action principles to help them decide on funding
priorities for China in the coming five years, and also to help
the Chinese Government map out a feasible national program.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, about 80 percent of the Chinese population can
now be provided with iodized salt, a rise of 40 percent in three
years. but some of the iodized salt cannot meet national standards
because of backward technology and facilities.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, Fu said that his council will spend
980 million yuan (118.1 million US dollars) to renovate salt
processing facilities. The World Bank will loan the country 27
million US dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
When the project is complete in 1997, about eight million tons
of high-quality iodized salt will be produced and marketed each
year, enough for the whole country.

SANTIAGO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States is to issue a statement condemning the United States'
decision to revoke Colombian President Ernesto Samper's U.S. visa.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chilean Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said today
that Bolivian Deputy Foreign Minister Jaime Aparicio is writing
the joint-statement which will be issued by countries in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
The White House revoked Samper's visa to enter the U.S. last
Thursday, saying it had information he knew drug money was used to
fund his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
A country had sovereignty in granting or not granting visas,
but when the issue concerned the head of state of a friendly
country, it could complicate relations between those two
countries, Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
It was extremely important that relations between Colombia and
the United States work well because they affect relations between
all countries in the hemisphere, he said.

The expedition is trying to establish the exact
geomorphological features of the glacial valley which feeds the
Carhuasanta, Apacheta and Sillanque streams and gives origin to
the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
The Amazon River was born in the Andes in Peru and runs 6,500
kilometers long, with 3,165 km in Brazil.

<P>
The "Origin of the Amazon" expedition will take water, soil and
plant samples and identify animal species, according to scientists
with the expedition, cited today by the local press.
</P>

The studies will enable them to learn how the shepherds who
live in the proximities of the Andean mountains utilize the animal
and vegetable resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
They will explore into the eating habits, living conditions,
family compositions and other daily aspects of the local people.
</P>

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Puerto
Ricans braved rainy weather Sunday to attend a conference of the
National Association of Governors in Fajardo, with most protesters
demanding recognition for the island's status as a separate
nation, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Protesters claimed that the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is
an independent nation, but some groups demanded the island be made
the 51st U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 protesters, including some independence
activists and civic, unionist and environmentalist groups,
exhorted Puerto Ricans to maintain their national identity,
particularly their language.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico is currently a commonwealth, defined as an
autonomous entity in "association" with the United States. But its
fate is ultimately controlled by the U.S. Congress. Puerto Ricans
hold U.S. citizenship but have no vote in U.S. national elections.
</P>

Debate over Puerto Rico's status has raged recently. The United

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July15 (Xinhua) -- The Centennial Olympic Games
gymnastic competitions will witness another Chinese vs. Chinese
situation, just like that in table tennis.
</P>
<P>
Li Donghua, who chalked up a gold medal in the pommel event at
the World Championships in Sabae, Japan in 1995, will represent
Switzerland to take part in the forthcoming Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Li, who left China at the end of last decade, will anchore the
four-gymnast Swiss squad, which also include Michael Engeler,
Pascale Grossenbacher and Eric Wanner.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss side will not participate in the team event.
</P>
<P>
"Generally the gymnastic activities in Switzerland are amateur
and its level is extremely low," he said, "sometimes I even can
not find a gymnasium and should pay by myself to take systematic
trainings. "
</P>
<P>
Li, who got the Swiss citizenship in 1994, said that he would
not set up a serious challenge to his former Chinese teammates.
</P>
<P>
"But everything could happen in the competitions, " the veteran
added, "I grabbed the world crown last year, which had fully
proved my power and an Olympic gold medal is also possible for me.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Li was considered a favourite for a medal in the pommel
event.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad, which arrived in the United States early
this month, gave two demostration matches in Greenville as the
last warm-up for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Qian Kui, head coach of the squad, said that the Chinese squad
was at their form now but refused to give out a specific
prediction.
</P>
<P>
"Russian men's team could be our arch-rival while the American
and Romanian teams are favored in the women's events." he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang, Olympic gold medalist in the floor exercise at
Barcelona Games, is also recovering from a back injury, said the
coach.

<HEADLINE> First IOC Olympic Medals Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The first medals of the Atlanta
Olympic Games were awarded today by the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) not to two athletes but to two doctors for their
pioneering studies demonstrating how exercise reduces the risk of
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
As winners of the first IOC Olympic prize in sport science,
both Jeremy Morris and Ralph Paffenbarger received an Olympic
medal, a certificate of recognition and shared a cash reward of
250,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The prize, awarded for the first time this year, will be
presented every two years in connection with the Summer and Winter
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The prize, the most prestigious award honouring research
excellence in science applied to human movement, exercise and
sport, is open to researchers in the biological, medical,
psychological and physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
Morris, 86, and Paffenbarger, 74, were recognized for their
pioneering research which changed the practice of medicine and
inspired the fitness revolution.
</P>
<P>
They have accomplished breaking works to prove the relationship
between physical activity and a reduction in the incidence of
coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Though their names are often linked, they work indepently with
Morris in England, and Paffenbarger in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Morris is emeritus professor of public health at the University
of London, England where he has served for 20 years, first as a
professor of social medicine and later as professor of public
health.
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years, he has served as an expert advisor to
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Paffenbarger, a former ultra marathon runner, is the professor
emeritus at Stanford University School of Medicine, adjunct
professor of epidemiology at Harvard University School of Public
Health and research epidemiologist at the University of
California, Berkeley, School of Public Health and College of Arts
and Science.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific research related to human movement, physical
activity and sport has become indispensable in contributing to a
broader understanding of health and human development," said
Prince Alexandre de Merode, IOC vice president and chairman of the
IOC Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
"While especially important to premier athletes, the
contributions made by this research helps to improve the lives of
all humankind," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Female Runner Eyeing Double Victory in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's world famous distance
runner Wang Junxia sets her sights firmly on chalking up a rare
double victory for the women's 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the
coming Olympic Games to open Friday, said the head coach of the
Chinese athletic team here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang, the world record holder for the 3,000 and 10,000 meters
who will double up in the 5,000m and 10,000m events, is not among
the 249-member Chinese group that flew in here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the team head coach Han Yongnian signaled an awesome
warning to Wang's opponents that the Chinese girl is now in
brilliant form and is likely to sweep two gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"Wang is the best 10,000m runner in the world and also a world
beating power in the 5,000m. She has geared herself up hot enough
to improve the marks she set in Nanjing early this season," said
Han.
</P>
<P>
Wang registered the world season's best of 31 minutes
01.76 seconds in the 10,000 meters before clocking the year's best
in the 5,000 meters with a time of 14:51.87. She is expected to
arrive here on July 21 with other Chinese distance runners and
walkers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese coach, the 23-year-old Wang, who
mocked the world record in the 10,000 meters by knocking off 42
seconds in 1993, has been undergoing training on the Duoba
Plateau, a training camp 2,300 meters above sea level, over the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
"She trained regularly and raised her running ability to a
new plane. Although she took part in competition only once during
this season, I still believe she is the person to beat at the
Olympics," added Han.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a fisherman's daughter from rural northeast China, became
an accomplished runner when she won the 10,000m event at the
world championships in Stuttgart in 1993. At the time she was
indentured to coach Ma Junren, the running guru whose "Ma Family
Army" was submitted to daily training sessions that sometimes
included running the equivalent of a marathon.
</P>
<P>
But in 1994, Wang broke away from Ma's camp with at least 11
other runners and began training on their own. After a low-key
season, Wang recovered her sizzling form in Olympic year and
looked set to regain her dominance in distance running.
</P>
<P>
In the 5,000 meters, world record holder Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal is Wang's arch rival who set a new world best this year
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Sonia O'Sullivan of Britain, world champion and the best female
athlete of 1995, is another big threat to the Chinese. The Briton,
however, is likely to choose 1,500 meters, because she still
memorizes her humiliating defeat to the 99-pound Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 meters will also be a battle between Wang and
Ribeiro, but the former is likely to turn out the winner. Wang is
holding the world record of 29:31.78, but she need not run that
fast. A sub-31 minute clocking is enough to bring her the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if Wang wins both events. I'm not worried
about her rivals at all," concluded the Chinese head coach.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Police Continue Sweeping Homeless off Streets,  Support Group Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Almost 10,000 people have been
arrested during the past year in a campaign to sweep the homeless
off city streets before the Olympic Games, a homeless support
group claimed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group, Task Force for the Homeless, said the city's police
had arrested 9,500 people on charges ranging from walking through
parking lots, sitting on curbs, asking for money down to sleeping
in public. And there were other ways of harrassment, it said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the arrested would have to stay in jail until after the
Olympics, the group's leader said.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta police had denied earlier this year the existence of
such a campaign.
</P>
<P>
Conservative estimates had put the homeless at the Atlanta
metropolitan area to some 55,000.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, local authorities had given homeless
people free one-way bus tickets to move out of town if they
promised not to come back.
</P>
<P>
But even moves like this didn't seem quite effective. Tourists
and journalists have still claimed to have been approached on
streets for money, although in a less visible manner.

<HEADLINE> France to Sign Agreement on Prisoners Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- French Justice Minister Jacques
Toubon today discussed with his Senegalese counterpart Jacques
Baudin the signing of a bilateral convention on transferring
prisoners who originally came from each other's country.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted Toubon as saying at a press
conference in the Senegalese capital Dakar that discussion of the
projected convention, which could open way for signing similar
conventions between France and other African and Maghreb
countries, still "remains open".
</P>
<P>
He said that the convention has met several obstacles,
including a European Union convention signed in 1988 banning
compulsory transfer of prisoners, while administrative and
financial procedures for carrying out such a convention remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
He said that 300 Senegalese are jailed in France, which is
quite low in number as is compared with those from Maghreb
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Position on Bosnian War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States reiterated
today that the Bosnian political and military leaders, Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, must be brought to the international
war crimes tribunal at the Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here that Richard Holbrooke, former U.S. chief negotiator
for the Balkans and now consultant to the Clinton administration,
will have tough talks with the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and
Croatia during his trip to the region. Holbrooke left here today
for the capitals of the three former Yugoslav republics assinged
by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"He (Holbrooke) will focus on the issue of war crimes. And
he'll focus on the issue of Karadzic and Muladic. I think that's
the primary focus for his mission," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian
peace accord last November, "is in a strong position to send the
basic message that if compliance (of the agreement) is not
improved, reimposition of sanctions (against Serbia) remains an
option available to the United States and our partners."
</P>
<P>
Burns said that Holbrooke "is uniquely qualified and uniquely
placed... to undertake" the mission to press for resolving the
problem of the war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We very much look forward to hearing from him when he
returns" form the trip, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Seizes Weapons from Muslim Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia (IFOR) said today it seized four
anti-tank weapons and some ammunition from a Muslim government
passenger helicopter in the Muslim town of Gorazde in eastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Maj. Brett Boudreau said in Sarajevo that as a
result of this incident, all Muslim flights were banned
immediately until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted Boudreau as saying that the incident
was "a flagrant violation of the Dayton accord provision" banning
all weaponry outside closely monitored storage sites.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday afternoon IFOR's Portuguese troops arrived in
Gorazde to monitor an authorized helicopter flight from Zenica.
Inside, rather than the 24 passengers it had been authorized to
carry, there were four 75mm anti-tank weapons and 148 rounds of
anti-tank ammunition," Boudreau said.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Observance of Olympic Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Freitas do Amaral,
President of the United Nations General Assembly, made a solemn
appeal in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce,
according to a U.N. document available today.
</P>
<P>
"On 7 November 1995, the General Assembly adopted resolution
50/13, by which it called upon Member States to reaffirm the
observance of the Olympic Truce during each Summer and Winter
Olympic Games," the appeal reads.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Truce, or ekecheria, is based on an ancient Greek
tradition, dating back to the ninth century B.C. All conflicts
ceased during the period of the Truce, which began seven days
prior to the opening of the Olympic Games and ended on the seventh
day following the closing of the Games, so that athletes, artists,
their relatives and pilgrims could travel safely to the Olympic
Games and afterwards return to their countries, according to the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Valiant attempts have consistently been made by the United
Nations in an effort to bring peace and stability to the troubled
regions of the world. Still new concepts are needed for dealing
with strife, the appeal continued.
</P>
<P>
"I solemnly appeal to all States to to observe the Olympic
Truce during the games of the XXVI Olympiad, the Centennial Games,
to be held at Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America, from 19
July to 4 August 1996 and strive towards building lasting peace,
whether or not they are now parties to a confrontation," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"I urge us all to place at the forefront of our thoughts and
actions the principles and ideals which the ekecheria and the
Olympic Movement seek to propagate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By applying the principle of the ekecheria, the world can at
least hope for some respite, however temporary, from the killing
and destruction which accompany conflict. I therefore appeal to
those now engaged in armed struggles to uphold this principle and
suspend hostilities in keeping with its observance," he concluded.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street plunged
again today as investors stung by two sharp tumbles in less than
two weeks braced for the impending flood of quarterly earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 161.05 points, or nearly
3 percent, to 5,349.51. It is the blue-chip measure's fourth
biggest point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq market suffered its second worst
point loss. It was down 43.60 to 1,059.89. It was the third steep
tumble in seven sessions, adding support to a growing consensus
that the stock market has entered what's known as a corrective
phase that often follows a powerful rally.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 432 up, 2,153 down and 591
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 418.43 million shares, up from 396.72
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 8.17 to 338.67, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.40 to 629.79.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged on July 5 after a surprisingly strong
employment report reignited fears of a Fed rate hike to fight
inflation.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Coca-Cola reported a 17 percent increase in
second-quarter earnings, meeting analyst expectations, but the

<HEADLINE> France Leaves to Bildt Arrest of Karadzic and Mladic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- France will leave the problem of
arresting Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic
to Carl Bildt, the International Civil High Representative in
Bosnia, the French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted Charette as saying at a press
conference in the Belgian capital that it is for Bildt to
determine the best way to act, either by imposing sanctions or by
banning the Serb Democratic Party in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"These questions will be examined in the days to come with Carl
Bildt who has, in the name of the international community, the
responsibility to determine the best way to act," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility of calling a United Nations
Security Council session to enlarge the mandate of the IFOR in
Bosnia to arrest Karadzic and Mladic, as had been called for by
the French Defense Minister Charles Millon during his visit to
Sarajevo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Charette said that the presence of Karadzic as head of the Serb
Democratic Party is an obstacle to holding elections in Bosnia and
an obstacle to the moving-on of peace there.
</P>
<P>
The International Tribunal for War Crimes in Former Yugoslavia
issued a mandate of arrest last Thursday against the two Serb
leaders, who were accused of crimes against humanity and genocide
committed during the Bosnian War.
</P>
<P>
In London, British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind has warned
against a repetition of the disaster in Somalia when the U.S.-led
international force tried to arrest war criminals there by force.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also said that using force
should be "the last resort".

<HEADLINE> 1.4 Million E. Africans Unemployed Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Pei Shanqing
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic restructuring,
high population growth and increasing rural-urban migration are
producing 1.4 million unemployed people in East Africa annually,
an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
"During the last decade, about 600,000 people joined labor
market every year, while in Kenya and Uganda, the number is
500,000 and 300,000 respectively," said a report reaching here
today from the East African Confederation of Informal Sector
Organization (CISO) based in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The report said the capacity of the formal sector had been
exhausted and can only satisfy no more than 10 percent of new job
requirements in Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
While in Tanzania, the rate is less than five percent, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The job creating ability of the government is decreasing due
to recent economic changes, according to the report, adding the
private sector is now attracting more employees.
</P>
<P>
"And the potential for employment creation in the informal
sector is high," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, for example, urban informal sector has the
capacity to employ 60 percent of people in the labor market, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the organisation called for the establishment of a
sustainable public policy to facilitate healthy growth of the
informal sector in the region under the East African Co-operation
framework.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Governor Gives up Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Governor Jim Guy Tucker of
Arkansas of the United States, Monday stepped aside but refused to
resign, invoking a clause in the state constitution that will
allow him to regain his office if his Whitewater convictions are
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he believes he will win his appeal, based on the
fact that one of the jurors who convicted him turned out to be
related to a well-known anti-Tucker activist. A hearing is
scheduled for August 19.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I would explain two weeks from now if the
elimination of the verdict would eliminate the reason for my
resignation," The Associated Press quoted Tucker as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 53, had said he would resign after he was convicted May
28 of fraud and conspiracy after a 13-week trial. The governor and
James and Susan McDougal were accused of scheming in the mid-1980s
to make illegal loans in a Whitewater-related trial.
</P>
<P>
Tucker would be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison on August
19 if his appeal is denied.

<HEADLINE> Bank of France to Keep Policy Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- France's central bank, the Bank of
France, will keep its policy of gradually lowering interest rates
despite an injunction by President Jacques Chirac on the July 14
National Day.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted French economists as saying today
that although there exists a potential for the Bank of France to
lower its principal interest rate -- the bids or tenders rate, the
margin for decrease will from now vary between 0.15 percentage
points to 0.60 points.
</P>
<P>
The tenders rate of the Bank of France was lowered to 3.55
percent on July 4.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview on Sunday, Chirac said that the
interest rates in France are too high to push forward the
country's economic growth. He also described the banking system of
France as "awful", accusing it of refusing to help the small and
medium-sized enterprises by maintaining interest rates at 7-8
percent.
</P>
<P>
But economists say that the essential act of lowering interests
has already been done by the central bank, which has reduced
short-term interest rates by three percentage points since last
October.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the
Bank of France, who has said many times that the interest rates
are now at a historical low, inviting French enterprises to take
advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
Christian de Boissieu, economist at the University of Paris I,
said that Chirac's injunction will not only not help lower the
interest rates, but also will block monetary policy-making board
from taking action.
</P>
<P>
He said that interest rates should not become "a tree that
covers the forest", because it is through structural reforms,
especially in the job market, that one can reduce unemployment and
restore confidence among the French people.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Natioanl Institute of Statistics
and Economic Study (INSEE) in Paris, France's economic growth
rate stood at 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 1995, and is
expected to reach 1.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Valerie Asselot, economist at the Credit Lyonnais, said that in
the perspective of building a unified European monetary system,
which calls for a stable franc, the Bank of France will not change
its policy of gradually lowering interest rates, which is made in
liaison with the Bundesbank of Germany.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly session of its monetary policy-making board on
Thursday, the Bank of France is not expected to change its
interest rates, AFP quoted economists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Petit, economist at the National Bank of Paris,
said that Chirac's speech is quite balanced since it is aimed at
pursuing the policy of rigid budgets and structural reforms,
especially in job markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some in the industrial circle of the country are
calling or the adoption of a financial policy ``the American
way", with 0 percent of interest rate to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Messier, president of the General Water Company,
said the lowering of interests by the central bank is
"insufficient".
</P>
<P>
The financial market of France today did not react to the
speech by Chirac, and the exchange rate between franc and
deutschmark stood at 3.3850 for one.

UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has expressed concern over deterioration in
humanitarian situation in Sudan and called on the government to
allow Operation Lifeline Sudan C-130 Hercules to enter southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is deeply concerned by
the recent serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation in
the Sudan, as a result of the unilateral and unjustified
obstruction by the Government of urgently assistance to the
affected population in southern Sudan, including Pochalla and
cholera-affected areas, as well as areas of the Nuba Mountains," a
U.N. statement said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General expresses the hope that the Government
will continue its cooperation and fully abide by the humanitarian
principles of neutrality, impartiality and transparency upon which
Operation Lifeline Sudan was founded in 1989, as well as adhere to
its commitments to the General Assembly to assist all persons in
need throughout the country," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Secretary-General is pleased to learn
this morning, however, that the government of Sudan is now
permitting Operation Lifeline Sudan C-130 Hercules relief flights
to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance to southern Sudan
during the month of July.
</P>
<P>
It added that continued authorization by the government for
this aircraft to deliver relief supplies in upcoming months is
critical.
