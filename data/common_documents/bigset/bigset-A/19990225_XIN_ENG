<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (xinhua) -- Zambia's Lusaka City Council
(LCC) has declared March 27 as Sanitation Day during which all
business houses, government institutions and residents will be
involved in cleaning their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of capital Lusaka, Patricia Nawa said here Wednesday that
the local authority has stepped up its fight against piling
garbage and dirt in the city in a bid to prevent the spread of the
cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Nawa said the Sanitation Day is designed to get everyone to
appreciate the importance of keeping their surroundings clean.
</P>
<P>
She noted that people have lost the sense of hygiene and that
it is high time people change their attitudes toward sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the LCC is in the process of acquiring
eight garbage collection trucks although the council needs about
40 to effectively solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to residents and businesses to be in a habit of
cleaning their surroundings and urged vendors to vacate the
streets and start trading in designated places.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Permanent Secretary of Information and Broadcasting
Services Ministry, Susan Sikaneta, told the LCC that the
government through the Zambia Information Service would mount an
awareness campaign to ensure that the Sanitation Day is
successfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation is a developmental activity which should be taken
very seriously, Sikaneta said.
</P>
<P>
"As a ministry, our mandate is to inform and educate the public
on matters of interest and development and keeping the city clean
is a developmental issue which we wish to take up." she said.
</P>
<P>
She also appealed to the business community to sponsor the
sanitation activities and get their workers involved in cleaning
the surroundings, especially trading areas so that Lusaka City
could look attractive to foreign visitors.

<HEADLINE> More Measures Needed to Boost Thai Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- More measures are needed to
boost Thailand's economy during the rest of the eighth five-year
plan, a senior official from Thailand's National Economic and
Social Development Board (NESDB) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wirat Wattanasiritham, secretary general of the NESDB, said
that the economy, including inflationary rate, foreign exchange,
current account and foreign reserves, was quite stable after the
agency had adopted measures following the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, economic growth in the country was still worrisome as
it was much lower than an earlier forecast, he said.
</P>
<P>
Measures to boost the economy, ways to help troubled financial
institutions, implementation of the fiscal policy and expansion of
exports have to be found out and adopted during the rest of the
1997-2001 Eighth Economic and Social Development Plan.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB is to organize a seminar in April on achievements
gained during the first two years of the plan. The seminar will
also invite proposals on the economic recovery from concerned
organizations and the public.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised eighth plan, the NESDB has forecast that the
Thai economy grows 0.9 percent this year, with inflation rising
three percent, export 5.2 percent and current account enjoying a
surplus of 10.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In 2000, economic growth is expected to grow 2.5 percent,
inflation to rise four percent, export to increase 7.7 percent,
current account to enjoy a surplus of 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The agency is looking forward to a 3.6 percent growth in
Thailand's economy in 2001, the last year of the plan, with
inflation up four percent, export rising 7.8 percent and current
account at a surplus of 8.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Time to Build Edifice of Russia-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said here Thursday that it is time to build the edifice of Russia-
China ties as he and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin have
already laid the foundation for bilateral bonds.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark while meeting with visiting Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the Russia-China strategic partnership of
cooperation initiated by him and Jiang is unique in the world and
that all the agreements reached by the two presidents should be
implemented in earnest.
</P>
<P>
China has made positive efforts to implement the accords and
Russia should act likewise, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Chinese premier that Russia will stage grand
ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China and the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries so as to make Russia-China
friendship more cherished by the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Zhu conveyed Jiang's cordial regards for Yeltsin and gave the
Russian president a picture of him and Jiang taken last November
at their first informal summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the picture, signed by Jiang, calls to mind the
sweet memories of his meeting with the Chinese president. He asked
Zhu to extend his best wishes to President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who arrived here Wednesday on a four-day
official visit, will hold talks with his Russian counterpart,
Yevgeny Primakov, later Thursday in the fourth regular meeting
between the premiers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is here on his first visit to Russia since assuming
premiership last March, said his trip is aimed at facilitating the
implementation of agreements reached by Jiang and Yeltsin and
boosting the bilateral strategic partnership of cooperation based
on equality and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier expressed confidence that his talks with
Primakov on mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields,
particularly in trade and economy, will yield new results and
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said there is still great potential for further developing
bilateral economic cooperation, adding that both sides would
certainly bring the cooperation to a higher stage of development
as long as they bring into full play their respective advantages
and complement each other's deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Jiang welcomes Yeltsin's planned visit to China later
this year for their second informal summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he is looking forward to the meeting.

Phieu reaffirmed that Vietnam recognizes the government of the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government
representing the whole of China, and it also recognizes Taiwan as
an inseparable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will never develop any official ties with Taiwan, or
engage in any official contacts, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The world is now at the turning point of a new millennium and
the international situation is undergoing profound and complicated
changes," Jiang said, "In this way, the establishment of a just

while seeking a stable and peaceful environment globally have
become the common aspirations of the international community."
</P>
<P>
He added that China will continue to pursue an independent
foreign policy of peace no matter how the international situation
changes, and stressed that it will make unremitting efforts to
promote peace, stability, prosperity and development in Asia and
in the world as a whole, and for establishing a new international
order.
</P>

Phieu agreed with Jiang's view on the international situation,
saying that it provides opportunities as well as challenges to
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and China should increase cooperation to promote their
respective reforms and development, he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Tops in On-line Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada has quietly emerged as
the international capital of a booming Internet gambling industry,
the Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But while many leading gaming firms are based in Canada, an
uncertain legal climate means most gambling transactions are done
offshore, in places like Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Some people, like Liberal MP Dennis Mills, would like to see on-
line gambling legalized in Canada to keep revenue in this country
instead of letting it go offshore.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing very well at it in Canada," says Alan Sneider,
Canadian director of the Interactive Gaming Council, a 50-member
worldwide association that will soon relocate its U.S.
headquarters in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 280 Internet addresses for on-line
casinos, and an average of 10 Internet casinos are added a month
as firms scramble to get a piece of the industry expected to
generate between 5 billion U.S. dollars and 20 billion dollars of
commerce by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Canada is home to a number of firms that run Internet casinos
through companies that operate computer-gaming servers outside
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadian firms are also licensing games to the rest of the
world's on-line operators, and Canada is considered a world leader
in the development of on-line games software and the electronic
cash used when bets are waged over the Internet, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
By most estimates, Canada has the largest concentration of
publicly traded Internet gambling companies of any country in the
world, an estimated 15.
</P>
<P>
Companies like Toronto-based CryptoLogic, which has become the
largest supplier of casino games and electronic commerce to on-
line casinos, dominate the industry. CryptoLogic has licenses with
12 gaming operators globally.

<HEADLINE> No Need to Rush DRC Peace Move: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Thursday that there is no need to set
deadlines for the peace process in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) due to the complexity of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Time frames were not important because of the need to
extensively consult with all parties involved, including countries
assisting either the rebel or government forces in the DRC, and
the United Nations, South African Press Association quoted Mandela
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting archbishop Laurent
 Monsengwa from Kisingane of the DRC, Mandela said the important
thing was that all sides were moving in the right direction of
seeking a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Monsengwa, a former speaker in the then Zairean parliament,
said that he had briefed Mandela on developments in the troubled
DRC. He did not give details, but said the churches were eager to
find a solution for the future Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised Namibian President Sam Nujoma and Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano for their efforts in seeking for an end
to the Congo (K) war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was aware that Chissano had travelleD to
Zimbabwe and Angola. "That is a good sign and I think in due
course he will brief us about these discussions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was grateful that beleaguered Congolese
President Laurent Kabila had issued a decree un-banning political
activity in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
"However slowly he might be moving... and whatever reservations
we might be having about certain aspects of the decree, it is a
step in the right direction," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Donors Agree to Set Up Monitoring Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and international aid
donors agreed Thursday to establish a monitoring body that will
hold quarterly meetings to assess Cambodia's progress in carrying
out reforms demanded by donors as a condition for continued
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to set up the mechanism in Phnom Penh was reached
here on the first day of the third Consultative Group (CG) meeting
on aid to Cambodia, which is attended by representatives from 16
donor countries and seven international aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has asked for 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars in aid over the next three years, said in a speech at
the meeting that he agrees with the idea of holding "in-depth
dialogue with our external partners once every three months to do
joint stock-taking of performance against goals and to consider
suggestions and recommendations."
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting said the Cambodian government was
criticized for not fulfilling promises of economic, administrative,
military and judicial reforms it made at the previous two donor
meetings, one in Tokyo in 1996 and the other in Paris in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Donors' concerns include chronic political instability,
uncontrolled illegal logging, excessive military outlays, weak
revenue collection, rampant corruption and a bloated civil service.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Cambodian government officials are to meet
every three months with Phnom Penh-based ambassadors and other
representatives from the aid institutions.
</P>
<P>
But the Tokyo meeting has yet to work out what specific areas
of the reform programs will be monitored, participants said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Hizb-e-Wahdat, a major
faction in the anti-Taliban alliance, has captured Yakawlang area
in the central Afghan province of Bamiyan from the Taliban after
three-hour fierce fighting overnight.
</P>
<P>
A report by the News Network International quoted opposition
sources as saying the Taliban Thursday launched a counter
offensive to regain the area and it lost to Hizb-e-Wahdat
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Five people from the two sides are reported to have been killed
while scores of others injured.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's chief representative in Islamabad Maulvi Saeed ur
Rahman, however, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that Hizb-e-Wahdat fighters, who had fled
the Taliban advance into Bamiyan province last September, swooped
down from their mountain hideouts Wednesday and in a sweeping
attack overran Yakawlang, 100 kilometers west of Bamiyan city.
</P>
<P>
After receiving reinforcements, the Taliban launched a big
attack and fierce fighting was raging in the area.
</P>
<P>
The two warring factions were using heavy weapons in the
fighting which followed clashes in the Taliban-controlled Dara
Souf area in Samangan province and in Daulat Shah in eastern
Baghlan province.
</P>
<P>
Afghan observers here expect the frontline to widen and
fighting to intensify as winter recedes further across northern
Afghanistan where anti-Taliban groups are concentrated.

BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, secretary of the
Central Political Science and Law Committee under the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with the top ten
Outstanding Female Judges selected from candidates nationwide
today.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who is also a member of the Political Bureau and the

safeguarding the country's legal system.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has promulgated more than 300 laws since the
country launched the reform and opening-up campaign in 1978, and
basically formed a legal system that conforms to the socialist
market economy with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He said that most Chinese law enforcement officers are
competent enough in general, however, problems do exist in those
serving in the political and law enforcement departments, adding
that it will be a long-term task to foster qualified staff members
in those sectors.

<HEADLINE> Captive-Bred Forest Cobras Hatched in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A South African park has
hatched a third generation of captive-bred forest cobras, the
first successful attempt in the world, South African Press
Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Transvaal Snake Park in Johannesburg said Thursday that the
eggs, which were laid in October 1998, were artificially incubated
and took t two-and-a-half months to hatch.
</P>
<P>
The nine hatchlings, which were jet black with a dash of vivid
yellow on their throats, would be exported as part of an
international exchange program with the Canadian center for the
breeding of specialized and endangered species.
</P>
<P>
In return the park would receive a group of vampire bats.
</P>
<P>
The young snakes, only 25 centimeters in length, are already as
venomous as their parents. The venom of forest cobras is a
neurotoxin which attacks the central nervous system, causing
paralysis of the respiratory system and ultimately death.
</P>
<P>
The park, which houses up to 150 species of snakes and other
reptiles mainly from southern Africa, has been successfully
breeding forest cobras since 1993.

<HEADLINE> 16 Percent HK Adults Participate in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) in January 1999 found that 16
percent of the Hong Kong adult population were stock investors,
the SEHK said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stock investors are defined as those who held or had traded
listed stocks during the previous 12 months, said a press release
issued by the exchange Thursday. The exchange said that 13 percent
of these stock investors were share owners.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of stock investors has remained unchanged since
September 1997 despite bearish market sentiment, the exchange said.
</P>
<P>
However, trading frequency declined as investors made an
average of three transactions in the past 12 months, compared with
10 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A typical Hong Kong retail investor is a 40-year-old white
collar worker with secondary or higher education, and a monthly
income of about 17,500 HK dollars (2,244 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The proportion of female investors has increased gradually
during the past ten years, reaching 48 percent in 1999 from 33
percent in 1989, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Stock investors are generally better educated and more likely
to be employed in a professional occupation than non-stock
investors, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The SEHK has conducted periodic retail investors surveys since
1989 to study retail participation in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
In the current survey, it interviewed 2,154 adults by telephone
to ascertain the percentage of retail participation in the stock
market, the investor profile and trading frequency.
</P>
<P>
The exchange conducts a full-scale survey every three years.
The last survey was in 1997. This latest survey was in the nature
of an interim survey to determine current degree of investor
participation.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Taliban Thursday held talks on the plight of Afghan refugees, the
largest refugee group in the world, according to reports reaching
here from Kandahar, a southern city of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Assistant High Commissioner of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) Soren Jessen-Peterson met with Taliban
representatives in Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban militia,
and they discussed ways and means to facilitate the return of
Afghan refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
There are currently some 2.6 million Afghan refugees, about 1.4
million in Iran and 1.2 million in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Jessen-Peterson discussed with the Taliban the
arrangement for the security of the U.N. staff with a view to
their return to the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"We want concerted steps taken for the security of the U.N.
staff," he said earlier in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR sees its return to Afghanistan as vital for monitoring
the repatriation and reintegration of the Afghan refugees, said
Jessen-Peterson.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. agencies withdrew their international staff from
Afghanistan following the murder of an Italian U.N. worker in
Kabul and the earlier killing of two local U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson is on his week-long tour of this region.
Earlier, he visited Pakistan and discussed the repatriation of
Afghan refugees.

controversial political views.
</P>

The New York Times:

-- The Clinton Administration appears to have walked into the
Kosovo peace talks without a clear idea of what to do if the

<HEADLINE> Debate on Spies-for-POWs Heats up in S.Korean Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A debate began Thursday in the
South Korean National Assembly over President Kim Dae-jung's
proposal for a spies-for-prisoners of war (POWs) swap with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers support the proposal, pushing for an early
exchange, while others see the proposal unrealistic, doubting that
Pyongyang would agree to exchange South Korean POWs with 20 DPRK
spies, who have been released in accordance with a presidential
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The debate came a day after President Kim Dae-jung suggested
the swap at a news conference Wednesday to mark the first
anniversary of his taking office.
</P>
<P>
Kim said his government is willing to send the released spies
to the DPRK on condition that Pyongyang returns South Korean POWs
to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has yet to respond to Kim's offer, but it has demanded
that its agents be repatriated, saying it would help improve inter-
Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
South Korean media said there are more than 200 South Korean
POWs still held in the DPRK after the 1950-1953 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Economy Saw Further Slide in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine witnessed in 1998 further
slip in its major production indicators, adding to the gravity of
the country's economic situation, the Ukrainian National
Statistics Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with those in 1997, Ukraine's gross domestic product (
GDP), industrial output and agricultural output dropped by 1.7
percent, 1.5 percent and 8.3 percent respectively in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the country harvested only 26.5 million tons
of grain, down 24.4 percent from 1997. The sagging grain
production, together with a 10-percent drop in beet output, led to
an 8.3-percent contraction in Ukraine's agricultural output, far
higher than the prime minister's forecast of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inflation surged to 20 percent, twice as high as
that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade volume (including service) last
year was 32.5 billion U.S. dollars, down 13.2 percent from a year
earlier. Its exports totaled 16.4 billion dollars and imports 16.
1 billion dollars, down 13.2 percent and 13.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Its imports and exports with Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) countries slumped by 19.6 percent and 26.5 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines Suspends Flights of All Tu-154 Passenger Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Southwest Airlines
today suspended flights of all four of its Tu-154 passengers
planes and launched an overhaul of them, following safety
examinations on all of its passenger planes last night, according
to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-154 planes will not resume flying until the cause of
yesterday's plane crash, which killed all 61 people on board, has
been cleared up, said an airline source.
</P>
<P>
To ensure regular flights, Southwest Airlines has replaced the
four Tu-154 planes with an Airbus-340, a Boeing-737 and a Boeing-
757.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the airline has merged two flights. Most of
the passengers, except for a very few who chose flights with other
airlines, were still carried by Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Passengers have been calm about the plane crash that occurred
yesterday afternoon, with no evident outflowing of passengers to
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
The plane crash has not affected the regular operation of the
Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport. A Boeing-737 passenger
plane of the Southwest Airlines carried the passengers from
Wenzhou to Chengdu who were scheduled on the crashed plane.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Takes Measures to Improve Employment Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will introduce three new
initiatives to enhance its employment services, as part of its
continuous efforts to help the unemployed find jobs.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth meeting of the Task Force on Employment held today,
members were told that starting from early March, the Labor
Department would launch an interactive employment service on the
Department's web site to feature information of registered job
seekers as well as vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The "Employment Service web site" will be equipped with
specially designed search engines to provide job seekers with jobs
which match their abilities and preferences and help disseminate
their resumes to employers.
</P>
<P>
It will also enable employers to identify suitable candidates
who have been registered. The project will enable job seekers and
employers to access useful employment information on the Internet
24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
As a further measure to provide better services to the public,
the Labor Department is undertaking a project to upgrade its
General Inquiry Telephone Service into an Intelligent Call Center
with the latest computer telephony integration technology.
</P>
<P>
As from mid-1999, the new call center will come into operation
with a total of 130 telephone and fax lines, as compared with 58
lines under the existing system.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with better support facilities and the upgraded
capabilities of directing callers electronically to the
information they seek, the call center will offer a much improved
telephone service to the public.
</P>
<P>
In response to the large potential in the labor market for
domestic helpers, the government is adopting a more active role to
promote employment opportunities for local job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Since late February, the Local Employment Service (LES) offices
have set up dedicated counters and appointed a designated
placement officer to assist job seekers looking for employment as
domestic helpers.
</P>
<P>
With effect from mid-March, all LES offices will organize a "
Domestic Helper Talk" every Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) has also set up a "One-
Stop Service Unit" to receive and refer job vacancies for domestic
helpers. It plans to increase its training capacity for domestic
helpers by 39 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the downturn in the economy, the Labor Department
found jobs for some 3,000 persons in January," said Donald Tsang,
financial secretary of the SAR and also chairman of the Task Force
on Employment.
</P>
<P>
"The new initiatives are timely and necessary. They will
improve the quality of the employment service provided by
government," he added.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to See 3 Percent Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy is
expected to grow 3 percent this year as compared to last year's
negative 5.5 percent, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The upward adjustment is largely based on the country's
favorable export figures and bolstered price competitiveness, BOK
Governor Chon Chol Hwan said at a meeting organized by the 21st
Century Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the central bank forecast that the economy will
grow only by 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's new forecast is different from the 2 percent
GDP growth predicted by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and
the 3.8 percent growth by the Korea Institute of Finance last week.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), also said Wednesday that South Korea should
enjoy a 2 percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chon anticipated the South Korea's inflation would
be down from last year's 7.5 percent to 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said his bank will push ahead with
lowering interest rates this year to support the economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Support for Artistic Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- If China is to have a high
level of artistic and cultural life which can win worldwide
acclaim more support from both the public and the government,
including financial assistance, is needed according to Wang
Shiguang, director of the Central Opera and Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent seminar organized by Premier Zhu Ronji to
solicit opinions for the upcoming sessions of both the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee and the National People's Congress (NPC) this March,
Wang warned that the current commercial rent for most theaters is
out of the reach of most artistic companies and even when they are
able to stage a performance the high administration costs leads to
expensive tickets which scares away potential audiences.
</P>
<P>
Wang acknowledged that during the reform and opening there has
emerged a considerable amount of literary and artistic work but
nothing which can be classified as a masterpiece as yet.
</P>
<P>
"National artistic institutions such as Peking Opera, opera,
ballet and national and regional orchestras are desperate for
support to ensure artistic integrity and a high level of
performance," stressed Wang.

<HEADLINE> Ex-S. African Minister to Join Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A day after being
expelled from the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) for defying party
authorities, Sipo Mzimela, former South African correctional
services minister, said Thursday that he wants to join another
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Mzimela announced his intention
to join the United Democratic Movement (UDM). He also accused the
leadership of the IFP, the biggest black-based opposition party in
South Africa, of being dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela was expelled by the IFP Wednesday for "spreading false
information to injure the party" and "bringing it into disrepute."
</P>
<P>
It followed several clashes between Mzimela and the IFP
leadership over his public calls for an IFP merger with the ruling
African National Congress (ANC), of which he was a member before
joining the IFP in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said Thursday that his expulsion was prompted by his
insistence that the party handle matters in a free and open way,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"The IFP culture is one of blindly following whatever chief
Gatsha (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi (IFP leader) says," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the disciplinary committee which announced his
expulsion was "a specially assembled panel of seven Buthelezi
henchmen", who made up their minds to expel him before Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said he did not want to rejoin the ANC, because the IFP
"would most likely become a surrogate of the ANC" after the
upcoming general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Joining the UDM would be a new beginning for him, as the party
was well placed to guide South Africa into the next century and
beyond, Mzimela said.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela's relations with Buthelezi soured two years ago when he
 repeatedly made public statements that the IFP and the ANC should
merge, despite warnings that he should desist from discussing the
matter in public.
</P>
<P>
This led to his removal from the cabinet as correctional
services minister and his loss of IFP deputy chairmanship. He
lost his seat in parliament after Wednesday's expulsion from the
IFP.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Mbeki Most Popular in S. Africa: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Only two political
leaders in South Africa - outgoing President Nelson Mandela and
his heir-in-waiting, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki - are widely
liked by the South Africans, a poll shows.
</P>
<P>
A countrywide survey conducted late last year shows that on a
scale of 0 to 10, Mandela got 7.7 points and Mbeki got 6.7 points,
while other politicians trailed far behind, South African media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is the former and Mbeki the current leader of the
African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The survey jointly conducted by Idasa, independent research
company Markinor and the South African Broadcasting Corporation,
shows that less than 20 percent of voters rate any other major
political party leader positively.
</P>
<P>
Taking the third and the fourth places are two black opposition
leaders, United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa,
with a score of 3.6, and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, with 3.3.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the biggest opposition party, the National Party
(NP), Marthinus van Schalkwyk, was ranked the sixth with 2.8
points, following Tony Leon, leader of another major white-based
party, the Democratic Party (DP), who had a rating of 3.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses to Extradite Teenager Wanted by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Supreme Court
ruled on Thursday that an American Jewish teenager wanted by the
U.S. on murder charges should not be extradited, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The five-judge panel ruled by a narrow 3-2 margin that
18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein will face trial in Israel rather
than in the U.S. for murdering an acquaintance, Alfred Tello
Jr. in Montgomery County, Maryland, in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The court based its rule on the fact that Sheinbein was born to
an Israeli father, which gave him an Israeli citizenship
automatically.
</P>
<P>
The ruling overturned a Jerusalem District Court order last
year that Sheinbein should be returned to the U.S. because his
ties with Israel are not close enough.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the
Foreign Ministry quickly expressed their hope that Washington
would accept the ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, which they
said works independently.
</P>
<P>
But senior diplomatic officials were quoted by the radio as
saying that they fear this case would strain U.S.-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has urged Israel to hand over Sheinbein who fled to
Israel two days after Tello's burned body was discovered in a
Maryland garage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv said it is still studying the
court ruling and will react "in due course," the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Sheinbein will be tried on charges of
first degree murder and would face a life sentence if convicted.
The trial will possibly start as soon as early next week.

BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungary fought back to force
hosts Thailand to a 3-3 draw in the King's Cup soccer tournament

<P>
The host team started the game strongly as captain Kiatisuk
Senamuang opened the scoring at the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes later, Thawatchai Damrong-Ongrakul put Thailand 2-

The Hungarian team narrowed the margin through captain Miklos
Toth just before the interval. Koszics Szedjan levelled the
scoring from 20 meters one minute into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Thawatchai put Thailand ahead at the 58th minute with a 40-
meter slice. He also hit the cross-bar with a long-range shot.
But the Hungarian team again levelled the score through Peter
Balassa three minutes into injury time.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Angola Trade Relations Undergo Remarkable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Ambassador to Angola
Joseph Sullivan has hailed the trade and economic relations
between his country and Angola as having undergone "remarkable
development" in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday at a luncheon held at the US-Angola Chamber
of Commerce that Angola has turned into U.S.' second largest
investment destination and third largest trade partner in the
sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said currently, US investment in Angola is mainly in
the petroleum industry, with over four billion US Dollars
accumulated so far. At present, the US' annual import of oil from
Angola accounts for seven percent of its total oil import. And
the percentage will reach ten percent in the coming years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to petroleum, the United States is also prepared to
invest several billions of Dollars in beverage, cane sugar, flour
production as well as fishing and the service sector.
</P>
<P>
A Coco-Cola factory started operation at the end of last year
in Angola. A total of 35 million Dollars has been invested in the
factory which is expected to go into production in November this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, the trade volume between the two
countries has been at about two billion Dollars in the past years.
 Statistics from the U.S. Commerce Department indicated that the
U.S. exported to Africa products worth six billion Dollars in
1997, while the import value from the region was 1.6 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan noted that if Angola wants to further obtain capital
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, it must
take up "difficult and resolute" measures toward economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the economy becomes more open and transparent, could
Angola achieve growth and prosperity and give a full play to its
great potentials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan disclosed that the U.S. government will provide Angola
with 350 million Dollars in loan through the Export-Import Bank in
a bid to boost bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Party's Campaign Headquarters Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Unknown gunmen Wednesday
evening spread bullets on the campaign headquarters of the party
of Constructive Executives of Iran (CEI), local daily Iran News
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A female staff member at the headquarters was injured during
the attack, but the assailants fled immediately, the paper said.
No further details of the attack are available.
</P>
<P>
The CEI, also known as G-6, is one of the political parties
which support the moderate President Mohammad Khatami. It expects
victory in coming Friday election of local councils, the first
such held since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
A week-long election campaign ended early Thursday morning.
Some 297,500 candidates have been qualified to run for about
200,000 seats in city and village councils throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the election, political quarrels intensified
between the moderate and conservative factions over qualifications
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Head of the conservative-dominated election supervisory board
Ali Mowahedi Savoji Tuesday night threatened to cancel the
election in Tehran if the pro-moderate Interior Ministry, which
manages the election affairs, does not remove 12 "disqualified"
candidates from its list.
</P>
<P>
The five-member board last week informed the ministry that it
had rejected 12 prominent candidates of the moderate faction,
including former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, who was sacked
by the conservative Majlis (parliament) in June in a no-confidence
vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry dismissed the rejection and termed it
illegal according to relevant laws.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus New Health Scheme Triggers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 Cypriot civil
servants staged a two-hour strike on Thursday to protest a new
National Health Scheme (NHS).
</P>
<P>
Under a government-proposed NHS Bill, all citizens of Cyprus
will be covered by medical care with half of the cost paid by the
state and the rest by mandatory contributions from employees.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants trade unions in a statement expressed their
concern that the bill will privatize the public health services
while enabling individuals to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
They were also concerned that the new scheme will affect 4,500
people working in the public health sector and infringe on their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The unions described the government's move as arbitrary and
claimed that if the bill is approved there will be a break-down in
the relations between the government and the public service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be tabled to the House of
Representatives, or parliament later Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Taiwan Company Sign Waste Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia signed an
agreement Thursday with Taiwan's Formosa Plastic Corp. (FPC),
ending more than two months of dispute over toxic waste dumping
near Sihanoukville by FPC.
</P>
<P>
The 16-article agreement was signed by Om Yentieng, president
of the Commission for Negotiation of Cambodia and Lee Chih-tsun,
president of FPC.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, FPC has to take the responsibility for
repacking, sites cleanup and transportation of the waste out of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
FPC should also remove the toxic waste from Sihanoukville
within 60 days or it will be fined 1,000 U.S. dollars a day for
the first 15 days beyond the 60-day deadline. Afterward, the fines
will increase by an additional 1,000 dollars per day for a 15-day
period until the fines reach 5,000 dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, FPC agrees to provide medical treatment to those
who have been confirmed by both sides to be poisoned by the waste,
or are harmed during its transport out of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also said FPC agrees to fulfill this waste
transporting operation under the supervision of the U.S.-based
Camp Dresser &AMP; McKee Inc., a third party expert chosen and agreed
upon by both parties.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000 tons of waste were dumped in the seaside town in
early December and have been found to contain high concentrations
of mercury.
</P>
<P>
The toxic waste sent thousands of people fleeing from the
seaside town, led to the suspension of more than 100 government
officials and threatened the health of workers and local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chih-tsun disclosed that the transportation of the waste
will cost FPC about 2.5 million dollars. However he did not
elaborate on who will take the job to transport the waste or where
the waste will be sent, saying only that his company would
contract the work out.

one million to five million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 86 percent of the respondents felt that those who
are engaged in the trading of highly endangered species should
also be imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the respondents supported animal protection
groups in Hong Kong and nearly half of these would consider
donating money to the SPCA in its continued programs to help
animals.
</P>
<P>
Although just 38 percent of those interviewed kept animals at
home, nearly 79 percent agreed that dogs, cats and birds made good
companions for people and 78 percent said they would support a
program in Hong Kong, which attempts to help sick and disabled
patients through the power of animal therapy.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the interviewees agreed with animal testing,
but 94 percent said they would actually use medicines containing
plants, rather than animals, if it was shown that the plants were
equally effective.
</P>
<P>
Jill Robinson, founder of the AAF, said the poll results
reflect that many people in Hong Kong are seriously concerned
about the conservation and cruelty impacts. It is time to turn
this awareness and concern into tangible programs which will
urgently work toward helping and protecting wild, domesticated and
endangered species, Robinson added.
</P>
<P>
Chris Hanselman of the SPCA said the poll showed that the
public is very supportive of measures to protect animals through
legislation and stiffer penalties and he asked the government to
act on these views.

<HEADLINE> Banking Services Paralyzed in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Banking services all over
India came to a grinding halt Thursday as more than 1.25 million
employees began a two-day national strike for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The government urged representatives of the United Forum of
Banking Unions (UFBU) to stop the strike and come to the
negotiating table, but strike leaders said they would not give it
up unless their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources here said the Indian Bank Association,
representing the management, was willing to enhance the wages
package to 11 percent from 10 percent if the UFBU, formed by nine
unions, immediately called off its strike.
</P>
<P>
V. K. Gupta, joint secretary of the National Confederation of
Bank Employees, told the Press Trust of India Thursday that there
was no way they would agree to come down below an 18-percent hike
in wages as they had substantially lowered it from their demand
for a 40-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, more than 10,000 bank employees staged a
demonstration outside the State Bank of India on Parliament
Street.
</P>
<P>
In the western commercial capital of Mumbai, banking services
were paralyzed as more than 50,000 officers and employees of some
1,500 branches of various public and private sector banks joined
the strike.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Commander Vows to Continue Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 25 (xinhua) -- Iraq's air defense commander
reiterated his country's refusal to recognize the "no-fly" zones
being enforced by U.S. and British jets and vowed to continue
attacking enemy warplanes.
</P>
<P>
General Shahin Yassin al-Tikrity was quoted by al-Zawra Weekly
Thursday as saying that military planners in the Pentagon are
addicted to striking Iraq and its people, thinking they will
succeed in their "containment" policy.
</P>
<P>
However, the results of the strikes were so sterile that they
always reminded the aggressors of their failure and make
Washington feel that its aggressive policy against Iraq has become
a regional and international burden on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reluctantly confessed that to contain Iraq is
impossible; therefore, it is now calling for the "containment
policy with military compulsion," said Shahin.
</P>
<P>
He claimed Iraqi air defense units intercepted tens of the
smart, laser-guided missile fired by the U.S., and "enemy planes
just dropped missiles and bombs in the deserts or on civil sites
far away from their targets" guarded by Iraqi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for allowing U.S. and
British warplanes to use their bases to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. and British warplanes fired missiles on a
civilian target in the southern suburb of Baghdad, killing several
civilians and injuring a number of others.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that those warplanes patrolling the
no-fly zones attacked targets so close to Baghdad that residents
in the capital could hear the booms of explosions.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq,
clashes between Iraq's air defense force and U.S. and British
jets patrolling the restricted zones have almost become daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's APP Leaders Voice Support for Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Former presidential candidate of
the All People's Party (APP) Olusola Saraki and 13 other APP
leaders have declared their support for the presidential candidate
of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) General Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in capital Abuja, Saraki called on
his supporters in the country to vote for PDP candidate Obasanjo
in the February 27 presidential election, media reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Since the APP has no candidate and we are not party to the
alliance, we decided that the best thing now for us is to support
and vote for Obasanjo on Saturday," he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Saraki has been at loggerheads with the Hahmud Waziri-led
leaders of the APP over the zoning of the presidency and the
party's alliance with the Alliance for Democracy (AD).
</P>
<P>
Early this month, he was expelled from the party over the
disagreement with alliance arrangement with the AD after the PDP
won the majority of the vote in the local and state elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the group, Saraki said although they
remained loyal members of the APP, they regretted the party has
lost a golden opportunity to present its own candidate in the
forthcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the party's convention in Kaduna, northern
Nigeria, was a rape on democracy, adding the alliance candidate
Olu Falae who was the AD presidential candidate was solely chosen
by a clique within the APP leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine governors-elect of the APP Wednesday
dissociated themselves from the decision by Saraki to support the
presidential bid of General Abasanjo, saying in a statement
released in Abuja that it is not their wish to watch their party
destroyed.

<HEADLINE> 1 Million Australian Kids Have Divorced Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1 million Australian
children live apart from one of their natural parents -- mainly
due to separation or divorce, a new survey found Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in its survey said
that in April 1997 1 million children (21 percent) lived apart
from one of their natural parents.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 lived with their mother and often ended up with
a step-parent or de facto parent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said more than 50,000 children were affected by the
divorce of their parents during 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, while the annual number of divorces rose in the past
decade, the proportion of divorces involving children fell.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the average Australian family had 1.9
children aged under 17.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight percent of families had one child, 40 percent had
two, 17 percent had three and six percent had four or more.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous families, rural families and blended families tended
to have more children than the average.
</P>
<P>
Children are projected to form a smaller proportion of the
population than people aged 60 years and over for the first time
ever from about 2020.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa received
significantly more foreign investment last year despite fears of
violent crime, election uncertainty and a collapse of confidence
in emerging markets, The Star paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 17.2 billion Rand (2.8 billion U.S. Dollars) was invested
in South Africa in 1998, nine percent up from 1997, independent
consultant Business Map said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, if the devaluation of the Rand is taken into account,
the figure represents a moderate decrease from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Europe remained the major source of investment for South
Africa, and Malaysia was the biggest investor mainly because of a
4-billion-Rand (656- million-Dollar) purchase of South African
fuel giant Engen by the MAlaysian state oil group, Petronas.
</P>
<P>
Italians joined the country's investor list and occupied third
place on arrival. The United States dropped to fourth place from
its previous No. one position, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the investment last year was through mergers and
acquisitions, and foreign investors began to show an interest in
new sectors such as mining and construction, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said South Africa still had to do more to
woo long- term capital, as investors were concerned about
appalling crime level and costly labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
Crime statistics show that South Africa has one of the worst
rates for murder and rape in the world. The image was even more
tarnished recently when a prominent Korean businessman was
murdered in Johannesburg and dozens of American tourists were
robbed at knife-point.
</P>
<P>
Other concerns include labor policy, taxation, skills
shortages, immigration hurdles and governance, Business Map said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is battling a balance of payments and current
account deficit and must borrow from abroad to finance the
shortfall in domestic savings.
</P>
<P>
It needs capital to invest in the economy to lift growth, which
slumped in the final quarter of last year into full recession.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the corporate tax reduction from 35 percent to
30 percent announced in the 1999/2000 budget last week would help
create a favorable investment environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Unrest continued to spread
sporadically in several places in the riot-torn Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku Province, on Thursday and 24 people have
reportedly died during the clash over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
The noise of gunfire and series of bomb explosions were
sometimes rocking the city since early Thursday morning and
followed by burning houses, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday, several praying houses in Batu Merah Dalam
village have been abandoned by the people after two persons were
killed and dozens injured by gunfire in the village.
</P>
<P>
Two choppers from the armed forces are flying over the city
while police and armed forces cars evacuate dead bodies and
injured people to the hospital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku Province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslim and Christian groups
since mid-January which have left at least 127 people dead and
caused massive damage.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim, but Maluku
is a predominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns Worsening Food Shortage in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) - The United Nations has
warned Tanzania that its food shortage could worsen in the coming
months as the short rains harvest production is expected at least
60 percent lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission carried
out by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
World Food Program (WFP) said that a dramatically reduced rainfall
discouraged farmers from planting and lowered yields sharply.
</P>
<P>
According to the report published Thursday by local newspapers,
Tanzania farmers will only produce 228,200 tons of maize in this
Vuli (Short Rains) season, compared with 568,600 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfall in current Vuli production and successive poor
harvests in parts of the country has significantly increased the
number of people that are vulnerable to food shortages," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although production was relatively good
and surplus stocks are available in some parts of the country, but
the food will not find its way to the deficit areas due to
reluctance by businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"Commercial transporters are hesitant to move supplies to
remote and distant locations of the country where road conditions
are difficult, markets restricted and purchasing power generally
low," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report expects that rainfall over the next two months will
also be critical for crop production and food supply prospect
because it will heavily influence the outcome of the Masika (Long
Rains) season crops to be harvested from May.
</P>
<P>
In addition to food, the report said, there is a desperate need
for seeds in the same areas because many farmers lost seeds
through failed plantings or have eaten them to survive.
</P>
<P>
Providing cereal seeds to 36,000 needy rural families, FAO
estimates the minimum need for seeds at 5.5 million Dollars in
order to assist some 270, 000 more families in the coming
1999/2000 crop season.
</P>
<P>
FAO will launch an international appeal shortly to raise the
funds to purchase and distribute seeds to farm families most
affected by the adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The UN agencies warn that if food shortages continue, rural
families will begin selling their few real assets, causing an even
bigger problem when the whole populations are left with nothing to
fall back on.
</P>
<P>
Since October, WFP has been providing food aid to tens of
thousands of Tanzanians struggling to cope with food shortages in
the country's two worst-affected districts of Dodoma and Singida.
</P>
<P>
This month the agency has increased its assistance to the area
and will feed 644,000 poor and hungry persons in the two
districts.
</P>
<P>
To meet immediate food needs, the Tanzanian Government has
released grain from its strategic reserves to assist the famine
threatening people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye told a
meeting by donors that the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) has been
reduced from 32,926 tons on January 21 to just 20,000 tons at
present as the commercial stock.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that the country faced a deficit of
approximately 600,000 tons of grain.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Reported Netanyahu Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians have rejected
an Israeli offer to carry out parts of the peace deal signed last
year, saying any proposal excluding further troop withdrawal is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has proposed that Israel release Palestinian criminal
prisoners and open a southern route for safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza in order to revive the stalled Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky confirmed that the message
of "partial steps" has been sent to the Palestinians through a
third party.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat refused to confirm
or deny the existence of the offer, but emphasized that "we won't
accept partial measures. To exclude a territorial component is to
make the peace process meaningless."
</P>
<P>
The partial offer from Netanyahu was the first Israeli proposal
concerning the Wye agreement since the accord broke down in
December. The interim deal calls on Israel to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the implementation of the accord in a futile
attempt to prevent his fragile coalition from being toppled by his
own partners. He charged Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
security obligations as called for by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which helped broker the accord, however, disputed
with Israel over its allegations. Senior American officials said
Palestinians are implementing their part of the deal while Israel
has failed to carry out its part.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeatedly said the early election in Israel,
slated for May, would not be a factor affecting his decision on
whether or not to continue to implement the Wye agreement, which
expired in late January.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat said he suspects that Netanyahu had offered this
partial deal in an attempt to persuade the electorate that he is
serious about peace, while at the same time not to alienate the
right-wingers with a territorial compromise.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be brought into the Israeli elections," he said.

JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Yad Vashem, or
Holocaust Memorial, has launched an ambitious project to
computerize millions of names of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports Thursday, the name listing
will be accompanied with all known details about the victims in
order to help track their unclaimed assets and boost Holocaust
research.
</P>
<P>
When the first stage of computerization is completed in March,
Yad Vashem hopes it will be able to hand a list of more than 3
million names to the Volcker Commission, which is tracking the
victims' assets in Swiss banks, The Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project, about 8 million U.S. dollars, will be
shared by the Swiss Bankers Association and the World Jewish
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev said he hoped that ultimately
some 5 million names will be gathered and stored on computer. He
said Yad Vashem hopes in the long run to establish a central data
base to be accessible through the Internet and to boost research.

JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Indonesia

conditions for businessmen who do business in the
Australia-Indonesia Development Area (AIDA), according to Antara
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The outcomes of the Indonesia-Australia Ministerial Meeting
held in Denpasar, Bali, on Thursday in the context of AIDA include
the exemption of fiscal taxes for businessmen of both countries
who want to travel within the AIDA region.
</P>
<P>
The territories which are included in the AIDA region are all
provinces in eastern Indonesia and all areas of northern
Australia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another provision mentioned in the joint
ministerial communique was exemption from income tax for three to
10 years for pioneering industries in the AIDA region.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has decided to grant free visas to
foreigners wanting to travel within the AIDA region within a short

<HEADLINE> UAE to Enforce Stringent Environment Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will soon enforce a draft law on environment protection
which stipulates stringent penalties, including capital punishment
and life sentence, for people found guilty of causing serious
damage to environment.
</P>
<P>
The law has been drafted by the Federal Environmental Agency
(FEA) and other agencies concerned in the wake of a spate of oil
spills in the coastal areas of the country in recent years, the
Khaleej Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has been approved by the federal cabinet recently and is
awaiting endorsement by President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft law, people found violating the regulation that
bans the import, burying, dumping, storing or disposing of nuclear
waste, will receive death penalty or life sentence and a fine of
between 1 million dirhams (about 270,000 U.S. dollars) and 10
million dirhams (about 2,700,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For violators of Article 18 of the law, which bans firms
licensed to search for, reproduce or exploit oil-fields from
discharging pollutants without taking necessary safety measures,
the punishment is a maximum of five years and a minimum of two
years in jail and a fine of between 200,000 dirhams (about 54,000
dollars) and 500,000 dirhams (about 135,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The same punishments apply to offenders under Article 57 which
prohibits circulation of and dealing in hazardous substances and
hazardous waste without obtaining a permit from authorities
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the FEA will act as commissioned inspectors to
ensure compliance with the law which also bans any act or
activity adversely affecting wildlife reserves or polluting the
air, soil, drinking water or natural resources.

JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens reiterated on
Wednesday his opposition to any unilateral withdrawal of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon. He said in the northern city of
Haifa that without a security agreement with the Lebanese
government, the withdrawal would be a gamble on the security of

<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered the
Palestinians "partial measures" to revive the land-for-peace Wye
accord through a third party within the past one or two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is offering to release petty criminal prisoners and
open a southern route for the safe passage between the West Bank
and Gaza, sources close to the negotiations said. But the
Palestinians rejected the offer, which they said did not include
any further Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded Wednesday night
in a mysterious explosion at a military base in the center of
the country. The army has opened an investigation into the

<HEADLINE> hke022541#-#- Australia to Offer More Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia Thursday announced
another economic aid to Indonesia amounting to about 6.4 million
U.S. dollars to boost foreign investments in a joint
Australia-Indonesia development area in the poor eastern region of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced the new
aid at the conclusion of the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum
held in Bali, Indonesia, over the past few days, according to a
report by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting focused on questions of the future of
East Timor, one of 13 provinces included in the
Australia-Indonesia Development Area (AIDA). AIDA has barely got
off the ground since its launch a few months before the economic
crisis hit Indonesia in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
At the forum meeting, Downer said, "We agreed that there is
good steady progress being made" and "the objective of
facilitating business links is moving forward."
</P>
<P>
But Indonesian Communications Minister Giri Suseno Hadihardjono
called for real progress to be made on business deals in the area.
</P>
<P>
"What is important at the moment is the real execution of that
program, that we start real business deals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aid initiative announced Thursday is aimed at encouraging
investment in the development area and includes 5.5 million U.S.
dollars over five years to help environmental management in the
dry eastern islands which were affected by the El Nino phenomenon
and have been recently hit in some parts by locusts.
</P>
<P>
This announcement came on top of an initiative announced
Wednesday pledging up to 15 million Australian dollars (9.6
million U.S. dollars) to help Indonesia run its first democratic
elections in more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
Downer is due to meet with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie
to discuss future arrangements for the disputed province of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
And he will also meet leading political figures before
departing Friday for Lisbon where he will meet over the weekend
with his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, to discuss the future
of East Timor.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The eastern province of Fujian
will join a World Health Organization program to help stop
tuberculosis in China, according to the provincial health
department.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is to set up an advanced TB-control system to increase
the cure rate to 90 percent in the country's better-off provinces
by the year 2000, with emphasis on treating infectious
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
They expect to cover 1.5 million people with the program, based
in the four counties of Xinluo, Shanghang, Zhangping and Yunxiao.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-WHO co-operation in controlling tuberculosis started
in 1992 using the Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course, which
has helped cure more than a million TB patients.
</P>
<P>
The WHO director-general, during a visit to China last November,
said China has been the world's most successful country in
implementing this strategy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the disease still kills more than 230,000 Chinese
annually and some 6 million people in China suffer from pulmonary
tuberculosis, 1.5 million of whom are highly infectious, according
to 1998 Health Ministry statistics.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Shares ADB's Procurement Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's share of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB)'s total procurement loans accounted
for 2.8 percent, an ADB official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's share of the bank's total procurement of goods,
related services, civil works and consulting services under
various loans stood at 1.356 billion U.S. dollars for the period
from January 1, 1967 to September 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
This ranks Malaysia 14th among the 58 ADB member economies,
Stuart R. Andrews, a projects coordination and procurement
specialist to ADB's Central Operations Services Office, said here
Thursday at the ADB Business Opportunities Seminar organized by
Malaysia's National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during the same period, ADB awarded
contracts worth 50.834 million dollars to Malaysia, of which
47.233 million dollars was for goods, related services and civil
works and the remaining 3.601 million dollars for consultancy
services.
</P>
<P>
According to another ADB procurement specialist, Werner R.
Schneider, there is a change of focus in Malaysia where ADB loan
exposures to the government are now more on program loans.
</P>
<P>
An example of the program loans given to Malaysia is the
technical assistance fund worth 2 million dollars that was
approved by the ADB at the end of last year, he said. He added
that the disbursement of this loan is next week and the
consultants appointed for the project will be mobilized here by
the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
Schneider said that since the economic and financial crisis hit
the region in July 1997, the bank had, in general, been focusing
more on the social side of financing and moving gradually away
from funding traditional infrastructure and power station
construction and consultancy projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank's overall policy was to look continually into
suitable projects that need financing in developing economies in
the Southeast Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor Sentenced to 15-Month Jail in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Uganda's capital city
Kampala Nasser Sebaggala was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment
in the United States Wednesday, eight months after his arrest
there for using forged checks and lying to Customs officers.
</P>
<P>
The embattled mayor was also ordered to pay a fine of 10,000
U.S. Dollars and to refund 44,000 Dollars he fraudulently withdrew
from Bank Boston, the New Vision paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sentence, which runs from December 4, 1998 when he was
convicted by a 12-member jury in a Boston court, shocked over 30
Ugandans attending the proceedings and dashed all hope of his
quick return home.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 51-year-old mayor, who was found
guilty of eight counts of fraud, transportation of forged checks
and making false statements to customs officers, has already
appealed against the guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer Paul Kelly has already filed a motion seeking a
retrial.
</P>
<P>
Sworn-in as first directly-elected Mayor of Kampala in May
1998, Sebaggala was arrested on June 13 at the Kennedy
International Airport, New York, by U.S. customs officers.
</P>
<P>
He was on his way home from a Mayors' conference on garbage
disposal in Chicago, Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Harbor Business Affected by Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Incessant wars in the
Great Lakes Region have affected the business of the state-owned
Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA), making its cargo performance
decline at an annual rate of 2.6 percent during the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
THA Director General, Samson Luhigo, said that during 1993 and
1997, THA' s cargo performance dropped from 4,734 tons in 1993 to
4,377 tons in 1997, a local newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo was briefing the Minister of Communications and
Transport, Ernest Nyanda, who toured Dar es Salaam port Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Daily News, Luhigo said about 85 percent of
Burundian cargo were channelled through the port, but the business
was greatly affected after the civil war broke out in that
land-locked country and economic sanctions were imposed on it in
1996.
</P>
<P>
He said high freight charges on cargo originating from Dar es
Salaam was another serious hindrance, explaining that while a
container loaded with Malawian tobacco is charged with 1,600 U.S.
Dollars for transportation from Durban in South Africa to Europe,
shipping charges for the same goods from Dar es Salaam to Europe
stood at 2,400 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Luhigo said, THA earned a total
profit of 23.8 billion Shillings (about 34 million U.S. Dollars at
current exchange rate) between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The director general urged the government to speed up the
construction of a railway line from the coastal region of Tanga to
Musoma on Lake Victoria to enable THA capture the Ugandan market.

NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan top education official
has expressed concern over the declined performance in English

Education examinations, but not yet established the causes for
the drop.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Education and Human Resource Development Kalonzo
Musyoka said the overall candidates performance in the two
subjects had drastically dropped compared with previous results,
the Kenya Times daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other subjects in the declining brackets, Musyoka said, were
chemistry, Biological Sciences, Geography, Christian Religious

<HEADLINE> NPLs Acquisition in Malaysia to Complete by Mid-1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional will complete its process of acquisition of
non-performing loans (NPLs) from banking institutions by the end
of June this year, the country's central bank governor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danamodal Nasional (National Capital Fund Corporation) will
also complete recapitalizing all banking institutions whose
shareholders are not able to inject new capital by the same time,
Bank Negara (State Bank or Central Bank) Governor Ali Abul Hassan
said at the two-day Malaysian Banking Summit here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies were set up by the government last year
specially to address the problem of rising NPLs in the banking
sector and to recapitalize banking institutions that faced erosion
in their capital base respectively to strengthen the country's
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The governor said at the end of 1998 that the risk-weighted
capital ratio of the banking system in Malaysia stood at 11.7
percent while net NPLs ratio remained at a manageable 9 percent of
the total loans at the end of November last year.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta (National Asset Management Corporation) had acquired
and managed NPLs amounting to 16.4 billion ringgit (about 4.32
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1998, which represented 30
percent of NPLs at the end of November last year.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the removal of a significant portion of NPLs
from the banking system and the successful restructuring of big
corporate loans had ensured that the level of NPLs in the banking
system would not pose a systemic risk.
</P>
<P>
Danamodal has injected 4.55 billion ringgit (about 1.197
billion U.S. dollars) into nine banking institutions, restored
their balance sheets and appointed Danamodal nominees in these
recapitalized banks.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul said, "The discipline to be instilled by Danamodal
will ultimately strengthen the banking system as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's banking sector's reform process started in January
last year with the merger program for finance companies to
consolidate and rationalize the finance company industry that
represented the weakest link in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed
said here Thursday that the government's policy to encourage
mergers still remains in an effort to create a stronger banking
industry.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian President Visits New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian President Arpad
Goncz paid a state visit to New Zealand from February 22 to 25
with bilateral trade issue high on his agenda for the visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the country, Dr. Goncz, at the head of a
delegation composed of his agriculture minister and 23 Hungarian
business people, opened a trade seminar in Auckland, the biggest
commercial city of New Zealand. New Zealand business people met
their Hungarian counterparts accompanying President Goncz in
Auckland and Wellington explored further potential trade
opportunities in both countries.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley greeted the Hungarian
President and gave a dinner in honor of him.
</P>
<P>
In a press release distributed after Shipley met with Goncz,
Shipley said Dr. Goncz's visit signaled a strengthening
relationship that offered significant opportunities for New
Zealand exporters.
</P>
<P>
She said New Zealand companies regard Hungary as a good base
from which to do business in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Shipley expressed the hope that trade and commercial links
between New Zealand and Hungary will grow steadily in the future.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand established trade ties with Hungary in 1970. New
Zealand exports to Hungary amounted to 4 million NZ dollars (2.16
million U.S. dollars) last year, up from one million NZ dollars
(540,000 U.S. dollars) in 1997. Hungarian exports to New Zealand
totaled 6.8 million NZ dollars (3.7 million U.S. dollars) in 1998,
doubling the figure for 1997.

<HEADLINE> International Donors Meet in Tokyo on Aid to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The third Consultative Group (CG)
meeting on aid to Cambodia opened here Thursday with international
aid donors urging Cambodia to implement its promised reforms.
</P>
<P>
Okonjo-Iweala, leader of the World Bank delegation and
chairperson of the two-day meeting, told Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen that his country could receive as much as 450 million U.S.
dollars in aid this year if it implements promised reforms and
agrees to a mechanism to monitor progress in reform.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official made the offer on behalf of 16 donor
countries and seven international aid agencies participating in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Okonjo-Iweala told the opening session that the donors'
financial commitment to Cambodia "will be based on our
understanding that the government will deliver action, not words,
and that it will persevere on a path of difficult but necessary
reforms."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who has appealed for 1.3 billion dollars in aid over
the next three years, said at the meeting that he agrees to
holding "in-depth dialogue without external partners once every
three months to do joint stock-taking of performance against goals
and to consider suggestions and recommendations."
</P>
<P>
The proposed monitoring mechanism would assess whether promised
economic, administrative, military and judicial reforms are
actually being implemented by the government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the third of its kind and the first since
Cambodia's previous coalition government collapsed in July 1997.
The previous two meetings were held in Tokyo in 1996 and in Paris
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Commends 10 Women Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Xiaomei, a woman judge in
East China's Zhejiang Province, was once blamed for "distrusting
the Party Committee" by overturning a verdict affirmed by a county
Party chief.
</P>
<P>
But today in Beijing, Zhu and 9 other women judges were
recognized as the country's "10 outstanding women judges" by the
Supreme People's Court (SPC) and All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a high-ranking Party official in charge of political
and legal work, said in a meeting with the judges today that such
a public event is "an important way to upgrade the competence of
law-enforcers across the country and promote justice."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that law-enforcement personnel are, in the main,
staunch and competent and can be trusted by the Party and the
people.
</P>
<P>
"But we must clearly realize that some problems still exist,
and some are quite serious, and the task of perfecting the
judiciary is very tough and long-termed," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, no black sheep inside the judiciary shall be
tolerated or go unpunished," he pledged, adding that "on the other
hand, outstanding models should be made known to the public as
well as to their peers as a way of promoting the rectification
drive."
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the SPC, said that "judges, dressed
with the national emblem, should represent the image of the Party,
the legal system and the state."
</P>
<P>
All attorneys must learn from these examples to do their job
well-- for the reform, and for the development and stability of
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 180,000 elected judges in China, 2,800 are women.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Unravels Mystery of Primitive Fossil Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese
paleontologist today confirmed that a fossilized fish found in
southwest China's Yunnan Province might be the father of the "bony
fish," widely regarded as the origin of all modern vertebrates,
including human beings.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Min, research fellow at the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), published his findings in the latest issue of the
British journal "Nature" on February 18.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference organized by the institute Wednesday, many
authoritative scholars said that Zhu's extremely significant
discovery challenges the traditional theory of the evolution of
the osteichthyans or "bony fish," and provides an important basis
for further research.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu's thesis, featured on the cover of the journal,
the fossilized fish, or psarolepis, which is 410 million years old,
possesses characteristics of two sub-groups of "bony fish."
</P>
<P>
"Zhu (and his colleagues), uncovering another example of this
pattern, present a basal bony fish with such an unexpected mix of
characteristics that it forces a reconsideration of large parts of
the vertebrate family tree," said Dr. Per Erik Ahlberg of Britain'
s Natural History Museum in a commentary in the same magazine.
</P>
<P>
"This early bony fish provides a morphological link between
osteichthyans and non-osteichthyan groups," said 34-year-old Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"It changes the polarity of many characteristics used at
present in reconstructing osteichthyan interrelationships and
offers new insights into the origin and evolution of osteichthyans,
" Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also said that the fossil fish from the Lower Devonian
strata of Qujing in Yunnan Province is one of the earliest
osteichthyans yet discovered.
</P>
<P>
This research, led by Zhu, has been enlisted as a key CAS
project.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Banking System Faces Challenges: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bank Negara Malaysia
(Malaysia's state bank) Governor Ali Abul Hassan Thursday outlined
five major challenges facing the domestic banking industry which
he said needed to be addressed urgently.
</P>
<P>
The five challenges are to ensure the resilience of the banking
sector through greater consolidation, to accelerate the
development of the bond market, to manage sources of globalization
and liberalization, to enhance the supervisory framework and to
upgrade risk management capability.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia recognizes that it cannot escape the forces of
globalization and liberalization and is not turning its back to
these challenges, he said at the Malaysian Banking Summit here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We must first prepare our economy and its financial system in
order to cope effectively with these challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have put in place a comprehensive program of the banking
sector restructuring which will not only ensure the stability of
the banking system but also avoid any disruption to the loan
intermediation process so that the economic recovery process can
be expedited."
</P>
<P>
The governor added that the thrust and objective of the
financial sector reform has been aimed at simultaneously
strengthening the banking sector, restructuring corporate debts
and ensuring macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that domestic confidence must be restored quickly
at all cost and failure to do so would only increase the cost of
the economic recovery as more drastic measures would have to be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
He said Bank Negara would continue to vigorously pursue the
policy of rationalizing and consolidating the finance company
industry to face the intense competitive pressures that would be
shaping the financial sector in the future.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this, merging with finance companies into a bigger
entity will contribute more effectively to the development and
efficiency of the banking sector as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that while much attention would continue to
be focused on the banking sector, efforts to develop the domestic
bond market would be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the importance of a developed domestic bond market,
Bank Negara will intensify its present efforts to deepen and
broaden the market, involve the development of infrastructure and
institutional building and streamline the regulatory framework, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China's First Publishing Group Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Century
Publishing Group, China's first publishing group, was established
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The group, formed by five major local publishing houses
including the Shanghai People's Publishing House, Shanghai
Translation Publishing House and the Shanghai Education Press,
will serve as an experimental unit for the country's publishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
It is intended to eventually become a diversified multinational
corporation, with publishing at the core, by making better use of
publishing resources and improving internal management.
</P>
<P>
Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, said at the launching
ceremony that this move demonstrates China's determination and
confidence in reforming the publishing sector.
</P>
<P>
China's publishing industry has been thriving in recent years,
and now has total assets of 70 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China had 565 publishing houses and 120,000 types of
publications, compared with only 105 publishing houses and 15,000
kinds of publications in 1978.
</P>
<P>
However, some scholars now urge publishing houses to improve
their competitiveness and the quality of their publications.

<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite suspending formal talks
with the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF), the Philippine
government will continue with its other peace initiatives to
address the causes of the insurgency, a government official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said all government
agencies concerned have been tasked to implement peace programs
more vigorously and with more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
"The peace initiatives of the government have not stopped, just
the formal talks between the government and the NDF," he said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The anti-poverty program, socioeconomic development thrusts,
the amnesty program and the local peace initiatives in different
parts of the country will have to be pursued, he added.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada Wednesday ordered the
suspension of peace talks with the NDF following the abduction of
two army officers and a police inspector by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he suspended an agreement with the NDF, which
allowed some members of the NDF to move freely.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Garment Quota for U.S., Canada to Go up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will be allowed to
export more than 35 million dozen pieces of apparel products to
the United States and Canada this year under various quota
categories, marking a 10-percent increase over the previous year's
figure, a daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) has already finalized the
list of local garment manufacturers and exporters that is due to
receive the different categories of quota orders, the Daily Star
quoted EPB sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have finalized the list for giving quota allotment to the
garment exporters this year about two months earlier than the
previous year's date," an EPB director general for textile said.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of quick allotment is to help the
manufacturers to increase export from the country, he stated.
</P>
<P>
There are 21 and 10 different quota categories explaining the
type of apparels that are to be exported to the U.S. and Canada
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the late 1970s, the garments sector has shown
tremendous growth in Bangladesh over the years bringing in foreign
currency and generating employment for the people.
</P>
<P>
The number of garment manufacturing and exporting factories has
increased to 3,265 from only 800 nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
The sector now employs around one million people and earns
around 70 percent of country's total export earnings. The annual
foreign currency earning from the sector now stands at around 4
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> MTI Survey Shows Singapore Economic Growth Markedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew by
1.5 percent to 141.22 billion Singapore dollars (83.1 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, markedly slowing down from the 8.0 percent
growth registered in 1997, according to a survey released Thursday
by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) of Singapore
</P>
<P>
But, the growth rate is higher than the expected 1.3 percent
growth announced earlier this year by Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the sharp decline in growth to a slump in
Singapore's external demand due to the deepening recessions in
1998 in most parts of Asia, erosion of the country's cost
competitiveness as a result of the sharp depreciation in the
regional currencies and the global over-capacity in the
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows the economic downturn has led to considerable
slackening in the labor market which saw a net loss of 17,300 in
total employment and a total of 28,300 retrenchments in 1998,
recording the first full year decline in employment and the
highest annual laid-offs since the 1985.
</P>
<P>
However, as the forward-looking indicators have improved, MTI is
retaining its 1999 GDP growth forecast of minus one percent to
plus one percent despite that Singapore economic prognosis will
continue to hinge on external circumstances and uncertainties and
stress points remain.
</P>
<P>
Commerce sector led the decline in 1998, shrinking by 4.0
percent compared to a growth of 5.7 percent a year earlier as
entrepot trade contracted in line with slower regional growth
while domestic trade was affected by the falling off in visitors
arrivals, bearish sentiment and belt-tightening in the face of
increased economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the manufacturing sector which shrank by
0.5 percent in 1998 against a growth of 4.5 percent a year ago
although it had large support from the strong growth in the
chemical industry, especially from the surge in the
pharmaceuticals segment and steady expansion in the petrochemicals
segment.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sector headed the ascent with
a growth of 5.5 percent in 1998 and the support came largely from
a relatively resilient communications segment and a modest
year-end recovery in air transport. However, the sea transport
shrank in the second half of the year as the pace of trade and
economic activity in Singapore and the regional economies slowed
further.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector as well as
construction sector managed to grow 3.1 and 3.9 percent
respectively. But both moderated significantly compared with a
run-up of 11 percent a year earlier in the financial and business
services sector and a robust of 15 percent a year ago in the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Total trade shrank by 7.5 percent to 354 billion Singapore
dollars (about 208.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 with re-export
and import leading the declines.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Experiencing Unusually dry Spell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is now experiencing
unusually dry spell at a stretch for three months since last
December, according to weather experts.
</P>
<P>
This is an unprecedented event and never recorded since 1950,
the Financial Express daily newspaper Thursday quoted weather
experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Though these months remained mainly dry, but so much dryness
without rain was never experienced before, at least during nearly
last half a century," they observed.
</P>
<P>
Neither the southern nor the northern part of the country had
any rainfall during the period, which is quite unusual, they
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Southerly wind which causes rain is obstructed by "sub-tropical
reach" due to which the expected moisture is not coming from the
Bay of Bengal, explained Akram Hossain, deputy director at Storm
Warning Center of the Met Office here.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Continues to Support China's Erosion Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will continue
to support the erosion control effort on the world's worst-eroded
region, Loess Plateau, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member World Bank delegation has completed an
assessment of the erosion control project in Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, and the assessment will be
submitted to the bank for final approval in May.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Ministry of Water Resources, the bank will
provide 150 million U.S. dollars for the second phase of the
project in five years.
</P>
<P>
China will pay back the bank loan in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Chinese central and local governments will provide the
remaining funds for the 2-billion-yuan (240-million U.S. dollars)
project.
</P>
<P>
The project is the largest of its kind supported in China by
the World Bank. It covers 20,000 square kilometers in the Loess
Plateau's 12 worst-eroded prefectures and 37 counties in Shaanxi,
Shanxi and Gansu provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Worsening erosion has plunged 2 million rural people in these
areas into chronic poverty, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
the project aims to bring 4,300 square kilometers of eroded
land under basic control within five years, and reduce silt going
into the Yellow River by 29 million tons every year.
</P>
<P>
The total area of controllable land is expected to rise from
the present 27 percent to 52 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase project funded by the World Bank was completed
in 1997, and brought 250,000 hectares of eroded land under
effective control, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have increased their annual per capita grain
output from 381 kilograms to 543 kilograms.

In Sweden, the eastern region along the Baltic Sea was hit hard.
In the Stockholm airport, all flights were delayed for over two
hours since fast wind speed and heavy snow piles allowed only one
runway to remain open. Ferries on the Baltic Sea were canceled
and even trains and buses could not run normally.
</P>
<P>
The situation was similar in Finland where passenger trains
were canceled or postponed by snow piling on the rails. In the
capital of Helsinki, the public transport system was operating at
half of its normal capacity while in the southern region 125

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Infrastructure Quality Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of bridge collapses
have prompted China's State Council to tighten control over the
quality of infrastructure projects, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
In a Tuesday circular, the council pointed out that bribery was
among the causes of the accidents in the quick-money construction
sector.
</P>
<P>
It warned that contractors who dilute project quality will be
subject to administrative and criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction demands projects ranging from
dykes and bridges to use new building materials including
geotextile, a synthetic material to help prevent potential quality
problems.
</P>
<P>
New materials "are better than sandbags and other materials in
preventing water from permeating dykes, and are inexpensive," said
Zheng Dawei, an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Chunyuan, vice-minister of water resources,
out of the 250,000 kilometers of dykes along China's major rivers,
75 percent need to be reinforced to withstand future floods.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper pointed out, new materials are unable to
be widely used in water and other infrastructure projects due to
the lack of production standards in China.
</P>
<P>
At Premier Zhu Rongji's urging, the central government set 28
standards for the production and use of geotextiles on Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ceremony to Congratulate Start of Girls' Puberty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A special ceremony for
congratulating girls who have their first menses has been
introduced in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, girls aged 15 are invited to street
neighborhood committees, a kind of grass-roots community
organization, where family planning or birth control officials
bless the beginning of their puberty, discuss adolescent issues
with them, and show video tapes on sanitary information.
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen-year-old girls begin to have menses but many of them
do not fully understand the phenomenon. So we arrange activities
to promote their awareness," said Lu Zhen, a local family-planning
official with the Beixinqiao Street Neighborhood Committee.
</P>
<P>
She said the committee is mailing invitation letters to every
girl in the neighborhood when she comes of age, and about 400
girls have attended the ceremony over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists have pointed out that the younger generation in
Chinese cities are becoming more sophisticated and open-minded
than their parents who were born in the 1950s or even earlier, and
love affairs are now common in middle schools where students are
exposed to more adult films, magazines and other information.
</P>
<P>
However, many still know little about their physical condition
and do not pay much attention to their own safety, according to
sociologists.

<HEADLINE> China to Curtail Random Selling of Small, Medium-Sized Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China will put an abrupt brake
on random selling of small and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, today's China's Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the Ministry of
Finance and the People's Bank of China said in a joint circular
that haphazard selling has caused "losses of state assets and
difficulties in recovering the bank debts and the unpaid taxes."
</P>
<P>
Smaller enterprises account for 99 percent of China's
registered 10 million businesses and employ three quarters of the
country's rural employment, according to statistics of the SETC's
newly established Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Department.
</P>
<P>
During the years of reform, the circular said, many small
enterprises have taken shareholding and other non-state ownership
systems to compete in the market and be responsible for their own
profit and losses.
</P>
<P>
However, the circular noted, some regions adopted a single
solution: selling off the smaller firms, and wiping out all their
responsibilities, though it would be detrimental to the interests
of the corporate workers.
</P>
<P>
It said the selling of the state's smaller businesses should be
conducted statutorily, and said no smaller firms in the social
welfare sector should be sold.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who sells firms to overseas buyers should obey the
appropriate laws and regulations, the circular said.

BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will set
up an intra-agencies sub-committee to help Thai fishermen
negotiate fishing rights with neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Panja Kesornthong was quoted Thursday by
The Nation as saying that the sub-committee, comprising officials

Thailand shares deep-sea fishing grounds with Myanmar, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia, which yield 99 percent of Thai
marine catch each year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fisheries Department's report, some 4,000 Thai
fishing trawlers which involved in deep-sea fishing yielded a

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Higher Minimum Wage Could Raise Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that higher minimum wage
could raise unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions Wednesday from House of Representatives
Banking Committee members after delivering the Federal Reserve's
semiannual report to Congress Tuesday, Greenspan said increasing
the wage probably would push inflation higher. But he said his
main concern was "individuals who become unemployed because of the
minimum wage."
</P>
<P>
"Being unemployed when you're a teenager is very detrimental to
learning by training and becoming a productive member of the
workforce," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said raising the wage wouldn't cause job losses
immediately because, with unemployment at a 29-year low, demand
for workers is huge.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "When the economy turns down at some point, we are
going to find that teenage unemployment will be higher than it
would otherwise have been."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also said some sectors of the economy, such as
farming and steel-making, were suffering amid the general
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said farm exports have fallen dramatically, mostly because
of a drop in demand in Japan and other parts of Asia. In the
absence of a revival of that demand, "it's going to be difficult
to work our way through this particular problem."
</P>
<P>
Domestic steel producers have been hit hard by a surge in cheap
imported steel, but "prices are stabilizing, orders are coming
back a bit now, and the real pressures are easing in the steel
industry," he added.

Director of Social Services N.J. Pathirana said that there were

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- As Western countries pressure
Yugoslavia to accept a peace plan for Kosovo, many Yugoslav
political parties and organizations are expressing strong support
for the government's decision to keep the separatist-minded
province under control.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, an organization representing Serbia's disabled
soldiers praised government negotiators in sticking to the country'
s policies regarding Kosovo, a mainly-Albanian province in
southern Serbia, during the recent peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it would make every effort to support the
government's attempt to safeguard the country's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
A local branch of the Socialist Party said that Yugoslavia's
position on resolving the Kosovo crisis through peaceful means had
gained wide support among the international community, even though
the Serbs and ethnic Albanians failed to reach an agreement at the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks were frozen Tuesday until March 15 after Western
mediators reached only partial agreement between warring Serbs and
ethnic Albanians on a political framework for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the 17 days of talks in Rambouillet, France, the
Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians failed to agree on a
peace plan proposed by the international Contact Group on the
former Yugoslavia. The plan will grant Kosovo broad autonomy but
not full independence.
</P>
<P>
The military part of the proposed accord, which provides for
the stationing of 28,000 armed NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, was
left unresolved because of Serbia's steadfast refusal to allow
foreign troops on its territory.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Update with Details China Strongly Resents U.S. Ban of Satellite Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed "strong
resentment" against the United States administration's rejection
of a satellite sale to a China-Singapore company, Foreign Ministry
Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We lodged a strong complaint against the U.S. administration's
decision to reject an export license for a satellite sale to the
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications under the excuse of
national security interests," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman urged the U.S. administration to correct its
erroneous decision, saying it is "groundless and will have a
negative effect on normal China-U.S. economic and trade exchanges
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications was jointly
established with investments from China, Singapore, Japan,
Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The company's purchase of a satellite from Hughes Electronics
of the United States is for civilian mobile telecommunications use
in the Asian-Pacific region, and therefore is conducive to the
economic development in the region," Zhang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Companies in China and the United States have strictly followed
international norms in the trading and launching of civilian-use
satellites for a long time, which Zhang said, is but a normal
international business transaction and is in accord with the
interests of both China and the United States.

<P>
The pay increase, which would take effect next January 1 for
the nation's 1.4 million active-duty military, is half a
percentage point higher than a military pay increase President
Bill Clinton proposed in the fiscal 2000 budget he submitted
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
After the initial 4.8 percent increase under the legislation,
service members would get additional raises in subsequent years of
0.5 percentage points above the rate of inflation. Clinton's
measure calls for an initial 4.4 percent increase next January 1,
to be followed by 3.9 percent increases in each of the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
The Senate legislation, like the administration bill, would
also allow for additional targeted pay raises to reward
performance.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they wanted the first Senate bill passed this
year to telegraph support for U.S. troops, particularly in light
of a possible new deployment to Kosovo even if it wasn't known
exactly how the package would be financed.
</P>
<P>
Democrats tried to get the Senate to consider a series of taxes
to pay for the measure, but were turned back on an 80-20
procedural vote. They then lined up with Republicans in support
the overall measure.

<HEADLINE> Henman Ousted at London Indoor Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Tim Henman missed one of his
best chances to win a tournament this year after being knocked out
of the London indoor tennis tournament by Jan Kroslak of Slovakia
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Henman appeared to be cruising for victory as he took the first
set 6-2. He broke his opponent to love in the opening game when
Kroslak netted a simple forehand, and the 24-year-old from Oxford
was untroubled on his way to the first set.
</P>
<P>
World number 79 Kroslak struggled to make a game of it early on,
committing 17 unforced errors and gifting Henman points with
elementary mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The second set was an entirely different story however, as
Kroslak produced a kind of form that had brought him victory over
Henman in their only previous meeting in the Davis Cup in 1995,
and Henman was found wanting at crucial moments.
</P>
<P>
Henman had to save four break points on his serve to take the
set into a tense tie-break but still had several chances to wrap
up the match.
</P>
<P>
At set point down he produced two brilliant forehand return
winners to earn himself match point, but then had no answer to
Kroslak's good low service return.
</P>
<P>
A simple forehand into the net then gifted Kroslak his third
set point and this time the Slovak made no mistake with his volley
to take the tie-break 10-8 and silence the partisan home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Kroslak made the more positive start in the final set and
quickly set up a 4-1 lead before finally closing out the game 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, number seven seed Goran Ivanisevic was knocked out of
the tournament by Hicham Arazi of Morocco after winning the first
set.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian took the first set 6-3 but Arazi came back to take
the following two sets 6-3 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic looked to have done the hard work in the deciding
set when he broke the Moroccan for 4-2.
</P>
<P>
But Arazi, ranked 46th in the world, broke back immediately
with some rapid returns and went on to win the last four games.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I got some of those serves back," Arazi said
afterwards. "He was serving really well and I guess I got lucky.
It happened at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Also earlier on the day, Richard Krajicek and Thomas Enqvist
produced impressive performances to reach the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
But there was disappointment for fans of Boris Becker, when the
former Wimbledon champion pulled out of the event because he is
suffering from gastro-enteritis.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Krajicek was in commanding form against Germany's
Nicolas Kiefer and wrapped up a 6-3, 6-4 victory in just 69
minutes with his 13th ace.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, 1999 Australian Open runner-up, took the first set 6-4
against David Prinosil but the second turned into a dog-fight.
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Swede swapped breaks with Prinosil before
striking the decisive blow in the 11th game, breaking to love
before serving out for a 6-4, 7-5 win in 81 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist will now face the winner of the second round match
between Petr Korda and Greg Rusedski.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Avalanches Kill 18 in Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Three avalanches hit the
village of Galtuer in Tirol, western Austria, within two days. To
date, more than 18 people have been killed, more than 10 injured
and 21 are still missing, Austrian television reported Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The third avalanche, which left two dead, struck the village on
Wednesday and followed two deadly avalanches a day before.
</P>
<P>
Austrian military helicopters have flown rescuers, medicine and
supplies to the site and transported some of the injured to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
German and American armies have also provided helicopters for
the rescue operation. Due to the bad weather, only a few
helicopters have been able to reach the area.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers are still digging in the snow in the hope of
finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schueels both flew to the region to help coordinate rescue efforts.
The Austrian National Council has offered condolences to the
families of victims.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the avalanches were five meters high, 800
meters wide and with speeds of nearly 200 kilometers per hour.
Because of the amount of snow involved, the avalanches were
considered some of the most dangerous in 400 years, said Tyrol's
provincial governor, Wendelin Weingartner.

<P>
He warned Mexicans to remain optimistic despite the slow-down,

<HEADLINE> Blatter Shelves World Cup Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sepp Blatter, president of
football's world governing body FIFA, put plans for a World Cup
every two years on hold until a harmonized international calendar
can be produced.
</P>
<P>
Blatter announced his decision following a two-hour discussion
with UEFA officials in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Europe's governing body, headed by Lennary Johansson, had
voiced opposition to the proposal because of the likely impact on
its own European Championship and club competitions.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's executive committee will still discuss the biennial
World Cup plan at its next meeting, but Blatter will not be going
ahead with a vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The international calendar is now the top item. We have not
withdrawn the idea of having a World Cup every two years, we have
just put it in the backyard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Work on drawing up a fixture calendar to accommodate the
biennial plan is expected to take about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Johansson was angered when the proposal was made public last
year without him being consulted and he said: "We're still not
convinced it's a good idea.
</P>
<P>
"But it would be wrong for me to be stubborn and say what I
think today will be the same as what I think in 10 years," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Include Environmental Issue in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Education on environmental
issues should be included in the curriculum of junior high schools
to improve student awareness on the issue, an Indonesian official
said.
</P>
<P>
"The environment will be integrated within a relevant subject,"
Director General for Elementary and High School Education Indra
Djati Sidi said at a seminar on environment education for high
school students here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's environment is one of the most biodiverse in the
world, but experts fear a lack of local knowledge about the
ecosystem could make it become one the most exploited on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970 the Education and Culture Ministry has paid more
attention to environmental education for students, as it is an
important element of national development, Sidi was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Environment Minister Panangian Siregar said it is
important to introduce issues on the environment to children at an
early age, through formal and informal education programs.
</P>
<P>
"If the government's efforts to introduce environmental issues
run effectively, children's awareness will be established now, for
a better future (of environmental conservation) in the next 25
years," Siregar said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, education on the environment should be used as one
of the guidelines for education in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar was attended by 120 participants, mostly
high school teachers.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Farmer Living More Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nyima Ngoizhub, a farmer in the
Tibetan village of Bianxiong, some 4,000 meters above sea level,
recently moved into a spacious new 5,600-sq.m. house in the
Tibetan style.
</P>
<P>
The first floor serves as a barn for his livestock and
storehouse for farm machinery and fuel. The second floor has a 50-
sq.m. sitting room, 3 bedrooms, and three rooms that can store
several thousands kilograms of grain.
</P>
<P>
Nyima, who is in his 60s, started using machinery for farming
and engaging in animal husbandry and transportation only after
Tibet got rid of the serf system in 1959.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the earliest users of mechanical tools in his
village, some 280 km west of the Tibetan capital and, in the past
decade, he has got several thousand kilograms of grain annually
from his land. In 1989, he met President Jiang Zemin, who praised
him for his achievement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the same land used to yield very little and that
the whole village belonged to a landowner who lent them a small
piece of land to grow barley for him. Every year they had to turn
in 420 kilograms of barley from the 0.36 hectare of land and the
remaining amount was barely enough for a family of five, so they
had to borrow.
</P>
<P>
"It was like living in hell," he said.
</P>
<P>
But last year, his family sold 20,000 kg of grain, half the
harvest, to the state and that, combined with earnings from
transportation, amounted to 100,000 yuan. He also has a horse, 13
cows, and a hundred sheep.
</P>
<P>
But, Nyima is not the only farmer in his village who is doing
so well. "In spite of the honor of visiting the capital of Beijing
as a 'Model Worker'," he explained, "I'm no better off than many
of my friends."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Improving Flood-Fighting Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, a major
grain production base in northeastern China, will start a 5-year
project this year to fortify the embankments of the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers and to improve the flood-fighting ability of major
cities and farmland along them.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zongzhang, the province's deputy-governor, it
can produce 30 billion kg of grain annually, 60 percent of which
goes on the market.
</P>
<P>
But, because of poor flood facilities, last year's floods on
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers left tens of thousands of people
homeless and a great number of farmland destroyed, causing a
direct economic loss of 30 billion yuan worth of losses.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the province will try hard to build a better
flood-control network for major cities along the two rivers, a
number of reservoirs and dams, and ecological projects, and an
investment system for water conservation construction, and will
use more overseas investment and foreign loans for water
conservation projects.

BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to wipe out
illiteracy among people aged from 15 to 50 by the year 2000, today'
s "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Chen Zhili, Minister
of Education as saying that the plan coincides with another
program which stipulates nine-year compulsory education across the
country.
</P>
<P>
"In the next two years, the implementation of these programs
will target mountainous, pastoral remote and border areas with
underdeveloped economies," Chen told a conference held in Beijing
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The conference discussed issues related to China's Action Plan
on Education Development for the 21st century, drafted by Chen's
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than three quarters of China's population who
live in developed areas have received nine-year compulsory
education, the ministry figure indicate.
</P>
<P>
The 21st-century-oriented plan also demands that governments
and schools provide various programs to train new employees.
</P>
<P>
The State will make more efforts to develop computerized long-
distance education networks so as to help build a nationwide
education system that can provide life-time education
opportunities in the next century for all Chinese people, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Vocational and continuing education programs will contribute to
on-the-job and re-employment training, says the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Even tennis star and ardent
soccer fan Boris Becker Wednesday joined the long list of critics
of German national team coach Erich Ribbeck in the wake of some
poor results.
</P>
<P>
"The core of the team is the same as at the World Cup in France.
I ask myself, why did one separate with (coach) Berti Vogts?"
Becker asked in the Sport Bild weekly.
</P>
<P>
Becker said that even his friend from Bayern Munich, 37-year-
old national team veteran Lothar Matthaeus, was surprised that
Ribbeck, who replaced Vogts last September, did not change the
team more drastically.
</P>
<P>
"Lothar just shrugs his head in disbelief when he hears he is
to be the key pillar of the team in the future," said Becker.
</P>
<P>
Becker said that Ribbeck should at least get some prominent
support in his job, for instance from the likes of Rudi Voeller,
Matthias Sammer or Andreas Brehme.
</P>
<P>
Germany have been battered in recent months. The team was
humiliated 3-0 in the World Cup quarterfinals by Croatia last year.
</P>
<P>
A hardly reshaped team then lost 1-0 in Turkey in a European
championship qualifier in September. Earlier this month Germany
even lost to the United States for the first time in a 3-0
drubbing.

dollars, higher than the 1.71-billion-U.S. dollar ceiling set by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Philippine Post said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star newspaper said that the possibility of a
higher budget shortfall can be attributed to the seeming
reluctance of Congress to pass several revenue generating measures
expected to help bridge the budget gap.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post quoted government sources as saying that
the IMF was worried over the country's revenue performance,
failure to adopt prescribed tax reforms and difficulties in the
passage of the proposed new taxes.
</P>
<P>
"There are fears (from the IMF) that the legislative revenue
measures will be rejected by Congress," the sources said. "This
will result in a higher deficit."
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu is moving to convince
lawmakers to enact into law the proposed idle land tax, land
conversion tax and road user's tax, the Philippine Post said.
</P>
<P>
These measures are designed to generate some 350-million-U.S.
dollar worth of additional income, it said.

ROME, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 demonstrators took
peacefully to the streets in Rome Wednesday in support of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan arrested by Turkish authorities
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Free Ocalan," the demonstrators marched from Rome's
central railway station Termini to Piazza Vittorio, which is the
heart of a multi-ethnic residential area in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the demonstration announced that various
associations, organizations, trade unions, political parties and
individuals concerned were determined to work for "the immediate
creation in Europe of an international conference for peace in the
region" and for a block on the sale of arms to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who were carrying portraits of Ocalan and
Kurdish flags, also called on the European Parliament to send a
delegation to Turkey to see that Ocalan will be given a fair trial
and that his human rights will be respected.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, top leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, is
being held by the Turkish authorities on an island in the Sea of
Marmara. He faces the death penalty on charges of treason.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature Flexing Muscles (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Ni Siyi
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature published
drafts of three laws in less than one year and asked for the
public's opinion, its chairman visited individual households to
get their comments on key pieces of legislation, and new measures
were adopted to keep departmental interests from influencing
legislation.
</P>
<P>
It was a busy year for the Ninth National People's Congress and
its Standing Committee, which were elected in March. In addition
to trying to improve its legislative work, the NPC was flexing its
muscles in its supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
This included setting up a budgetary watchdog to review the
budget draft before adoption and giving legislatures the power to
look into major cases of judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
With these reforms, the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, headed by
Li Peng, made headway in its first year, according to Jiang Ping,
a professor of law at Political and Legal Sciences University of
China.
</P>
<P>
Legislation has always been the top priority of the NPC and its
Standing Committee and to better reflect the will of the people,
the Standing Committee has developed laws on land management,
village committees, and contracts.
</P>
<P>
The first two, which are crucial to the public interests and
especially that of the country's 900 million farmers, incorporate
ideas suggested in letters from the public. The third law, in
draft form, is scheduled to come up for a vote at the 2nd plenary
session of the NPC.

Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peng took a step
rarely done by his predecessors when he went on an extensive fact-
finding tour not only of Beijing, but also of northern, eastern,
and southern China.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the new village committee law will be effective
in protecting the democratic rights of villagers, he spoke with
households in Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
To prevent departments and special interest groups from
affecting legislation, the NPC Standing Committee decided to rely
on NPC sub-committees instead of government departments. So far,
an earnest work style emphasizing research and investigation has
been instituted in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Legislative procedures were also improved by a mechanism that
requires each law to be heard at least three times. Younger and
better educated lawmakers are also playing a significant role in
improving the quality of legislation.
</P>
<P>
In only about one year, the legislature adopted 11 laws and 11
decisions related to laws on security, higher education, military
service, and foreign exchange crimes. Six more drafts are under
review.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's hopes at the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney will come not only from boxing but also
weightlifting, the Bangkok Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted General Chettha Thanajaro, president of
the Olympic Committee of Thailand, as saying that he thought
Thailand had a good chance of winning medals from the women's
weightlifting team.
</P>
<P>
The Weightlifting Association of Thailand has already started
their preparation for the Sydney Games and hoped to rebound at
last year's Asian Games where they won just one bronze.
</P>
<P>
Hopeful athletes are world record holder Khassaraporn Suta,
Tangmo Muangpho and Paweena Thongsuk.
</P>
<P>
Boxing has been the country's major hope at the Sydney Games.
Thailand won its first ever Olympic gold through Somluck Kamsing
in Atlanta in 1996.

<P>
To help the transition to a market economy and rule of law, the
Ninth NPC developed a five-year plan to produce 89 laws.
</P>
<P>
The new legislature, like its predecessors, exercises its
supervisory rights over government and judicial bodies by
reviewing their work reports and through inspections.
</P>
<P>
But it differed from them by publicizing tough criticism of
violations of the law, and its subcommittee for the first time
opened its closed-door examination of a national plan for economic
development and the budget to the media, and it considered the
possibility of allowing the legislature to look into major crimes
of judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
Another improvement hailed by observers was the establishment
of a budgetary watchdog. Because of the lack of a committee and
personnel, past examinations of the budget have been mostly
procedural, and the new organization will make the supervisory
action more substantial.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng has emphasized that legislative supervision also means
support for those supervised, namely, the government, the courts,
and the prosecutors. This support includes urging government to
operate in accordance with the law and urging the judiciary to
ensure that justice is served, Li has said.
</P>
<P>
The principle of rule of law is expected to be added to the
Constitution at the upcoming 2nd Session of the Ninth NPC in March,
sources say, and the legislature will play a significant role in
the push toward a system of rule by law, Prof. Jiang said.

<P>
MADRID, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish economy grew 3.8
percent last year, one percentage point higher than the average
growth rate of other European Union nations, official data showed
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth maintained a strong momentum in the first three
quarters, but slowed in the last quarter due to the international
financial turmoil, according to data released by the National
Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy grew 3.5 percent in 1997, the data said.
</P>
<P>
The institute attributed the rise to strong domestic demand and
an increase in investment. Domestic demand rose by 4.9 percent in
1998, compared to 2.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption rose by 3.8 percent from 3.1 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the economy to grow by 3.8 percent
again this year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 129-Million-Dollar Credit Tranche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved on Wednesday the
completion of the third review under the stand-by credit and the
release of a credit tranche amounting to 129 million U.S. dollars
for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, IMF Deputy Managing Director Alassane
D. Ouattara said that IMF commended the Philippine government for
its "continued satisfactory progress in implementing the program
under difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"This has contributed to the resiliency of the Philippine
economy through the recent crisis," the high-ranking IMF official
said.
</P>
<P>
The credit tranche is part of the two year stand-by credit
equivalent to 1.4 billion dollars which the IMF approved last
March for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Even so, economic activity has slowed markedly, and the
outlook for 1999 is uncertain," Ouattara said. "In response, the
program has been strengthened at this review to support growth
while continuing to aim at improving the external position."
</P>
<P>
Ouattara also urged the Philippine government to continue the
banking reforms adopted under the program in order to ensure that
the sector remains in good health.
</P>
<P>
"Improving tax administration is another core element of the
program where progress has been made, and needs to be sustained to
safeguard medium-term fiscal sustainability," the official said.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that he would support "whatever necessary force"
to ensure peace in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a stake in the resolution of the problems of the
Congo," Clinton said. "I was hoping we could avoid the bad year
we've had in the Congo."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at a joint news conference with
visiting Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings after their midday
meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said U.N.
peacekeepers probably would be necessary in the former Zaire if a
settlement is negotiated there. But Annan said American troops
likely would not be needed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in response to Annan's comments, said the United
States would take part, if asked, in "an internationally
recognized" peacekeeping effort.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would do my best to support whatever necessary
force to ensure the peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Congo, the former Zaire, a rebel coalition of ethnic
Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians took arms last August to fight against President
Laurent Kabila. Backed with troops and armor from Rwanda and
Uganda they have advanced through Congo's eastern part, fighting
government troops and Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States has provided more than 75
million U.S. dollars in Humanitarian assistance to refugees and
victims of violence in Africa over the past 18 months. He said he
would like to increase the U.S. contribution to ECOMOG, a West
African peacekeeping force."

BUCHAREST, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Luxembourg Wednesday
expressed their hope that the warring parties of Kosovo would find a
wise way to eschew a military intervention and that the region would
soon get back to normality.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu made the statement after
talks with Luxembourg's visiting Deputy Prime Minister Jacques Poos,
who is also Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Foreign Trade and
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Poos said he regretted that the negotiations in Rambouillet
had not resulted in success. However, he voiced hope that the parties
concerned would realize by mid-March that the signature of the accord
reached in Rambouillet was absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Luxemburgan guest said that his country would continue to
support Romania in its efforts to join the European Union and NATO,
stressing that the Summit in Washington due in April will have to
establish the status of the countries that had not been admitted in
the Alliance's first enlargement and clearly define the means to get
full access.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Poos arrived here Wednesday for a two-day official
visit. He was received by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
and met with Minister of National Defense Victor Babiuc and
Minister of Culture Ion Caramitru.

<HEADLINE> UK Calls on Turkey to Treat Ocalan Properly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday appealed to Turkey to treat Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan properly.
</P>
<P>
"Ocalan should receive a fair trial and his physical safety
should be assured," he said while answering a parliamentary
question on the plight of the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair said that Britain condemned "terrorism" in all
its forms.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Nairobi last week by Turkish special
forces on his way to the Airport from the Greek Embassy in Kenya,
where he had been sheltered for several days.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to face the death penalty if found guilty of
treason for leading an armed struggle for Kurdish self-rule in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's arrest caused a wave of protest by Kurds around
Europe. Seventy-nine Kurds forced their way into the Greek Embassy
in London last week to demonstrate their anger against the role
Greece played in Ocalan's case.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully th ree days later when the Kurds gave
themselves in to London police.

<HEADLINE> Sunlight May Work as Cheap Alternative to Medical Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sunlight might one day offer
developing countries a cheap alternative to expensive medical
lasers, researchers in Israel said Wednesday in the New Scientist
journal.
</P>
<P>
Physicists Jeffrey Gordon and Daniel Feuermann of Ben-Gurion
University in Beersheva told the magazine that many medical laser
treatments do not require the power of lasers.
</P>
<P>
If tissue does not have to be cut, they said, all that is
needed is for the tissue to absorb high levels of radiation.
</P>
<P>
Sunlight could be harnessed to provide energy for therapies as
diverse as treating skin tumors and diseases, tissue welding and
destroying plaque in blocked arteries, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
The two physicists have designed a system that collects
sunlight in a parabolic dish and feeds the light energy down an
optical fiber, which can be up to 100 meters long, into an
operating room.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed their system can be put together for a
few thousand dollars, compared with more than 120,000 U.S. dollars
for a laser.
</P>
<P>
The system would be used mainly in developing nations and field
hospitals, they said.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Biggest Money Launderer Convicted in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The owner of a London bureau de
change was convicted of running Europe's largest money-laundering
operation in London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 million pounds (115 million U.S. dollars) belonging to
British criminals passed through Ussama El-Kurd's hands in less
than two and a half years, Knightsbridge Crown Court was told.
</P>
<P>
The money was stacked into piles before shop staff hopped onto
buses with up to 500,000 pounds (825,000 dollars) at a time to
swap it for "clean" Dutch Guilders, Swiss Francs and Spanish
Pesetas at a branch of Thomas Cook's and a couple of banks.
</P>
<P>
El-Kurd, 50, a multi-millionaire, became the first person in
England to be convicted solely as a money launderer without having
faced other charges.
</P>
<P>
He was found guilty of four conspiracy counts between April
1994 and November 1996. He will be sentenced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jury that spent six days considering five and a half months
of evidence also convicted him of a related offense of attempting
to remove criminal proceeds worth 250,000 pounds (410,000 dollars)
out of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Peters, QC, prosecuting said the High Street Bureau de
Change became a "safe haven" for criminals' cash, similar to the
sort of "Aladdin's cave that burglars use to sell their jewelry,
paintings or whatever."

<HEADLINE> U.S. President on Kosovo Conflict, Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that his country has an interest in resolving the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. does have "a direct interest" in whether there is
instability in the Balkans, Clinton said at a joint news
conference with visiting President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 U.S. troops as part
of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to Kosovo for at least
three years if a peace plan were implemented. Peace talks in
France ended this week without a solid agreement.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Iraq Issue, Clinton accused Saddam Hussein of
trying to score "a symbolic victory" by targeting U.S. warplanes
over Iraq, but said America will not be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the United States had not given up hope of
eventually restoring United Nations inspections of Iraq's weapons
holdings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking hours after U.S. and British warplanes
attacked targets on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, said,
"They're trying obviously for the symbolic victory of shooting one
of these planes down and perhaps trying to intimidate us from
enforcing the no-fly zone, which we're still bound to do."
</P>
<P>
But he said, "We have not given up on the prospect of restoring
inspections" in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Kosovar Parties Asked to Honor Rambouillet Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has called on warring parties in Kosovo, southern
province in Serbia, to refrain from any actions that could
undermine the achievements at the end of the two-week peace talks
in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here late on Tuesday by his spokesman,
Annan, who is currently in Washington for a three-day visit, said
that he "strongly supports the appeal made by the Contact Group to
the parties to abstain from any actions which could undermine the
achievements of Rambouillet."
</P>
<P>
Annan also asked the parties "to honor fully and immediately
the ceasefire which could be in place throughout Kosovo, to
abstain from all provocative actions, to provide for the security
of all international personnel, and to abide fully by their
commitments of October 1988 and to comply with all relevant
Security Council resolutions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief extended a welcome to the conclusion
of negotiation led by the six-member Contact Group that have led
to an agreement on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up some 90 percent of the province's population of
2 million, "while respecting the national sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is pleased that there is a commitment to
attend a conference, covering all aspects of implementation, on
March 15, and hopes that it will result in a comprehensive interim
agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Annan left here for Washington on Tuesday. During the visit
ending on Thursday, he is scheduled to meet with leaders from the
Clinton Administration and the bi-partisan Congress, including
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from ethnic Serbs and Albanians have reached an
agreement giving Kosovo substantial autonomy, but neither side
signed the accord. The peace talks was put off until March 15,
when the parties are expected to discuss the outstanding issues.

<HEADLINE> Second-Day Municipal Polls Peaceful in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The second day of the three-day
municipal elections across Bangladesh ended peacefully Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Polling was held in 398 centers in 30 municipalities, where the
elections were generally peaceful and the turnout was "large and
substantial," Election Commission sources said.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of incidents from the polling areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 persons, however, were injured Wednesday in several
bombing incidents in the capital city, including the explosion of
home-made bombs in front of the National Press Club in the
afternoon, sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Some 628,000 voters were expected to exercise their franchise
Wednesday, also the second day of the three-day
opposition-sponsored nationwide destructive strike designed to
resist the polls.
</P>
<P>
A total of 197 candidates were in the fray for the posts of
chairmen in the 30 cities.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, elections were held in 56 municipalities where
voting in 18 out of 930 polling centers were postponed due to
clashes among rival candidates and snatching of ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
Voters will cast ballots to elect their representatives in 50
cities Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The turnout of the three-day elections would be at 50-60
percent, an Election Commission official estimated, considering a
low turnout of 32 percent and a relatively high turnout of 73
percent in northwest Bogra and Jamalpur districts respectively
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, meanwhile, called for canceling the
elections and demanded the government to accept their four-point
demand including the resignation of the chief election
commissioner and to announce new election schedule.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's turnout was as low as "10 percent," according to
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, secretary general of the major opposition -
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Hopes to Return to Afghanistan Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Assistant High Commissioner
of U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Soren Jessen-Petersen
Wednesday said here that UNHCR very much wants to return to
Afghanistan and resume its work.
</P>
<P>
"Our return to Afghanistan is absolutely essential and we have
very very strong hope that the United Nation's negotiations with
the Taliban on security-related issues will lead to our very quick
return," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. pulled out its staff from Afghanistan last August
following the killing of an Italian worker and the world body has
maintained that it will resume its work only after certain
conditions related to security are met.
</P>
<P>
"These conditions are still under discussion, we cannot go back
on our own - but we want to be there - we cannot afford to be
absent for any longer because there is a need for international
refugees protection agency in Afghanistan," he said, adding that
some 2.6 million Afghan refugees are still the biggest such
community in the world presently.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Petersen, who was planning a flight Wednesday for
Kandahar, the stronghold of the Taliban militia which control over
80 percent of Afghanistan, said the trip plans could not be
materialized and now he will have a meeting with the Taliban
representative in Islamabad Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"For the return of Afghan refugees, it is extremely important
that UNHCR is present inside Afghanistan, we have been absent for
eight months and we are very concerned about that prolonged
absence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Petersen, who is visiting the region as part of UNHCR's
efforts to mobilize resources for the repatriation of Afghan
refugees, has had meetings with Iranian and Pakistani officials
over the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February (Xinhua) -- Eritrea said Wednesday it had
shot down an Ethiopian helicopter and destroyed 31 ethiopian tanks
in the past two days of heavy fighting in the disputed Badme
region.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted a government spokesman as
claiming that fighting was continuing late on wednesday afternoon
on the second day of an Ethiopian ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
"An Mig-24 attack helicopter was shot down behind Eritrean
fixed positions," the spokesman said, adding that three Ethiopian
tanks had been captured along with the 31 destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from Addis Ababa and no
independent confirmation of the claim.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia launched a ground offensive on Tuesday against
Eritrean forces, angry at Eritrea's refusal to respect the
Organization of African Unity's agreement on Eritrea's withdrawal
after occupying contested land at Badme last may.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Chief Against Fresh Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
has condemned the fresh Turkish incursion into northern Iraq and
demanded that Turkey withdraw its its troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in the letter that the Iraqi government totally
rejects the pretexts made by Turkey to justify its launching of
military operations in northern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say when the letter was sent to Annan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the alleged crackdown of elements threatening the
Turkish national security should not constitute an excuse on the
Turkish part to make any further incursion, which completely
contradicts its declared stand of keenness on Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Aziz briefed Annan on the details of the military
operations carried out by the Turkish troops on February 17
via the Gate of Ibrahim al-Khalil and the area of Rebka,
northeast of Zakho city and the surrounding areas till the
Turkish-Iranian-Iraqi border triangle.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish invasion, which is supported by helicopters and
jet fighters, has caused heavy losses in men and properties of the
Iraqi citizens, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed a no-fly zone in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
Since the imposition of the no-fly zone in the north, the
Iraqi central government has lost its actual control over this
region. Turkish troops often crossed into the region to chase
the rebels of the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed hope that the U.N. would live up to its
responsibility and prevent the continuation of
aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Annan to exert utmost efforts to let the
Turkish government abide by the U.N. Charter and the
international law and pull out its armed forces from the Iraqi
territories immediately.

<HEADLINE> UN, Taliban to Hold Talks on Refugees Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. and the Afghan
Taliban militia will hold talks Thursday on the plight of Afghan
refugees, a senior official from the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soren Jessen-Peterson, assistant high commissioner for refugees
of UNHCR, said here at a press conference that he will proceed to
the southern Afghan city of Kandahar Thursday to discuss with the
Taliban ways and means for the plight and return of the Afghan
refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world community is disinterested to provide
funds for Afghanistan due to human rights violations and
restrictions on women education.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson said he will urge the Taliban leadership to
take measures for conducive environment for the refugees so that
they could return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson arrived here Sunday from Tehran on the second
leg of a week-long tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Jessen-Peterson met with senior
Pakistani officials in Islamabad and Peshwar, capital of North
West Frontier Province, and discussed with them matters relating
to the Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the Pakistani government officials and other
senior U.N. officials here, Jessen-Peterson focused on a number of
issues relating to the estimated 1.2 million Afghan refugees, who
are still living in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 1.4 million Afghan refugees
living in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson told reporters that during his stay in Kandahar
he would also discuss with the Taliban the security situation for
the U.N. staff. "We want concerted steps to be taken for the
security of the U.N. staff," he added.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. agencies withdrew their international staff from
Afghanistan last August, following the murder of an Italian U.N.
official in Kabul and earlier killing of two staff members of
UNHCR and World Food Program in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR sees its return to Afghanistan as vital for monitoring
the repatriation and reintegration of Afghan refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Wednesday said significant progress has been made during the
suspended Kosovo peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
Although the Serb and ethnic Albanians couldn't reach a
comprehensive deal to settle the Kosovo conflict, "It's very
important that they have been able to reach a tentative political
accord that would envisage autonomy for Kosovo while preserving
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Yeltsin's
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Now, everything must be done to consolidate the process of
political settlement in Kosovo," Yakushkin said, adding "It's
important to observe a cease-fire and avoid any action that would
undermine the fragile accord."
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, on a trip to Tajikistan,
also hailed the talks' outcome Wednesday, saying they had "
produced a document opening a door to the settlement of the Kosovo
problem."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov accused NATO of unduly trying to influence the talks'
outcome by threatening airstrikes on Serbia if it was responsible
for a failure to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin noted that Russia will not send peacekeeping forces
to Yugoslavia unless it gets invitation from Yugoslavia and the
approval of the United Nations Security Council and the upper
house of the Russian parliament.

<P>
Later, they disclosed that the president will go along to pay a
visit to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers accompanying Chissano are scheduled to hold
talks with their Angolan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo also came
to Luanda Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Nzo told the media that he has
come to strengthen the bilateral relations with Angola and to
learn about the current situation in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had a letter from President Nelson Mandela for
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, but did not disclose
the content of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The South African foreign minister said that his visit has only
 coincided with that of President Chissano. However, he will hold
talks with his Mozambican counterpart Leonardo Simao.
</P>
<P>
Both Chissano and Nzo separately held talks with Angolan
President dos Santos at the State House immediately after their
arrival.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the stance of Angola, a major supporter
of DRC President Laurent Kabila, is crucial as the southern
African states are stepping up their mediation on a cease-fire in
Congo (K), the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government insists on using force to crack down on
the rebels in the DRC and the Republic of Congo because it
considered the conflicts in the two neighbors are interrelated.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of Angola, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Namibia and
Uganda failed to reach a cease-fire in Congo (K) at the meeting on
January 27.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Iraq Delays Distribution of Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
complained on Wednesday that Iraq had failed to distribute large
quantities of medical supplies under the "oil-for-food" program
and that a supply of 275 million dollars was in warehouse at the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
"In previous reports I have noted with growing concern the
frequently long delays in the distribution of supplies after
delivery to government warehouse," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said in his latest report.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter that requires the urgent attention of the
government," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As at January 31, 1999, approximately 275 million dollars
worth of medicine and medical supplies has accumulated in
warehouses," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest phase of the "oil-for-food" program approved
by the United Nations Security Council on November 26, 1998, Iraq
was allowed to sell 5.2 billion worth of oil over six months to
buy food, medicine and other goods to help offset the effects of
sanctions in effect since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and his Namibian counterpart, Sam Nujoma, Wednesday
reported progress in efforts to bring peace to the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) .
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress notwithstanding the problems," South
African Press Association quoted Mandela as saying after a meeting
with Nujoma in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents said DRC President Laurent Kabila's recent
decision to lift the ban on political parties was a positive step
toward achieving peace.

Mandela said details of the discussions between himself and
Nujoma could not be revealed before all the parties involved in
the DRC conflict had been consulted.
</P>
<P>
The presidents reiterated the importance of dialog between the
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
"Through consultation and dialog, matters can be easily
resolved," Nujoma said. "We are convinced that we will be able to
bring about peace and stability in Congo."
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed bilateral issues such as the
unemployment problems in their countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Develop Quick Test for Meningitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A new test, which can cut the
diagnosis of meningitis to 30 minutes, could save many lives by
enabling doctors to treat the disease more quickly, British
scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Until now it takes up to 48 hours to identify strains of
meningitis. Doctors need to know the variety of the disease
because vaccination is only effective against C strain meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The new test, developed by researchers at Cardiff University
and the University of Wales College of Medicine, identifies the
strain of the disease and can detect five times as many cases of
meningitis as current methods.
</P>
<P>
It works by mixing a sample of the patients's blood or spinal
fluid with tiny latex beads coated with an antibody either to the
B or C strain meningitis.
</P>
<P>
If the relevant strain is present, it will produce a sugar
which will coat the antibodies on the beads, causing them to
become sticky and clump together. The visible clumps show the
presence of the infection.
</P>
<P>
By putting the sample through an ultra sound machine, the
scientists have successfully increase its sensitivity. Because the
diagnosis can be made from a blood sample, it also avoids the need
for a painful and sometimes dangerous lumbar puncture.
</P>
<P>
Trials of the test in five British and Irish hospitals over the
past year have proved it is superior to traditional culture
techniques and is cheaper than DNA testing, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Provides Support for Medical Training College  in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has donated equipment and materials worth
some 10,000 U.S. dollars to the Kenya Medical Training College's
faculty of orthopaedic technology.
</P>
<P>
The donation in mid-February was part of the ICRC's ongoing
effort to alleviate the plight of hundreds of amputees throughout
Kenya, said the humanitarian organization in a press release here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The equipment includes a full set of tools and machines as well
as raw materials enough to produce 100 light-weight, low-cost and
recyclable artificial limbs made of polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Spreyermann, deputy head of the ICRC's Nairobi
delegation, noted that the organization's physical rehabilitation
service, set up 20 years previously, had a two-pronged approach
that provided both material support for limb-fitting workshops and
training for their staff.
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that the technologists' newly learnt skills
will be put to good use," said Anastasia Kimeu, acting deputy
principal at the Medical Training College.

<HEADLINE> Germany says Bosnian Tragedy Must not be Repeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Wednesday in Bonn the tragedy of Bosnia must not be repeated
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called for broad parliamentary support to send
German troops to help enforce any Kosovo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He said he respected those who said German troops should not go
to the Balkans given what had happened in World War II when Nazi
Germany invaded former Yugoslavia and fought a bloody and brutal
partisan war.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder said this idea could be reversed: "If there is a
historic German guilt in this region one can help clear it away by
helping to prevent further killings," he said in a speech to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called on the international community not to wait for
another Bosnia to happen, with hundreds of thousands dead, before
getting involved in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He thanked leaders of the Contact Group for having developed a
common position for peace in Kosovo at talks in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
Germany says it would contribute 5,500 troops to a Kosovo
peacekeeping force which would be set up after any final accord.
</P>
<P>
Parliament must approve the deployment but with broad
government and opposition support there is little doubt the green
light would be given.

GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Electricity consumption in
Switzerland rose by over two percent in 1998, according to a Swiss
news agency report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the record consumption is the economic upturn, the
cooler weather which prolonged the heating period, and the
increase in population, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Swiss power plants produced approximately 60 billion
kilowatt-hours in 1998, the second-highest production figures
ever, nearly one percent more than in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Germany Stresses its Interests in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
vowed Wednesday he would self-confidently push Germany's
legitimate interests in the EU, including demands for a cut in
Bonn's contributions to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"We must get the partners to understand that the Germans have a
right to their interests," said Schroeder in a speech to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who will host a one-day European Union (EU) summit
in Bonn Friday, said he would make clear to other leaders that
Germany would put forward its interests in a self-assured manner.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which has the EU's biggest economy, is the 15-nation
bloc's biggest paymaster. Bonn pays 22 billion marks (13 billion
dollars) more each year to Brussels than it gets back.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has demanded a cut to Bonn's contribution but he
cautioned this could not happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
"We must push through agreement which allows no real increase
in current contributions," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The E.U.'s current financial arrangements expire at the end of
this year. Germany, which currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency, is seeking to achieve agreement by next month on the
budget and other financial issues in a package dubbed Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
A new budget accord would set national E.U. contributions from
2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Bonn expected to see a decline in the German
contribution during this period but refused to say how much.

<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's population has exceeded
62 million, Ehab Elwi, director of the Egyptian Central Agency for
Mobilization and Statistics announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The results of a census carried out in January 1998 indicate
that the population is increasing by 3,444 persons a day or 2.4
persons a minute, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The population includes about 2 million people working abroad,
the director said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's population is expected to reach 123 million by the year
2029, he said, adding the prospect attests to the importance
of national projects aimed at luring people out of the densely
populated Nile valley, which accounts for only 4 percent of the
country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is undertaking mega-projects in the Sinai Peninsula and
in Toshka in the south to channel Nile water to reclaim land from
desert and create new communities.
</P>
<P>
The census has showed that more than 6.9 million people reside
in Cairo, or 11.4 percent of the total population, Elwi said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Accepts Palestinian State but Questions Date for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
signalled German acceptance for creation of a Palestinian state
after talks Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosny Mubarak, but
said the question of when statehood should be declared needed
further discussion.
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to find there was a broad common appraisal and
that we, with all recognition - which was emphasised - on the
right of the the Palestinian people to have their own state, are
of the opinion that the question of when is the right moment must
be clarified among friends and naturally with (Palestinian)
President (Yassir) Arafat...," said Schroeder at a Bonn news
briefing with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
A German foreign ministry spokeswoman termed Schroeder's
remarks "nothing new" and said Bonn did not have its own position
on the creation of a Palestinian state and instead shared the
common position of the European Union (E.U.).
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder's comments seemed to go a step further than the
E.U. position, supplied by the spokeswoman, which calls on Israel
"to recognise the Palestinian's right to self-determination
without ruling out the option of a state".
</P>
<P>
Germany currently holds the rotating European Union presidency
and it was unclear if Schroeder made his remarks as German
chancellor or in the capacity of the E.U. presidency.
</P>
<P>
Both Schroeder and Mubarak called for international talks on
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told reporters: "We have established that consultations
are necessary on this issue with all partners, naturally also the
Palestinian authority, and that support is needed from the
European Union and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state sometime
after May 4 when the Oslo peace agreement expires. He has not
indicated if he plans to wait until after Israel's May 17 general
election.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24(Xinhua) -- DaimlerChrysler denied Wednesday
a report that the company had reached a deal to buy into the
Japanese automotive company Nissan.
</P>
<P>
"No decision whatsoever has been reached," a spokesman told
Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) when asked about reports about an
agreement having been reached.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Japanese agency Kyodo cited what it called well-
informed sources in reporting that the two companies had reached
an agreement in principle for DaimlerChrysler to buy into Nissan,
with a final deal expected for mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman at company headquarters in Stuttgart only pointed
to previous comments by chairman Juergen Schrempp, after the two
companies in January confirmed that talks were underway, that a
decision on Nissan was foreseen in three to four months' time.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the German-American company was reportedly
interested only in Nissan's truck-manufacturing division. But
industry analysts say that DaimlerChrysler achieve this by buying
into the parent company Nissan Motor, Japan's second biggest
automotive company.

Turkey recently alleged that both Cyprus and Greece has given
backing to the rebel Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), led by Abdullah
Ocalan.

Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos last week in Nairobi,
Kenya. Turkey has accused him of leading the 14-year seperatist

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
has condemned the fresh Turkish incursion into northern Iraq and
demanded that Turkey withdraw its its troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in the letter that the Iraqi government totally
rejects the pretexts made by Turkey to justify its launching of
military operations in northern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say when the letter was sent to Annan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the alleged crackdown of elements threatening the
Turkish national security should not constitute an excuse on the
Turkish part to make any further incursion, which completely
contradicts its declared stand of keenness on Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Aziz briefed Annan on the details of the military
operations carried out by the Turkish troops on February 17
via the Gate of Ibrahim al-Khalil and the area of Rebka,
northeast of Zakho city and the surrounding areas till the
Turkish-Iranian-Iraqi border triangle.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish invasion, which is supported by helicopters and
jet fighters, has caused heavy losses in men and properties of the
Iraqi citizens, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed a no-fly zone in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
Since the imposition of the no-fly zone in the north, the
Iraqi central government has lost its actual control over this
region. Turkish troops often crossed into the region to chase
the rebels of the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed hope that the U.N. would live up to its
responsibility and prevent the continuation of
aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Annan to exert utmost efforts to let the
Turkish government abide by the U.N. Charter and the
international law and pull out its armed forces from the Iraqi
territories immediately.

NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea said Wednesday it had
shot down an Ethiopian helicopter and destroyed 31 ethiopian tanks
in the past two days of heavy fighting in the disputed Badme
region.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted a government spokesman as

on the second day of an Ethiopian ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
"An Mig-24 attack helicopter was shot down behind Eritrean
fixed positions," the spokesman said, adding that three Ethiopian

<HEADLINE> UN Drug Board Urges Research on Marijuana as Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The board that oversees
international drug-control treaties for the United Nations
recommended on Wednesday that government sponsor impartial
research into the medicinal benefits of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The International Narcotics Control Board stressed that such
research must not become a pretext for legalizing cannabis, as
marijuana is called in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Board said if the drug is determined to have medicinal
value, its use should be subjected to the same stringent control
applied to cocaine and morphine.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision on the medical use of cannabis should be based on
clear scientific evidence," the Board said in its latest annual
report.
</P>
<P>
"Political initiatives and public votes can easily be misused
by groups promoting the legalization of all use of cannabis and/or
the prescription or cannabis for recreational use under the guise
of medical dispensation," the Board said.
</P>
<P>
The Board reported that marijuana abuse has become widespread
in virtually all countries and that it was the most commonly
abused drug in North America.
</P>
<P>
The Board further expressed its concern about the
computer-assisted engineering of more powerful designer drugs and
about drug recipes that circulate on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Re-visit Plane Crash Sites in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday said that the United Nations will step up
its efforts to re-visit the U.N. plane crash sites in central
Angola and recover the remains of the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is currently in Washington on a three-day visit,
made this statement in his message to a memorial service, which
was held on Wednesday in Luanda, capital of Angola, for the
victims of the crashes of two U.N.-chartered planes respectively
on December 26 last year and January 2 this year, killing 23
people on board.
</P>
<P>
"Let me take this occasion to assure all of you that the
United Nations will intensify its efforts to re-visit the crash
sites and recover the remains of our fallen friends and
colleagues," Annan said in the message delivered in Luanda by Issa
Dialor, the Secretary-General's special representative in Angola,
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
"My outrage at these events has not subsided, nor have my
sympathies will not have been in vain," he said, "They were all
courageous men and women who fought on the frontline of peace --
to bring help to the needy, to bring comfort to the bereaved, and
to bring peace to a people who have suffered for too long from the
ravages of war."
</P>
<P>
"United Nations staff have long risked -- and sacrificed --
their lives in their efforts to bring peace to Angola," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The past year has been one of challenge and tragedy" for the
U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), he said. In June 1998,
Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, then the secretary-general's special
representative in Angola, was killed in a plane crash, together
with five MONUA staff and two crew members.
</P>
<P>
The memorial service was held at the MONUA headquarters in
Luanda, present at the ceremony were families of the victims,
representatives of the diplomatic corps in Angola and MONUA staff,
said U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva, who was wearing a
black tie in making such an announcement at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest plane crashes in central Angola, where
fighting between Angolan Government troops and the rebel National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was raging on, the
United Nations was not able to reach the two sites in time due to
non-cooperation from both warring sides on the ground of security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations visited the first crash site simply two
weeks after the tragedy took place to search any possible
survivors, the search, which only lasted not long at the site,
failed to find any survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government has repeatedly asked the 1,000-member
MONUA to leave the southwestern African country when its mandate
expires on February 26. The Security Council is expected to
discuss the Luanda demand on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa Slams EU Over Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Wednesday
slammed the European Union (EU) for its failure to ratify a key
trade agreement with Pretoria, saying the EU seemed unable to
attend to developing countries' needs despite its finely-worded
pledges.
</P>
<P>
In its first official response to the EU's decision Monday to
delay ratifying a draft accord reached last month, the South
African government urged EU countries to rise above their "narrow
individual interests" and conclude the wide-ranging free trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers Monday shelved the ratification of
the draft deal, a result of nearly four years of negotiations, and
sought to reopen talks with South Africa over complaints from
certain member states.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin,
commenting on behalf of the government, said that South Africa
would not close the door on further talks, but it would seek a
balanced deal which meets the initial objectives of the country
when it started negotiations with the EU in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The deal seeks to open the EU market to 95 percent of South
African exports over 10 years, and to grant 86 percent of EU
exports free access to South Africa over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The pact would have significant impact on South Africa's trade
as well as the whole economy, as Europe accounts for almost half
of the country's total foreign trade, and has remained its biggest
source of investment for years.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimated that the deal, once implemented, would
double Europe's investment in South Africa, particularly in heavy
industries. It would benefit South African farmers substantially
by lowering EU tariffs on almost 70 percent of South Africa's
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's farm industry, whose survival largely depends on
access to the EU market, has over years been hard hit by the EU's
policy of high subsidies for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
During the dragged-out negotiations, South Africa has
repeatedly criticized the EU for its reluctance to make
concessions on small points despite its high level of development.
 Market access for farm products has sparked most heated debates
during more than 20 rounds of formal talks.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute attempt by some EU members to torpedo the deal
was seen by South Africa as contradictory to the EU's declared
intention when it proposed the trade deal to the post-Apartheid
South Africa in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the EU pledged to help the crucial process of
transition in South Africa and hence contribute to the stability
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said that in his personal opinion, "it would be a
political disaster for the EU not to conclude this agreement...It
would manifestly indicate they were incapable of accommodating the
needs of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
His words echoed the sentiments of the South African parliament
trade committee, which said earlier that the much-trumpeted trade
deal was "held hostage by vested interests" within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Five EU states - Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece -
rejected the draft deal, saying that it was too generous to South
Africa, allowing it to continue using two wine names, "port" and
"sherry".
</P>
<P>
Portugal and Spain consider the names their exclusive brands
and insist that South Africa, which reportedly has been making the
two wines for over 100 years, should stop using them.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had agreed to phase out the terms within five
years in areas outside the 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC), and to phase out the names within eight years in
the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
But it insisted the phase-out period at home and in four
neighboring countries - Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland -
to be no less than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa had made "considerable" concessions on
the wine issue and would not renegotiate it.
</P>
<P>
"In the end we seek a balance compromise, and if last-minute
concession seeking disturbs this balance, the agreement will be
jeopardized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deal will have to be approved by the governments and
parliaments of the two sides before it takes effect. The South
African cabinet has given the green light to the deal, but the
prospect of a consensus on it from all 15 EU member states
remained obscure.
</P>
<P>
The EU's General Affairs Council is scheduled to meet on March
22, just a few days before the South African parliament is due to
be dissolved on March 26 to pave the way for this year's general
election. It means that the task of concluding the deal might be
left to the next government and parliament of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Sirens Sounded in Baghdad, Tracers Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- At around 7 p.m. local time
(1600 GMT), sirens were sounded in Baghdad and tracers could be
seen rising from the east, west and south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Residents do not know what has happened, but the sirens and
tracers obviously made them nervous. No explosions were heard.
</P>
<P>
No official explanation is available at the moment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that tracers were launched in Baghdad
since the United States and Britain launched four nights of air
raids on Iraq in mid-December when sirens were often heard before
missiles fell in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Since the air raids, clashes between the Iraqi air defense
forces and the U.S.-British troops patrolling the no-fly zones
have almost become a daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led allies imposed the no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from Baghdad's suppression.

LONDON February 24 (Xinhua) - Leading London shares closed at
record highs Wednesday as dealers reacted to the second day of
strong corporate earnings figures and Britain's positive line on
joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
The Footsie rose 152.4 points to close at 6307.6. It was one of
the largest one-day rises in the history of the market, adding
tens of billions of pounds to the value of the UK's top companies.
</P>
<P>
"The move caught us all by surprise", said the head of UK
equities trading at a French bank, pointing out that most traders
actually had expected share prices to go down.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the British market had been reassured by the
recent spate of results from top firms like British Telecom up
almost 4.5 percent, Glaxo and banking groups including NatWest, up
4.4 percent, and Barclays up almost 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. African FM Suggests Angolan, Zambian Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo tried Wednesday to arrange a meeting between Angolan
and Zambian presidents to settle their differences over whether
Zambia has supported Angolan opposition.
</P>
<P>
The direct meeting between Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos and his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba will bring
out the whole truth on the issue so that the unpleasant aspect in
the bilateral relations could be dissolved, paving the way for
peace and stability in the southern African region, said Nzo.
</P>
<P>
The visiting South African foreign minister told the press
that he had put forward the suggestion during his meeting with
Angolan president.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan president said that he will agree to meet
Zambian President Frederiko Chiluba only when Zambia ceases its
intervention in Angola's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Angola has accused the Zambian government many times of
allowing the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) to obtain weapons and logistic resources by making use to
its territories, which was denied by Zambia.
</P>
<P>
On the support of UNITA by certain South African
organizations, Nzo pledged that his government will make efforts
in preventing any further development.
</P>
<P>
"The white apartheid regime had offered much support to UNITA
in the past, but this does not represent the policy of the current
South African government," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the
South African foreign minister said he had discussed the issue
with Angolan president, which "has made progress in its peaceful
resolution".
</P>
<P>
Nzo also disclosed that the international community has formed
into two working teams to promote the ceasefire agreement between
the DRC government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nzo arrived here Wednesday for several hours' stay over before
his departure.

NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government on
Wednesday approved a new National Health Scheme (NHS), which will
be submitted to the House of Representatives (parliament) on
Thursday, Health Minister Christos Solomis announced.
</P>
<P>
The plan would provide for free health care for all, at both
state and private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Solomis added that at least five years are necessary to prepare
for the introduction of the new NHS.
</P>
<P>
At present, free health care is available only at public
hospitals and only for emergency cases and low-income patients.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, half of the cost for health care will be
paid by the state and the other half by mandatory contributions
from employers and workers.
</P>
<P>
"The Cypriot citizen will be given the right to choose his
doctor or health center -- in either the private or the public
sector, and will enjoy full 24-hour medical cover without having
to pay on the spot," Medical Association chairman Antonis
Vassiliou has said at a press conference.

<HEADLINE> Rock Circling The Sun May Be Chip Off The Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A chunk of rock 50 meters
across found circling the Sun in an orbit close to the Earth's is
probably a chip off the Moon, astronomers have suggested.
</P>
<P>
The object was discovered on 10 February by an automated
asteroid-hunting Linear telescope in New Mexico, the United
States,, New Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After six nights of observations, Gareth Williams of the U.S
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics calculated that it
circles the Sun every 1.09 years.
</P>
<P>
Its nearly circular orbit is just nine million kilometers
farther from the Sun than the Earth's, which astronomers said is
extremely unusual as comets and asteroids that cross the Earth's
orbit normally have eccentric orbits.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said that the new object, between 30 and 50 meters
across, is too big to be the final stage of a rocket.
</P>
<P>
"The most likely explanation is that it's a chip off the Moon,"
Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, astronomers do not know the object's composition, which
could cast light on its origins. However, they hope to analyse the
rock's spectrum to see how it compares with that of the Moon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli DM to Review Strategy in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) - Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens has decided to hold a review with senior officers
on the strategy of Israeli army in south Lebanon within a few
days, a senior defense official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official told Israel Radio that Arens decided to hold the
review after three Israeli officers were killed in south Lebanon
by the Hezbollah guerrillas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting the situation in south Lebanon
as well as the strategy and operations of Israeli army there will
be discussed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the near future the activities of Israel's
troops in south Lebanon are expected to be stepped up and become
"more aggressive."
</P>
<P>
Another five Israeli soldiers were also wounded in the ambush
on Tuesday. These were the first Israeli casualties this year in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern towns from attacks by guerrillas. Since then
Lebanese guerrillas, spearheaded by Hizbollah, or Party of God,
have been fighting to end the occupation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arens visited the headquarters of the Northern
Command and heard the briefing of the ambush and the overall
situation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Arens has insisted that any unilateral withdrawal of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon will be more risky and dangerous
than deploying soldiers there until a solid security agreement
can be reached with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio said that Israel's warplanes attacked
Hizbollah targets in south Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon. All
planes returned safely, but there was no word on casualties.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Saudi Arabia to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries urge Saudi Arabia to
cut crude oil output to help shore up the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters on Wednesday, Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Mohammed Rashid called upon Saudi Arabia to reduce its
production by 1.5 million barrels per day to help curb the slump
of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Rashid held Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer, responsible
for the fluctuation in the world oil markets, saying it is
implementing the U.S. goals against the oil-exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Iraq deems it necessary to raise the oil
price to 14-15 U.S. dollars a barrel from 10
dollars a barrel at present.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sagging oil prices and lack of spare parts, Iraq
exported 3 billion dollars worth of oil in the fourth phase of
the U.N. oil-for-food program, which expired last November.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which started in November 1996, allows
Iraq to export 5.2 billion dollars of oil as of the fourth phase
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British
representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the
approval of contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to
purchase oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase, Iraq was allowed to import 300 million
dollars worth of spare parts badly needed for its oil sector to
increase its oil production and export capacity.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Greece To Condemn Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official said here
Wednesday that Turkey expects Greece to openly condemn the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and end its ties with the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
"We expect her (Greece) to condemn the terrorist organization
clearly and openly, to break off her relations with the terrorist
organization and not to permit the activities of the terrorist
organization," Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli
said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Greece of supporting and sheltering the
Kurdish separatist guerrilla group led by Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured last Tuesday by Turkish special agents in
Kenya, where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi,
and was now held captive in a jail on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea
near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
He is charged with treason for leading PKK guerrillas in waging
a nearly 15-year-old war for the Kurdish independence in
southeastern Turkey that has claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have been long-time rivals over territory disputes,
minority issues and the issue of Cyprus.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry, Moses Ali,
has said agro-food processing needs further development although
it is the fastest growing sub- sector in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when opening the first workshop on
agro-food processing Wednesday in Mukono district, 30 km east of
the capital Kampala, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Agro-food processing accounts for less than one percent of
Uganda's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Uganda continues to experience high post-harvest losses of 30
percent of processing industries, yet there is demand for
processed food products in the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moses Ali said that the workshop is taking place at an
opportune time when the country is struggling to modernize
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Dick Gold, director of export and industrial development at the
 Commonwealth Secretariat which co-organized the workshop with the
Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry, said Uganda has
got the potential of increasing and improving the quality of its
agricultural products for export.

<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Governor of the Exchange Department of the
Palestinian National Authority Foad Besisou has said that
unauthorized bankers will be prevented from activities according
to a new law.
</P>
<P>
The law covers all the bankers even the roving currency
dealers, the Arabic Al-Alam Al-Youm daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Controls are being toughened after the negative impacts
inflicted on the currency market by unlawful bankers following the
death of Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Besisou said necessary preparations were finalized to regulate
the activities of bankers in the Palestinian territories and
relevant ad hoc committees were set up.
</P>
<P>
The dealers sometimes decide the exchange rate of some foreign
currencies, particularly the dinar and the U.S. dollar, forcing
the banks to approve such exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
AL-MANAMAH -- Bahrain said the slump of oil prices led to a
trade deficit of 16.6 million dollars in the first three quarters
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Its exports went down to 2.48 billion dollars while imports
reached 2.5 billion dollars, the Al-Alam Al-Youm quoted sources of
the Central Bank of Bahrain as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini trade balance registered a surplus of 245.26 million
dollars in 1997 as exports hit 3.17 billion dollars, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the first Arab county that produced petroleum in
1932, but it is running out of the oil reserves and imports some
140,000 barrels from Saudi Arabia a day.
</P>
<P>
It reexports part of its oil imports in the form of refined
products, but it does not export its national oil.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Private car sales in Morocco grew by 13 percent last
year as 35,000 vehicles were sold, an increase of 4,000 units from
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al-Hayat quoted figures of the auto industry
association as showing that demand for modern imported cars hiked
by 24 percent from 11,675 to 14,437 units while demand for
locally-assembled cars such as FIAT and UNO went down by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
French and Japanese cars took major shares of the Moroccan
market followed by the German, U.S. and South Korean automobiles.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian exports declined by 20 percent in the first
half of 1998 to 16 billion liras (356 million dollars) from the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Its imports rose from 19.15 billion liras (425 million dollars)
in 1997 to 22 billion liras (490 million dollars), the Al-Hayat
quoted a report of the Central Statistics Organization of Syria as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Water Commission of the Agriculture
Ministry has decided that farmers will be allowed in 1999 only 85
percent of the amount of water they used last year because of
this winter's below-normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated the cuts will cost some 125 million
dollars in reducing the output, not to mention the likely
increases in the consumer prices index when the demand for
fruits, vegetable exceeds the available supply.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Unemployment among the immigrants who arrived in
Israel after 1989 reached 10.5 percent to 38,000 in the last
quarter of 1998, according to figures issued by the Central Bureau
of Statistics Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed new immigrants comprised 19.9 percent of the
nation's unemployed, although the 666,000 new immigrants over the
age of 15 made up only 15.5 percent of Israel's total population.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Germany Tuesday signed an agreement on
promoting and protecting investment, the Daily Star reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will take effect March 25, will guarantee
investors from either of the two countries favorable treatment as
nationals and help remove all restrictions on the movement of
capital.
</P>
<P>
Peter Witting, German Ambassador in Beirut, who signed the
pact on behalf of the German government, said that the importance
of the agreement is that it gives Lebanese and German investors
guarantees in terms of international law.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Ogden, the U.S. multinational aviation firm, Tuesday
signed an agreement to take an undisclosed stake in Lebanese Trans
Mediterranean Airways(TMA), the Arab world's only all-cargo
carrier.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by the two companies at TMA's
headquarters at Beirut airport, is the first direct
U.S. investment in Lebanon since the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
It also marks the first investment by Ogden in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The two companies refused to disclose details of their deal,
but said the Ogden purchase did not comprise a controlling stake
in TMA.

<HEADLINE> China to Vote Against Renewal of U.N. Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here on Wednesday that China will on Thursday vote
against the extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia, which will
expire on February 28.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters that "We believe UNPREDEP has already
completed its mandate. It should be concluded."
</P>
<P>
Qin made the statement after the 15-member Security Council met
behind closed doors to discuss the question for the second day.
</P>
<P>
"You know quite well, at the adoption of the council
resolutions 1058, 1142 and 1186, the Chinese delegation made it
very clear its reservations on the repeated extension of the
mandate of UNPREDEP," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, however, had taken a flexible and cooperative approach
towards questions concerning UNPREDEP, taking into account of the
request of the Macedonian Government then," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, as known to all the situation is changed. So China no
longer finds it necessary to allow for the request of Macedonia on
the question of UNPREDEP," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP was sent into Macedonia under a 1992 Security Council
resolution to deter threats and prevent clashes, monitor the
border areas, and to report to the U.N. Secretary-General any
developments which could pose a threat to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
China, one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, maintains that the limited U.N. fund should be used to
keep peace in needy regions, such as Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council on the question of
UNPREDEP, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "It is a matter
of satisfaction that, until now, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia has not been adversely affected by the conflict in
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the bilateral relations of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia with some of its neighbors have
strengthened," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Although smuggling incidents have been observed, UNPREDEP has
so far not detected any direct evidence of arms smuggling across
the borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with
Albania or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the U.N. chief
added.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes attacked
military targets in southern Iraqi no-fly zone on Wednesday after
they were fired on by Iraqi anti-aircraft guns, U.S. defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Details were not immediately released on the incident.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive day of raids by U.S. warplanes in
both northern and southern no-fly zones, which Iraq has said it
would no longer recognize since the bombing raids in December by
U.S. and British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said on Tuesday that two months of tit-for-tat
raids against Iraqi air defenses had destroyed about 20 percent of
Iraqi's anti-aircraft missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Saddam Hussein) has demonstrated to his own
people, to people in the region, that he can't defend his own
territory or his installations," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said.

BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Several Iraqi civilians were
killed and a number of others injured on Wednesday when U.S. and
British warplanes attacked southern Baghdad, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 6:15 p.m. local time (1515 GMT), 22

</P>
<P>
Witnesses in the embassy areas in southern Baghdad told Xinhua
that they heard booms and sounds of Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery
fire.
</P>
<P>
Residents in other parts of the city saw tracers rising in the
east, south and west of the city after sirens were sounded at
around 7 p.m. local time (1600 GMT).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that sirens were heard and tracers
seen in Baghdad after the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December bombardment, clashes between Iraqi air
defense forces and warplanes of the United States and Britain
patrolling the no-fly zones have almost become a daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were imposed by
U.S.-led western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south from Baghdad's suppression.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Seven Cypriot political
parties launched a demonstration Wednesday in central Nicosia, the
capital, to support the Kurds' demand for an immediate release of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was
captured last Tuesday in Kenya. He was now held captive in a
jail on the Imrali Island near Turkish western province of Bursa
pending trial.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 people, including kurds living in Cyprus,
participated in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Holding Cypriot and Kurdish flags and chanting slogans
demanding the release of Ocalan, the demonstrators marched to the
delegation office of the European Union (EU) in Nicosia where they
handed their petition.
</P>
<P>
The petition called on the EU to pressure Turkey to respect the
Kurdish people's demand for a political settlement to their
problem.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on all democratic countries to show their
solidarity with the Kurdish people and its leader.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot political parties urged the EU to take immediate
and effective action "to safeguard Ocalan's physical integrity and
human personality."

<HEADLINE> Donors Reduce Tanzania's Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Donors have cancelled
660 million U.S. Dollars which Tanzania is to pay the Paris Club
in debt servicing this fiscal year, International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF deputy managing director Shigemitsu Sugisaki told a
press conference in Dar es Salaam that Tanzania will now pay 220
million U.S. Dollars instead of a total of 880 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sugisaki said the measure is aimed at giving Tanzania a debt
relief to facilitate its economic growth, explaining that the
country has potential for a higher growth rate of up to five
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's economic growth rate reached 3.3 percent in the
last fiscal year from July 1997 to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
He further said the IMF will study Tanzania's debt situation
later this year to see whether it is eligible for the highly
indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative whose aim is to write
off debts.
</P>
<P>
The IMF deputy chief, who left for Mozambique Wednesday, said
he is impressed by Tanzania's efforts to strive for a single digit
inflation rate in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Sugisaki said Tanzania is lined for a one-billion-U.S. Dollar
injection in grants and concessional aid from bilateral and
multilateral donors in this fiscal year ending June.
</P>
<P>
The package is aimed at accelerating structural reforms in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The present leadership is certainly creating a very favorable
environment which is conducive for economic development," Sugisaki
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official called on the Tanzanian government to
accelerate reforms, saying health sector spending should be
expanded and primary education accelerated.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for fully involving the private sector
in economic development, saying "the private sector has to be the
further engine of growth for this country."
</P>
<P>
"You cannot rely on the public sector. Private sector
development is really a key to further economic development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sugisaki, who was in the country for a familiarization tour,
also met President Benjamin Mkapa, the business community,
legislators and senior government officials.

<HEADLINE> UK Announces New Police Controls After Racist Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Secretary Jack
Straw unveiled new curbs Wednesday to combat police racism in the
country after a damning report on ther murder of black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Straw told the parliament that he had ordered an immediate
inspection of the London Metropolitan police force by the
Inspectorate of Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
The report into the racist murder of Lawrence which was
released earlier in the day labeled London's police force
"institutionally racist" and condemned officers for "fundamental
errors."
</P>
<P>
Straw's response to the report followed Prime Minister Tony
Blair's promise Wednesday afternoon during the Prime Minister's
Questions of a "fundamental shift in the way British society deals
with racism."
</P>
<P>
"The publication of today's report on the killing of Stephen
Lawrence is a very important day in the history of our country,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"It will certainly lead to new laws but more than that it will
bring a new era of race relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, the home secretary said the Race Relations
Act would be extended to cover the police -- one of the report's
70 recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Straw also said he had asked the Law Commission to consider
giving the Court of Appeal powers to permit prosecution after
acquittal new, viable evidence was presented.
</P>
<P>
But he lent his backing to Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Paul
Condon to remain in his job. Condon has admitted the report had
brought "shame" on his force, but he refused to resign.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, 18, was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop
in southeast London in 1993. Nobody has been convicted of the
murder so far.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian PM in Cairo for Talks on Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik arrived in Cairo on Wednesday evening from Egypt's
Mediterranean port of Alexandria for talks on issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Bondevik will hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri ways of strengthening the bilateral relations, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters earlier in the day in Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of Cairo, Bondevik said his talks with
El-Ganzouri will deal with the bilateral political and economic
relations, which he termed as "close," in a bid to further promote
cooperation between the two countries, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that progress will be made in the Middle
East peace process after Israel's early general elections, saying
that his talks with El-Ganzouri will tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel are stalled
due to Israel's failure to honor signed agreements and its
decision to hold early elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Norway hosted the secret negotiations between the Palestinians
and Israelis, which led to the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik arrived in Alexandria Wednesday morning and toured the
Library of Alexandria. He said that he is proud of his country's
contribution to the cultural project.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings on Wednesday urged the United States to help "put an end
to hunger, deprivation, starvation and conflict " on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcome ceremony on the South Lawn of the White
House, Rawlings told President Bill Clinton that "I am here, on
behalf of my fellow citizens from this continent, to invite
America to join us to put an end to hunger, deprivation,
starvation and conflict on my continent."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, who is in Washington for a return visit to Clinton's
12-day trip to African countries last April, also called on the
United States to pay off its 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in arrears
to the United Nations and restore contributions to the U.N.
Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the trade relationship of "mutual respect and
mutual benefit" between the United States and Ghana, and cheered
Ghana'a participation in peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon and
Bosnia, as well as the all-African forces now working in Liberia
and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States "needs partners like Ghana."
</P>
<P>
As Clinton greeted Rawlings, the White House announced that
the president will address a U.S.-African ministerial meeting on
March 16 in Washington. The conference will be attended by nine
members of Clinton's Cabinet, along with their counterparts in
foreign policy, treasury, commerce, transportation, labor,
agriculture and energy issues from 46 African nations.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on Clinton's Partnership for
Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa, as well as
identifying ways to expand and speed up economic development,
trade and investment in Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attacks Iraqi Targets in 4th Day in Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes attacked
military targets in the southern Iraqi no-fly zone Wednesday after
they were fired on by Iraqi anti-aircraft guns, U.S. defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Reading a statement issued by the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Florida, the Pentagon said U.S. Air Force F-15E and Navy
F/a-18 fighter jets dropped bombs on two surface-to-air missile
sites near Al Iskandariyah, about 30 miles south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The strikes were in response to an Iraqi aircraft violation of
the no-fly zone and anti-aircraft artillery fire directed at
coalition aircraft," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive day of raids by U.S. warplanes in
both northern and southern no-fly zones, which Iraq has said it
would no longer recognize since the bombing raids in December by
U.S. and British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Tuesday that two months of tit-for-tat raids
against Iraqi air defenses had destroyed about 20 percent of
Iraqi's anti-aircraft missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Saddam Hussein) has demonstrated to his own
people, to people in the region, that he can't defend his own
territory or his installations," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Egypt Urged to Ask Israel to Cancel Pirate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat Wednesday urged the United States and Egypt to ask
Israel to cancel the legalization of pirate settlers' radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made the request in letters he sent Wednesday to the
Egyptian Embassy in Israel and the U.S. general consulate in
Jerusalem, the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Egypt must take actions with the Israeli
government and convince it to cancel its decision to allow
settler's radio stations to transmit programs that incite
violence against the Palestinians," Erekat said in the letters.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government decision to issue licenses for
extremist settlers' radio stations, such as Arutz 7 (channel 7),
is dangerous and a legitimacy to violence and disorder," Erekat
said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Knesset passed a law 40-29, legalizing any
pirate station that had been operating for five years. The two
main stations meeting these criteria are the settlers' Arutz 7 and
Shas's Radio 2000.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the law was approved, Meretz lawmakers Haim
Oren and Yossi Sarid petitioned the High Court against it,
claiming that the law rewarded "persistent criminals."
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmaker Eitan Cabel filed a separate petition against
the law while Israel's existing 14 regional radio stations
announced they plan to file a petition next week.
</P>
<P>
The Meretz petition argued that the new law discriminates
against legal radio stations, which had to pay hefty fees and put
up large financial guarantees in order to obtain their licenses.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the petition charged, Arutz 7 broadcasts
political propaganda that serves the interests of settlers and
the National Religious Party (NRP).
</P>
<P>
The station, the petition said, therefore does not fulfill the
requirements of the Broadcasting Law, which demands fair coverage
for all political viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu absented himself
from the vote Tuesday, most of the lawmakers from the government
coalition parties voted in favor of the bill, sponsored by NRP.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said Tuesday that the new
law violates the principle of equality before the law and damages
efforts to educate the public to respect and obey the law.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Back on View of Independent Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday he has "some ideas" about whether the independent
counsel statute under which Kenneth Starr investigated him should
expire, but noted he will not make them public until others air
their views.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be better for me at this time to say less so
that others can say more," Clinton said at a joint news conference
with President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's second meeting with reporters since the U.S.
Senate ended the impeachment trial and declared acquittal of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The two articles were approved by the House along partisan
lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said White House lawyers will testify before Congress
about the independent counsel law next week, and he would make his
feeling known at that time.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was inspired by the Watergate scandal, expires
this Summer and many legislators in both parties are anxious to
see to expire or change.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that his country has an interest in resolving the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Does the United States have an immediate selfish interest in
what happens on some lonely road in Kosovo to some poor family
driving some wagon with horses that are underfed because they
haven't been able to get food? No. I would argue we have a
humanitarian interest," Clinton said at a joint news conference
with President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., he said, does have "a direct interest" in whether
there is instability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 U.S. troops as part
of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to Kosovo for at least
three years if a peace plan were implemented. Peace talks in
France ended this week without a solid agreement.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says NATO Powers not Achieve All They Want </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Wednesday admitted that NATO powers had not
achieved all they wanted at the Rambouillet peace talks between
the Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Albright said: "We did not achieve all we hoped for but
Rambouillet was not the end of the road."
</P>
<P>
A partial peace agreement reached after 17 days of talks was
"the best deal either side can get," said the secretary of
state, who returned to Washington from France on Tuesday after
negotiations between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians recessed
until March 15.
</P>
<P>
When asked why NATO had allowed two threatened deadlines to
pass for air strikes against Serbian targets, Albright said,
"The talks themselves were very productive and useful in getting
the parties together. The deadlines, while passed, certainly
focused people's mind."
</P>
<P>
She said the threat of air strikes still exists if Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic rejects the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
She said Milosevic "no longer has a choice" but to accept the
deal, or be subjected to NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that Washington's strategy at the
Rambouillet peace talks was to get the Kosovar Albanians on board
while jamming the Serbs so that it could impose huge pressure on
Belgrade for acceptance of NATO's sole implementation of a peace
accord in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she also feared that the Serbs "are getting
ready for a Spring offensive of some kind. We are going to work
very hard to make sure they know this would be a big mistake."
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed the U.S role in the peace talks, saying,
"There is a zero chance that the Kosovar Albanians will sign
onto this deal if the U.S. does not participate in its
implementation."

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls for Joint Efforts in Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Wednesday called on nations all over the world to make joint
efforts in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks at the three-day Global Forum on
Fighting Corruption, Gore cautioned that corruption in one country
can trigger economic, environmental and leadership crises in
nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
"No country can seal itself off from the impact of corruption
beyond its borders, and therefore every nation must work with
every nation to fight corruption wherever it is in the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The forum, chaired by the vice president and organized by the
U.S. State Department, attracted representatives of 79 nations
here to outline strategies against corruption in their judicial,
economic and national security systems.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that while the United States has made strides in
guarding itself against corruption domestically and abroad, it is
not immune to weakness. "No nation has a monopoly on virtue. None
has a corner on corruption," he said. "And no nation has the right
to lecture any other."
</P>
<P>
As an example, Gore pointed to the arrest this month of three
U.S. immigration employees responsible for patrolling the Mexican
border near Nogales, Arizona. They were arrested for allegedly
participating in a drug-smuggling scheme.
</P>
<P>
Gore said better world leaders and a decreasing tolerance for
crime are forces helping battle corruption worldwide. A growing
trend toward government reform also is helping, he said.

<HEADLINE> Spring Comes Earlier in Europe: Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Spring is arriving earlier in
Europe and global warming seems to be the reason, German
scientists reported Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
Trees in Europe are unfolding their leaves in spring some six
days earlier on average than they did 30 years ago, while autumn
shedding of leaves has been delayed by about five days over the
same period, said Annette Menzel and Peter Fabian from Germany's
Munich University.
</P>
<P>
The scientists analyzed data from the International
Phenological Gardens, a Europe-wide network of sites where
genetically identical trees and shrubs have been grown in parallel
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
After tracking changes such as leaf unfolding, flowering, leaf
coloring and leaf fall, they found that depending on the species,
spring is up to six days earlier for each degree increase in
winter air temperature.
</P>
<P>
Their study also showed that Europe's growing season has
increased by 10.8 days since the early 1960s and is getting longer
every year, which fits with other studies and mirrors satellite
data from 1981 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The scientists ascribed these changes to a general temperature
increase attributable to global warming and they also estimated a
global advance of between five and eleven days for the start of
spring.
</P>
<P>
"Our phenological modeling indicates that the changes are
caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of
global warming," they said in a letter to Nature.
</P>
<P>
Though the changes taking place were likely to be beneficial in
the short term, the longer growing seasons would put greater
strain on already limited water resources, especially in southern
Europe, the researchers said.
