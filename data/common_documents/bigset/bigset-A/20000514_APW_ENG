   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For thousands of Americans, rallies in Washington and 70

   FATIMA, Portugal (AP) -- Ending an enduring mystery, the Vatican disclosed
the so-called third secret of Fatima on Saturday, saying the secret the Virgin

FBI Flaw Still Has Gun Sales Halted

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI hoped to have an internal software problem fixed

official said late Saturday. The FBI's Interstate Identification Index, a
database containing criminal histories of 36 million people, stopped working
late Thursday afternoon, the bureau said Friday. This computer failure at the
FBI Criminal Information Center in Morgantown, W.Va., halted gun sales because
it prevented completion of background checks that the Brady law requires for
buyers.

   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- A blaze inside a fireworks warehouse on
Saturday triggered multiple explosions that killed at least 20 people, wounded
230 and sent balls of fire shooting over the center of this eastern Dutch town,
media reported. A sea of black smoke plunged an entire neighborhood into
darkness as the fire raged for hours after the afternoon explosions. Helicopters
and ambulances ferried away the injured. A 625-square-yard area around the
facility was destroyed, and streets in the town of Enschede, 85 miles east of
Amsterdam, were littered with fragments of concrete and shards of window pane.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre became the major leagues'
second seven-game winner as the Arizona Diamondbacks improved their
franchise-record winning streak to nine with a 6-2 victory over the
San Diego Padres on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (7-1) tied teammate Randy Johnson for the most
victories in the majors as he held the Padres to a one unearned run
on five hits over six innings. Stottlemyre struck out a season-high
eight and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' streak has lifted them to the best record in
baseball at 26-10. Arizona has beaten the Padres six straight
times, including five during the streak.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which lost its eighth straight and 14th in 17 games,
dropped a season-high 13 games behind Arizona in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre won his fourth straight start and beat San Diego for
the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell gave Stottlemyre all the runs he needed with a two-run
homer in the third as the ball nicked off left fielder Al Martin's
glove at the wall. Bell's home run followed Tony Womack's two-out
double.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the fourth, Arizona took a 3-0 lead on a double
by Steve Finley and Martin's error when he failed to catch Kelly
Stinnett's fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Spencer (0-1) made his first start of the season after
being recalled from the minors Friday. The right-hander allowed
three runs -- two earned -- on five hits in seven innings. Spencer
set a career high with nine strikeouts and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer drove in San Diego's run with a two-out single in the
fourth. Carlos Hernandez reached on a one-out error by left fielder
Luis Gonzalez, moved to second on a walk and scored on Spencer's
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks added two runs in the eighth on pinch-hitter
Greg Colbrunn's RBI single, followed by a passed ball by Hernandez
that allowed Gonzalez to score.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Andy Fox hit a double in the ninth and scored after an
infield single by Womack and a throwing error by pitcher Matt
Whiteside.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera hit a leadoff homer in the bottom of the ninth to
close it to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Stottlemyre's 136th career victory, combined with father
Mel's 164 wins, makes them the first father-son combination with
300 career wins. ... Spencer was 0-7 with a 9.16 ERA in nine games
-- eight starts -- with San Diego last season. ... San Diego has lost
13 of 15 against division leaders Arizona (2-7), St. Louis (0-3)
and Atlanta (0-3). ... The Diamondbacks have beaten San Diego in 17
of their last 20 meetings, dating to last season. ... The Padres
have been outscored 53-25 during their eight-game losing streak.
... Spencer came into the game with only one hit in 19 career
at-bats. ... San Diego reliever Rodney Myers underwent successful
surgery Saturday to repair the torn patellar tendon in his left
knee, suffered Thursday on the artificial turf in Cincinnati.
Myers, placed on the 60-day disabled list Friday, is expected to be
out for the season, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Rick Helling allowed three hits over
seven innings and Royce Clayton, David Segui and Ruben Mateo hit
home runs as the Texas Rangers held off the Anaheim Angels 6-5 on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hung on in the ninth when John Wetteland got Mo
Vaughn to ground out with two on and two out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (5-1) won his third straight game. Clayton's two-run
homer in the sixth inning gave Texas a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland was shaky in the ninth before picking up his fifth
save. He allowed Scott Spiezio's pinch-hit sacrifice fly to pull
Anaheim within a run, but Vaughn grounded out to short for the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   All three Texas homers came off Jarrod Washburn, who made his
first start of the season for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Helling pitched out of a bases-loaded jam with none out in the
seventh. His fielding error allowed Garret Anderson to reach first,
and then he walked Troy Glaus and Orlando Palmeiro to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina and Benji Gil hit successive sacrifice flys to
make it 5-3, then Erstad's foul pop ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both runs were unearned. Helling was charged with one earned run
in seven innings, lowering his ERA to 2.28, second in the American
League to Pedro Martinez's 1.01. Helling walked five and struck out
two.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead with his 10th homer in the first.
After Segui tied it with his third homer in the second, Rafael
Palmeiro's RBI single in the third broke the tie and Mateo made it
3-1 in the fourth with a 441-foot shot to dead center for his sixth
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton followed Mateo's two-out single in the sixth with his
seventh home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got within 5-4 in the eighth, when Anderson's RBI
single off Tim Crabtree scored Vaughn, who had doubled off Mike
Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis' RBI single in the ninth made it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (0-1) allowed five runs on six hits and three walks in
six innings. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, who had been 3-0 in five starts for Triple-A Edmonton,
began the season on the disabled list with a strained oblique
muscle. He was making his first big-league start since going 8 2-3
innings in a 1-0 win over the Rangers on the final day of the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Clayton's grand slam in the Rangers' 13-11 win Friday night
was only the second ever hit by a Texas shortstop on the road; Toby
Harrah connected for the first, on July 29, 1975 at Oakland.
...Helling's teams now are 35-11 when he goes 7-plus innings.
...Gil singled in the third to snap an 0-for-11 drought. ... Luis
Alicea went 0-for-4, ending his nine-game hitting streak.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 people hostage
for three weeks in a remote Philippine jungle declined to release
two ailing Europeans Saturday but offered more flexibility in
negotiations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiators had announced earlier Saturday that they
had reached an ''understanding'' with the Abu Sayyaf rebels that a
sick German woman and perhaps a French man would be freed later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   But when the negotiators met with the Abu Sayyaf, the rebels
instead discussed procedural arrangements for formal negotiations,
which have yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   After both sides agree on arrangements, which may take several
days, the first topic of the talks will be the release of the
ailing hostages, a negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Abu Sayyaf held on to its hostages, the army said its
troops rescued 183 villagers who had been captured by a larger
Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, killing
three of the rebels in a gun battle early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 rebels burst into the remote southern village before
dawn Saturday, demanded food and took the villagers hostage as they
escaped from pursuing government troops, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   MILF leader Ed Kabalu disputed contentions that any hostages had
been taken, and said they were fleeing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF withdrew from peace talks with the government following
a recent military offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts with the Abu Sayyaf rebels, broken since Wednesday,
were re-established Friday night. Envoys from the negotiators told
the rebels that releasing the two sick hostages would help start
talks on freeing all the captives, and the rebels said they would
consider it, said a negotiator who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators are seeking the early release of Renate Wallert,
a German woman with hypertension, and Stephane Loisy, a French man
with a urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiator Robert Aventajado said Wallert's condition has
improved in recent days and her high blood pressure has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting Saturday, the rebels said they would present a
list of formal demands after negotiations begin. Informally, they
have indicated they will put forward a number of demands already
rejected by the government, including independence for the region
and the establishment of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels demanded Saturday a total military withdrawal from
the area as a precondition for negotiations, Aventajado said.
However, in a softening of their earlier position, the rebels said
they would be willing to meet with anyone designated by the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf had said in a letter to President Joseph Estrada
last Saturday that they would only negotiate with Estrada's
executive secretary, ambassadors from the hostages' countries and
Libya, and representatives of the United Nations and Islamic
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French citizens, two South
Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
-- were kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan Island and taken
to Jolo, an island at the tip of the southern Philippines about an
hour away.
</P>
<P>
   An Abu Sayyaf leader said the hostages were recently moved
deeper into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police reported that at least five journalists, most
of them from French television, were still missing Sunday after
hiking into a mountainous area near the rebel camp the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Sulu provincial police chief Candido Casimiro said at least 16
journalists were reported missing by their drivers when they failed
to return as scheduled, but 11 had come back by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the journalists, Gerome Fripel of France Soir, had asked
other reporters in Jolo about how to visit the camp. The driver for
some journalists told police their van was stopped by an armed man
in the village of Kaunayan and the journalists were escorted up the
mountain, Casimiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is also holding a separate group of Filipino
hostages in nearby Basilan province. They seized those hostages,
many of whom are children, on March 20 from two schools.
</P>
<P>
   The military overran the rebels' stronghold in Basilan last
month and later rescued 15 hostages. Four others were killed and
eight are believed to still be in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
   Recent violence involving Muslim rebels in the southern
Philippines has been the worst in years. Fighting flared last month
after the military attacked rebels occupying a 10-mile section of a
highway linking several provinces to Cotabato City on Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also have threatened to strike government targets in the
capital of Manila, where a rocket-propelled grenade was fired early
Sunday at national police headquarters. Damage was limited and no
one was injured. A MILF leader would not comment on whether his
group was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, communist insurgents of the New People's Army killed
five people, including two civilians, in an ambush Saturday of a
routine security patrol in Surigao del Sur province in the southern
Philippines, the military said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Knight: Confrontation in My Blood  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES PRICHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- With his coaching future at Indiana
University in jeopardy, Bob Knight apologized Saturday for his
sometimes explosive temper and said he realizes he needs to be more
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   In a 330-word statement, Knight, 59, said he is working on
trying to control his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are times when my passion for basketball led me into
confrontations that I could have handled a lot better. I've always
been too confrontational, especially when I know I'm right,''
Knight said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's temper has fueled one controversy after another since
he became head coach in 1971. In his statement, he admitted he
needed to develop a more diplomatic approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not very good at just forgetting something and going on,
and I'm truly sorry about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of whether he would continue as coach.
</P>
<P>
   While the statement's tone was apologetic, Knight said his
temper was not a factor ''in the investigated incident,'' a
reference to allegations by former player Neil Reed that Knight
choked him.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's claim prompted university officials to begin an
investigation into the incident. Once the investigation was
announced, others came forward with stories of abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's statement was released a day before the IU trustees
were scheduled to meet in closed session amid speculation they will
consider asking Knight to resign rather than force a showdown that
could lead to his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   No major announcement was expected after Sunday's meeting. While
trustees can meet privately to discuss personnel matters, they can
take official action only in public meetings, which require 48
hours notice, excluding weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a university official denied a report Saturday in the
Daily Herald of Arlington Heights, Ill., that IU President Myles
Brand asked Knight to end his Caribbean vacation early and return
for a Saturday meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Brand could offer Knight a choice
between resigning or going through a lengthy public battle over his
future with the Hoosiers basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   IU vice president Christopher Simpson, a spokesman for Brand,
said there was no meeting scheduled Saturday between Knight and
Brand. ''I know that for a fact,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Star reported in Sunday's editions that Knight
did not send his conciliatory statement to Brand. Instead, Simpson
was told of its publication on the Internet, and called a friend of
the coach to make sure it was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson declined to speculate on how the statement might affect
Sunday's scheduled trustee meeting, The Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Starowitz, a spokesman for IU's basketball program, said
Knight was expected to return Saturday evening from his Caribbean
vacation. He declined comment on whether Knight would meet with
Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's top high school recruit, Jared Jeffries, on Saturday
joined the list of Indiana players threatening to leave the program
if Knight is forced out. Jeffries' mother, Cecelia Jeffries, told
The Associated Press that her son was frustrated that no one
connected to the investigation asked his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wishes they'd come to him,'' Cecelia Jeffries said. ''If
coach Knight left, he (Jared) would look at his options and then
possibly just stay there for a year and then move on.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Knight was one of the main reasons her son chose
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted the strictness and the discipline,'' she said. ''We
are quite fond of coach Knight. He's a good man. I'll always
believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 Knight supporters gathered Saturday in the parking lot
of the Hoosiers' home venue, Assembly Hall. A larger rally had been
proposed on an Internet forum, but it didn't come together.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Reed, one of the organizers of a larger pro-Knight rally
held shortly after the choking allegations surfaced, said he was
encouraged by Knight's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does want everyone to know he's trying,'' Reed said. ''He
wants to stay a coach. He's got some good kids coming in, and he
wants to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Dyson, an avid Knight fan from Indianapolis, said she's
confident Knight will continue coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should have taken temper-control classes 30 years ago,''
she said, sighing. ''But 30 years ago, they probably didn't have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand has given three IU trustees 90 days to complete their
investigation. Simpson said they are expected to finish well before
the June 20 deadline. Knight's contract with the university gives
Brand the power to fire him if such action is recommended by the
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation began in March, there have been reports
Knight once kicked Brand out of a practice and also showed players
a piece of soiled toilet paper, saying that was what their practice
resembled.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, reports have surfaced of fights involving Knight
and a former assistant coach, the athletic director and the
university's sports information director. A secretary in the
athletic department this week said an enraged Knight once threw a
vase in her direction and more recently stormed into a waiting
area, swore and came toward her in anger before athletic director
Clarence Doninger restrained him.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Fireworks Warehouse Explodes  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- A blaze inside a fireworks
warehouse on Saturday triggered multiple explosions that killed at
least 20 people, injured 300 and sent balls of fire shooting over
the center of this eastern Dutch town, media reported.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of black smoke plunged an entire neighborhood into
darkness as the fire raged for hours after the afternoon
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters and ambulances ferried away the injured. Several
blocks around the facility was destroyed, and streets in the town
of Enschede, 85 miles east of Amsterdam, were littered with
fragments of concrete and shards of window pane.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly a calamity,'' the town's mayor, J. Mans, told
RTL-5 television. He said 100 tons of fireworks exploded in the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our information is that 20 people are dead, but I fear that
there will be more,'' he told the NOS public television channel.
''I'm afraid that there are more people buried under the rubble,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 people live near the warehouse, according to the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters were dead and another two were missing, he
said. Health department officials said in a pre-dawn press
conference Sunday that 300 people were injured. Hospitals were
still treating 53, with 10 people in intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur video footage on RTL-4 television showed a huge ball of
fire rising over the roofs of row homes in a densely populated
area. Sparks shot skyward as more explosions followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A whole neighborhood was blown away,'' said Freek Tonis, who
lives down the street from the destroyed blocks. ''It was like a
war zone after the first explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonis also said he thought the death toll would go higher
because people initially streamed toward the warehouse, thinking
the exploding fireworks were part of a display.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were hordes of people,'' he said. ''The police needed to
nearly pull their guns to keep the people back.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood around the warehouse, called Enschede North,
resembled the aftermath of a heavy bombing raid. There were no
signs of life on the gray, ash-blanketed streets. Homes were
reduced to blackened rubble and surrounded by burnt-out hulks of
cars and mangled bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   One of Grolsch Beer's two main breweries caught fire and was
extinguished after a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Klaas de Vries arrived on the scene and said
that emergency services were being coordinated by the National
Crisis Center in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the Netherlands feels compassion for the people of
Enschede,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, emergency crews erected floodlights in the
stricken neighborhood and continued to sift through the rubble in
search of more victims. Rescue teams from across the border in
Germany assisted in the search.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of residents were spending the night in local sport
halls, which had been converted into emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the town said ambulance and fire fighters
from nearby Dutch cities, as well as Rheine across the border in
Germany, were helping move the wounded to hospitals. A local Dutch
air force base was reportedly being used to treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Police sealed off the damaged area and hundreds of extra agents
were patrolling the streets to restrain looters, who reportedly had
been going through broken windows and helping themselves to goods.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse is several blocks north of the train station,
television reports said. The Dutch national railway said train
service to the city had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Television reports described the firm that operated the
warehouse as a major importer of fireworks from China and supplier
to pop concerts and other major events in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the warehouse was licensed for fireworks storage,
but could not explain why it was situated close to a residential
area.
</P>
<P>
   No further details were given on the cause of the blast, which
followed a spell of unseasonably warm and exceptionally dry
weather. Temperatures here have been in the 80s.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Briefly lift Jaffna Curfew  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- As hundreds of people fled northward to
escape a feared assault from Tamil rebels, the Sri Lankan military
said Sunday that their bombing raids have halted the rebel advance
toward northern Jaffna town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing air raids on the area,'' Sri Lankan air force
spokesman Ajith Vijayasundara said in a telephone interview from
Colombo. ''At the moment, the advancement of the terrorists is very
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The military also briefly lifted a curfew in Jaffna Saturday to
help nearly 500,000 residents stock food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna was the rebel capital from 1990 to 1995, and residents of
the city were awaiting a final rebel push to recapture it. Some of
those looking to get away from the fighting headed across the water
to India.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, the capital of this small island nation off India's
southern coast, President Chandrika Kumaratunga called a Monday
meeting of leaders of all political parties to discuss the latest
fighting in the north, state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have
been fighting for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983, saying the island country's 3.2 million Tamils suffer
discrimination at the hands of the Sinhalese majority in jobs and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Near Jaffna, the rebels launched a dawn offensive that left
three soldiers dead and 38 others wounded, said Ariya Rubasinghe,
the government spokesman and chief censor. Rubasinghe said rebels
were forced to ''withdraw with their casualties.'' He said another
seven rebels were killed by army snipers Saturday in a nearby area.
</P>
<P>
   No new fighting was reported after the dawn attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement posted on the rebel Web site Saturday said units
were ''consolidating their newly secured positions along the
coastal belt of Jaffna city, preparing for the final assault on the
heart of the capital.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Heavily armed Tamil Tiger troop formations who have moved in
large numbers ... into the Jaffna theater of war are gearing up for
the decisive battle,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   After the fighting ended Saturday, the military lifted the
curfew in Jaffna for three hours, said an aid worker who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The government imposed a curfew in Jaffna three days ago as
guerrillas overran defenses on the city's periphery. About 40,000
government soldiers are arrayed against nearly 5,000 guerrillas in
the battle for Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Most civilians fleeing the city were seen heading to the
northwest, the aid worker said. Others were making their way across
the stormy Palk Straits to the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, 20
miles away. The Tamils of Sri Lanka share a language, culture and
family ties with the 55 million residents of India's southern Tamil
Nadu state.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's government is censoring all news reports from the
country, and has banned live broadcasts of war news. The government
said life was normal in Jaffna despite the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life in Jaffna town goes on as usual. Residents are not
showing any sign of panic and continue their day to day
activities,'' Rubasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Palitha Fernando, a military spokesman, said the troops
were holding onto Kolombuthurai and Tanankilappu, two to three
miles from the city center. He said the rebels were concentrated
further south of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel position is the closest they have come to Jaffna since
they were ousted from the city in late 1995, putting an end to
their de facto government over the surrounding area.

Ailing Hostages Still Held in Philippines

	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- 21 people are still being held captive by Muslim
rebels in the Philippines, despite government negotiators' announcement early
Saturday that they had reached an "understanding" with the group. But when the
negotiators met with the Abu Sayyaf, the rebels instead discussed procedural
arrangements for formal negotiations, which have yet to begin. In the meeting
Saturday, the rebels said they would present a list of formal demands after
negotiations begin. Informally, they have indicated they will put forward a
number of demands already rejected by the government, including independence for
the region and the establishment of Islamic law.

<HEADLINE> Tour Given of Los Alamos Lab  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- In a move officials called
unprecedented, Los Alamos National Laboratory gave an extensive
tour of its facilities to reporters Saturday, trying to allay fears
that a wildfire damaged key research and nuclear waste areas at the
high-security facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to show you we are not hiding anything,''
said Gene Habiger, director of security and emergency response for
the Department of Energy. ''If anyone thinks the government, the
Department of Energy, can suppress the truth, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency and the laboratory have come under criticism in
recent days, accused by anti-nuclear activists of not being
forthcoming about the extent of damage and possible health concerns
caused by the fire that scorched northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze began as a government-prescribed burn to clear brush
in the Bandelier National Monument, adjacent to the lab. But the
fire quickly got out of hand, fueled by dry conditions, hot
temperatures and winds of 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lab officials said that while the flames started grass fires on
lab property, burned brush and destroyed several trailers, they did
not get into critical areas where nuclear materials or hazardous
waste are stored.
</P>
<P>
   Long cloaked in secrecy, the lab is one of the nation's most
important nuclear weapons research facilities and was responsible
for the growth of the town around it.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured to provide more details, the DOE and lab officials
agreed to take reporters on a 2{ hour tour of the 43-square-mile
lab. The tour included stops at key installations, including the
nation's only active plutonium facility, which is normally off
limits to the public and under 24-hour armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, officials pointed out that despite the danger of
the fire, the lab's emergency procedures worked and prevented the
damage or loss of any significant structures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there ever the risk of total disaster? If you mean
disaster in the sense of losing one of these facilities, I would
say we were a long way from that,'' said Stan Busboom, the lab's
security director.
</P>
<P>
   The plutonium facility, known as Technical Area 55, sits on a
high mesa surrounded by deep ravines filled with juniper and heavy
brush. While much of the ground surrounding the facility was
charred, officials pointed to where firefighters were able to stop
the flames about 50 feet short of the high-security fence
surrounding the site.
</P>
<P>
   All through the lab grounds, fallen ponderosas and the
cobweb-like juniper bushes continued to smolder Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Burick, deputy director of operations at the lab, credited
''hero firefighters'' for preventing damage at another research
facility known as TA18. The site, where nuclear experiments are
conducted, sits in a deep gulch and was at one time nearly circled
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas of greatest concern, a waste storage site known
as TA54, also was untouched by flames. The site is used to store
certain types of nuclear waste temporarily until it can be shipped
elsewhere for permanent disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Energy Department study explored the possible effect of a
devastating wildfire at the laboratory. It said that in a
worst-case scenario higher levels of radiation would be released in
the plumes of smoke, but the effect would likely be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tour, some still criticized what they saw as a lack
of information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trouble is we really don't know what burned when and we
basically had no information from the laboratory of any sort of
detailed, technical kind that any outside person could interpret to
provide credibility,'' said Greg Mello, director of the
anti-nuclear Los Alamos Study Group. ''There definitely was
danger.''

<HEADLINE> Moms To March for Stricter Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by President Clinton to take on the
gun lobby and blunt its influence with Congress, thousands of moms
and their families were congregating within sight of the Capitol on
Sunday to demand stricter regulation of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   They were greeted by large banners on the National Mall, bidding
a ''Welcome To the Million Mom March; Sensible Gun Laws, Safe
Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Million Mom March'' organizers want the nation to see images
of families marching together on Mother's Day, hoping to send
lawmakers and the gun lobby a message that many more Americans are
ready to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud that so many mothers are saying this issue of
guns is a public-health challenge to our children,'' first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Sunday on NBC's ''Weekend Today''
program. ''We lose nearly 12 children a day to accidental, or
self-inflicted or homicidal gun injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   In an area bounded by the Capitol, Washington Monument and the
popular Smithsonian museums, marchers will carry signs showing
handguns with red lines through them and messages proclaiming
''Freedom From Gun Trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has issued several statements this past week
that amounted to pep talks for the marchers.

<HEADLINE> Moms Push for Stricter Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by President Clinton to take on the
gun lobby and blunt its influence with Congress, thousands of moms
and their families were congregating within sight of the Capitol on
Sunday to demand stricter regulation of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   They were greeted by large banners on the National Mall, bidding
a ''Welcome To the Million Mom March; Sensible Gun Laws, Safe
Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Million Mom March'' organizers want the nation to see images
of families marching together on Mother's Day, hoping to send
lawmakers and the gun lobby a message that many more Americans are
ready to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come here in the names of the children we love, the
children we have lost, the children we want to save,'' first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Senate candidate from New York, told
hundreds of mothers at a White House reception before the march.
</P>
<P>
   In an area bounded by the Capitol, Washington Monument and the
popular Smithsonian museums, marchers will carry signs showing
handguns with red lines through them and messages proclaiming
''Freedom From Gun Trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has issued several statements this past week
that amounted to pep talks for the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're letting the gun lobby know it is no match for
America's moms,'' he said in Saturday's weekly radio address. ''But
our nationwide fight won't be over tomorrow, no matter how many
march. We have so much work still to do.''

<HEADLINE> Barrels of Cyanide Found in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty barrels of deadly potassium cyanide were
found Saturday in a New York park, 10 days after they disappeared
from a New Jersey warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous 911 call after noon reported the barrels were in
plain view next to a baseball park in a Bronx neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately evacuated about 75 families. Investigators
wearing protective suits inspected the orange barrels to ensure
they remained sealed, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were removed about four hours later, and the
families were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were located after a trailer went missing May 4 from
a warehouse in Linden, N.J. The shipping container with the drums
of potassium cyanide was destined for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI confiscated the barrels, but officials cautioned that
the agency is involved because the crime is considered interstate
theft, and not because they suspect terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the person who stole it, since they were dumped this
way, had no idea what they were taking,'' said Richard J. Sheirer,
the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is used in electroplating, a process employed
to make silverware and jewelry, and can be fatal to anyone who
drinks or inhales it. The World Health Organization says potassium
cyanide could be used by terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Encourage Gun-Control Moms  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by President Clinton to take on the
gun lobby and blunt its influence with Congress, thousands of moms
and their families were congregating Sunday within sight of the
Capitol to demand stricter regulation of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be deterred by the political mountain you have to
climb,'' Clinton said at a White House reception attended by
hundreds of mothers, some of whose children died from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could be sitting home today, burying your heartbreak and
anger and instead you made this journey here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Fixes Software for Gun Checks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has fixed an internal software problem
that halted gun sales nationwide for more than two days, an
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs allowed resumption of firearms sales that are
dependent on background checks with the bureau's criminal history
database. The system began operating again at 7:30 a.m. EDT, FBI
spokesman Steve Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Interstate Identification Index, a database containing
criminal histories of 36 million people, stopped working late
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure at the FBI Criminal Information Center in
Clarksburg, W.Va., halted gun sales because it prevented completion
of background checks that the Brady law requires for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers had hoped for a quick fix because Saturday is their
busiest day. However, the system remain down throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Without background check approvals, gun dealers were forced to
tell their customers to wait for their guns until the system came
back up and the checks could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure made it impossible for the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to check the criminal
histories for past felony convictions that bar people from buying
guns. Also brought down was the FBI's automated fingerprint system.
</P>
<P>
   When the system is working, 72 percent of gun purchases are
approved within 30 seconds, the Justice Department says. And 95
percent of buyers get an approval or a disapproval within two hours
of their purchase application.

<HEADLINE> Prison program founder says state is phasing out ''Scared Straight'' </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Even 20 years later, the words ''Scared
Straight'' still recall the cold stares of convicts, the
frightened, tearful expressions of young delinquents and
expletive-filled tirades aimed at keeping young people out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 award-winning television special filmed at East
Jersey State Prison, convicts stripped teens of their shoes, spit
in their faces, threatened to hurt some and told them rape, murder
and lost dreams would await them in prison if they didn't
straighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' won two Emmys and an Oscar and the program,
founded in 1976 at the Rahway prison, went on to reach more than
50,000 troubled young people and has spawned replica programs
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the state has decided that ''Scared
Straight'' may be better television than it is an effective crime
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Corrections ordered a reevaluation of
the program last fall that led to a slowdown. Only one session has
occurred since December, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it decided to restart a toned-down, less aggressive
version of the program and took control of another program aimed at
high school and college classes from the Lifers, the East Jersey
State inmates who run ''Scared Straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune said independent studies
have shown that scare tactics don't stop juveniles from committing
crime. He touted a program he founded in 1998, Project Pride, which
takes inmates into schools ''to address students in a very positive
and proactive way, as opposed to the foundation of 'Scared
Straight,' which is clearly a negative context.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan August, a retired Corrections lieutenant who founded the
program, said the scare tactics were meant to get the attention of
delinquents who didn't want to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids were real wiseguys, most of them,'' August said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' supporters say they have countless stories
from people who say the in-your-face intimidation of hardened
criminals helped take them off a dangerous path.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Shapiro, who produced the 1979 ''Scared Straight'' film,
a 20-year sequel tracking those in the original and a 1999 film of
the program for MTV, said 80 percent of the young people who
listened to the convicts in the two shows left a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   And ''I can't relate to you the number of people over the years
who have said to me that just by watching on television what the
Lifers were doing, it dissuaded them away from the direction
they're heading,'' said Shapiro. ''That's prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Terhune became so disturbed by a viewing of Shapiro's ''Scared
Straight '99,'' which aired last summer, that he decided to revamp
the program to be less violent and aggressive, according to a
source familiar with the program who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The department ordered the Lifers to stop scheduling new
sessions of ''Scared Straight'' in September and suspended the
Lifers' separate, less aggressive question-and-answer sessions and
prison tours with high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifers had been conducting three ''Scared Straight''
programs a week and two high school and college tours, August said.
</P>
<P>
   After the slowdown, Corrections Department spokesman Chris
Carden says a gentler version of ''Scared Straight'' debuted in
April. Another session is scheduled for Monday, and 15 others have
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The high school and college tours programs will resume and
expand to other prisons as well, but under the department's
direction, Carden said. The tours will be available at East Jersey
State, he said, but ''it's not Lifers-specific'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Claude Buchman, a Hackettstown high school teacher, said he
has called several times this year to schedule a tour at the
prison, and ''we've been told that the program no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Several high school and college officials have written to Gov.
Christie Whitman in recent weeks, saying the Lifers' tour is
unparalleled and shouldn't be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meeting with the Lifers ranks with the finest human
interaction and educational experiences of our lives,'' wrote
Barbara J. Gonos, a Brookdale Community College professor who has
taken students to see the Lifers for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Carden said that Project Pride, a deterrence program that sends
inmates into schools, can be enough of a warning to students
without putting them through the unsettling experience of going
into a prison. That project has reached 32,000 kids since 1998, a
far greater per-year average than Scared Straight.
</P>
<P>
   August said Terhune wants to phase out ''Scared Straight'' to
bring more attention to his own program and less to the successes
of one that lives forever on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't destroy one program to promote the other program,''
August said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Carden said that ''Scared Straight'' is effective ''in
its current incarnation,'' August is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost gone,'' he said. ''It's very obvious what they're
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks China Trade Support  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aboard Air Force One after Cardinal John
O'Connor's funeral, President Clinton sat down with Rep. Charles
Rangel and other lawmakers and pressed his case for legislation
giving permanent normal trade relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel also received a phone call on the subject last week from
Vice President Al Gore and recalls, ''I was doing the listening,
too.'' He met the next day with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who
is leading organized labor's effort against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the 15-term veteran of Congress from New York, a
liberal with close ties to labor, says, ''I'm undecided what I'm
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee and an elder in the Congressional Black Caucus, Rangel is
among the most influential of several dozen Democrats who remain
uncommitted on the trade bill scheduled for a vote later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   As such, he is in the eye of an intense lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House works with the Republican leadership about
GOP votes, it labors on a parallel track with California Reps.
Robert Matsui and Cal Dooley to court Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That effort is complicated by the opposition of the party's top
House leaders, although Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., seems more
focused on preventing a fracture within his caucus. ''I've seen and
heard of no evidence'' of Gephardt attempting to sway the rank and
file, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say their vote will be influenced by the fate of
companion legislation, drafted by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., to establish a commission to monitor human
rights in China and protect against a surge of imports.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the effort to round up Democrats is more retail than
wholesale. Clinton's trip to Ohio on Friday, for example, was
strategic: the local Democratic congressman, Rep. Tom Sawyer, is
uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Some considerations range afield of China and concern over jobs
and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   --Democratic Rep. Bud Cramer of Alabama, sought and got a meeting
with Commerce Secretary William Daley to discuss a federal weather
station in the tornado-prone area around Huntsville. The facility
has been at risk for closing, and Cramer wanted to talk to the man
whose department overseas the Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., talked with Postmaster General
William Henderson and won creation of a new Zip Code -- something he
has sought for nearly a decade in the state legislature and
Congress. In an interview, Thompson said the change is needed to
address bureaucratic inefficiencies affecting immigration
enforcement and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to think that's a completely different issue''
than China, he said, although other Democrats say he injected it
into trade bill discussions.
</P>
<P>
   --Some undecided Democrats have ambitions that extend beyond the
House, in races where labor's clout could matter. These include
Rep. Xavier Becerra of California (Los Angeles mayoral hopeful) and
Rep. Martin Meehan (a potential candidate for Massachusetts
governor.)
</P>
<P>
   --Meehan and two other Massachusetts lawmakers, Ed Markey and
Richard Neal, are at the center of a separate drama. The state's
most prominent Democrat, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, is expected to
support the bill. Sweeney has asked him to remain silent until
after the House votes to avoid making it easier politically for the
three House members to vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end a system annual reviews of trade rules with
China. Clinton told an audience in Akron, Ohio, on Friday its
passage would ease China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
tear down barriers to trade and investment with America and
''reduce the likelihood of conflict, even war'' in Asia for the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is also strongly backed by business, particularly
the high tech industry, which sees a vast potential new market.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue the Chinese cannot be trusted to abide by the
agreements it signs, worry about the loss of jobs overseas, and
cite human rights abuses by the Communist government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Vote counters envision a coalition of 150 Republican votes or so
and 70 or more Democrats to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to court Rangel includes expediting passage of a
separate bill to open U.S. markets to developing countries in the
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. Clinton is to sign the
measure on Tuesday, and supporters of the China bill are guardedly
hopeful that Rangel will side with them.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rangel says Clinton is ''as involved emotionally
and politically as in anything I've ever seen....It's a legacy
thing with him,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior member of the black caucus and possible chairman of
a powerful committee, Rangel could well pull other lawmakers off
the fence with him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other Democrats say his vote will send a message to
the business community of the type of reception they would receive
with him at the helm of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel has aggressively raised campaign money from business for
Democrats this year, part of the effort to gain control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But enigmatic as ever, he says, ''I've raised a lot of labor
money, too.''

<HEADLINE> Scientist-congressman hopes focus on education will lead to second term </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unlike many House freshmen, who struggle to
develop an identity before their first re-election campaign rolls
around, Rush Holt had a label the moment he arrived on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He would be a ''scientist-congressman'' -- only the second
research physicist ever elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight the label or merely embrace it, Holt has
sought to expand it, making education and research two major issues
of concern in his first term in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His test will come in November, when voters in the 12th district
decide whether Holt serves a second term. Holt, D-Pennington, is
among the top targets for Republicans this year.
</P>
<P>
   As two former congressmen, Mike Pappas and Dick Zimmer, compete
for the right to take on Holt --their contest will be decided in the
June 6 primary) -- Holt is preparing his campaign machinery while
seeking accomplishments in Congress to bring home to voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, he has built a substantial campaign war
chest. As of March 31 he had raised nearly $1.2 million and had
$793,000 on hand. Zimmer had raised $925,000 and had $558,000 on
hand, compared with $196,000 and $66,000 for Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Holt has received fund-raising assistance from the centrist New
Democrat Network, the League of Conservation Voters and Moveon.org,
an Internet-based group formed to help Democrats oppose efforts to
impeach and remove President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the government front, Holt has spent his 16 months in
Congress stressing core Democratic issues like gun control and
health care, a handful of bipartisan high-tech issues like Internet
privacy, and efforts to boost math and science teaching.
</P>
<P>
   He has voted with his party on most showdown issues, but
supported Republican efforts to cut estate taxes and the so-called
''marriage penalty'' tax, potentially removing one piece of
ammunition from his Republican opponent in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over the fiscal year 2001 budget, Holt argued for
extra funding for the National Science Foundation. Rep. John Spratt
of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget
Committee, credited Holt with convincing Republicans to boost NSF
funding by $700 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rush, being a scientist himself, is the one member of our
committee who said this is an area where we should increase the
president's budget,'' Spratt told reporters in a recent conference
call organized by Holt.
</P>
<P>
   During debate last summer on Republican measures to give states
and schools more flexibility in how they spend federal money, Holt
fought for language ensuring that funding for science and math
education would not be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Holt and Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., were appointed by the
Department of Education to serve on the National Commission on Math
and Science Teaching in the 21st Century, chaired by former
astronaut and senator John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   On fiscal issues, Holt joined 47 other Democrats in approving a
Republican plan to reduce taxes for married couples by $182 billion
over 10 years, and joined 40 other Democrats in supporting a
Republican plan to cut estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And last November, Holt declined to support a massive $390
billion budget package that wrapped up the House year.
</P>
<P>
   Holt said the 2,000-plus page agreement, approved only hours
after it was completed, was too complex for anybody to digest in
one day. Explaining his vote, he said: ''All year long I've talked
about coming to Washington not to engage in business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> Cyclists Fear Drivers With Road Rage  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There was the driver who pulled a gun on him,
and the driver who ran a pickup truck onto a sidewalk after him,
Christopher Scott recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And this was only while Scott, a bicycle commuter in Washington,
was doing his four miles between his home and his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things do get a little hairy,'' said Scott, 25, who works in
the membership department at the League of American Bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Things are too hairy, say officials of the bikers' organization.
Road rage isn't simply driver against driver -- it's driver against
cyclist, too. And the bike group officials want government
officials, as well as drivers, to pay more attention to the risks
that cyclists face.
</P>
<P>
   The association cited the fatal shooting May 5 of a 32-year-old
Lakewood, Colo., cyclist by the driver of a pickup truck in what
Denver police describe as a case of road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an almost weekly occurrence'' to get some kind of abuse,
Scott said. A driver pulled a gun last summer after being unable to
pass him on a crowded street, he said. And in the same area,
another man drove his pickup onto the sidewalk and started to chase
him, Scott said. In both cases, ''I clicked into full gear and got
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Road rage is a growing and dangerous phenomenon,'' the
league's executive director, Elissa Margolin, said in a statement.
Drivers and cyclists as well must learn to share the road, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also is concerned, but has no data on how
large the problem may be or whether it is growing, said Rosalyn G.
Millman, acting director of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. Being out of emotional control is not regularly
singled out on police accident reports, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the agency is trying to distinguish between road rage
and ''aggressive driving,'' Millman said. The safety administration
considers aggressive driving to be a combination of unsafe driving
behaviors, such as speeding and weaving in and out of traffic, she
said. That's less violent than road rage, which would mean
''criminal behavior -- using the car as a weapon -- or using a weapon
from a vehicle,'' Millman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency has been concerned primarily with
driver-against-driver activity, ''clearly someone on a bike is very
exposed. They don't have the protection of the metal, like someone
in a car would,'' Millman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping road rage is up to both the driver and the cyclist,
because the activity is an interaction, said psychologist Leon
James of the University of Hawaii. ''Both have traffic emotions
that they cannot keep under control because they are not trained to
do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the cyclist, this involves not demanding a share of the road
when the driver refuses to give it, said James, who has interviewed
drivers and had them carry tape recorders to capture their
emotional reactions to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime directive is to retain control over the situation,''
James said. Once the cyclist shows anger, the situation is out of
the cyclist's control, because ''the cyclist doesn't know how the
driver will respond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers must realize that ''there are roadway bullies, and any
of us can turn into a bully,'' James said. ''All of us drivers have
a bias to feel we have priority over the road. It's a territorial
competition where the driver feels that the cyclist should not be
there, in the way of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers should acknowledge when their emotions become a problem,
figure out exactly what triggers their outbursts and start to put
locks on those triggers, James said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety administration advises those who are confronted by
aggressive drivers to make every attempt to get out of their way,
to avoid challenging them, to avoid eye contact and not to return
any gestures. Later, report the driver's vehicle description and
license plate number to police, the agency said. The agency is
working with state and local officials to develop programs against
aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   And cyclists should always wear helmets. ''That's the most
effective safety device we have,'' Millman said.

<HEADLINE> North Dakotans Embracing Wind Energy  </HEADLINE>
By BLAKE NICHOLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCER, N.D. (AP) -- As a stiff breeze stirs the grass and turns
the wind turbines on Russell Makeeff's farm, he stops for a moment
to marvel at how attitudes toward wind power have changed.
</P>
<P>
   When he put up a turbine on his farm about 20 years ago, others
scoffed. When he tried to persuade them to support wind energy
development, he was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got such a sour taste in my mouth from the '80s,'' Makeeff
said, running his hands over the homemade wind turbine he built in
the late 1970s. That turbine, which Makeeff put together using a
combine gearbox, now lies in the grass on his farm, a few hundred
feet from two more modern turbines that tower over his land.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that the general public didn't give wind energy a
chance. It seemed like we were just getting nowhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Makeeff is considering adding two more wind turbines on
his land, he is selling excess electricity to a rural utility and
others interested in their own wind energy projects are turning to
him for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Makeeff, who headed the Renewable Energy Association of North
Dakota for six years in the 1980s, is even considering being an
activist again for wind power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I was probably one of the forerunners of this in
North Dakota,'' he said, ''and if I have anything to offer, I will
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy's
Pacific Northwest Laboratory found North Dakota has the greatest
wind energy potential of any of the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in that potential is rising, propelled by a bigger push
on the national level, more monetary incentives and an increasing
desire for cleaner, renewable energy, said Kim Christianson, energy
programs manager for the state Division of Community Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''With some of the concerns about the environment and global
warming, the nice thing about wind energy is that it's
emission-free -- there are no byproducts to be concerned about,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, wind energy was perceived by many as a
threat to the state's lignite industry, Makeeff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The energy industry, coal industry, power plant industry --
they were quite negative towards it,'' he said. ''I think they
thought it was going to infringe on their enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suddenly, the power companies are realizing that wind can be
an energy mix,'' he said. ''It can work well with hydropower, coal
power.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of interest among consumers was the main roadblock to
development, said Mike Nisbet, a spokesman for Minnkota Power
Cooperative in Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lignite fire generation is going to be a part of our (power)
generation into the future -- it supplies 70 percent of our
wholesale power,'' he said. ''But if (wind energy) is something
customers want, we will try to offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-op is surveying rural electric customers to see how many
would be willing to pay a premium for wind-generated power, and
hopes to make a decision on a project by the end of May, Nisbet
said. A private developer would build the wind farm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Griggs and Steele counties, which have been
designated as part of a federal ''empowerment zone'' in eastern
North Dakota, also are looking at wind energy. The empowerment zone
program is aimed at stemming population loss.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hoping to capitalize on a project involving
Northern States Power Co., said Jay Haley, a consultant in Grand
Forks. Under an agreement with the state of Minnesota, the utility
must develop some alternative power sources in exchange for storing
nuclear waste at its Prairie Island plant near Red Wing, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The wind farm could include up to 170 turbines, depending on
their size, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first one is always the toughest,'' said Brad Stevens, a
project engineer at the University of North Dakota's Energy and
Environmental Research Center. ''Most people feel that if indeed
that happens, it will open up even more interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley also is helping coordinate meetings across the state aimed
at educating landowners about how to deal with wind rights.
</P>
<P>
   Haley and Stevens said wind development in North Dakota could
follow the same path as oil development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wind energy is big business -- these are large corporations
that provide the financial backing for these projects,'' Haley
said. ''They're not typically looking for financial investors in
the local area ... but they do need the local wind resource, local
cooperation, local land to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Energy Department has established the Wind Powering
America initiative to increase wind power generation, and the
government has reinstated a production tax credit for utilities
that generate wind power.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota also has tax incentives for renewable energy
production, but the programs might not apply to large-scale
developments, Christianson said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has no large wind farms, but five large wind turbines
already operate in the state. A turbine also will be installed on
the Fort Berthold Reservation this summer, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson has no firm figures, but estimated that two dozen
smaller turbines are operating on private property in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Seven utilities have conducted a statewide assessment to
determine the best spots for wind turbines. Christianson said the
results are still being studied, and will be used to guide future
development.
</P>
<P>
   Roadblocks include finding markets, since much of the power
produced in the state already is exported, and having the means to
get the power from wind turbines to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the concerns statewide is transmission capacity -- what
could be added in that area without disrupting the reliability of
the system,'' Christianson said.
</P>
<P>
   For Makeeff, who saves about $4,200 a year on his utility bill
by generating much of his own power, the main issue has always been
educating people about the benefits of wind energy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever coal, hydropower we can save, we can save for the
future,'' he said. ''If it's good for the environment, if it's good
for people, if it's good for our energy resources, I'm for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are finally starting to listen.''

<HEADLINE> Zoo Veterinarian is Elephant Midwife  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Hanging on the wall in Dennis Schmitt's
office is a picture of two elephants snuggling, their trunks
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   A sign below it reads, ''Getting things done around here is like
mating an elephant: It's done at a high level, there's a great deal
of roaring and screaming, it takes two years to get results.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, the veterinarian at Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield,
is in charge of one of the most aggressive elephant breeding
programs in the country. When he isn't grading papers or teaching
veterinary medicine at Southwest Missouri State University, he is
traveling the globe, assisting zoos and circuses with the breeding
and birthing of pregnant pachyderms.
</P>
<P>
   You might say he is part matchmaker, part elephant midwife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer reproductive specialist,'' Schmitt says, without
cracking a smile.
</P>
<P>
   With the worldwide stock of Asian and African elephants
dwindling, the subject of breeding is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Asian elephants in captivity are past their reproductive
age. If we don't increase the birth rate considerably in the next
20 years, we won't have any animals left that can reproduce,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   His latest feat -- assisting in the first successful birth of an
artificially inseminated elephant -- has earned him a reputation as
one of the leading elephant reproductive specialists in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work Schmitt has done in the world of breeding has been
critical to the understanding of the biology of elephants and
utilizing artificial reproduction techniques,'' said Michael
Hutchins, director of conservation and science for the American Zoo
and Aquarium Association in Maryland. ''He has brought the field to
a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming an excellent breeder starts with developing an eye for
good mothers. Teen-agers and 20-somethings usually make the best
candidates, Schmitt says, since elephants older than 30 have a
tendency to develop tumors and ovarian cysts that make them unable
to birth calves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are their reproductive tracks in good physical shape? Are
their blood cycles regular? Are they socially mature enough to
handle becoming a mother? These are types of things we are looking
for in a good mom,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt learned most of what he knows growing up on a dairy farm
outside Springfield, where his father wasted no time teaching him
the finer points of breeding large animals. His interest in
reproductive science led him to veterinary school, and later to a
reproductive practice in nearby Republic, where we worked nearly 20
years perfecting breeding techniques with cattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Dickerson Park Zoo asked Schmitt to take
part in a six-month project to develop a technique for freezing and
moving embryos from the horned oryx, a member of the antelope
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''From there I became involved with elephants, and it just
ballooned,'' he says. A six-month project turned into 17 years of
work at the zoo, and a newfound love for the creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elephants are charismatic creatures. They have personalities
just like people,'' he says. ''The way they greet you with their
trunks and interact with humans. I can't explain it, there's just
something about these animals that is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges facing elephant breeders is that
few zoos have the capacity to house adult males, which are so
aggressive they require special holding pens. Transporting males is
costly and difficult, and doing so with females disrupts their
reproductive cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians had tried unsuccessfully since the mid-1980s to
solve the problem by impregnating elephants through artificial
insemination, but they ran into difficulties determining the female
breeding cycle in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Schmitt and his team at Dickerson had luck with an
Asian mother named Moola. On Nov. 28, Moola gave birth to a
378-pound miracle named Haji, the world's first Asian elephant born
through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, who monitored Moola's 674-day pregnancy with
ultrasounds and a lot of house calls, felt like a proud papa. ''It
was an amazing experience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, he flew to the Indianapolis Zoo to help
deliver the first baby African elephant resulting from artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, who has delivered 14 baby elephants in his career,
knows that the technique is far from perfect. ''(But) now we can
say, yes, it's possible because it's been done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asian elephants number 40,000 to 50,000 in the world, with
10,000 in captivity. That compares with 500,000 to 600,000 African
elephants, 5,000 in captivity. Dickerson has 10 of the 251 Asian
elephants in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt's team at Dickerson is now working on techniques for
freezing the semen for travel and influencing the gender of the
calf.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to find a way to increase birth rates and birth
survivals of both of these species,'' he says. ''This is hopefully
going to be one of the ways.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of the breeding program at Dickerson, Schmitt
has become a very busy man consulting other zoos and circuses
across the country. On most weekends, he finds himself on a plane
to such places as New York and Indiana -- often with a container of
bull semen at his side -- to inseminate an awaiting elephant or to
perform an ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   In his travels, he is finding the old saying about an elephant's
memory is true.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the mothers show signs of recognition when I show
up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't always a good thing. Ultrasounds can be uncomfortable
procedures for elephants, and occasionally, Schmitt says, he is
greeted by the mother raising her tail and defecating when he walks
into a room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just happy that they remembered me,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Salvation Army Serves Record No.  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, Larry Webber's house in Wilmington,
N.C., flooded during Hurricane Floyd last fall. Then it caught
fire. In the end, he and his wife Debra were left with nothing --
except, he says, the moral support and donations from the Salvation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The organization helped a record number of Americans last year
as more than 33 million people received lodging, food and help
recovering from natural disasters. The Salvation Army's basic
services -- providing clothing or groceries from local centers --
accounted for about 18 million of those cases, according to their
1999 service report to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of people served last year topped the 1998
total by almost 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amid the atmosphere of this robust economy, there are still
millions of Americans in need,'' said John Busby, national
commander of the Salvation Army. ''Our greatest challenge is to
continue to develop relevant programs and services that address the
emerging spiritual, social and economic needs of our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber plans to tell Congress this week about his ordeal and to
urge lawmakers to lend their support to the organization that kept
him and his wife fed and clothed after they lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ''My faith and trust has been restored because of the Salvation
Army,'' he said in telephone interview. ''I am a firm believer in
the Salvation Army, and I would highly recommend them to anybody
that's in any kind of need. Their moral support is not just a one
day thing. They're there through the whole ordeal and then
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army also served almost 29 million meals to the
hungry last year and gave nearly 8 million homeless people a place
to sleep. The group plans to present their report to members of
Congress on Wednesday as part of National Salvation Army Week.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in November by The Chronicle of Philanthropy found that
for a seventh consecutive year, the Salvation Army was the top
choice among the nation's charities, raising $1.2 billion in cash
and donated goods.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1865, the Salvation Army is an evangelical part of
the Christian church and one of the largest charitable and service
organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For Webber, the charity's assistance has been invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time since the hurricane but their still
helping as far as giving moral support,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Assesses Future  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   POJOAQUE, N.M. (AP) -- As a resident of a town inextricably
linked to the threat of apocalyptic destruction, nuclear detonator
specialist Tom Turner sees a lesson in the fire that ravaged Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows you who's boss,'' Turner said at a shelter for
evacuees. ''We're the elite -- we've developed weapons of many
megatons that can set off a giant fireball -- and now a wildfire
sweeps through here and we can't do a thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which destroyed 260 homes and forced 25,000 people to
evacuate, is the first major disaster here since Los Alamos
National Laboratory became the historic development site of the
first atomic bomb in 1945. Rebuilding will be a test of resolve for
the community, whose long-term prospects have been uncertain since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a town founded on patriotism and service,'' said
Stephen Younger, director for weapons programs at the laboratory.
''We need to let our people grieve. But ... we've got a mission to
do, and we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Naud, a chemical explosives expert at the lab, is less
confident about the future, personally and professionally. He and
his wife, who have two small children, lost their rented townhouse
in the fire and fear a replacement will be costly.
</P>
<P>
   He also has doubts about the lab, saying many programs have been
plagued by funding problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just mired in worries and concerns and bureaucracies,''
Naud said. ''The whole budgeting situation is one big horrible
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that mess was precipitated by the firing last year of
nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee, who was charged with breaching lab
security by transferring top secret files from secure to unsecure
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The case unleashed a torrent of criticism of security standards
at the lab, prompting a security overhaul by the Department of
Energy. Lee, 60, is now on trial in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos is a company town. Nearly every family gets a
paycheck from the lab, or does business with it. The lab workforce
of 7,000 includes hundreds of Ph.D's making up one of the
wealthiest, best-educated communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lab scientist Dave Becker, 39, and his wife came to Los Alamos
from Austin, Texas, five years ago; their daughter, Emily, turned 1
last week. They intend to rebuild and foresee Los Alamos as their
home for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like Los Alamos for its beauty,'' said Becker, bouncing
Emily in his lap at a relief center in nearby Pojoaque. ''It's more
hospitable than Texas. There are no fire ants. And people have a
clear sense of what their mission is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say the company-town atmosphere can be oppressive
at times -- they cite gossip, nosiness and the inevitability of
encountering familiar faces on every shopping sortie.
</P>
<P>
   But there are advantages -- excellent schools and community
activities, minimal crime, a camaraderie fueled by common
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, Los Alamos was devoted primarily to
developing and testing America's nuclear weapons. Its core defense
task now is to maintain the existing weapons stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Younger is convinced the nation will keep a large enough
stockpile to ensure that Los Alamos remains vital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through some difficult times in the early '90s, when
some people in government suggested we didn't need nuclear
weapons,'' he said. ''But every president since Truman has affirmed
the importance of the nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon Bennett, a 35-year-old explosives specialist, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Call me a pessimist, but the world's not going to be as nice a
place as you want it to be,'' said Bennett, who arrived from North
Carolina four years ago with his wife and two children. ''I'd be
just as happy if nuclear weapons did disappear -- there are other
jobs in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose father worked at the federal nuclear facility in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., said he has been heartened by the public response
to the fire at a time when he sensed many Americans were unenthused
about their nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It surprised me -- the outpouring of everybody helping us,''
said Turner, 42. ''For the first time, we feel like part of the
broader community.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Math Teachers Get Outside Help  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- In professor Yoram Sagher's classroom, a dozen
high school math teachers hunch over textbooks, scribbling their
way through a tough geometry problem.
</P>
<P>
   His lesson today: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
</P>
<P>
   The textbooks come from Singapore, the small southeast Asian
country whose students beat Americans and the rest of the world
hands-down in math. Sagher and other math experts are encouraging
U.S. school districts to use Singapore's books, particularly in
elementary schools, to help foster mathematical success in a
country consistently rated mediocre at best.
</P>
<P>
   ''The curriculum believes in the students' abilities,'' Sagher
said of books approved by Singapore's Ministry of Education. ''One
of the effects of these books on all teachers is that they are much
more courageous about giving harder problems to students.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's eighth-graders ranked No. 1 in math among 41 nations
tested by the Third International Mathematics and Science Study,
released in 1996. American eighth-graders came in 28th.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore textbooks -- written in English, the language of
instruction there -- are lightweight paperbacks filled with sample
problems and step-by-step explanations that help students
understand not only how to use a formula, but why.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Ross, a math teacher at Baltimore's Robert Poole Middle
School, said American textbooks tend to jump from topic to topic
without helping students understand the basic concepts that connect
all math problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore texts, with their multistep word problems and
emphasis on logic, develop skills that help children solve all
types of problems -- even those they've never tried, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're more confident problem-solvers in general,'' she said.
''I definitely think the textbooks have something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore began using the Singapore books in a program for
advanced middle school students last school year.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Flood, a math teacher at Madison Country Day School in
Waunakee, Wis., has used the texts in elementary classes for three
years and raved about how her students first work out problems with
blocks or rods, then move to drawings on a page and finally learn
the formula behind the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids will understand these things from the gut,'' Flood
said. ''One of the greatest things I see is the confidence it
builds in them.''
</P>
<P>
   But even fans of the books note some problems. All measurement
tasks use the metric system. Word problems use names unfamiliar to
American students, such as Suhua or Mr. Wu, and often portray men
and women in stereotypical gender roles. And younger Singapore
students tend to spend much more time each day on math, so the
lessons are too long for a typical American class schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, though, teachers say, is that the further
along students get in school using American texts, the more
ill-prepared they are to understand the concepts in Singapore's
higher-level books.
</P>
<P>
   Madge Goldman, a mathematics researcher whose foundation helped
fund the Chicago teaching program and its classes, like the only
being taught by Sagher, said that while math teachers she has
worked with love the books, the texts alone won't solve the United
States' math woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the really serious problems is that most elementary
school teachers are expected to teach all subjects, and most of
them barely managed to squeak through whatever math classes they
had to take in college,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics recently
recommended at least an hour of math a day in elementary grades.
Goldman would go a step further, making sure math teachers are
specialists in the subject, as they are in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Sherry, a math teacher at Chicago's Whitney M. Young
Magnet High School, sometimes uses lessons from Singapore's
standard textbooks for sixth- to ninth-graders in her advanced
algebra/trigonometry class.
</P>
<P>
   ''They see it in my hand and say, 'Oh no, not that book
again,''' Sherry said. ''But they like it. They say, 'If those
ninth-graders can do it, we can do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mohit Manocha, a 15-year-old sophomore in Sherry's class,
notices a definite difference between the Singapore problems and
those in his normal math book.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're more challenging,'' Manocha said. ''It was just so
much fun when you got the problem right.''

<HEADLINE> Examples From Math Textbooks  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The following are sample word problems from math
textbooks used
in Singapore. High school begins earlier in Singapore than it does
in the United States, so the post-elementary examples cover eighth
through 12th grades. Answers are in parentheses.

<HEADLINE> Pot Crop Thrives in Appalachia  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY HEFLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BERNSTADT, Ky. (AP) -- Bob O'Neill stands on a secluded
hillside in the Daniel Boone National Forest. In the palm of one
hand, the forestry officer holds a dozen marijuana seedlings that
could have grown to a street value of $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here in these rugged hills, known more for their destitution
than their beauty, more than 40 percent of the nation's marijuana
is grown -- an estimated 1.6 million outdoor plants worth $3.9
billion annually in a region where the average household income has
yet to break $8,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''With marijuana growing, nothing surprises you -- who's growing
it and who's selling it,'' said Knott County Sheriff Wheeler
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has arrested friends and acquaintances caught growing the
plants illegally, and he has faced the backlash from struggling
mountain communities where the drug money has become a financial
lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Richard R. Clayton, a University of Kentucky professor who wrote
a report for the United Nations titled ''Marijuana in the 'Third
World': Appalachia, USA'', says the region is the perfect
drug-growing economic model.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got that large level of unemployment, you've got
insularity and you've got a need for cash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the nation prospered amid record economic
growth, the region's endemic poverty, lack of high-paying jobs and
ideal growing climate feeds the illegal industry. Appalachia's
rugged terrain also provides a natural camouflage for the marijuana
plants -- each worth a street value of about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tremendously profitable,'' said Joseph L. Famularo, U.S.
Attorney for the eastern district of Kentucky. ''Kentucky marijuana
is very prized, especially in the Northeast United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the 65-county region was designated a High Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy. The designation means $6 million annually in federal
funding is used to help law-enforcement agencies fight the problem.
Since then, there have been 1,952 arrests and 5,703 marijuana plots
have been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the problem is a social one -- that the offspring of
moonshiners have traded in their bootleg liquor sales for a more
profitable product.
</P>
<P>
   While the product might have changed, the cat-and-mouse game
between growers and law enforcement officials still gets personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been told I'm taking Christmas away from the kids ...
I've heard it all,'' said Harold Sizemore, supervisory law
enforcement officer for the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The industry crosses social strata; Sizemore has arrested
engineers and even retired teachers for marijuana cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some that are fairly organized like corporations,''
Clayton said. ''And you've got some that are just mom and pop
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roution, who turned to growing when his pay check from
Pizza Hut couldn't support his cocaine habit, is nearing the end of
a five-year prison sentence for growing 185 plants in his Taylor
County attic. He was netting $165,000 every three months.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a Head Start teacher, filed for divorce while he was
behind bars. He has a 13-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was one of the people who would've told you that marijuana
is the best drug in the world ... now I know the adverse affects of
it,'' he said in an interview from the Kentucky State Reformatory
in LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   The thriving cottage industry has also spawned official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie White, the drug-dog handler for the Perry County
sheriff's office, pleaded guilty in February to possession with the
intent to distribute marijuana, as well as other drug charges.
Johnny Mann, former Lee County sheriff, is serving a 24-year
federal sentence for a 1991 conviction for accepting bribes to
protect marijuana and cocaine smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers also acknowledge that the millions of
dollars generated by illegal marijuana sales are bolstering
legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after 100,000 plants were eradicated in Leslie County,
there were widespread stories of grocery stores and car dealerships
nearly going bankrupt, Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   The cultivators are ''quite frankly, very wealthy,'' Famularo
said. ''Four-wheel drive trucks ... ATV's. They usually have
expensive toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Public lands are popular places to plant marijuana patches. By
planting on government property, growers avoid forfeiture laws and
make it more difficult to track the grower. In Boone National
Forest alone, 192,685 plants worth $384 million were eradicated
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Roution said marijuana growers often carry firearms, plant
animal traps and steal each other's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ''You stumble onto someone's crop in the middle of the field,
you're liable to get shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, three eastern Kentucky men were killed by their own
booby traps at a marijuana patch in Breathitt County. The explosion
left 3-foot-deep craters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The repercussions of it, the tragedy and all the stuff that
goes with the drug trade, it's no means romantic or glamourous.
It's a nasty, rotten business,'' Famularo said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. investors caught in nationwide $50 million scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Several elderly New Jerseyans are among
those who say they've been victimized by a nationwide investment
scam that's netted as much as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials are investigating the company that sold the
investments, and New Jersey authorities have opened a probe of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack reported in Sunday's editions that the
Florida Department of Banking and Finance is suing U.S. Capital
Funding of Lake Worth, Fla., seeking to shut the company down.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the state Bureau of Securities started its own
investigation of the company, and law firms in at least three
states have filed what they hope will be class-action lawsuits
against U.S. Capital.
</P>
<P>
   One of those suits, filed in U.S. District Court in Newark on
behalf of a Mount Arlington widow, accuses U.S. Capital and
Lawrence J. LaSala of fraud. LaSala identified himself on his
business card as a financial planner and adviser.
</P>
<P>
   LaSala declined to comment on the case when contacted by The
Record.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say hundreds of people nationwide have been waiting
for returns on investments issued by U.S. Capital and sold by
LaSala and others. Bill Blundetto, 74, of Fair Lawn, said he
invested his life's savings -- $65,000 -- into what was supposed to
be a high-return, no-risk investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just about making ends meet,'' he said. ''I'm working a
couple hours a day for extra money. I can't do for my kids, for my
grandchildren. Now I have to watch out for a $10 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Annette, invested the $50,000 she had saved for
her own daughter's college education.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Picone of Mount Arlington invested $93,689 with LaSala, and
was counting on interest income for her living expenses, according
to her lawyer, Martin Meyers of Denville.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thought she was placing it in a safe place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to be invested in notes to finance government and
business accounts receivable. A U.S. Capital sales brochure called
such investments ''one of the most secure and lucrative areas of
commercial banking.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the receivables backing the notes were insured or
backed by the government, said Tobi Pam, an assistant counsel
general for the Florida banking department.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after they put their money in, investors were
supposed to start receiving dividend checks paying 9.25 percent
interest. The Blundettos said all they've gotten were monthly
statements saying they had earned nearly $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   They said LaSala promised them the money was coming soon. That
was 16 months ago.

<HEADLINE> Guard in Seton Hall abduction flap says he acted properly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A security guard accused of failing to
intervene in a deadly abduction outside Seton Hall University said
he acted properly during the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Williams told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's
editions that he contacted his supervisor by radio and passed along
the information. Two teen-age girls who witnessed the abduction
said they asked the guard for help, but were told to call police
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I had to do,'' said Williams, 33, of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   He said he notified his supervisor, Lloyd Pearson. Pearson, 32,
of Newark, could not be reached for comment by the newspaper. A
Newark telephone number listed in his name was temporarily
disconnected on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall fired Williams, and Pearson resigned after the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Honrath dragged his ex-girlfriend, Sohayla Massachi,
into a car as she screamed for help. He then drove the Seton Hall
education student to his Westfield home, shot her in the head, and
fatally shot himself as police closed in. She died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police throughout the state have been angered by the guards'
failure to summon help in the case, saying a quick phone call to
911 could have saved Massachi's life.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said he's hurt by the scorn that has been heaped
upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a burden on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls said they saw Honrath dragging Massachi into a car
in front of the South Orange college campus. One yelled at him to
stop, while the other ran to a guard booth and begged him to call
police.
</P>
<P>
   Chituru Iromuanya said the guard said he couldn't do anything
because he wasn't a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   South Orange police are considering whether to file criminal
charges in the case against one or both of the security workers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Pearson were employed by Argenbright Security of
Atlanta, which remains on the job at Seton Hall. The company, one
of the nation's largest private security firms, is being sued by a
former Seton hall student who says she was laughed off by a guard
when she reported being stalked. She called police herself, and the
stalker was later arrested and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   And Argenbright paid $1.2 million in fines last month for hiring
convicted felons to search carry-on luggage at Philadelphia
International Airport.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Town Assesses Lab's Future  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   POJOAQUE, N.M. (AP) -- As a resident of a town inextricably
linked to the threat of apocalyptic destruction, nuclear detonator
specialist Tom Turner sees a lesson in the fire that ravaged Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows you who's boss,'' Turner said at a shelter for
evacuees. ''We're the elite -- we've developed weapons of many
megatons that can set off a giant fireball -- and now a wildfire
sweeps through here and we can't do a thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which destroyed 260 homes and forced 25,000 people to
evacuate, is the first major disaster here since Los Alamos
National Laboratory became the historic development site of the
first atomic bomb in 1945. Rebuilding will be a test of resolve for
the community, whose long-term prospects have been uncertain since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a town founded on patriotism and service,'' said
Stephen Younger, director for weapons programs at the laboratory.
''We need to let our people grieve. But ... we've got a mission to
do, and we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Naud, a chemical explosives expert at the lab, is less
confident about the future, personally and professionally. He and
his wife, who have two small children, lost their rented townhouse
in the fire and fear a replacement will be costly.
</P>
<P>
   He also has doubts about the lab, saying many programs have been
plagued by funding problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just mired in worries and concerns and bureaucracies,''
Naud said. ''The whole budgeting situation is one big horrible
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that mess was precipitated by the firing last year of
nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee, who was charged with breaching lab
security by transferring top secret files from secure to unsecure
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The case unleashed a torrent of criticism of security standards
at the lab, prompting a security overhaul by the Department of
Energy. Lee, 60, is scheduled for trial later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos is a company town. Nearly every family gets a
paycheck from the lab, or does business with it. The lab workforce
of 7,000 includes hundreds of Ph.D's making up one of the
wealthiest, best-educated communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lab scientist Dave Becker, 39, and his wife came to Los Alamos
from Austin, Texas, five years ago; their daughter, Emily, turned 1
last week. They intend to rebuild and foresee Los Alamos as their
home for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like Los Alamos for its beauty,'' said Becker, bouncing
Emily in his lap at a relief center in nearby Pojoaque. ''It's more
hospitable than Texas. There are no fire ants. And people have a
clear sense of what their mission is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say the company-town atmosphere can be oppressive
at times -- they cite gossip, nosiness and the inevitability of
encountering familiar faces on every shopping sortie.
</P>
<P>
   But there are advantages -- excellent schools and community
activities, minimal crime, a camaraderie fueled by common
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, Los Alamos was devoted primarily to
developing and testing America's nuclear weapons. Its core defense
task now is to maintain the existing weapons stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Younger is convinced the nation will keep a large enough
stockpile to ensure that Los Alamos remains vital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through some difficult times in the early '90s, when
some people in government suggested we didn't need nuclear
weapons,'' he said. ''But every president since Truman has affirmed
the importance of the nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon Bennett, a 35-year-old explosives specialist, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Call me a pessimist, but the world's not going to be as nice a
place as you want it to be,'' said Bennett, who arrived from North
Carolina four years ago with his wife and two children. ''I'd be
just as happy if nuclear weapons did disappear -- there are other
jobs in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose father worked at the federal nuclear facility in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., said he has been heartened by the public response
to the fire at a time when he sensed many Americans were unenthused
about their nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It surprised me -- the outpouring of everybody helping us,''
said Turner, 42. ''For the first time, we feel like part of the
broader community.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Dodd also under consideration for No. 2 slot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Both of Connecticut's senators are on a
list of potential candidates for vice president with presumptive
Democratic nominee Al Gore, the New Haven Register reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., acknowledged meeting this
weekend with former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is
heading up the search team for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher has met previously with Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., who has often been mentioned as a potential running mate
for Democratic nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd declined to answer questions about the meeting with
Christopher, which occurred in Dodd's Capitol Hill office earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a personal and private conversation and it would be
inappropriate to discuss what they discussed,'' said Dodd spokesman
Marvin Fast.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Dodd felt about being on the list of potential
candidates, Fast said Dodd ''feels very fortunate to have the job
he does and he's enjoying it each and every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels very honored to be working for the people of
Connecticut,'' Fast said, adding that it is also an honor to be
mentioned as a possible vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd has not been mentioned in the vice presidential context as
often as Lieberman. But he has held a number of high visibility
jobs including head of the Democratic National Committee after the
disastrous midterm elections of 1994, when Republicans took control
of both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd was credited with the ground that the Democrats gained two
years later, when President Clinton was re-elected and the party
nibbled away at the GOP majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Lieberman have their differences: Lieberman was the
first Senate Democrat to publicly chide Clinton for the Monica
Lewinsky affair, and tongue-lashing from the Senate floor which
carried added weight because of their history together; Clinton's

<HEADLINE> Scott Smith: From police officer to felon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Scott Smith was handcuffed in front of
his family, friends and former colleagues after he being sentenced
to six years in prison last week, a humiliating experience he hopes
will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Milford police officer wore the handcuffs only
briefly after Judge Charles Gill handed down Smith's prison term in
Litchfield Superior Court. He was soon freed on a $250,000 appeal
bond and thus began a new chapter in this ground-breaking case.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the next year, Smith will be fighting to stay free.
His attorney, John Kelly, quickly got Smith released after filing a
motion to appeal the March 13 verdict that convicted the former
police officer of intentional manslaughter in the fatal shooting
27-year-old Franklyn Reid in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's appeal will be heard by a judge in the state Appellate
Court or state Supreme Court. It's rare to have a jury verdict
overturned, but if Smith is successful, he would get a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he will scrutinize all the decisions Gill made during
the three-week trial, looking for something that could be viewed as
tainting the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough, tough case,'' said Norman Pattis, a New Haven
attorney who handles police misconduct cases. ''Everything will
turn on reasonableness of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kelly has declined to show his hand, he is expected to
bring up Gill's having limiting the amount of evidence the jury was
allowed to hear about Reid's criminal history and his limiting
expert testimony on police use of deadly force. Kelly said Reid was
a dangerous felon, capable of injuring or killing anyone who got in
his way, but Gill would not allow jurors to hear much of Reid's
background, which includes a 1995 sexual assault conviction for
having a consensual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he had hoped to show that the victim was the probable
aggressor even though witnesses said Smith shot Reid even the
slightly built, unarmed suspect was kneeling on the ground and
appeared to have surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Fernow, a University of Connecticut law professor, said it
was likely that the appellate court would back Gill's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ruling on evidentiary decisions are usually upheld,'' he told
the Danbury News-Times. ''The defendant would have to show it was
erroneous and prejudicial to his case. The more successful legal
challenges come from criticism of the judge's final instructions to
the jury right before jurors begin their deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill gave the jurors in the Smith trial a 56-page order
instructing them on the law they were to follow when deliberating
Smith's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was fired after being convicted and now works in
construction, was the first officer in Connecticut to be charged
with murder for an act committed while on duty. But at the request
of the prosecution, Gill also gave the jury permission to consider
two separate first-degree manslaughter charges if they found Smith
innocent of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is expected to appeal Gill's decision to give jurors that
option. The attorney, noting that Smith's case is unprecedented in
Connecticut, said he expects it to go to the state Supreme Court,
which can choose to hear any cases on to the state Appellate Court
docket.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wife To Lead Delegation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the end, Sen. John McCain got his wish. His
wife Cindy will be lead the state delegation to the Republican
National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain was chosen at a state convention Saturday in
Scottsdale -- after Gov. Jane Hull stepped aside. Despite initial
misgivings about relinquishing the governor's traditional role as
head of the delegation, Hull stressed the need for party unity, The
Arizona Republic reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Republicans we must find common ground, not a battleground,
and that's what this convention is all about,'' Hull told about 800
party activists.
</P>
<P>
   By installing his wife as the delegation head, McCain assures
himself additional media exposure at the July 31-Aug. 3 convention
in Philadelphia. Cindy McCain, who previously had avoided the
political spotlight, will stand up and deliver Arizona's 30
delegates on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Feuding between the governor and senator began with Hull's
endorsement of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, now the presumptive GOP
nominee for president, which miffed McCain and garnered national
headlines. The dispute simmered even after McCain suspended his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After Hull disclosed her desire to lead the delegation, McCain
dismissed the idea during a nationally televised interview. His
preference for his wife angered Hull and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, however, stepped aside after two weeks of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At the state convention Saturday, the party also elected its 30
delegates to the national convention.

<HEADLINE> Affluent county copes with financial quagmire  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- When Gov. George Pataki rode in last week
with a $100 million bailout plan for Nassau County, it was too late
for some residents already reeling from budget cuts in this
affluent Long Island bedroom community.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this has done to our community is a disaster,'' said Rudy
Vanterpool, administrator of the New Cassel/Westbury Youth Services
Project, one of nearly 100 social service agencies that suffered $8
million in cuts. ''I can't even put into words what has happened to
us, it's so horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge smorgasbord of services provided to Nassau's citizens
for years was one of several major factors that helped bring the
county -- one of the nation's richest -- to near bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to pay the piper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole business community has been very concerned about the
situation,'' said Matt Crosson, president of the Long Island
Association, the island's largest business group. ''It cast a
shadow over the economy of not only Nassau County, but Long Island
in general.''
</P>
<P>
   How exactly did one of the nation's wealthiest counties get into
such a financial mess? Why are lawmakers scrambling to close a $117
million shortfall this year alone?
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gulotta ... didn't raise the general property tax for
eight of 10 years,'' said Fred Parolla, the county comptroller and
a frequent critic of fellow Republican County Executive Thomas
Gulotta.
</P>
<P>
   ''So what you had was a shrinking or stabilized general property
tax fund ... and increasing burdens,'' Parolla said. He said
contracts with the public employee unions, especially the police
unions, have grown ''beyond what the county can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spending makes up nearly a quarter of the county's
$2.2-billion budget and has risen 64 percent since 1989, twice as
fast as county spending overall. Newsday reported last month that
the county pays $118,000 per police employee, the highest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics also show that Nassau employs 230 officers
per 100,000 residents, 77 percent higher than the average for
suburban county departments nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta, who is proud of his record of keeping taxes steady, has
said that the county consistently fights against police increases,
but usually loses in binding arbitration. He got tougher recently,
threatening to lay off more than 200 officers unless the police
union agrees to a package of contract givebacks.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that despite the fiscal problems, Nassau County
is still rated among the best places in the country to live;
something he sees as a positive reflection of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for many years the county relied on borrowing to help keep
its books straight. Wall Street executive Frank Zarb, who was
appointed by Pataki in March to review the county's financial
health, said last week that the county's $2.7 billion long-term
debt was ''extremely high.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the per capita debt in Nassau was $2,210, while
the average amount for residents in neighboring counties, including
New York City, was $311.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the county's precarious financial condition, Standard
&AMP; Poor's has given Nassau a credit rating that is one notch above
junk status, making it much more expensive to borrow. It has
threatened another downgrade unless the county begins to straighten
itself out by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution offered last week by Pataki and Zarb, who
is chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, is
to create a separate bonding agency to refinance some of the
county's long-term debt at lower interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau was also sinking under the burden of an archaic property
tax assessment system unchanged since 1938 -- before the postwar
building boom transformed the rural county into quintessential
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, property owners challenged their assessments so
successfully that the county has run up an $800 million debt to pay
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it takes an average of six years to settle a tax grievance
case because the county doesn't have enough staff to handle cases.
''So it goes into protracted litigation and we always get the
shaft,'' Parolla said.
</P>
<P>
   The county legislature voted in March to overhaul the assessment
system by 2003, spurred by the threat of a lawsuit claiming the
system discriminated against homeowners in minority neighborhoods.
The complaint was that homes increased in value much faster in
white neighborhoods than in minority areas, leaving minority
homeowners paying a higher percentage of home value in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The county's financial troubles have yet to have an impact on
home sales, according Tricia Chirco of the Long Island Board of
Realtors. She said April sales figures put the median price for a
Nassau County home at $254,000, up from $220,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still feeling comfortable about selling and
buying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's Nassau rescue plan signaled state Republicans would
fight hard to regain control of a county that could be pivotal in
the U.S. Senate and presidential races this fall. Last November,
voters unhappy with the fiscal fiasco ended a decades-long GOP
stranglehold on Nassau politics, giving Democrats a 10-to-9 hold on
the county legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ''carrot-and-stick'' bailout offer requires the
county to cut $50 million from this year's budget, as well as $70
million in each of the next three years. Pataki has offered $100
million in aid over five years, contingent on the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Vanterpool, who said he cut his own salary more than 25 percent
after laying off 14 staffers at the youth center, thinks further
cuts could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means that from 2 o'clock to 7 or 8 o'clock, when those
youth were in our program, now they're left to wander around
unsupervised, getting into all kinds of problems on the street,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're beginning to see colors -- when I say colors, I'm talking
about gang colors -- on the streets now. And some of those same
youth who were in our program are now wearing those colors,'' he
said. ''There's no way right now today that I can tell those
youngsters 'come on in,' because I have nothing for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith, director of a social service program called Long
Beach Reach, said the deep cuts in funding for youth programs mean
''we're basically throwing away a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to do that as a society,'' he Said. ''It's
every bit as important as the police and the other things we take
for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Wet Spring a wild card for farmers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- The weekend's wet weather is the latest
element of a wet spring that is giving some farmers promise, and
others nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   For onion and potato farmers in the Elba mucklands in western
New York's Genesee County, Saturday's deluge left them wondering
how they will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's all said and done we will have a 75 percent loss on
3,000 acres of onion crop,'' said Joe Ognibene, operator of the Big
O Farm in Elba and one of about 15 farmers who work the drained
swamp land.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as bad as it gets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the same story for other parts of the sprawling
upstate area where farming is as diverse as the weather can be
fickle.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit and vegetable growers in central New York see the same
rain as reason that this year's crop could overcome losses from
last year's drought.
</P>
<P>
   How wet? much of upstate received just over 3 inches of rain
since Thursday morning, or about 2.9 inches more than normal to
this point in May. April had about 1.7 inches more rain than
normal, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Growers in Cayuga, Madison, Onondaga and Oswego counties credit
the warm, wetter-than-usual April to get crops in the ground on
time this month. Fruit trees are also budding and blossoming on
time, which lessens the chance of a killing frost as summer
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're set up real good going into the spring,'' said Steve
Simpelaar, who grows apples, cherries, peaches, pumpkins and squash
on 300 acres in Oswego County. He's also a partner with his father
and a brother in a farm in Lyons, Wayne County.
</P>
<P>
   Simpelaar said the wet April, however, delayed planting of about
5,000 apple trees for future crops.
</P>
<P>
   For other farmers and consumers, though, the wet weather was a
more immediate concern.
</P>
<P>
   Onions and potatoes are planted earlier than most other crops,
so these farmers feel the worst effects of the rain that dumped 2
to 3 inches on most of western New York. Onion and potatoes cover
about 30 percent of Elba's farmland.
</P>
<P>
   That likely means some higher prices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to tell right now, but if everything follows
the trend that we're having right now, we could see price increases
as high as 25 percent,'' Ognibene said.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rain earlier in the week and total water accumulation
''just washes out the crop,'' said Ted Konieczka, a director for
the Genesee County Soil and Water Conservation Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks more like a lake than a field that's already been
planted,'' said Assemblyman Charles Nesbitt, R-Albion, Orleans
County.
</P>
<P>
   New York Farm Bureau President John Lincoln said those who plant
other crops, such as corn, may be delayed in getting the crop
planted because of the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year we had all the corn planted by now,'' said Lincoln,
an Ontario County dairy farmer. ''This year we've had three, maybe
four planting days.''

<HEADLINE> Hastert Eyes Clinton's Help on HMOs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a private White House meeting last week,
House Speaker Dennis Hastert told President Clinton he favors HMO
legislation that extends new rights to all Americans with
insurance, rather than a more limited series of protections in a
Senate-passed bill, according to Republican sources.
</P>
<P>
   These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at
the same time, the Illinois Republican asked the president for his
assistance in shaping a final compromise that limits any right to
sue insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said Clinton told the speaker that
he also would insist on legislation that covers all Americans and
that the issue was nearly non-negotiable. The president also said
that as long as the bill contains a way to enforce a patient's
right, the White House is ''open to talk about how it is
enforced,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting occurred the night before a larger session that
Clinton convened Thursday with key congressional negotiators on a
patients' bill of rights. Clinton said that discussion was designed
''to determine what the issues are and what the processes are to
resolve them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the meeting was under way, Hastert
said, ''We are very close to completing a balanced bill, one that
will address the issue of the uninsured as it addresses the issue
of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hastert's optimistic statement, progress toward a
compromise on the health maintenance organization legislation has
been fitful. That is due partly to the wide election-year gulf
between Democrats and Republicans and partly to the internal
differences among lawmakers of the same party in different houses.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, GOP sources say House Republicans recently
forwarded a confidential proposal to Senate GOP negotiators
outlining a proposed new right to sue the ''designated
decision-maker'' in federal court for wrongful denial of care.
Suits could be brought for compensatory damages as well as economic
damages, and punitive damages would be permitted under some
circumstances. No class action suits would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed measure lifts the federal ban on lawsuits for
Americans in health plans that fall under federal regulation. The
Senate bill contains no new rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican negotiators are expected to meet this week, and a
bipartisan bargaining session is also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sought in
the White House meeting to push Republicans to agree to a timetable
for resolving key issues. Republicans declined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have spent hundreds of hours to put together a bill,'' Sen.
Don Nickles, R-Okla., said after the meeting. ''We have made good
progress despite what some may think.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, negotiators have agreed on a variety of relatively
minor points. They appeared on the verge of an accord several weeks
ago on an appeals process for patients who believe they were
wrongly denied care, but there has been no deal yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they discussed in any detail the issue of how
wide-ranging the coverages should be, or on what, if any, right to
give patients to bring lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where a coalition of Democrats and Republican
outmaneuvered the GOP leadership, the legislation would cover all
Americans with private insurance. Many of the Senate provisions
would cover a smaller group of 48 million Americans in plans
regulated only by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans are expected to press Democrats this
week to address issues of access to insurance, including tax
benefits designed to make insurance more affordable, and allow for
more medical savings accounts. These allow Americans to set money
aside tax-free to pay for routine care if they buy a
high-deductible insurance policy in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   With time growing short for Congress to act in an election-year
session, some Republicans have said privately in recent days they
may attempt to negotiate an agremeent among themselves and send it
to the floor of both houses of Congress for a vote, even though it
would fall short of legislation Democrats and the White House
favor.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether that represented an attempt to wring
concessions from Democrats, or whether it was an attempt to
restrain Republicans most eager for a final compromise with the
Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Want Prisoners Freed  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Frustration over stalled negotiations exploded
into violence Sunday as thousands of Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli troops -- demonstrations that left at least 26 people
injured in a third day of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli
army base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones
and Molotov cocktails over the fence. Palestinian police
halfheartedly chased away some of the demonstrators, and Israeli
troops fired rubber-coated steel pellets, injuring at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians took place
in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah, injuring 11
Palestinians, an army officer and a border policeman, none
seriously. Those clashes began as marches marking Monday's 52nd
anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe'' -- the term
Palestinians use to refer to Israel's creation, which displaced
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hussam Al-Jouhari of Rafidiye hospital in Nablus said five
of the protesters were injured by live bullets. The Israeli army
would not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a meeting to discuss the release of 1,600
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli attacks ended in near
deadlock, with Israeli negotiator Oded Eran demanding that
Palestinian police quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''No talks can produce positive results while the violent
demonstrations continue,'' Eran told reporters, but he said Israel
would continue to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who has given Israel
a list of 200 prisoners he wants freed, said he told Eran that
''the reason for these demonstrations must be addressed.''
Palestinian negotiator Qaddura Fares said the protests would
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   The violence comes as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
having trouble reaching agreement on the thorniest issues of the
conflict between the sides: the future of Jerusalem, claimed by
both sides as their capital, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and final
borders of a Palestinian state. Those issues are supposed to be
settled in a final peace agreement due in September. The sides also
are still in discussion about several aspects of interim peace
accords, including prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Megiddo military prison in northern Israel, guards fired
tear gas after prisoners holding marches and giving speeches
refused to disperse. The army said the prisoners threw objects at
the guards and burned the tents they use for sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   One guard and two prisoners were slightly injured, the army
said. The prisoners, speaking by telephone, said dozens suffered
from tear gas inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Ads in Palestinian newspapers called for more protests during
two ''days of anger'' Friday and Saturday, and a commercial strike
was planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said in a statement
that while it did not accuse the Palestinian Authority of
instigating ''the violent winds'' sweeping across the Palestinian
areas, it expected Palestinian police to prevent the escalation.
The statement said that Israel had already fulfilled its obligation
to release prisoners as part of interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Palestinian family has a male relative who spent
some time in Israeli jails, and many Palestinian ministers and
lawmakers are former prisoners. Israel has released hundreds of
prisoners as part of detailed peace accords but says it will not
release Palestinians jailed for killing Israelis. To Israel, they
are terrorists; to the Palestinians, they are freedom fighters who
resisted Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   In a move not directly related to the talks, Israel released
Salah Shihadah, a founder of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who
had spent nearly 12 years in an Israeli prison. Shihadah, 45,
served a 10-year sentence for ''security violations'' but had been
held since 1998 under so-called administrative detention, a clause
that allows security officials to jail suspects without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said Shihadah was the first commander of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, and organized the kidnapping and
killing of two Israeli soldiers. Prisoner Services spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said Shihadah continued his involvement with Hamas
from his prison cell but would not say if he was involved in the
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Mazal Khouta, a sister of one of the soldiers kidnapped,
protested his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother is under the ground, and he (Shihadah) goes home as
though nothing had happened,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Snipes Plans Guard-Training Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga. (AP) -- Wesley Snipes, who has played a federal
marshal, a police officer and an FBI agent in his movies, wants to
bring some real-life action to rural Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes is negotiating to buy 300 acres about 35 miles northeast
of Macon to create a camp to train security agents for celebrity
protection, said Victor McGauley, vice president of Snipes' Los
Angeles-based production company, Amen Ra Films.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wesley is a high-profile person, and he saw that specific
security needs were not being met,'' McGauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam County chief building inspector J.D. Adams said a
security school is not permitted on the property, which is zoned
agricultural. He said the law has no provision for weapons storage
as indicated in Snipes' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys appealing the ruling say a firing range is a
permissible use of agricultural land.

<HEADLINE> College Welcomes Mr. Rogers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Mr. Rogers is welcome in his old
neighborhood any time.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after some students at Old Dominion University
questioned whether the children's television icon was an
appropriate speaker for college graduates, Fred Rogers received a
standing ovation Saturday at Saint Vincent College in his native
Latrobe.
</P>
<P>
   The host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood told the graduates he
felt complete when he realized he could combine his loves for
music, language and human development to help children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a miracle when you finally discover whom you're best
equipped to serve ... and we're all equipped to serve in some
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Old Dominion, some students complained that Mr. Rogers
catered to too young an audience -- one likened the appearance to
having Barney or the Teletubbies speak.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no such objections at Saint Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to have their rapt attention,'' said university
spokesman Don Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers received the college's Presidential Medal of Honor
and his wife, Joanne, a concert pianist, received an honorary
doctor of musical arts degree.

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran president speaks at UH graduation  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HARTFORD-- President Francisco Flores of El Salvador
returned to the University of Hartford Sunday urging graduates to
look to past traditions as they prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, a 1979 graduate of the university's Hillyer College,
recalled his then-troubled homeland and how his education helped
him overcome feelings of uncertainty and exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a rich paradox that the only way to develop a sense of
direction in our future is by immersing ourselves in the timeless
traditions of our past,'' Flores told some 1,300 graduates and
thousands of friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting Flores with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree,
Life Regent Harry Jack Gray told the Central American leader that
he was an inspiration to both the people of El Salvador and the
students at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ''You represent the sort of student the university seeks to
serve,'' said UH President Robert B. Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, the first UH alumnus to lead a nation, said he was
''assaulted'' by memories as he returned to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the ''strikes of gold in the generally green
landscape of Connecticut'' when he first arrived in Hartford in
September 1977 as well as the turmoil back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents' somber faces at the airport in San Salvador
concealed deeper fears than those normally associated with a
farewell to a 17-year-old,'' he said. ''Those were difficult times
for me and my country. After decades of military rule, El Salvador
was fast headed to the deepest conflict in its history: A civil war
that would last more than a decade, and that, with its blind
violence, would affect every single Salvadoran family.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores, a member of the Republican National Alliance, was
elected president of El Salvador on March 7, 1999 by an
overwhelming margin. He is part of a new political generation that
had little direct role in the 12-year civil war that ended in 1992
and cost 70,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   He told students to seek truth and creativity and to ''resist
the temptation to be lost in placid generality of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I went back to my country in the worst years of the war,'' he
said. ''I found something greater than my past, greater than my
roots, greater than my identity. I found my country. I found my
happiness. May you, dear graduates, find yours.''

<HEADLINE> Getting help is tough for New Jersey's special education students  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Jonathan Yard spent most of his
kindergarten year in a cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The autistic child wasn't allowed to attend school with other
children, so special education consultants taught the boy in the
basement of his family's Ewing home.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Yard wanted her son to attend his neighborhood school
with other kids, but the Ewing Township School District refused to
place him in its classroom for children with multiple handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   District officials did not return several phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's 5 and he belongs in kindergarten,'' Yard said. ''They're
discriminating against my child. How is it that my cellar is a
better place than my school around the corner?''
</P>
<P>
   Yard has plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   Parents across the state complain that their handicapped
children are being cheated out of the education they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Even though state and federal law requires districts to create
individual education plans tailored for every special education
student and provide services to meet their individual needs, many
districts fail to do this, parents charge.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigations back them up.
</P>
<P>
   A recent federal report compared the individual plans in one New
Jersey district and found 16 students had identical goals and
objectives. A teacher said all students were taught the same
skills, according to the federal Office of Special Education
Programs.
</P>
<P>
   That report, along with years of failure to meet the
disabilities law, brought federal monitors to New Jersey in
February. At meetings around the state, they heard from hundreds of
parents who complained that their handicapped children were being
denied a good education.
</P>
<P>
   These parents might finally find some help.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal corrective action plan, New Jersey is
scrutinizing the way special education is delivered in every
district in the state, according to Barbara Gantwerk, state
director of special education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new system calls for each district to appoint a committee of
parents, teachers and school administrators to assess its special
education program.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the state will do onsite inspections, Gantwerk said. State
officials are just finishing the first inspections of 25 of the
largest districts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 35 large districts are completing self-assessments and
will get state inspections in the coming school year. Together,
these 60 districts educate about 40 percent of New Jersey students,
Gantwerk said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is also pumping more money into special education,
one of the fastest growing parts of the education budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, state funding for special education has increased
about 31 percent, from about $586 million to a proposed $770
million in the budget year that begins July 1. New Jersey also
receives $156 million in federal funding, Gantwerk said. All that
money educates about 212,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The increase has been driven partly by a jump in the number of
children classified for special education, said Melvin Wyns,
director of the state Office of School Finance. The number of
special education students is rising faster than general
enrollment, Wyns said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state also increased the amount of aid it
provides for severely disabled children, and more children now fall
into that category, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, districts complain they need more special ed funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''In certain areas, are we getting adequate funding? I don't
believe so,'' said Rick Shane, director of special services in the
Millville School District.
</P>
<P>
   He says new laws mean teachers are required to attend additional
meetings, and that adds up to higher staffing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Richman, deputy director of the New Jersey
Developmental Disabilities Council, said it's impossible to know
exactly how much special education costs because no one has ever
studied it.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, she said, is that state special education
funding gets funneled into the regular budgets and there's no
accounting of how those dollars are spent. Federal dollars have to
be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   But money is only part of the picture, Gantwerk said. Districts
also need to change the way they educate kids with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons costs are high is that we in New Jersey
send a lot of kids out of district,'' she said. Costs would go down
if district would learn how to teach handicapped children in their
own classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Yard, the Ewing parent, would like to see that happen.
</P>
<P>
   After months of fighting, the Ewing district in April finally
found a seat for Jonathan, allowing him to finish kindergarten in a
regular classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people feel these kids don't belong with other
kids,'' Yard said. ''But he's a great kid. And he's doing
wonderfully now. He's not a distraction to other kids. But they
didn't want to give him a shot.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Attend Obuchi Funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday, that if his
schedule permits, he would like to attend the funeral of former
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like, obviously, to do anything I could to pay my
respects. But not only because of our relationship with Japan but
because of my personal feelings for him,'' Clinton said in brief
remarks to reporters that followed a written statement issued hours
after Obuchi's death.
</P>
<P>
   White House staff are mulling the possibility of a presidential
trip to attend Obuchi's funeral, but that no decision has been
made.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials said a private funeral is planned for
Tuesday. It is not clear whether Clinton or other heads might
attend that ceremony, or whether there will be a separate state
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi died of complications from a severe stroke that left him
in a coma six weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Tall Ships Tour East Coast Harbors  </HEADLINE>
By ANN S. KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Major ports along the East Coast will
evoke an earlier era this summer as an international fleet of tall
ships fills harbors with towering masts and acres of sail.
</P>
<P>
   The majestic vessels begin their northward journey up the East
Coast later this month after an appearance starting Friday at San
Juan, Puerto Rico. They'll reach New York Harbor in time for an
Independence Day celebration organizers say will eclipse the city's
massive 1976 bicentennial event.
</P>
<P>
   New York will be the centerpiece of the tour with about 150 tall
ships, three dozen warships and up to 70,000 spectator craft,
organizers say. The tour continues until late July when about two
dozen of the ships make a final stop at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of ships is organized by Operation Sail, a nonprofit
group that has promoted tall ship visits since the 1964 World's
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year is extraordinary and I don't think it's going to
happen this way again,'' said Lincoln Paine, who is helping to
organize the Portland event, called OpSail Maine 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Paine, an author of maritime books, said interest in tall ships
has surged in the last 25 years, spurred by sailboat races and the
appeal of wooden vessels in an era of ''plastics, polyester and
fiberglass.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, who has a summer home in Kennebunkport,
will be Portland's parade marshal, riding into the harbor aboard
the Eagle, the Coast Guard's 295-foot, three-masted training
barque.
</P>
<P>
   On their way from Puerto Rico to Maine, the ships also will stop
at Miami; Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; New York; and New
London, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Liver Transplant Waiting Time Drops  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The waiting time for the sickest liver
transplant patients was cut from five to three days after
transplant hospitals were required to send donated livers to the
sickest people rather than the closest patients, new research
finds.
</P>
<P>
   But that came at a cost: Fewer patients with less-urgent
conditions got transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which were being discussed at a transplant meeting
Sunday in Chicago, were expected. With a limited supply of donated
organs, any organ given to one patient is one taken away from
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the research cannot quantify the impact of the change on
the relatively healthy patients because medical criteria changed
over time, making the numbers inconsistent, said the study's lead
author, Dr. Santiago Vera, who directs the liver transplant program
at the University of Tennessee in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The change in liver allocation was ordered by the United Network
for Organ Sharing last summer. Normally, organs are first offered
to all patients in the local area before going to other
communities. But under the new policy, livers must be offered first
to any ''status 1'' patients within the region.
</P>
<P>
   Status 1 patients are those who are suddenly struck by liver
disease and have a week or less to live.
</P>
<P>
   This new policy brought the transplant network closer to the
philosophy of the Department of Health and Human Services, which
wants the network to break down these geographic barriers and get
more organs to the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study presented Sunday involved the experience of Region 11,
comprised of Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina and
North Carolina, or a total of 26 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Vera and his colleagues set out to measure the impact of the
change.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was reducing the waiting time for the sickest
patients by two days. ''That's a big deal,'' Vera said, with each
day critical for patients who are that ill.
</P>
<P>
   But 132 of the less-sick patients -- those classified as status
2b or 3 -- died while waiting for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vera had no way of knowing whether the number of deaths
in this group was higher or lower than in earlier years, given
changes in the medical classification over time. ''There's no way
to do that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israelis Clash  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Frustration over stalled negotiations exploded
into violence Sunday as thousands of Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli troops -- demonstrations that left at least 26 people
injured in a third day of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli
army base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones
and Molotov cocktails over the fence. Palestinian police
halfheartedly chased away some of the demonstrators, and Israeli
troops fired rubber-coated steel pellets, injuring at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians took place
in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah, injuring 11
Palestinians, an army officer and a border policeman, none
seriously. Those clashes began as marches marking Monday's 52nd
anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe'' -- the term
Palestinians use to refer to Israel's creation, which displaced
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hussam Al-Jouhari of Rafidiye hospital in Nablus said five
of the protesters were injured by live bullets. The Israeli army
would not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a meeting to discuss the release of 1,600
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli attacks ended in near
deadlock, with Israeli negotiator Oded Eran demanding that
Palestinian police quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''No talks can produce positive results while the violent
demonstrations continue,'' Eran told reporters, but he said Israel
would continue to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who has given Israel
a list of 200 prisoners he wants freed, said he told Eran that
''the reason for these demonstrations must be addressed.''
Palestinian negotiator Qaddura Fares said the protests would
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   The violence comes as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
having trouble reaching agreement on the thorniest issues of the
conflict between the sides: the future of Jerusalem, claimed by
both sides as their capital, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and final
borders of a Palestinian state. Those issues are supposed to be
settled in a final peace agreement due in September. The sides also
are still in discussion about several aspects of interim peace
accords, including prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Megiddo military prison in northern Israel, guards fired
tear gas after prisoners holding marches and giving speeches
refused to disperse. The army said the prisoners threw objects at
the guards and burned the tents they use for sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   One guard and two prisoners were slightly injured, the army
said. The prisoners, speaking by telephone, said dozens suffered
from tear gas inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Ads in Palestinian newspapers called for more protests during
two ''days of anger'' Friday and Saturday, and a commercial strike
was planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said in a statement
that while it did not accuse the Palestinian Authority of
instigating ''the violent winds'' sweeping across the Palestinian
areas, it expected Palestinian police to prevent the escalation.
The statement said that Israel had already fulfilled its obligation
to release prisoners as part of interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Palestinian family has a male relative who spent
some time in Israeli jails, and many Palestinian ministers and
lawmakers are former prisoners. Israel has released hundreds of
prisoners as part of detailed peace accords but says it will not
release Palestinians jailed for killing Israelis. To Israel, they
are terrorists; to the Palestinians, they are freedom fighters who
resisted Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   In a move not directly related to the talks, Israel released
Salah Shihadah, a founder of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who
had spent nearly 12 years in an Israeli prison. Shihadah, 45,
served a 10-year sentence for ''security violations'' but had been
held since 1998 under so-called administrative detention, a clause
that allows security officials to jail suspects without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said Shihadah was the first commander of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, and organized the kidnapping and
killing of two Israeli soldiers. Prisoner Services spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said Shihadah continued his involvement with Hamas
from his prison cell but would not say if he was involved in the
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Mazal Khouta, a sister of one of the soldiers kidnapped,
protested his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother is under the ground, and he (Shihadah) goes home as
though nothing had happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Israel television Channel 1 reported that the
Palestinian Authority has arrested a high-ranking guerrilla of the
militant Hamas group who tops Israel's wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate confirmation of Mohammed Deif's arrest could be
obtained from Palestinian officials. Israel holds Deif responsible
for a series of suicide bombing attacks which killed 47 Israelis
and injured 96, the Israeli justice ministry said when it requested
Deif's extradition last year.

settled in a final peace agreement due in September. The sides also
are still in discussion about several aspects of interim peace
accords, including prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Megiddo military prison in northern Israel, guards fired
tear gas after prisoners holding marches and giving speeches
refused to disperse. The army said the prisoners threw objects at
the guards and burned the tents they use for sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   One guard and two prisoners were slightly injured, the army
said. The prisoners, speaking by telephone, said dozens suffered
from tear gas inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Ads in Palestinian newspapers called for more protests during
two ''days of anger'' Friday and Saturday, and a commercial strike
was planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said in a statement
that while it did not accuse the Palestinian Authority of
instigating ''the violent winds'' sweeping across the Palestinian
areas, it expected Palestinian police to prevent the escalation.
The statement said that Israel had already fulfilled its obligation
to release prisoners as part of interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Palestinian family has a male relative who spent
some time in Israeli jails, and many Palestinian ministers and
lawmakers are former prisoners. Israel has released hundreds of
prisoners as part of detailed peace accords but says it will not
release Palestinians jailed for killing Israelis. To Israel, they
are terrorists; to the Palestinians, they are freedom fighters who
resisted Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   In a move not directly related to the talks, Israel released
Salah Shihadah, a founder of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who
had spent nearly 12 years in an Israeli prison. Shihadah, 45,
served a 10-year sentence for ''security violations'' but had been
held since 1998 under so-called administrative detention, a clause
that allows security officials to jail suspects without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said Shihadah was the first commander of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, and organized the kidnapping and
killing of two Israeli soldiers. Prisoner Services spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said Shihadah continued his involvement with Hamas
from his prison cell but would not say if he was involved in the
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Mazal Khouta, a sister of one of the soldiers kidnapped,
protested his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother is under the ground, and he (Shihadah) goes home as
though nothing had happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Israel television Channel 1 reported that the
Palestinian Authority has arrested a high-ranking guerrilla of the
militant Hamas group who tops Israel's wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate confirmation of Mohammed Deif's arrest could be
obtained from Palestinian officials. Israel holds Deif responsible
for a series of suicide bombing attacks which killed 47 Israelis
and injured 96, the Israeli justice ministry said when it requested
Deif's extradition last year.

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian Authority has arrested a
high-ranking guerrilla of the militant Islamic Hamas group who tops
Israel's wanted list, Israel television Channel 1 reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate confirmation of Mohammed Deif's arrest could be
obtained from Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Israel holds Deif responsible for a series of suicide bombing
attacks which killed 47 Israelis and injured 96, the Israeli
justice ministry said when it requested Deif's extradition last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Deif, who has been in hiding for years, was arrested a few days
ago and placed under what the Palestinian Authority called
''protective detention,'' Channel 1 said. The implication was that
he was being arrested for his own safety, to protect him from the
Israeli Shin Bet security service.
</P>
<P>
   Deif's predecessor -- Yehie Ayash, known as ''the engineer'' --
was killed in the Gaza Strip in 1996 when his cellphone blew up as
he answered a call. Hamas blamed the Shin Bet for the killing but
Israeli never acknowledged responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Banking Department tries to combat predatory lending  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State regulators want to stop so-called
predatory lending, which critics say traps elderly and minority
borrowers in ruinous loans.
</P>
<P>
   Acting state Superintendent of Banks Elizabeth McCaul said the
proposed regulations would ''significantly'' reduce abuse by
''unscrupulous mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers who engage in
deceptive sales and lending practices.'' The agency reports there
has been a recent ''explosion of complaints'' of these
high-interest, high-pressure loans.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Zinner of South Brooklyn Legal Services said his office has
been nearly overrun with calls from people who are in financial
chaos because of predatory lending practices. Most of the calls
have come from high-minority, poor sections of Brooklyn like
Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant or Brownsville, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the state would require lenders to inform
borrowers in writing to consider financial counseling and to shop
around.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would also require lenders to disclose all
details of the loans at least three days before closing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   What opponents call predatory lending, financial institutions
call ''sub-prime loans'' or high-interest home loans. They
generally are used by people who don't qualify for the
lower-interest prime loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-prime loans typically come with a high interest rate because
lenders take a higher risk of default. For example, a prime lender
may charge about 9 percent interest on a mortgage, while a
sub-prime loan's interest can run as high as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say lenders will also sometimes ''pack'' loans with
unnecessary fees or inflated costs without telling the borrower,
use high pressure door-to-door sales tactics or convince people who
have already borrowed to borrow more for unnecessary home
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired People reports sub-prime
home mortgages increased 760 percent from 1993 to 1998, compared to
a 38 percent increase in standard, prime home loans. The group also
reports that more than 90 percent of sub-prime loans have been made
in the past six years and that the market grew by roughly 30
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week by the Rochester Public Interest Law
Office showed that more than 3,000 sub-prime loans were granted in
1998 in Rochester, with a high percentage among primarily minority
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, president of the New York City-based state
Bankers Association, said he supports the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are designed to basically put parameters around the way
in which lenders can make these so-called predatory types of loans
outside the traditional lending market,'' Smith said. ''Their
purpose is really to eliminate abuse. We're supportive of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the regulations give unscrupulous lenders an
out.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they can correct the violation within 60 days or
prove that they made the mistake in good faith, they would not face
any consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ''For everything here, there's sort of a loophole,'' Zinner
said. ''It says that there's an exception to this prohibition if
lenders and brokers can say compelling circumstances existed to
make the loan. Basically, it says if you have a good reason, you
can make a loan that's unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinner also said the department largely ignored a recommendation
signed by 82 advocacy groups and elected officials to the first
draft of the proposed regulations. The groups asked for a
stiffening of many of the regulations, but the latest version is
very similar to the first, Zinner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Department did not return repeated telephone calls
during the past three weeks to comment on that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhi Maker, a senior attorney with the Rochester Public Interest
Law Office, said the new regulations ''obviously won't get us that
far.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything has a loophole and that would definitely be a
concern for us as we let people know, 'You can't do this, but you
can do it this way,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines could be in place as early as June.

<HEADLINE> 'Gladiator' Tops Box Office Again  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Combat of yore easily beat a battle of the
future as ''Gladiator'' stayed atop the box office for a second
straight weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman epic starring Russell Crowe took in $24.3 million in
its second weekend, padding its total gross to $73.3 million in 10
days of release.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta's sci-fi thriller ''Battlefield Earth,'' which
received almost universally terrible reviews, debuted in second
place with $12.3 million. The movie is based on L. Ron Hubbard's
bestseller about humans revolting against alien conquerors in the
year 3000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're No. 2 and happy to be there in such a competitive
marketplace,'' said Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner
Bros., which released ''Battlefield Earth.'' ''When John opens up a
movie, there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gladiator'' benefitted from a weak field of new movies. Sony's
ballet drama ''Center Stage'' took hard knocks from many critics,
as did Trimark's ''Held Up,'' a comedy starring Jamie Foxx. The
Norm McDonald comedy ''Screwed'' was so bad Universal did not
screen it for reviewers beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Center Stage'' debuted with $4.8 million to tie for fourth
place with ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' and
''Frequency.'' ''Screwed'' opened at No. 8 with $3.4 million, and
''Held Up'' was tied for No. 10 with ''Keeping the Faith'' at $1.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''All week long, 'Gladiator' has been doing over $3 million a
day, which is really terrific. That tells you right away audiences
are seeking out this movie,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie ticket sales. ''Word of
mouth on the movie has been tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gladiator's'' box-office reign likely will end next weekend
with the debut of Disney's ''Dinosaur,'' a computer-animated
spectacle about talking prehistoric reptiles on the run from a
killer meteor. Five days later, the summer season officially begins
with Tom Cruise's ''Mission: Impossible 2'' opening for Memorial
Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A new screen version of ''Hamlet,'' set in modern corporate
Manhattan, did well in limited release. Starring Ethan Hawke, the
movie debuted at four sites with $61,000 for an impressive
per-theater average of $15,250, compared with ''Gladiator's''
average of $8,257 at 2,943 cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamlet'' expands to more theaters next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Gladiator,'' $24.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Battlefield Earth,'' $12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''U-571,'' $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4 (tie). ''Center Stage,'' $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4 (tie). ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4 (tie). ''Frequency,'' $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Where the Heart Is,'' $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Screwed,'' $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Love and Basketball,'' $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   10 (tie). ''Held Up,'' $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   10 (tie). ''Keeping the Faith,'' $1.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Moms on Gun March  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said participants in
Sunday's Million Mom March were following in the path of admirable
activists in the women's suffrage and civil rights movements.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the great tradition that runs from Seneca Falls to Selma,
you will have redeemed the promise of freedom, you will have
strengthened the bonds of community, you will have proved that the
American Constitution works,'' Clinton said at a White House rally
before the march.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing views of the Clinton White House and the gun lobby
were aired on the White House South Lawn and during the Sunday talk
shows as tens of thousands of mothers, many with children in tow,
descended on the National Mall to press for gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   On television, a top executive of the National Rifle Association
executive maintained that the goals of the Million Mom March
amounted to ''a controlled burn of the Second Amendment'' -- the
constitution language guaranteeing citizens the right to keep and
bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But in his remarks, Clinton told several hundred of the people
favoring stricter gun controls: ''You're reminding all those people
out there, who have listened to all these crazy excuses,'' about
the reasons why gun control does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be deterred by the intimidation, don't be deterred by
the screaming, don't be deterred by the political mountain you have
to climb,'' Clinton said. ''You just remember there are more people
who think like you do in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for Senate in New York,
said that mothers ''don't want flowers or jewelry, we don't want a
nice card or a nice meal as much as we want our Congress to do the
right thing to protect our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The march agenda mirrored Clinton's: mandatory safety measures
such as trigger locks on handguns; an end to the ''loophole'' that
allows gun buyers to avoid background checks at flea-market style
gun shows and handgun licensing and registration.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would do some of those things, including
requiring trigger locks and a three-day waiting period and
background check at gun shows, has been gridlocked in the
Republican-run Congress for nearly a year. There has been just one
meeting -- nine months ago -- of a House-Senate conference charged
with resolving differences in gun laws passed by each house.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control supporters accused Republicans of bowing to the NRA
and bottling up gun control legislation that many Americans say
they support.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't get it,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., a
gun-control supporter. ''Why can't we pass common sense gun control
legislation?'' she asked on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, who often has
clashed with Clinton on this issue, said on NBC's ''Meet the
Press'' that ''setting fire to freedom should never be the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre appeared on several shows to make the same point: The
NRA claims the Clinton administration has not enforced many of the
approximately 20,000 gun laws already on the books, so why add new
ones?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. and a critic of the NRA, complained
on ''Fox News Sunday'' that gun-rights supporters ''are trying to
make it look as if the moms who are here today are trying to take
everybody's guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is so not true,'' Boxer said. ''The fact is what we're
fighting for is sensible gun laws that will protect those who want
to have a gun but would take the guns away from the criminals, the
children, the mentally imbalanced people.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Phasing Out ''Scared Straight''  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Even after 20 years, the words ''Scared
Straight'' still recall the cold stares of convicts, the
frightened, tearful expressions of young delinquents and
expletive-filled tirades aimed at keeping young people out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 award-winning television special filmed at East
Jersey State Prison, convicts stripped teens of their shoes, spit
in their faces and told them rape, murder and lost dreams would
await them in prison if they didn't straighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' won two Emmys and an Oscar. And the program,
founded in 1976 at the Rahway prison, went on to reach more than
50,000 troubled young people and has spawned replica programs
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, New Jersey has decided that ''Scared
Straight'' may be better television than an effective deterrent to
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Corrections ordered a re-evaluation of
the program last fall, and only one session has occurred since
December, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the agency decided to restart a toned-down, less
aggressive program. It also took control of another program aimed
at high school and college classes from the Lifers, the East Jersey
State inmates who run ''Scared Straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune said independent studies
have shown that scare tactics don't stop juveniles from committing
crime. He touted a program he founded in 1998, Project Pride, which
takes inmates into schools ''to address students in a very positive
and proactive way, as opposed to the foundation of 'Scared
Straight,' which is clearly a negative context.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan August, a retired Corrections lieutenant who founded
''Scared Straight,'' said the scare tactics were meant to get the
attention of delinquents who didn't want to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids were real wiseguys, most of them,'' August said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' supporters say they have countless stories
from people who say the in-your-face intimidation by hardened
criminals helped steer them off a dangerous path.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Shapiro, who produced the 1979 ''Scared Straight'' film,
a 20-year sequel tracking those in the original, and a 1999 film
about the program for MTV, said 80 percent of the young people who
listened to the convicts in the shows avoided a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't relate to you the number of people over the years who
have said to me that just by watching on television what the Lifers
were doing, it dissuaded them away from the direction they're
heading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Terhune was so disturbed by Shapiro's ''Scared Straight
'99,'' which aired last summer, that he decided to revamp the
program to be less violent and aggressive, according to a source
familiar with the program who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The department ordered the Lifers to stop scheduling new
sessions of ''Scared Straight'' in September and suspended the
Lifers' separate, less aggressive question-and-answer sessions and
prison tours for high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokesman Chris Carden says, a gentler
version of ''Scared Straight'' debuted in April. Another session is
scheduled for Monday, and 15 others are planned.
</P>
<P>
   High school and college tours programs will resume and expand to
other prisons as well, but under the department's direction, Carden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several high school and college officials have written to Gov.
Christie Whitman in recent weeks in support of the Lifers' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meeting with the Lifers ranks with the finest human
interaction and educational experiences of our lives,'' wrote
Barbara J. Gonos, a Brookdale Community College professor who has
taken students to see the Lifers for a dozen years.

<HEADLINE> Pope Reveals Fatima Secret His Way  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II said Sunday he'd been
deeply moved by his trip to Portugal, where a day before the
Vatican revealed that the so-called third secret of Fatima involved
a prophecy of the 1981 attempt on the pontiff's life.
</P>
<P>
   The pope chose the Vatican's No. 2 -- Cardinal Angelo Sodano -- to
reveal the vision seen by three Portuguese shepherd children in
1917. Sodano said in an interview published Sunday that the pope
had wanted to put an end to decades of speculation surrounding the
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Many believers had feared the secret was about some apocalyptic
end looming for humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed opportune to reveal these symbolic visions, also to
show that there wasn't anything mysterious,'' the Italian cardinal
said in Rome's daily La Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
   The other two secrets -- based on several visions the little
shepherds of Fatima had of the Virgin Mary starting on May 13, 1917
-- had been revealed decades earlier. The visions foretold the end
of World War I and the beginning of World War II, and the rise and
fall of Soviet Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's third pilgrimage to Fatima coincided with the
anniversary of the May 13, 1981, assassination attempt in St.
Peter's Square, in which he was gravely wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three shepherd children died of pneumonia at the ages
of 9 and 11, two years after the visions. Their cousin who also saw
the visions, Lucia Dos Santos, is now a 93-year-old cloistered nun
in Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still strong in my heart is the emotion felt yesterday at
Fatima in beatifying the little shepherds Francesco and Giacinta
Marto, who, together with Lucia, still living, had the privilege of
seeing the Madonna and speaking with her,'' John Paul told the
public gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon Sunday for a ceremony
to ordain 26 priests.
</P>
<P>
   Sodano told the faithful at Fatima on Saturday that the
shepherds interpreted a vision of a ''bishop clothed in white'' as
signifying the pontiff. In the vision, the figure ''falls to the
ground, apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire,'' Sodano said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the pope had credited the Virgin of Fatima
with lending a ''motherly hand'' to guide the bullet's path and
spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who turns 80 on Thursday, has asked a commission led
by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, his top guardian of orthodoxy, to
issue a text and commentary about the third secret.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview why the pope chose now to reveal a secret
he learned in 1978 in the first days of his papacy, Sodano said:
''Fatima was the most proper place, a symbolic place in the moment
in which a millennium, especially such a tormented century so full
suffering, closes.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the atheism promoted by the now defunct Communist
regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Sodano said
Saturday that Fatima's call ''to conversion and penance, issued at
the beginning of the 20th century, remains timely and urgent
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope on Sunday encouraged prayer and penitence for the
church ''for the conversion of who those who live in sin and for
peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan's daily Corriere della Sera quoted the pope's 1981
attacker, Mehmet Ali Agca, as saying: ''I am sure a supernatural
force pushed me to shoot that May 13th 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet, a Turk, is serving a life sentence in an Italian prison.
However those serving life sentences in Italy rarely spend more
than 20 years in prison before being released, and Agca has
petitioned for an early release.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get out of prison, I will go to kneel before the Madonna
of Fatima and I will stay there 10 days in prayer,'' Agca was
quoted as saying.

accusing them of masterminding the slaying of a top official in
President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist party -- on behalf
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bosko Perosevic, 43, head of the Vojvodina
provincial government and chief of a Socialist party branch there,
was shot and killed while visiting a trade fair, the government
claimed the anti-government student organization Otpor and the
opposition Serbian Renewal Movement party were behind the attack
and would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ''All who perform activities against the state will be treated
in accordance with the law and prevented. The time of their street
actions is over,'' Serbia's Information Minister Goran Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said in a statement they were ''beyond doubt'' that the
suspected gunman, Milivoj Gutovic, 50, was an activist with Otpor
and the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency Sunday
said ''posters and propaganda material of Otpor and of Serbian
Renewal Movement, as well as brochures on terrorism'' were found in
Gutovic's home.
</P>
<P>
   Gutovic, a longtime security guard at the Novi Sad exhibition
venue, allegedly approached Perosevic at an agricultural fair
Saturday, pressed a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. He was
taken into custody immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have denied the allegations and any connection with
the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement expressed condolences to
Perosevic's family and called Gutovic ''a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic also claimed the NATO countries who launched a 78-day air
attack against Yugoslavia last year were behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (slaying) was not the work of a single maniac, but an
organized murder with a deep political background, with the aim to
destabilize Yugoslavia,'' Matic told reporters Sunday. ''We are
faced with a concept of active destabilization of Yugoslavia by the
same who carried out armed aggression against our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The government appeared ready to crack down on the rising
dissent in Yugoslavia, a country which is impoverished and isolated
after more than decade of Milosevic's rule and losing three wars,
as well as virtual control of the Kosovo province to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said a number of arrests had been made already in
connection with the slaying, but declined to specify how many.
Asked if opposition activists who are expected to hold a rally in
Belgrade Monday would face arrest, Matic said: ''That is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic personally attended a Sunday memorial for
Perosevic, along with about 200 officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NATO aggressors are now putting their weapons in the hands
of their servants here, to do for them the dirty job, to spread
fear and chaos,'' said Gorica Gajevic, Secretary General of the
Socialists, in a speech at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Gajevic called Otpor ''ordinary NATO mercenaries'' and promised
''Serbia will fight against them just as it fought back against any
other evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor activists in Belgrade and Novi Sad called the government's
comments an attempt by Milosevic's regime to halt their popular
anti-government protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a thorn in their side, they are trying to break us with
this, but we will not give up our demands'' for democracy and free
elections, said Miroslav Kecman, an Otpor activist.
</P>
<P>
   He added that at least one Otpor activist had been called by
Novi Sad police for questioning. Earlier Sunday an independent
radio reporter and a member of the Serbian Renewal Movement were
also detained in Novi Sad for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   An Otpor activist in Belgrade, Ivan Marovic, told the Associated
Press that a number of the groups' activists have been arrested in
several Serbian towns, but some were released after lengthy
questioning.

<HEADLINE> St. Petersburg Voters Choose Leader  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTINA SHEVORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Incumbent Vladimir Yakovlev was
expected to win re-election Sunday as governor of Russia's
second-largest city in voting after a campaign marred by dirty
tricks and allegations of ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   As he cast his own vote, Yakovlev -- who has the support of his
All Russia party and the Communists -- expressed confidence he would
win a second four-year term in St. Petersburg. Voters, he said,
realized he had done a great deal to revitalize the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good sign that we have achieved much and are
being rewarded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of St. Petersburg's 3.5 million voters were expected
to turn out, election officials said. If no candidate receives more
than 50 percent, a second round will be held between the top two
finishers. Results were expected to start coming in Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge was posed by Igor Artemyev, a local leader of
the liberal Yabloko party and a former city financial official.
Artemyev accused Yakovlev of having ties to underworld figures and
blamed him for St. Petersburg's reputation as Russia's organized
crime capital. Organized crime is a major problem in Russia, with
gangs extorting money from private companies and government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg has been the scene of a rash of mob-style
killings of political and business figures. One member of the city
legislature, Yuri Shutov, is in jail on charges of ordering seven
contract killings. Prosecutors have described Shutov as the head of
an organized crime group.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the national magazine Sovershenno Sekretno
produced a 1-million-copy special St. Petersburg edition also
accusing Yakovlev of having links to the organized crime world.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev has denied the allegations and billed himself as a
strong manager. As an example, he pointed to the city's newly built
hockey stadium, site of the world championships which end Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has widespread support among residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yakovlev is a strong manager,'' pensioner Valentina
Andreyevna, who would not give her last name, said as she cast her
vote at a city school. ''The city has been transformed. It's
obvious that he's done something for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Artemyev supporter Mikhail Prokhurovye, 39, disagreed:
''Yakovlev is not completely honest. He's only done small projects
that make him look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The election campaign has been inundated by accusations of dirty
tricks, many of them aimed at Artemyev. The opposition leader's
campaign posters have been defaced, and leaflets were distributed
accusing him of failing to support Russia in the hockey
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev's re-election hopes seemed far less certain when
Vladimir Putin became acting president Dec. 31 after Boris Yeltsin
stepped down. Putin was a top aide to former Governor Anatoly
Sobchak, who lost to Yakovlev in 1996 elections, and the new
president reportedly wanted to avenge his former chief's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a St. Petersburg native, originally endorsed a powerful
potential challenger, Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matvienko.
But Putin later backed down and Matvienko withdrew for reasons that
were never explained.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has since handled Yakovlev cautiously. Still, the
pro-Putin Unity party decided to back Artemyev, endorsing his
democratic credentials and pro-market economic program.
</P>
<P>
   Also running were Yuri Boldyrev, deputy head of the Russian
parliament's auditing agency, and businessman Artyem Tarasov.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were also to choose a replacement for city legislature
member Viktor Novoselov, who died in October when unknown attackers
placed a bomb on the roof of his car at a traffic light.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Attack Checkpoints  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters attacked Russian
checkpoints around Chechnya, military officials said Sunday, but
bad weather kept federal jets from flying their daily sorties in
the republic's south.
</P>
<P>
   Russian checkpoints came under fire eight times in the last 24
hours, while border points and patrols were attacked 11 times,
Russian military officials said. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Though jets were grounded by bad weather, Russian artillery
shelled rebel positions in Chechnya's southern mountains on Sunday.
The south is still controlled by thousands of rebels, who have
defied Russian claims of imminent victory with deadly ambushes on
military convoys in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In attacks over the last day, Russian forces claimed to have
found and destroyed a rebel base, finding 35,000 rounds of
ammunition and 400 mortar rounds, officials said Sunday. Military
spokesmen said that seven rebels were killed, but casualty claims
have been difficult to verify and both sides exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also continued searching Sunday for a reconnaissance
plane that disappeared over Chechnya a week ago. The Su-24MR was
lost in bad weather, and Russian military officials have not ruled
out that it was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency said that, despite bad weather, six
helicopters, two planes and several ground units were searching for
the plane, which rebels claimed to have downed. Several Russian
planes have been shot down in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified military sources, the Interfax news agency
reported that a Russian helicopter went down in Chechnya's southern
mountains Sunday afternoon. The report said several servicemen
wounded in the crash were hospitalized. Calls to the Defense
Ministry for comment on the report were not answered.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the last day for rebels to receive amnesty under a
federal decree. The decree gives amnesty to rebels who surrender
their weapons and are found not to have committed serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 rebels have been amnestied under the decree, Russian
officials said. But most rebels have scorned the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces re-entered Chechnya in September, after Islamic
militants based there seized villages in the neighboring Russian
region of Dagestan, and after 300 people died in Russia in
apartment bombings the government blamed on the Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Cindy McCain To Lead GOP Delegation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the end, Sen. John McCain got his wish. His
wife Cindy will lead the state delegation to the Republican
National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain was chosen at a state convention Saturday in
Scottsdale -- after Gov. Jane Hull stepped aside. Despite initial
misgivings about relinquishing the governor's traditional role as
head of the delegation, Hull stressed the need for party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Sproul, executive director of the Arizona GOP, said the
state's 30 delegates unanimously voted for Cindy McCain. McCain's
home state is one of seven he won during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was to be expected that the party pulled together
and would be united,'' Sproul said Sunday. ''McCain won Arizona,
and I think it's logical that she (Cindy) be the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   By installing his wife as the delegation head, McCain assures
himself additional media exposure at the July 31-Aug. 3 convention
in Philadelphia. Mrs. McCain, who previously had avoided the
political spotlight, will stand up and deliver Arizona's delegates
on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Feuding between the governor and senator began with Hull's
endorsement of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, now the presumptive GOP
nominee for president, which miffed McCain and garnered national
headlines. The dispute simmered even after McCain suspended his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After Hull disclosed her desire to lead the delegation, McCain
dismissed the idea during a nationally televised interview. His
preference for his wife angered Hull and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, however, stepped aside after two weeks of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At the state convention Saturday, the party also elected its 30
national convention delegates.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Goes Dot-Com and B2B  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- One of the biggest stars at Cannes this
year doesn't ride in a limousine and hasn't been seen climbing the
famous red-carpeted stairs.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Internet, and it's reworking industry deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   Film buyers and sellers are all talking Net jargon, and the buzz
is all about B2B, or business-to-business and a slew of sites that
make it possible for them to connect, share film information, video
trailers and rights -- all before they even get to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it means is that you can do all your homework before
coming to Cannes and then just slide the contract across the
table,'' said Jeremy Kehoe, vice president and director of
communications of Los Angeles-based Filmbazaar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Filmbazaar.com was launched at the American Film Market in
February, and its piece de resistance is its Professional Business
Center -- touted as ''a global online office that connects film
buyers and sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe says a key element is the screening process that wannabe
members have to go through before they can register.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in the flea market of films, where any guy who has
a camera can put a film on the site. We are a B2B enabler,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also very visible at Cannes is ShowBIZdata.com, formed three
years ago and already a granddaddy of the fledgling business.
</P>
<P>
   ShowBIZdata.com has teamed up with the Cannes Market, the
organizers of the commercial side of the two-week moviefest, and
information provider FilmFinders to launch cannesmarket.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which went live a couple of weeks before the start of
the festival, provides company profiles, contact information,
marketing materials and e-mail addresses to make drawing up that
big deal easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Eberle, ShowBIZdata.com's German founder and
self-confessed computer geek, was a movie producer for 12 years
before setting up the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have around 20,000 users a day and it is increasing
steadily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cannes Market site has about 3,500 users a day, or half the
festival participants.
</P>
<P>
   So will players one day forgo the meet-and-greet business of
festivals like Cannes? Most say no.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in sales are very social people. We are basically
gypsies,'' said one seller, Vincent Petrillo, vice president of
international sales at Devin International. The firm came to Cannes
with 11 films and has sealed six deals already, the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very emotional business,'' he said. ''You can't
divorce the art from the commerce.''

<HEADLINE> BIA chief says tribes must end dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The U.S. director of Indian Affairs
says he has lost patience with the decades-old dispute between the
Paucatuck Eastern Pequots and Eastern Pequots and questions whether
the Bureau of Indian Affairs can recognize both tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s one group within the Eastern Pequot tribe has
sought to oust another faction, claiming the other group has no
Pequot heritage. The dispute has been marked by acrimonious
exchanges on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gover said he also finds it distasteful that the rift is
along racial lines. The Paucatuck Easterns are the perceived
''white'' tribe and the Eastern Pequot tribe is made up largely of
the extended Sebastian family, which is black and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ''There obviously are no full-blooded Pequots anymore, but we
don't care if they intermarried with whites, blacks, yellows or
greens. From our perspective there was enough evidence in the
record to satisfy us'' that both groups were legitimate, Gover told
The Day this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s the schism erupted into a full-fledged political
row before the Connecticut Indian Affairs Council. The ensuing rift
created the faction known as the Paucatuck Easterns. The tribes
share a Lantern Hill reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Paucatucks contend that the Eastern Pequots do not descend
from the historic Eastern Pequots and that the group's members have
''stolen'' parts of the Pequot and Paucatuck histories to boost
their tribal claims. The Paucatucks have continued to press those
allegations with the BIA while seeking federal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Easterns, meanwhile, have maintained throughout that they
and the Paucatucks are really one tribe and have tried several
times to reconcile with the Paucatucks.
</P>
<P>
   Gover, assistant secretary of the Department of the Interior,
told The Day that the BIA has determined that both factions descend
from the historic Eastern Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the BIA issued preliminary recognition to both groups.
Gover said the tribes' petitions were among the strongest he's ever
seen during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ''These petitions did a real good job of presenting evidence as
to each of the (BIA's) seven criteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said the BIA has told the supplicants their best best
chance of achieving recognition might be to merge. The BIA might
not be able to recognize a tribe that may have just come into
existence during the past century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that although splinter groups of a tribe can and have
been recognized by the BIA, most of those cases-- such as the split
in the Sioux Nation in the 1800s that created several Sioux tribes--
happened long enough ago for the groups to establish themselves as
separate and distinct political entities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we're confident that there is a tribal institution
that exists here,'' he said, referring to the Eastern Pequots and
Paucatuck Easterns. ''What we want to understand more clearly is at
what point, if any, did the separation occur between the two groups
and do we have the authority to recognize an Indian tribe that came
into existence'' in the 1970s?
</P>
<P>
   He added that the feuding not only is self-defeating but
perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're right on the verge of all this federal assistance,''
and they continue to fight, he said.

<HEADLINE> 20 Killed in Dutch Fireworks Blast  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- At first it looked like a
spectacular fireworks display had lit up the sunny afternoon, and
people streamed toward the green, yellow and red flares.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the whole fireworks depot blew up, obliterating
an entire working-class neighborhood and leaving at least 20 people
dead and 589 injured in this eastern Dutch city.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a day after 100 tons of fireworks exploded, emergency
crews searched for survivors among the charred wreckage of 400
flattened houses. They found themselves hampered by small fires
that kept the rubble red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   Although safety regulations require that explosives be stored in
separate, insulated bunkers, the depot's entire 100-ton store
detonated with a force that experts compared to a wartime rocket
attack. Officials said they had not ruled out arson.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 15 bodies have been recovered but authorities estimated
the death toll at 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction began when a series of blasts from the S.E.
Fireworks warehouse sent concrete blocks and glass shards flying.
Cascading fireballs and billowing black clouds swallowed the
neighborhood of Enschede North as throngs fled the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started as a small fire,'' said Omir Sobaa, 18, his wrists
swathed in bandages as he recalled the previous day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thought that a paper factory had gone up in
flames,'' he said. ''I saw fireworks and everybody started to
panic. Everybody started to run. And then I was knocked to the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   For many others, there was no escape in the smoke-shrouded
darkness. But they ran anyway, in every direction, their faces
streaked with blood, some with missing limbs, trampling children
underfoot, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most terrible thing that could happen to people,''
said Prime Minister Wim Kok, shaking his head in shock after
surveying the disaster area with Queen Beatrix.
</P>
<P>
   The day was doubly tragic for the Dutch queen. Her 88-year-old
father, Prince Bernhard, was in an intensive care unit after
complications from intestinal surgery, his seventh operation in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   As Beatrix toured an emergency shelter, mothers of missing
children clung to her and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Freek Tonis said he was working in his garden with his wife and
young child when the first explosion blew out windows in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a bang and we went to the corner to see what it
was,'' said the 35-year-old businessman. ''We thought it was a
fireworks display and wondered who would be setting off fireworks
in the middle of the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the desolate streets of Enschede North resembled a
bombed-out war zone. Rescue workers in bright yellow and orange
suits sifted through the smoldering ruins with sniffing dogs in
search of survivors and dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Blackened skeletons of homes stood silently as dark silhouettes
against a bright, cerulean sky. Cleanup crews solemnly hauled away
burnt-out automobile chassis lining streets strewn with pieces of
glass and concrete and blanketed with ash.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left of the fireworks warehouse was a gaping
crater. A neighboring supermarket had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Small fires still burned in the Grolsch Brewery across the
street, where fermentation tanks and inventory rooms were gutted.
The factory is one of two main production centers for Grolsch, a
leading Dutch beer brand. Employees were asked not to come to the
factory on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy was the worst to strike the Netherlands since an
Israeli cargo plane plowed into a tenement block on Oct. 4, 1992,
killing 43 people.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators and talk show hosts Sunday drew parallels between
the two disasters, noting that both struck low-income neighborhoods
with large immigrant communities. About one-quarter of Enschede
North's residents were of Turkish, Moroccan and Spanish origin.
</P>
<P>
   Sobaa, whose parents immigrated from Turkey before he was born,
was one of many residents who wanted answers to why city
authorities allowed a fireworks depot to be located so close to a
residential neighborhood. But mainly, he feared for those still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky,'' he said, as he strolled by the outdoor cafes in
the center of town. ''I have lots of friends and relatives who live
there.''

<HEADLINE> White Farmer Dies in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- White farmer John Weeks died Sunday from
injuries sustained in a shooting farm leaders say was linked to
ruling party militants. He was the nineteenth person killed by
political violence in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   David Hasluck, head of the Commercial Farmers Union, called the
shooting Thursday of Weeks, 65, ''definitely political.'' He said
Weeks' attackers are tied to the militants who have occupied more
than 1,000 white-owned farms in the past three months in protest of
the land disparity between Zimbabwe's whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks also shot one of the five armed men who attacked him, said
David Hasluck. The man was taken away by his companions and his
condition was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks' farm is in the Beatrice district, about 30 miles from
Harare, where farmer Alan Dunn was bludgeoned to death a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the other fatal victims, Dunn supported the main
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. But Guy
Watson-Smith, another farmer in the area, said he was not aware of
Weeks being involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it was a symptom of the breakdown of law and
order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five new farms -- including one owned by Zimbabwe's last white
ruler, Ian Smith -- were occupied Saturday, the union said in a
statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Robert Mugabe assured union representatives
that the violence would stop while a commission was established to
oversee land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 81, whose 1964-79 premiership saw Zimbabwe, then called
Rhodesia, declare unilateral independence from Britain in a bid to
stave off black rule, was in Harare Sunday. He told the Associated
Press Television News that he did not think black squatters might
target his farm because of his past.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, they all love me. I've got more black friends than Mugabe
at present.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's Gwenoro ranch was ruled unsuitable for resettlement of
small-scale peasant farmers by Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has accused Mugabe of inciting and supporting the
farm occupations to shore up his party's flagging support ahead of
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   However, the occupation of Smith's farm, 250 miles southwest of
Harare, appeared not to be organized by the ruling party, said
Smith's son, Alec Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just a group of local squatters and unemployed people
from the nearby town of Shurugwe who have just wandered on, and not
in any organized or dangerous fashion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The occupiers had not disrupted farming operations and there was
no confrontation with workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has called the occupations a justified protest against
unfair land ownership. One-third of Zimbabwe's fertile land is
owned by a few thousand whites.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations began in February, after Mugabe had lost a
referendum that would have entrenched his powers and allowed him to
seize white-owned land without paying compensation.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gun Marchers Carry Message  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Arlene Heter missed the bus to the Million Mom March
in
Washington, so she passed up a Mother's Day meal with four
daughters and 11 grandchildren Sunday to campaign for gun
regulation at Michigan's state Capitol in Lansing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I want safety for my family,'' said the 60-year-old Heter,
from Rochester, Mich. ''I want people to feel free to walk down
streets and suburbs and in cities. Men with all their money and
power don't talk to the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That gathering in Lansing was one of dozens held from coast to
coast to back up the Million Mom March in Washington and its demand
for stricter regulation of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   While tens of thousands turned out on Washington's National
Mall, several hundred gathered with Heter in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something special here,'' Michigan Attorney General
Jennifer Granholm, a mother of two daughters and a son, told the
crowd. ''Talk about girl power. As my girls would say, 'You rock.'
Never again will the country ever underestimate the power of
moms.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lansing and elsewhere, gun advocates faced the pro-regulation
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Signs carried by counterdemonstrators in Chicago read ''An armed
person is a free person'' and one showed a picture of a woman
pointing a gun with the caption ''Rape this.''
</P>
<P>
   A group calling themselves the Second Amendment Sisters staged a
small counter-rally in Los Angeles. Jane Keller, a mother of two,
held a sign reading ''self-defense is an inalienable right.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were outnumbered by the marchers calling for gun
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Moms were joined by dads and children in a half-mile march in
Atlanta that organizers said drew more than the expected 1,500
people. Some carried signs bearing the names of gun violence
victims and slogans such as ''We will remember in November.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to accomplish getting Congress to listen to us,
to women's voices,'' said Jaquie Algee, a march organizer whose son
was shot and killed in 1995. She said police never caught her son's
killers or determined a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the estimated 1,500 people who rallied in Los Angeles were
parents and teachers from the North Valley Jewish Community Center,
where a gunman wounded five people last August. That event inspired
the organization of the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is ever going to walk into a center again and unload 78
rounds of ammunition,'' said Bernice Lieberman, 69, longtime
director of North Valley's nursery school and kindergarten. ''We,
the moms of this country, won't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd estimated at more than 4,000 people gathered along the
downtown Chicago lakefront, including 79-year-old Bea Semrow of
suburban Glenview. She said she got all five of her daughters to
join the campaign, four in Chicago and one in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not one to go to a lot of rallies, but I just thought this
was so important,'' Semrow said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people turned out in Portland, Ore., with Sue
Hill, 45, of Tillamook, carrying a sign reading ''Triggerlocks Are
Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And several hundred people gathered in front of the New
Hampshire Statehouse urging lawmakers to enact tougher gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for real representation on this issue and we will
keep nagging until you hear us, not humor us, but hear us,''
organizer Mireille Lang of Hollis, N.H., said to cheers from the
crowd.

<HEADLINE> 17 Die in Egypt Building Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Dozens of family and friends, their dusty
faces streaked with tears, stood stunned outside the remains of a
collapsed apartment building Sunday, grieving each victim unearthed
from the wreckage and questioning who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday evening, 17 bodies had been pulled from the wreckage
in downtown Cairo, and at least three more people were feared dead
beneath tons of concrete and metal rods.
</P>
<P>
   ''God has made a place for them in heaven. There, they will be
together,'' said a man comforting another, who cried openly for his
relatives who had yet to be recovered. Officials on site said there
was little chance anyone inside had survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think anyone would come out alive from under this
hell,'' said Mohammed el-Bahii, the chief ambulance officer and one
of more than 80 civil defense workers, paramedics, fire fighters
and police at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 relatives and residents gathered near the broken
concrete, and wondered who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they'd paid $330 apiece less than a week ago to
have the apartment building repaired. A half-hour before the
building collapsed at 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning, they had finished
a meeting to discuss renovations, including reinforcement supports
and repairs to the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   A contractor who came Saturday ''dug a long ditch by the
building, where he said he would lay some support rods,'' said Um
Ahmed, who lived on the top floor of the five-story building,
located in the Sayyida Zeinab district.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then he left without putting up the rods,'' she said. Um Ahmed
said a neighbor in the next building had called out to her to leave
immediately, after the neighbor had seen chunks of concrete fall
from the edifice and a small cloud of dust rise from the ground
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Um Ahmed, her husband and her 17-year-old daughter, Maha, ran
out just five minutes before the building crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how many people lived in the building, but some
families had already left in anticipation of the planned
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   The city council had ordered the building's owner, Yousri
Mohammed Hosni, to undertake repairs. Hosni was the 11th victim to
be pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dead was Ashraf Mohammed, his wife, Abeer, and
their sons, Mohammed, 2, and Moustafa, 4. Mohammed was found
hugging his younger son.
</P>
<P>
   As rescuers using sensors pulled each corpse from the
20-foot-high pile of debris, women let out screams that overpowered
the orders rescue officials barked over megaphones.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sister, my love, the light of my eye,'' cried one woman,
her head covered in the scarf of a devout Muslim. ''Why God, why
did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, health ministry officials said a man and a
his young son who were walking by the building when it collapsed
had been pulled out alive.
</P>
<P>
   Officers atop the rubble ordered onlookers off the debris and
surrounding rooftops, as bulldozers shifted and scooped up rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, roamed a school courtyard next to the
building, asking residents about the hired contractor and whether a
city engineer had been overseeing the work.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were overheard telling them that a district engineer
had come to the building Saturday and ordered the work to begin.
But just who was involved in the renovation wasn't yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   The district engineer ''left bags of plaster and cement and
supervised the digging of the ditches by the building and then
left,'' said Wael Abdel-Nabi, an electrical engineer who lives in a
nearby building. ''He didn't order them to vacate the building.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Likes Chances in Tennessee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- George W. Bush says he can win Tennessee
in November even though it is Vice President Al Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters in Austin, Texas, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee said he expects to campaign often
in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tennessee is going to be an interesting race,'' Bush said,
according to The Knoxville News-Sentinel. ''That's a state where I
have a pretty good chance ... because a lot of Tennessee people
don't want four more years of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said residents appreciate his position on strengthening the
military and cutting taxes, and recalled that the Clinton-Gore
ticket carried the state by 2 percentage points in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plus, I think the reason I have a good chance is the
Republican Party is strong in Tennessee and is well represented by
(Sen.) Fred Thompson and (Sen.) Bill Frist and Sunny (Gov. Don
Sundquist) at the governor's mansion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people who are good people, who have earned the
respect of their citizens. This is where, if you are judged by your
friends, I like my chances in Tennessee because the party has done
so well, because of the quality of elected officials from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, has
never lost a race in Tennessee, including as vice president. Though
Democrats carried the state in the last two presidential races,
Republican Ronald Reagan won it in 1980 and 1984, and Bush's father
carried it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Tennessee poll, a Mason-Dixon survey from
mid-March, showed Gore leading 47 percent to 41 percent, with an
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Mobbed at March  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A crush of media and excited onlookers forced
Hillary Rodham Clinton to take a detour shortly after she began to
join the Million Mom March as it moved along the National Mall on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Such outings by first ladies are quite rare. Clinton, undeterred
by the mob scene, opted for a nearby road, where she slowly made
her way toward the Capitol on her own. She shook hands with throngs
of well-wishers that lined the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God! Oh my God! She signed my T-shirt! That is so
cool!'' gushed 17-year-old Trina Williams from Morris Township,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother's Day march was intended to send lawmakers and the
gun lobby a message that American families support stricter gun
control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was one of the march's star attractions, Clinton,
who is running for the Senate from New York, did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a reception with the president for several hundred
marchers on the South Lawn of the White House, she delivered a
campaign-style speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined the need child safety locks, licensing for gun
owners and closure to a loophole that allows firearms to be sold at
gun shows without background checks. All are positions she has
embraced in her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come here in the names of the children we love, the
children we have lost and the children we want to save,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think sometimes it takes women to stand up and say enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At the march itself, she was such a magnet for the media and
onlookers that it repeatedly stalled the section of the march she
was in.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept smiling as she walked between New York Reps. Nita
Lowey and Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed by a gunman on
a Long Island commuter train. But she appeared a bit dazed as media
cameras and even other marchers swarmed her repeatedly and jostled
inches from her with Secret Service and event staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too much press,'' she said when asked why she was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared to be heading to a waiting limousine, but instead
made her way up Madison Drive, which runs parallel to the Mall. As
word spread that she was in the area, people packed the street to
catch a glimpse of her.
</P>
<P>
   While most shouted out her name and snapped photos, not everyone
was a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Flint, a junior at Howard University, shouted ''Go Rudy''
as he rollerbladed along the line of supporters Mrs. Clinton was
greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''She can shake all the hands she wants, she does not impress me
at all,'' Flint said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady ignored questions shouted to her by reporters
about Rudolph Giuliani. The New York City mayor's recent diagnosis
with prostate cancer combined with his marital woes have left him
rethinking whether he will stay in the race. He is expected to
decide in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Gun Rights Protesters Also in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wanda Borsa belongs to a women's shooting club
and opposes gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother of five and retired elementary school teacher
says it is her deep concern for children's safety, however, that
brought her from New Freedom, Pa., to a counter-demonstration
against the Million Mom March Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very, very strongly about the same things as the women
on the other side feel. I want the violence to stop. Where I
disagree with them is the method,'' said Borsa, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Good parenting, gun-safety education and self-defense are among
alternatives to more gun-control laws, said Borsa, who joined
several thousand others in attending a gun-rights rally near the
Washington Monument Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the much larger, star-studded event held at the
other end of the National Mall, with its mass-produced T-shirts and
buttons, people at the rival gun-rights gathering carried mostly
homemade signs -- ''If you outlaw guns, only the outlaws will have
them,'' read one. Like the Million Mom March, many there were moms
and dads, pushing strollers or holding children on their laps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm interested in pointing out that just because you're a mom
doesn't mean you buy into the idea that you have to do something
even if it isn't going to be effective,'' said Marta Howard,
holding her 15-month-old daughter Marjorie.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and her husband Nat, who live in Vienna, Virginia, own a
gun -- partly because it makes them feel safer, but also as a
political statement they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''A right exercised is not so easily taken away,'' Nat Howard
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Another man with similar sentiments wandered the crowd dressed
as a revolutionary war patriot, complete with powder horn and three
cornered hat. Refusing to identify himself except as ''an American
citizen,'' he said, ''I came because we have some people on the
other side who want to destroy the Bill of Rights because some
mothers don't control their children properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter-rally was organized by the Second Amendment Sisters,
Inc., started to generate a national response to the Million Mom
March. The group, not affiliated with the National Rifle
Association, set up a small stage and brought in speakers and
musical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Gartia Hupp, a Republican state representative from
Texas, told the crowd how she saw her parents killed nine years ago
when a man went on a shooting rampage, killing 23 people in a
cafeteria where the family was having lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''My gun was 100 feet away from me in my car because I had
chosen to obey the law,'' against carrying one, Hupp said. ''I
refuse to ever be an easy victim again,'' she vowed.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, the gun-rights demonstrators marched up
Constitution Avenue toward the U.S. Capitol and the Million Mom
March participants. Members of the two groups exchanged some shouts
and booing, and a few stopped to try to strike up coversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know some of those women have lost a child to gun violence,
I can't imagine the pain,'' said Borsa, adding, ''But what they
want to do is the wrong thing.''

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Vote as Fighting Rages  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- As a border war with Eritrea raged
on in the background, Ethiopians voted Sunday in their second-ever
general election, a ballot marked by violence when security forces
reportedly opened fire on protesters. Seven people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition party leader said government forces threw a
grenade into a protesting crowd in Hadiya, a southern region where
opposition to the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front is strong. Five people were killed in that
explosion and two others when police opened fire on another crowd,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyene Petros, chairman of the Southern Ethiopia People's
Democratic Coalition said the fighting was triggered by ruling
party supporters posing as electoral officials and filling ballot
boxes with false votes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to obtain immediate comment on the report
from police, government officials or ruling party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the third day of the latest flare-up in the border
war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and both sides traded
counterclaims and insults.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said Sunday it has killed or injured 25,200 Ethiopians
since the fighting began Friday morning, a claim Ethiopian
government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse called ''a ridiculous
statement right before defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia made no claims of Eritrean casualities Sunday, but the
two sides frequently offer wildly varying numbers that cannot be
confirmed. Neither side has ever reported on its own casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Taddesse said late Sunday that Ethiopian troops had captured
several strategic areas around the Mereb River, which runs between
the two countries, and that the air force had attacked positions
inside Eritrea for the second day running. Eritrean spokesman
Yemane Gebremeskel could not be reached immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The reports came two days after a U.N. Security Council
delegation left the region empty-handed after trying to get the two
countries to begin implementing a peace agreement each has already
accepted. Eritrea wants a cease-fire first; Ethiopia does not.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which broke out in May 1998, is ostensibly about the
two nations' poorly demarcated, 620-mile border. But observers say
it is more a playing out of political rivalries and tensions
between the two countries, who fought a 30-year guerrilla war until
1993, when Eritrea gained independence from its much larger
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say the fighting resembles battles in World
War I, when waves of soldiers poured out of trenches and into enemy
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The war is not considered to be a factor in elections. All seats
in the federal, 548-seat parliament, the nine regional assemblies
and the two city councils were theoretically up for a vote Sunday.
However, the opposition did not run candidates for every seat and
residents in one region -- Ogaden -- did not vote because residents
there are dealing with widespread drought and food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ethiopia's first general elections in May 1995, no
international observers watched voting Sunday. Mesfin Oldemariam of
the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, which did monitor the process,
said it was too early to say whether there had been any abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Aklilu Mekuria, an official with the National Election Board,
said voting had gone well and that turnout was about 90 percent.
Reporters, however, saw little evidence of a large turnout among
the 20 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both the election board and the human rights group said they
would issue reports this week.
</P>
<P>
   The board initially said that results from individual polling
stations, where voters stuffed their ballots in square olive drab
canvas bags, would be made public Monday. But Aklilu said Sunday it
was more likely an official count would be announced June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian state radio said a demonstration was planned in the
capital Monday to express indignation against the United States and
Britain for their role in sponsoring a U.N. resolution last week
that gave the two countries 72 hours to stop fighting or face
possible sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Evacuated Moms in N.M. Fight Tears  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   POJOAQUE, N.M. (AP) -- For some of the women forced from their
homes by the Los Alamos wildfire, Mother's Day was an occasion for
gratitude and relief. But Andrea Woodward was fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day a year ago, she underwent a total hysterectomy.
This year, she spent the day with her husband and three children at
an emergency shelter, staggered by the loss of their home in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's two bad Mother's Days in a row,'' she said. ''I just deal
with it and go on -- but this has to be the toughest of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards moved to Los Alamos from Montana in 1998 after
Andrea's husband, Glen, received a five-year contract to dig wells.
They are unsure what sort of housing they will obtain to replace
their three-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos is going to be our home,'' she said. ''This is just
kind of a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   When the evacuation order came last week, there was no time to
gather belongings. Family keepsakes were left behind, included the
treasured ring of an aunt who died last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids took one stuffed animal each,'' Mrs. Woodward said.
''They wanted to take everything, but there just wasn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   For mothers whose houses survived intact, Sunday was a happier
day. In fact, 86-year-old Marjorie Shaner, a great-grandmother,
said she felt pampered by volunteers staffing the emergency center
at Pojoaque High School, about 15 miles from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting more attention than I would at home,'' she joked,
gesturing to flowers, a pillow and a teddy bear received as gifts
and placed beside the cot she has slept on since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been very kind,'' she said. ''You couldn't ask for
nicer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Vases of red roses bedecked the tables where evacuees enjoyed a
turkey dinner. Hanging on a wall were Mother's Day cards, complete
with creative spelling, prepared by local schoolchildren: ''I'm
realy sorry your house burnd down,'' wrote Alyssa.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki Mang cheerfully struggled at the Pojoaque shelter to keep
track of four children ranging from 8-year-old Zachary to little
Connor, who will turn 2 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm worried about is where we're going to celebrate his
birthday,'' Mang said.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal Mother's Day, her husband, Joe, would be preparing
meals for her, but she readily excused him Sunday. A physicist at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, he was spending the day in the
evacuated town using his computer skills to help compile a database
of fire damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll celebrate Father's Day as Mother's Day,'' Jacki Mang
said.
</P>
<P>
   She had been reconciled to a day without special treats, and was
delightedly surprised when Zachary surfaced with a custom-made
card, masterminded by some aid workers, that included a snapshot of
him and the inscription, ''To Mom, from Hot Shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The family felt fortunate because their house was intact, even
though a home less than 100 yards away was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing that's struck me is how the community has
responded,'' Mrs. Mang said. ''Everywhere we go, people have been
so generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Terri Abeln, both metallurgists at the Los Alamos
laboratory, joined in the turkey dinner with their children,
Chelsea, 13, and Ben, 11.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal Mother's Day, said Mrs. Abeln, ''I'd be drinking
mimosas, and being waited on hand and foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband grimaced playfully.
</P>
<P>
   ''I usually cook for her all day,'' he said. ''I'll probably get
nailed next weekend.''

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills One in Costa Rica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a crowd of
university students celebrating college week, killing one and
injuring five.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Reyes, 26, died in the attack late Saturday, while five
others, between the ages of 17 and 23, were injured and taken to a
local hospital, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting appeared to be in retaliation for a
group that hurled beer cans, sticks and rocks at a car of four
young men who drove by the University of Costa Rica, where students
were dancing and drinking in the streets as part of the school's
traditional weeklong bash held each year.
</P>
<P>
   The car returned hours later and one of the passengers opened
fire on the crowd, witnesses said. Police are still looking for the
assailants.

<HEADLINE> Derby Champ To Run the Preakness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Kentucky Derby champion Fusaichi Pegasus will
run in the Preakness, trainer Neil Drysdale said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale committed his horse to the middle jewel of horse
racing's Triple Crown after flying in from Churchill Downs to
inspect the racing surface and stables at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said he was being cautious because he was unfamiliar
with the track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here once in the Preakness Barn,'' Drysdale said, ''I
think it was for the Dixie Handicap and the horse didn't run very
well. That's probably why I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale also eschewed the accommodations traditionally reserved
for the Derby champion, deciding to keep Fusaichi Pegasus out of
the Preakness Barn altogether
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the horse will stay in Barn 7, on the backstretch,
about three furlongs away from his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bit more room, and it's the quietest part,''
Drysdale explained.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Fusaichi Pegasus appears to be in good shape
and has gained back the weight he lost in his 1{-length Derby
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus remained at Churchill Downs, where he was
expected to have a final workout Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said he plans to ship the horse to Baltimore on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Preakness competitors were working out at Pimlico on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope was feisty in his morning exercise, bucking and
jumping as he came off the track after jogging a mile and galloping
1{ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rose, the trainer for the Derby's 16th-place finisher,
said he looked as if he wanted more of a workout than he got.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield galloped 1{ miles. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas said he
planned another workout early Monday for his horse, who finished
15th in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet walked Sunday morning in the Preakness Barn after a
five-furlong workout Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 10, Orioles 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Darren Lewis and Brian Daubach homered as the
Boston Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East, beating Mike
Mussina and the Baltimore Orioles 10-1 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's season-high fifth straight victory boosted the Red Sox
past the New York Yankees, the first time they've stood alone atop
the division since last June 8. It also completed Boston's first
four-game sweep in Baltimore since 1977,
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (3-2) allowed one run in five innings and the bullpen
did the rest in Boston's eighth consecutive win over Baltimore. The
Red Sox outscored the Orioles 35-6 in the series, allowing only two
runs in the final three games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh straight loss for the Orioles, who last
dropped a four-game series at home against Boston on June 20-23,
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (1-5) allowed three runs and six hits, including two
home runs, in seven innings. Off to the worst start of his career,
the Orioles' ace has yielded 14 homers this season compared to 16
all last year.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander was once again victimized by a lack of support.
Baltimore has averaged 2.9 runs in his nine starts and 6.1 runs in
its other 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was nursing a 2-1 lead before Daubach led off the sixth
with his eighth home run, a 408-foot shot to center.
</P>
<P>
   After Mussina left, the Red Sox pulled away with a seven-run
eighth. B.J. Ryan issued three straight walks and was removed with
a 2-0 count on Mike Stanley. Jose Mercedes finished the walk,
forcing in a run, and Donnie Sadler bounced a three-run double
under the glove of second baseman Mark Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman followed with an RBI single, his ninth hit in the
series, Darren Lewis singled before Trot Nixon hit a two-run
triple.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis put the Red Sox up 1-0 in the first with a drive
that barely cleared the left-field wall, his first home run since
June 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore fourth, 41-year-old Harold Baines singled with
two outs and was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a
double by Jeff Conine.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 2-0 in the fifth when Sadler hit a two-out bloop
double and scored on a single by Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got a run in their half when Rose walked Mike
Bordick with the bases loaded, but B.J. Surhoff followed with a
short fly and Albert Belle did the same on a 3-2 count.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last Baltimore starter to earn a win was Mussina on
April 29. ... Boston OF Carl Everett missed a third straight start
with a hamstring injury. ... Baltimore has lost 11 of 12 and is
5-17 since April 22. ... Boston is 15-3 when scoring first. ... The
Red Sox lowered their AL-best ERA to 3.46.

<HEADLINE> Mourning's Misses Hurt Heat  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With the game on the line, Alonzo Mourning
failed to come through from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, the Miami Heat's lone consistent threat on offense all
day, managed to put the ball through the net often, using baseline
jumpers, slick inside moves and even a spinning, half-hook while
being fouled.
</P>
<P>
   He was harassed by New York's Patrick Ewing, Marcus Camby and
Kurt Thomas and still topped all players Sunday with 27 points and
14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But late in Game 5 of Miami's annual playoff wrestling match
against the Knicks, Mourning missed three straight of what should
be the easiest shots in basketball -- free throws -- and the Knicks
held on for a 91-83 victory, tying the best-of-seven series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have got to make plays. I have got to put the ball in the
hole,'' Mourning said. ''I missed three free throws down the
stretch. That is very unacceptable, just got to put it in the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning took a long breather at the start of the fourth
quarter, but when he returned from the bench with 7:34 left he
immediately was beaten on the boards twice at the defensive end.
After a miss by Allan Houston, Thomas kept the ball alive and his
errant shot was tipped in by Camby to put New York up 78-70.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after missing one of two foul shots with 5:13 to play and
the score 80-72, Zo's woes from the line became even more critical.
</P>
<P>
   While New York went more than two minutes without a basket,
Miami pulled within 84-79 and Mourning was fouled on consecutive
trips down the court.
</P>
<P>
   But he went 1-for-2 with 3:39 left and missed two more foul
shots with 2:28 left. The second foul shot barely grazed the front
of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reprise of the foul-shooting problems Mourning and
Miami experienced in a Game-2 loss at home, when he missed six of
13 and the Heat went 19-for-33 overall. That prompted Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy to jokingly praise his players' free-throw defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning also offset his own scoring with nine turnovers,
including a pair of 3-second violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nine turnovers is not acceptable at all, especially when you
are trying to win a playoff series against a tough-minded defensive
team,'' Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   His was part of a generally sloppy performance by the Heat,
whose 19 turnovers led to 28 points for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just gave them gifts constantly,'' Mourning said. ''We
pretty much gave them the game with our careless mistakes. I take
full responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slew of accolades in his seven-year NBA career,
including All-Star team selections, defensive player of the year
honors, and finishing second a year ago in the league MVP voting,
Mourning has yet to lead his team to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for that has been the Knicks, who have eliminated
the Heat from the playoffs each of the past two seasons, and
Mourning is a bit weary of that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we go again, win one game, lose one game,'' he said.
''Why can't we get to a level of consistency? Why does it always,
you know, come down to a dogfight game with these guys? Why can't
we just pull away?''

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Bombing Injures 9 Civilians  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Iraqi military said Sunday that recent
U.S. and British airstrikes had hit a southern residential
neighborhood and injured nine civilians, including a 3-year-old
boy, according to the official news agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Central Command in Miami, Fla., confirmed Saturday's
strikes at Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery sites in southern Iraq,
and said they'd been launched in response to anti-aircraft fire
against coalition aircraft on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi News Agency report, which cited an unidentified Iraqi
Air Defense spokesman, did not specify the exact location of
targets hit. It said only that they were residential areas and
civil installations.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein met Saturday night with some air
defense fighters, telling them: ''We have the right to shoot down
(allied) warplanes because we are defending our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''America has failed in the face of Iraq, even though it has
rallied all evil powers in the world to its side,'' the news agency
quoted Saddam as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones set up after the 1991
Gulf war to provide aerial protection from government forces for
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. It began
challenging the patrols in December 1998, and allied forces have
responded by firing on Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and radar
installations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Remember Displacement  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Fighting a demolition order, 97-year-old Jamil
Akel said Sunday he would rather be crushed by a bulldozer than let
Israel destroy his Jerusalem home, built to replace a house lost in
the 1948 war that followed Israel's creation.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 52nd anniversary of Israel's creation,
thousands of Palestinians took to the streets to remind Israel that
there will be no peace until the fate of 3.5 million of them who
are refugees is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Marches in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Nablus
commemorating Monday's anniversary of what Palestinians call
al-Nakba, Arabic for ''catastrophe,'' erupted into clashes between
demonstrators and Israeli troops, injuring 13.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations on a final settlement, Israel has said
Palestinian refugees will never be allowed to reclaim homes they
fled or were forced to leave inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Akel said he was forced out of his home in the Palestinian
village of Lifta, now located inside Jerusalem, in the midst of the
1948 fighting. He said he still has the key to his house in Lifta,
where many houses still stand, abandoned or occupied by homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel forced me out of my first home, but I would rather die
in the rubble then leave this home,'' Akel said as he leaned on his
cane and rolled tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   He was ready to fight the planned demolition Sunday of a
two-room extension on his new home in east Jerusalem, but an
Israeli court stayed the demolition order for a month.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, Israel
confiscated land where he and eight other families lived. The land
was later sold to Jerusalem's Hebrew University, Akel said.
</P>
<P>
   The university built three student dormitory buildings in Akel's
backyard, and now is trying to evict him from his current home to
build more dorms, Akel said.
</P>
<P>
   Several phone calls to the Hebrew University seeking comment
were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem municipality said it ordered the demolition
because the Akel family did not have a permit to build the
extension, which was to accommodate Akel's son Nasser's family of
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why can they enjoy seven-story buildings while we can't enjoy
two rooms?'' Akel said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the central Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, 150 Palestinian
refugees from camps near Bethlehem toured three villages they left
behind in 1948, only one of which was still standing. In the
Zakaria village, now an Israeli town, Israeli homeowners refused to
allow the refugees to enter what they said were houses they left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Each side shouted, ''This is my home!''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a rehearsal for our return,'' said 71-year-old
Palestinian refugee Akram Abu Surour, who now lives in Bethlehem's
Deheishe camp.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Palestinians will observe a commercial strike and
sound a two-minute siren marking a moment of silence for the
refugees, a custom apparently borrowed from Israel, which uses the
siren for Holocaust Remembrance Day.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 12, Dodgers 10  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered in his first two at-bats,
tying Mickey Mantle for eighth place on the career list with 536,
and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-10
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Paquette homered in going 5-for-5 with four RBIs. Jim
Edmonds also homered and drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros homered twice for the Dodgers, and Gary Sheffield
and Todd Hundley also connected as the teams combined for a Busch
Stadium record eight homers. The previous mark of seven was set
April 9 when the Cardinals hit six and the Brewers one.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tied a season high with 17 hits and avoided a
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire passed Jimmie Foxx with his 13th homer of the season and
535th of his career, a two-run shot off a 2-2 hanging curveball
from Carlos Perez in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and McGwire hit consecutive homers in the second, with
McGwire sending a 1-0 curve from Perez into the upper deck in left.
McGwire's shot wrapped around the foul pole and was estimated at
487 feet, the longest homer at Busch this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Edmonds have homered six times in the same game,
including Edmonds' last five homers. The Cardinals have hit
back-to-back homers 12 times, two shy of the NL record set by
Colorado in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals ended a three-game losing streak, but the Dodgers
made it close after trailing 7-0 after two innings and 9-3 after
four.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen allowed six runs on eight hits in
4 1-3 innings. Perez (3-2) lasted only 1 2-3 innings, surrendering
seven runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Dodgers got was 9-8 after Sheffield hit his 12th
homer, a two-run shot, off Heathcliff Slocumb (1-2) in the sixth.
The Cardinals answered with three runs in the bottom of the sixth,
with Paquette driving in his fourth run on his fourth hit and Mike
Matheny adding a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Paquette, who set a career high for hits, and Edmonds each made
elusive slides on close plays at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the gap to 12-10 on Hundley's 10th homer and an
RBI double by pinch-hitter Dave Hansen in the seventh off Mike
James.
Notes: McGwire has 63 career multihomer games, tied with Willie
Mays for second on the career list. Babe Ruth is the leader with
72. ... Hundley has homered in six of his last seven starts. ...
Perez has lost his last four decisions against the Cardinals,
allowing 14 earned runs in 14 innings.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Vows Opposition Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government announced a
major crackdown Sunday on the country's main opposition groups,
accusing them of masterminding the slaying of a top official in
President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist party -- on behalf
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bosko Perosevic, 43, head of the Vojvodina
provincial government and chief of a Socialist party branch there,
was shot and killed while visiting a trade fair, the government
claimed the anti-government student organization Otpor and the
opposition Serbian Renewal Movement party were behind the attack
and would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ''All who perform activities against the state will be treated
in accordance with the law and prevented. The time of their street
actions is over,'' Yugoslavia's Information Minister Goran Matic
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said in a statement they were ''beyond doubt'' that the
suspected gunman, Milivoj Gutovic, 50, was an activist with Otpor
and the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency Sunday
said ''posters and propaganda material of Otpor and of Serbian
Renewal Movement, as well as brochures on terrorism'' were found in
Gutovic's home.
</P>
<P>
   Gutovic, a longtime security guard at the Novi Sad exhibition
venue, allegedly approached Perosevic at an agricultural fair
Saturday, pressed a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. He was
taken into custody immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have denied the allegations and any connection with
the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement expressed condolences to
Perosevic's family and called Gutovic ''a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic also claimed the NATO countries who launched a 78-day air
attack against Yugoslavia last year were behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (slaying) was not the work of a single maniac, but an
organized murder with a deep political background, with the aim to
destabilize Yugoslavia,'' Matic told reporters Sunday. ''We are
faced with a concept of active destabilization of Yugoslavia by the
same who carried out armed aggression against our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The government appeared ready to crack down on the rising
dissent in Yugoslavia, a country which is impoverished and isolated
after more than decade of Milosevic's rule and losing three wars,
as well as virtual control of the Kosovo province to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said a number of arrests had been made already in
connection with the slaying, but declined to specify how many.
Asked if opposition activists who are expected to hold a rally in
Belgrade Monday would face arrest, Matic said: ''That is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic personally attended a Sunday memorial for
Perosevic, along with about 200 officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NATO aggressors are now putting their weapons in the hands
of their servants here, to do for them the dirty job, to spread
fear and chaos,'' said Gorica Gajevic, Secretary General of the
Socialists, in a speech at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Gajevic called Otpor ''ordinary NATO mercenaries'' and promised
''Serbia will fight against them just as it fought back against any
other evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor activists in Belgrade and Novi Sad called the government's
comments an attempt by Milosevic's regime to halt their popular
anti-government protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a thorn in their side, they are trying to break us with
this, but we will not give up our demands'' for democracy and free
elections, said Miroslav Kecman, an Otpor activist.
</P>
<P>
   He added that at least one Otpor activist had been called by
Novi Sad police for questioning. Earlier Sunday an independent
radio reporter and a member of the Serbian Renewal Movement were
also detained in Novi Sad for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   An Otpor activist in Belgrade, Ivan Marovic, told the Associated
Press that a number of the groups' activists have been arrested in
several Serbian towns, but some were released after lengthy
questioning.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Islamic Party Elects Leader  </HEADLINE>
By AYLA JEAN YACKLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The leader of Turkey's Islamic party was
re-elected Sunday, narrowly beating back a challenge from young
reformers who are calling on the party to concentrate more on
social issues and less on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Recai Kutan, the 69-year-old chairman of the Virtue Party, won
633 votes, 112 more than his challenger, Abdullah Gul.
</P>
<P>
   Gul, 50, had campaigned on the promise to concentrate more on
social welfare policies and less on pro-Islamic rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But Kutan is the ideological successor to Necmettin Erbakan, a
former prime minister who stepped down in 1997 under pressure from
the military. The military regards itself as the guardian of
secularism in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic movement has seen its share of the national vote
fall from 21 percent just a few years ago to 15 percent in the last
election. That drop has come amid intense pressure from the
military, which has repeatedly said that it regards political Islam
as one of the greatest dangers to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is 99 percent Muslim, but the state is secular. The
powerful military has seized power three times since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's leadership vote was the first in the party's 30-year
history. Erbakan ran the party for three decades, but was banned
from politics for five years after the military pressured him to
leave office. Kutan then took over the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Kutan has said his party should continue to embrace Islam as its
defining principle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turkey needs a virtuous democracy,'' Kutan told the crowd of
10,000 party members. ''It needs strong welfare. And it needs
freedom, where people are not forbidden to raise their children the
way they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Gul, who was condemned by some party leaders for entering the
race, said: ''If we want Turkey to move closer to democracy, we
must be more democratic. If we are to criticize Turkey, we must be
able to criticize ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Activist Boesak To Appeal Conviction  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- On the eve of beginning a
three-year jail sentence for fraudulently using aid money,
disgraced anti-apartheid hero Allan Boesak said he would appeal his
convictions in constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not guilty as charged and will therefore continue to
explore any and all avenues in pursuit of final justice,'' he said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was his first public appearance since an
appeals court on Friday upheld convictions on three charges of
stealing aid money donated to his Foundation for Peace and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak claimed his conviction was linked to the prominent role
he played in fighting apartheid. He is a former senior leader of
the African National Congress, which took power in all-race
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is deeply regrettable that because of who I am and my role
in the struggle, this trial has been fatally politicized,'' he
said. ''I will be entering prison as an innocent man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Boesak, a church minister of mixed race, headed
the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and helped found the
anti-apartheid United Democratic Front. He organized protest
marches, was thrown in jail and later traveled the world to
highlight apartheid's injustices.
</P>
<P>
   A probe was ordered after evidence suggested that money Boesak
raised to help disadvantaged children and others was going into his
own pockets and financing a jet-set lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak said he would hand himself over to the police on Monday
morning to begin serving his sentence at Pollsmoor Prison. During
apartheid, Boesak led marches to that prison to call for the
release of former President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by family, friends and supporters, a somber Boesak said
the aid organization he ran -- the Foundation for Peace and Justice
-- was never a charity, but a front for the ANC and other
organizations fighting apartheid, and that donors knew this. The
money includes a donation by singer Paul Simon.

<HEADLINE> 'Friends' Cast Back for 2 More Yrs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC will keep its ''Friends'' for two more
years, but the six actors who star in the sitcom will be getting a
lot more money to hang around the coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations with Warner Brothers Television that ended in
the predawn hours on Sunday, the actors agreed to return for $20
million per year each, according to executives close to the talks
who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt
LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer will be getting a big
raise from the reported $125,000 they made for each of the 22
episodes this season.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came a day before NBC was to present its fall schedule
to advertisers in New York. The network had imposed a deadline of 3
p.m. EDT on Sunday to get an agreement, or it was prepared to
announce a schedule without ''Friends'' in its customary slot on
Thursdays at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Losing ''Friends'' would have been a major blow to NBC, which
has had trouble developing new comedies and seen its Thursday
dominance somewhat eroded by ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, negotiators beat the deadline by about 12 hours. The
actors reached the deal with Warner Bros., the studio that produces
the show.
</P>
<P>
   The six ''Friends'' will be paid $750,000 per episode for each
year. They were also given a greater percentage of the profits from
the sitcom's lucrative syndication deals, giving them each a total
of $40 million over two years, executives said on Sunday. The stars
had reportedly been demanding $1 million each per episode to return
-- a sum NBC paid Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser for the final year of
''Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Friends' is one of the best written, produced and directed
shows on television. We are thrilled and excited to continue,'' the
actors said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The show finishes its sixth season with a one-hour special this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled to have our No. 1 sitcom on Thursday nights
again in September,'' said NBC spokeswoman Shirley Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in television expected the deal to get done at the
last minute. NBC could ill afford to lose one of its most popular
shows, and the actors -- while agreeing to an all-for-one,
one-for-all negotiating strategy -- hadn't expressed any great
desire to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Another off-air cliffhanger will be resolved later this week.
Fox is still uncertain whether ''The X-Files'' will return for
another season.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Probe Results Expected  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- After being vilified in Australia
for the Olympic flame controversy, Kevan Gosper probably would like
nothing more than to escape the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the IOC vice president was forced to apologize for
allowing his 11-year-old daughter to replace another girl as the
first Australian torchbearer for the Sydney Games, prompting an
uproar over perceived Olympic cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Australian newspapers reported Monday that Sydney organizers
have dropped Gosper from all duties related to the torch relay. The
reports came as Gosper awaited the results of an inquiry into
allegations of misconduct stemming from the Salt Lake City bid
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's ethics commission was
investigating whether Gosper violated rules on excessive travel and
hospitality during Salt Lake's winning campaign for the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry centers on a trip, arranged by Salt Lake bidders,
that Gosper's wife and two children made to Utah's Deer Valley ski
resort in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe I'll be found not to have behaved improperly,''
Gosper said Friday. ''I've provided all the information I said I
could to demonstrate it was a private visit and we paid what we
believe was owed.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake records show bidders filed expenses of about $11,000
for the trip. Gosper said he insisted on paying for the vacation
and described the expense claims as fraudulently inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said he and his wife, Judy, traveled to New York a month
ago to face questioning by Martin Lipton, the American lawyer
appointed by the ethics panel to carry out an independent inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I provided them with additional documentation,'' he said.
''It's taken a big effort with the banks. Some documents have been
found. The paper trail is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The key document: a copy of the check made out by his wife for
lodging payment at Deer Valley's Stag Lodge. Gosper said the check
was for less than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake documents showed Gosper thought he was paying all the
expenses, but bid officials were quietly paying part of the costs
and filing two separate sets of invoices. But the files did not
include any record that the Gospers actually made any payment.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who investigated the Salt
Lake scandal, has said Gosper was entrapped in a bookkeeping scam.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, Australia's senior Olympic delegate and one of the IOC's
most powerful members, was dragged into another major controversy
last week.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Sophie, was the first Australian to run with the
Olympic torch after Wednesday's flame lighting ceremony in Greece.
She was selected ahead of a 15-year-old Australian student of Greek
heritage, Yianna Souleles.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper was widely condemned in Australia for what appeared to be
a case of blatant favoritism. He insisted he never sought his
daughter's involvement and only accepted an invitation by the Greek
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper apologized Friday, blaming ''fatherly pride'' for his
''lapse of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper offered to forgo his own leg of the torch relay in
Melbourne -- his home city where he won a silver medal in the
1,600-meter relay at the 1956 Olympics -- and give the spot to
Souleles.
</P>
<P>
   Souleles' school, St. Spyridon College, said Gosper and Souleles
should run the leg together instead.
</P>
<P>
   But Australian media reports said Olympics Minister Michael
Knight had ruled that Gosper would not run with the torch under any
circumstances, and would also be barred from taking part in
ceremonies greeting the torch when it arrives in Guam next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised at this report,'' Gosper told Australia's ABC
radio. ''I don't know where it's come from. If there was to be any
change in my responsibilities, Michael Knight certainly would have
talked with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake and torch relay controversies have dealt a blow to
Gosper's Olympic ambitions. He has long been considered among the
top contenders to succeed IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who
completes his final term in July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've lived with controversy before,'' Gosper said. ''I'll find
my way through it. Storms come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Salt Lake accusations surfaced in January, Gosper
referred the case himself to the eight-member IOC ethics panel. He
had been a founding member of the panel, but resigned in early
March to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the inquiry arose in March when ethics panel
member Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former U.N. Secretary General,
said the delegates believed Gosper was ''totally innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC denied that Perez de Cuellar, who is compiling the final
report on the inquiry, had prejudged the outcome and promised there
would be no whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no conspiracy theory any more,'' IOC spokesman
Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. ''It is very difficult for this to
be quashed without any repercussions. The world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission was created in the wake of the Salt Lake
scandal, which resulted in the expulsion or resignation of 10 IOC
members for accepting cash, lavish gifts, college scholarships and
other inducements.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, made of a majority of non-IOC members, has been
criticized for appearing reluctant to act as a watchdog or to
investigate allegations of past misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The non-IOC members of the panel are Perez de Cuellar; former
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker; former French Justice Minister
Robert Badinter, former Swiss President Kurt Furgler; and former
Australian governor-general Ninian Stephen, who filled the seat
vacated by Gosper.
</P>
<P>
   The panel chairman is Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president and
former World Court justice. The other IOC panel members are Chiharu
Igaya of Japan and Charmaine Crooks of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Expos 16, Cubs 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Henry Rodriguez homered twice and drove in a
career-high seven runs for Chicago, but the Montreal Expos pulled
off an early triple play and a ninth-inning rally to overtake the
Cubs 16-15 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa had five hits and five RBIs for the Cubs. He singled
home a run in the ninth and Rodriguez hit a three-run homer with
two outs for a 15-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos then came back with three runs in the bottom half to
win it.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White hit a tying, two-run homer and pinch-hitter Mike
Mordecai singled home the game-winner. White also doubled twice.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young stole five bases, the most by a Cubs player since
George Gore swiped seven on June 25, 1881. Six Cubs had stolen four
since 1900, most recently Sosa on Sept. 29, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Young stole second in the first inning. He swiped second and
third in both the third and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens, who drove in five runs, Vladimir Guerrero and Andy
Tracy also homered for Montreal, which had 16 hits. Damon Buford
homered for the Cubs, who had 21 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (4-3) got the win despite giving up Rodriguez's
go-ahead home run. Rick Aguilera (1-1) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos turned the 10th triple play in their 32-year history
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and third and the Cubs leading 1-0 on
Sosa's RBI single, Stevens fielded Rodriguez's sharply hit grounder
and stepped on first base for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens threw to shortstop Orlando Cabrera, who tagged Sosa for
the second out. Ricky Gutierrez, who had been on third, was cut
down at the plate by Cabrera's throw to catch Chris Widger,
completing Montreal's first triple play since Sept. 29, 1993,
against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago wasted leads of 1-0, 6-2, 11-9 and 15-13. Montreal blew
margins of 2-1, 9-7 and 13-11 before its final rally. The Expos
also scored four times in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit a two-run homer, his 11th, for a 2-1 lead in the
first. Stevens made a throwing error that helped the Cubs take the
lead in the second, but hit a two-run homer that put the Expos
ahead 6-4 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez went 4-for-6 with a pair of RBI singles. Sosa was
5-for-6 with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy hit his first major league homer, a three-run shot off
Ismael Valdes to cap a five-run fifth that put Montreal ahead 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Making his third start since being activated from the disabled
list, Valdes allowed nine runs on seven hits and six walks in just
3 2-3 innings to see his ERA go from 6.52 to 10.80.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Hideki Irabu allowed six runs on seven hits in 2
1-3 innings and left to a chorus of boos after allowing a one-out
single to Willie Greene in the third. Notes: Just 10,621 were on
hand for the game despite a Mother's Day promotion which allowed
free admission to any mother accompanied by her children. ... Young
stole six bases against Los Angeles while playing for Colorado on
June 30, 1996. ... The Cubs last hit into a triple play April 16,
1999, at Milwaukee. ... Dave Martinez, acquired from Tampa Bay on
Friday, joined the Cubs on Sunday. He did not play. ... Expos
reliever Scott Strickland threw on the side without pain prior to
the game. Strickland, currently on the 15-day disabled list, was
scheduled to fly to Birmingham, Ala., following the game to consult
Dr. James Andrews on Monday for a second opinion on the MRI reading
which detected a tear in his right shoulder.

Mothers Rally for Strict Gun Control

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demanding strict control of handguns, tens of thousands of
mothers rallied in sight of the capitol today memorializing loved ones and
strangers felled by bullets. Participants in the ''Million Mom March'' sought to
send Congress a ''Mother's Day'' message: A new movement of mainstream Americans
is getting politically active, ready to battle the gun lobby and to work against
lawmakers who oppose gun control. ''Politicians, take heed. We are watching you.

base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians
took place in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah. Those clashes began

<HEADLINE> Edwards Shocked by Conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards said he was
amazed when jurors convicted him of extortion last week, and is
horrified by the thought that he might die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the flamboyant 72-year-old doesn't really expect to serve
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legal analysis we're getting is unanimous,'' he said in
Sunday's Baton Rouge Advocate. ''This case is going to be reversed
on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son, Stephen, and three co-defendants were found
guilty Tuesday of rigging riverboat casino licenses. Two other men
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hurt and I'm devastated and all that other business, but
I'm not going to lie down and kick my feet and cry,'' he said.
''But then, I'm not going to sheepishly close my eyes and fold my
arms and placidly go to the slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola has not set a sentencing
date. Since Edwards will turn 73 this summer, even a short sentence
could wind up being a life term.
</P>
<P>
   The only two jurors willing to talk to reporters have said
secretly recorded tapes of Edwards' personal and telephone
conversations helped clinch the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used the tapes to try to show that the Edwards and
others extorted cash from Robert Guidry, the former owner of the
Treasure Chest casino in Kenner, and Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who was
involved in a partnership to land a riverboat in Bossier Parish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that there's any basis for anybody to think
that I did anything at all except help Bobby Guidry and Eddie
DeBartolo,'' Edwards said. ''That's what the tapes show.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided the Edwardses and three others must forfeit
more than $2.5 million as ill-gotten gains from extortion,
racketeering and money laundering. Edwards and his son also could
be fined up to $4.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said his net worth is between $2 million and $3 million,
not the $5.7 million described during trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably just enough to pay the forfeiture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Edwards, 45, is the father of five children, ages two to
17.
</P>
<P>
   ''As awful as it is and horrible the thought of going to prison
at my age, it is even that much worse for someone such as he who
has a family to rear and who depends upon him,'' Edwin Edwards
said.

<HEADLINE> Hamas-Linked Group Sued by Teen Kin  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The parents of an American teen-ager slain on
the West Bank have filed suit in a federal court in Chicago against
Islamic groups and charities, claiming they raised money in the
United States for Hamas, a radical Islamic group that has carried
out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently unprecedented move, Stanley and Joyce Boim,
former New Yorkers who now live in Jerusalem, invoked the federal
anti-terrorism law of 1990 against what their suit described as
Hamas-front organizations and individuals who collected funds in
the United States for relief and development on the West Bank and
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Boims asked for $600 million in damages in what could be the
first effort by individuals to use federal terrorism laws against
what the suit called ''a network of front organizations'' in the
United States that raise money for Islamic causes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the suit contended, the money was channeled to
terrorists and some of it was used to pay for the vehicle, machine
guns and ammunition used to kill the Boims' son David, a
17-year-old yeshiva student who was gunned down in 1996 waiting
with other students at a bus stop in Beit El, on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the two attackers had opened fire on a civilian bus and
injured two passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority apprehended Amjad Hinawi and Khalif
Tawfiq Al-Sharif, described in the court papers as known members of
Hamas' military wing, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hinawi confessed and was tried and convicted by a Palestinian
court in 1997 and sentenced in 1998 to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Al-Sharif was released by Palestinian
authorities and participated in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in
1997 in which five civilians were killed and 192 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups named as defendants were Quranic Literacy
Institute, with offices in Oak Lawn, Ill.; Holy Land Foundation for
Relief and Development, a California corporation with a branch
office in Illinois; and Islamic Association for Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The Quranic institute is said to translate and publish sacred
Islamic texts. The Holy Land foundation claims to conduct a variety
of humanitarian relief and development efforts. The Islamic
association disseminates information on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the defendants is Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, a
native of Gaza who was deported to Jordan in 1997 and then deported
from the kingdom last year when King Abdullah closed the Hamas
political bureau in Amman, and Mohammed Abdul Hamid Khalil Salah,
described as the leader of Hamas'' military branch and a resident
of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone number is listed for a Mohammed Salah in Bridgeview,
Ill., but efforts to reach him were unsuccessful because the number
is not published.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Sunday at the Quranic Literacy Institute in Oak
Lawn, Ill., was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a message left Sunday with the Holy Land Foundation
for Relief and Development branch in Palos Hills, Ill., was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   No listing could be found in Illinois for a branch of the
Islamic Association for Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 88, Trail Blazers 85  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Jazz are getting older but
they're not dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone scored 27 points and John Stockton had 18 as the
Jazz beat the Portland Trail Blazers 88-85 on Sunday, trimming
Utah's deficit in the Western Conference semifinals to 3-1 and
sending the series back to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Portland missed a chance to tie at the buzzer when Greg
Anthony's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The teams play again Tuesday night in Portland, where Utah has
won once in 15 playoff games and lost 13 straight. No team in NBA
history has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers called a timeout to set up a play with 6.7 seconds
remaining. They worked the ball to Steve Smith, who couldn't get
open on the perimeter and fed the ball to Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   His shot was in the air when the horn sounded, and the Jazz
broke into a celebration when it was slightly short.
</P>
<P>
   Utah played with an intensity they lacked earlier in the series,
with the 36-year-old Malone and 38-year-old Stockton displaying the
focus that has made them into the team's leaders for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Olden Polynice, 35, got into the act, scoring 12 points and
collecting 11 rebounds as the Jazz avoided being swept for the
first time in franchise history. Bryon Russell added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Utah guard Jeff Hornacek, facing the final game of his
14-year NBA career if the Jazz had lost, had nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Brian Grant led the Blazers with 20 points and 13
rebounds, while Smith scored 19 points and Rasheed Wallace had 15.
</P>
<P>
   Portland wasn't the well-oiled machine that dominated the Jazz
in the first three games. The Blazers committed 16 turnovers, shot
37.5 percent and led only in the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Portland made it interesting by rallying from a 75-64
third-quarter deficit. Utah led 75-69 entering the fourth quarter
and Malone's turnaround jumper with 6:54 remaining made it 81-73.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers stayed patient. Wallace completed a three-point play
and Grant scored twice inside, pulling Portland within 81-80 and
forcing a Utah timeout with 4:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone hit a 20-footer and two free throws, and Russell
drove the baseline for a dunk to give the Jazz an 87-80 lead with
2:11 to play.
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by Wallace, Grant made two free throws with 38
seconds left, trimming the margin to 87-84. The Blazers caught a
break when Polynice was called for a foul after a miss by Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made one of two free throws at the other end, pulling
Portland within 87-85 with 14 seconds remaining. The Blazers
stopped the clock by fouling Armen Gilliam, who made one of two
free throws with 6.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wallace, who set an NBA record with 38 technical fouls in
the regular season, got his second of the playoffs for arguing with
referee Joe DeRosa in the third quarter. ... Since Game 2 of the
1998 NBA Finals, Utah's playoff record is 10-15, including 8-5 at
the Delta Center. ... Polynice and Scottie Pippen were separated
during a first-quarter flap that resulted in double technicals. ...
Hornacek, who hit an NBA-leading 95 percent of his foul shots in
the regular season, was 1-of-3 from the line. ... Rod Hundley, the
only radio broadcaster the New Orleans and Utah Jazz have had,
missed Sunday's game to receive his diploma at West Virginia. The
No. 1 pick in the 1957 NBA draft, he left school 30 hours short of
graduating.

<HEADLINE> Padres 3, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Arizona's team-record winning streak ended at
nine as Brian Meadows pitched eight strong innings Sunday to give
the San Diego Padres a 3-1 victory over the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres stopped their eight-game losing string.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack hit a leadoff home run on Meadows' second pitch of
the game. Steve Finley singled with one out and Arizona went on to
load the bases, but Meadows escaped when Damian Miller flied out.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks did not get another hit the rest of the game
off Meadows (4-3) and Trevor Hoffman, who got his sixth save.
Arizona's only two runners after the first inning came on a walk
and an error.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had lost six straight games against Arizona this
season. The victory was only the Padres' third in 18 games overall.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (1-4) dueled Meadows before erratic defense cost him.
He allowed three runs, one earned, on four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took the lead with three runs in the sixth, helped by
two errors.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera reached on Womack's errant throw from shortstop and
Ed Sprague followed with a run-scoring double. Phil Nevin also
doubled for a 2-0 lead, and he later scored when third baseman
Lenny Harris let a ground ball by Wiki Gonzalez go through his
legs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Daal came away without a victory over the Padres despite an
outstanding outing for the second time this season. On April 11,
Daal allowed two runs on eight hits in nine innings, getting a
no-decision when Sprague's leadoff homer in the ninth sent the game
into extra innings. ... The Padres beat Arizona for just fourth
time in their last 21 meetings. ... Nevin was hit in the right
shoulder by a line drive off the bat of teammate John Roskos in the
sixth. inning. Nevin, leading off third base in foul territory,
couldn't get out of the way of the low liner, but stayed in the
game.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Wins Italian League Title  </HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lazio of Rome vaulted past Juventus of Turin on the final day of
the season to win the Italian League for only the second time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Juventus by two points, Lazio beat Reggina 3-0 Sunday
at Olympic Stadium in Rome while Juventus of Turin lost 1-0 at
Perugia in a rain-delayed game that ended about an hour after the
other eight matches.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio (20-4-9), which won its other title in 1974, finished with
72 points, one ahead of Juventus (21-5-8), which had lost just once
in the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio led during most of the 1998-99 season but was overtaken by
AC Milan with one game remaining and finished second. This season,
Lazio trailed by as many as nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Simone Inzaghi (33rd minute) and Juan Sebastian Veron (37th)
converted first-half penalty kicks for Lazio, and Diego Simeone
scored in the 59th.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at Olympic Stadium listened on radios to the game at
Perugia, where water in the parking lot was higher than car tires.
Play was delayed at halftime, and referee PierLuigi Collina watched
as the ball was bounced on the soggy field as he debated whether to
continue the game.
</P>
<P>
   Juventus, whose 25 Italian League titles are the most of any
team, fell behind when Alessandro Calori scored five minutes into
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Juventus forward Filippo Inzaghi -- the elder brother of Lazio's
Simone -- missed a clear scoring chance in second-half injury time,
which would have given Juventus a tie a berth in a title playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Juventus' defeat was cheered by thousands of Lazio fans who had
stayed on at Rome's Olympic stadium waiting for the outcome of the
Perugia match.
</P>
<P>
   The most fanatic Lazio supporters had demonstrated in front of
the soccer federation headquarters, clashing with rot police, a few
days ago to protest alleged help received by Juventus in last
weekend's game against Parma. Juventus won 1-0 after the referee
voided a late goal by Parma.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Juventus played the last 18 minutes a man short after
Gianluca Zambrotta received a pair of yellow cards in a five-minute
span. It was a replay of 1976, when Juventus lost at Perugia on the
final day as Torino won the title.
</P>
<P>
   AC Milan (16-5-13) beat Udinese 4-0 and finished third with 61
points, joining Lazio and Juventus in next season's European
Champions Cup. Internazionale of Milan (17-10-7) and Parma
(16-8-10) tied for fourth with 58 points apiece and will meet in a
playoff for Italy's final Champions Cup berth.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina and AS Roma earned UEFA Cup berths. Torino, Venezia,
Cagliari and Piacenza were relegated the second division.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds (21-11-6) clinched England's third and final place in next
season's Champions Cup with a scoreless tie at West Ham and will
join Manchester United (28-3-7), the English League champion, and
second-place Arsenal (22-9-7).
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool, which needed a victory to have any chance of
finishing third, lost 1-0 at Bradford City and finished in fourth
with 67 points. Liverpool qualified for next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon lost 2-0 at Southampton and was relegated to the first
division on the final weekend of the season. Wimbledon had been at
the top level for 14 straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield Wednesday and Watford also were relegated, while
Charlton and Manchester City were promoted and will be joined by
Birmingham, Barnsley, Ispwich or Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   Deportivo de La Coruna (20-11-6) missed a chance to clinch its
first Spanish League title, playing a scoreless tie against Racing
de Santander.
</P>
<P>
   Second-place Barcelona (19-12-6), which trails by three points
with one game remaining, played a scoreless tie against Real
Sociedad.
</P>
<P>
   Deportivo is at Espanol (12-14-11) next week, while Barcelona
finishes at home against Celta de Vigo (15-15-7).
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Thordur Gudjonsson scored two second-half goals as
Racing Genk rallied a 4-1 victory over Standard Liege in the
Belgian Cup final, earning a UEFA Cup berth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, Feyenoord of Rotterdam played a 1-1 tie
against FC Twente and clinched a berth in the qualifying rounds for
the Champions Cup. Dutch champion PSV Eindhoven and SC Heerenveen
have the other places.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting Lisbon beat Salgueiros 4-0 to win the Portuguese
championship for the first time in 18 years and end FC Porto's
five-year reign.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Rep.'s Son May Have Shot Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENOMINEE, Mich. (AP) -- The 17-year-old son of Rep. Bart Stupak,
D-Mich., died early Sunday, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Bartholomew Stupak Jr. was found shortly after 10
a.m. at the family's home. The initial investigation indicates the
teen-ager shot himself, Menominee police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope that the media would respect the need for
Congressman Stupak, his wife, Laurie, and their son Ken to have
some privacy in this hour of family crisis,'' said Bob Meissner,
spokesman for the four-term representative.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said Stupak was in Michigan over the weekend. Laurie
Stupak is the mayor of Menominee, an Upper Peninsula town on
Michigan's border with Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Menominee High School officials said school will be in session
Monday with grief counselors available.
</P>
<P>
   Stupak gained national attention in June when he was among 31
Democrats who got donations from the National Rifle Association
within the previous two years but the only one to vote against an
NRA-backed amendment to loosen background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   With that vote, Stupak broke with his traditionally pro-gun
voting record to favor the same background checks at gun shows that
exist at licensed gun shops.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Captives Turned Over  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared rebels
handed over 18 captive U.N. peacekeepers Sunday, but the rebels
also reportedly attacked a key highway junction east of the capital
as clashes continued in the nation's reignited civil war.
</P>
<P>
   David Wimhurst, a U.N. spokesman in Freetown said the captives --
11 Indian troops and seven unarmed military observers of various
nationalities -- were released to U.N. soldiers from India based in
the eastern town of Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
   The handover did not mean those peacekeepers were entirely safe.
Rebels continued to surround the U.N. peacekeeping contingent in
Kailahun, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the U.N. force, Vijay Jetley, said the freed
captives were in good physical condition and had not been harmed by
the rebels. ''This gives us a glimmer of hope for the future,''
Jetley said of the releases.
</P>
<P>
   The released peacekeepers were among more than 500 members of a
U.N. force who were disarmed and taken into custody by the
Revolutionary United Front rebels when they ended a 10-month peace
and restarted Sierra Leone's civil war earlier this month. Speaking
on condition of anonymity, a U.N. official said 486 U.N. staff
members, including 435 Zambians, were still believed to be
detained.
</P>
<P>
   In their eight-year campaign against various governments, the
RUF rebels have killed tens of thousands and intentionally
mutilated and dismembered many more men, women and children in a
bid to gain power through intimidation. Last July, they signed a
peace deal giving rebel leaders top government posts and amnesty
for war atrocities. The U.N. peacekeepers were sent to Sierra Leone
to oversee that peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels damaged the accord by taking peacekeepers
hostage. Then, a week ago, they opened fire on unarmed
demonstrators outside rebel chief Foday Sankoh's home. Thirteen
civilians and six soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, thousands of residents of towns near the
capital have fled into Freetown, fearing renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, rebels and pro-government forces battled for control
of Masiaka town, a key road junction some 30 miles east of the
capital, U.N. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
By noon, government troops retook the town for the second time in
24 hours, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile pro-government alliance includes ex-junta soldiers
once allied to the RUF rebels and ragtag traditional hunter
militiamen known as Kamajors. After both its victories on Saturday
and Sunday, the troops staged raucous celebrations, arguing among
themselves and firing guns in the air, said journalists traveling
with the troops. No civilians were visible in the town.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Britain, Sierra Leone's former colonial
ruler, reaffirmed that its troops would not get sucked into the
civil war. Britain has contributed some 700 paratroopers, but only
to help U.N. peacekeepers, pro-government militiamen and ex-army
soldiers protect the airport and organize a defense of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The British mission was originally intended to evacuate its
expatriates from Freetown. That goal has been largely accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Guthrie, Britain's chief of Defense Staff, flew
into Freetown on Sunday from Senegal to evaluate the British
mission, saying its objective was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job here is to evacuate people, to secure this airfield
and though we are not part of the United Nations (peacekeeping
force), to give help to U.N. forces,'' Guthrie said. He declined to
answer questions about whether the British were preparing for a
possible offensive role.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Freetown have pleaded with the British troops
to stay. The British contingent has given pro-government forces
confidence that they have a safe rear guard in Freetown against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United Nations, they really let us down. But with the
British we are safe,'' said Michael Cesay, a security guard at a
Freetown church.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, told CNN in New
York there was no firm timetable for the British troops to pull
out. The paratroopers were waiting for U.N. reinforcements from
India, Bangladesh and Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. David Richards, the commander of British forces in Sierra
Leone, said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview that
government forces appeared to be regaining momentum over the
rebels. Sankoh seemed unable to control his rebel fighters,
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards estimated the RUF's fighting force at 5,000-10,000 men,
adding: ''They are bullies really, and a good, sharp rap over the
knuckles tends to send them away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN interview, Greenstock blamed greed and the desire to
control the lucrative diamond trade for fueling wars in Sierra
Leone and other African countries. ''In these cases, diamonds are a
state's worst friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sierra Leone's Justice Minister and Attorney
General Solomon Berewa accused Sankoh of striking illegal deals
with international diamond firms, including one in South Africa, in
return for military supplies to equip his rebel movement.

<HEADLINE> Arlington Racetrack Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By MARIO FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- Arlington International
Racecourse reopened Sunday after a 2-year shutdown, resuming
thoroughbred racing for a 103-day run after increasing purses and
spending nearly $10 million for renovations.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mother's Day and roses were handled out to the first
10,000 moms. Gov. George Ryan headed the list of politicians and
other dignitaries on hand. The track's row of executive suites,
reserved seats and reservations for its restaurants were sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many of our supporters came out today. I couldn't be
happier,'' track owner Richard L. Duchossois said. ''We are hoping
for a wonderful future for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 35,273 was off the opening day attendance record of
40,483 in 1992 when it was also Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening is a boon for local trainers and jockeys who have
been racing at Sportsman's Park and Hawthorne Racecourse, nearby
tracks which aren't in the same league as Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to be back. It's been more than two years and I've
missed Arlington a lot,'' Chicago trainer Mickey Goldfine said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big day for jockey Mark Guidry, who posted consecutive
victories 2{ years apart. He won the track's last race on Oct. 10,
1997, aboard Kark's Ark, and the first race Sunday on Fire and Ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, this one will be the first of many this summer,''
said Guidry, who rode two other winners Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were many women and children in the crowd as Arlington
tries to make itself friendly to families on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love everything here -- the horses, the clubhouse, the
flowers,'' said Louise Frawley of Arlington Heights, who was at the
track with her son and daughter-in-law. ''My only complaint is it's
too crowded.''

   Arlington shut down two years ago, citing unfair competition
from riverboat casinos in the region. But a deal was worked out
with other racing interests, lawmakers and casino operators to make
thoroughbred racing more competitive with the riverboats -- even
giving it a big slice of profits from a new casino targeted for
Rosemont.

<P>
   The track also overcame a last-minute threat of a strike from
pari-mutuel clerks when a contract settlement was reached
Wednesday.

<P>
   Now, the question is how to keep the fans coming back.

<P>
   ''That's a million-dollar question. But we have got to keep up
the excitement and keep them happy,'' Duchossois said.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Beat Slovaks for Gold  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- By beating up on a neighbor, the
Czech Republic asserted its superiority over the world's hockey
elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs won their second consecutive World Hockey
Championship by defeating Slovakia 5-3 Sunday in the gold medal
game.
</P>
<P>
   Finland took the bronze with a 2-1 victory over Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always nice to play them and know we're on top,'' said
Jiri Dopita, a member of the Czech gold medal winning team at the
1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. ''We showed them we have a
little bit better hockey players. We showed them tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   After triumphing at the Olympics two years ago, this win gave
the Czechs consecutive World Championship crowns for the first time
since 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was frustrating for Slovakia, which has never managed
to defeat the Czechs in world championship play since it began
competing as an independent country in 1996 and had hoped to use
the final to finally step out of the bigger nation's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Simply making it to the final was a remarkable accomplishment
for the Slovaks, whose previous best results were a pair of seventh
place finishes the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see in the future if this is a one-year wonder or if
we'll build on it,'' said Slovakian defenseman Ivan Droppa.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs took a 3-0 first-period lead as Michal Sykora, Tomas
Vlasak and Martin Prochazka beat Slovak goalie Jan Lasak, a member
of the Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Strbak scored Slovakia's first goal at 7:43 of the second
period, but Jan Tomajko restored the Czech's three-goal lead 3:35
into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia, however, made a late charge. Miroslav Hlinka scored at
15:22 and, just over two minutes later, Miroslav Satan of the
Buffalo Sabres, with his 10th goal of the tournament, pulled
Slovakia to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichel, who had consecutive 40-goal seasons with the
Calgary Flames from 1992-94, added an insurance goal for the Czechs
in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing we started out strong because we kind of
slacked off in the second period,'' said Czech Vaclac Varada, a
forward for the Buffalo Sabres. ''And we were lucky to get away
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Slovakians felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had played another 10 minutes we would have won this
game,'' said Slovakia's Lubomir Vaic of the Vancouver Canucks. ''We
had a really bad start. We started skating in the second and third
period, but it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the Czechs assumed the
lion's share of the nation's hockey players and, as such, the Czech
Republic was allowed to remain in the A-pool while Slovakia was
forced down the long path of requalification, only reentering the
A-pool five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Slovakian team, which boasted seven NHL players,
went undefeated in the opening round, then suffered a few
second-round bumps before eliminating the highly touted Americans
4-1 in the quarterfinals and Finland 3-1 in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If somebody said before the tournament we would come in
second, we would have laughed,'' Vaic said. ''The second spot is
great for us. It's the best in our history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people will be in the square in Bratislava waiting for us
and partying.''
</P>
<P>
   They were. Crowds in Bratislava's main square of the Slovak
National Uprising celebrated by singing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Marko Tuomainen of the Los Angeles Kings scored the
winning goal as Finland edged Canada for the bronze medal. It
marked the third successive year that Canada left the tournament
without a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to swallow,'' said the Florida Panthers' Mike
Sillinger. ''It's very disappointing leaving with nothing.''

Mothers Rally for Strict Gun Control
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP -- Thousands of mothers who rallied in the ''Million Mom
March'' near the Capitol today to demand strict control of handguns had to share
the day with others. A considerably maller group of several thousand
counter-demonstrators gathered near the Washington Monument to hold a rally
where they argued that guns were needed for self-protection. That demonstration,
organized by a group called Second Amendment Sisters, Inc., also included
mothers who brought their children. The ''Million Mom March'' principally wants
trigger locks to protect children and a national system that would register
handguns and license their owners.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Frustration over stalled negotiations exploded into
violence Sunday as thousands of Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli
troops -- demonstrations that left one Palestinian dead and about 38 people
injured. In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli army
base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians
took place in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah. Those clashes began
as marches marking Monday's 52nd anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe''

Serbian Renewal Movement party were behind the attack and would be punished.

<HEADLINE> Social Democrats Lead German Vote  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats
won a critical vote of approval in Germany's most populous state
Sunday, staving off a reinvigorated Christian Democratic party
still falling short after a corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary official results showed the Social Democrats had
42.8 percent of the vote, down from the 46 percent they received in
the last election in North Rhine-Westphalia five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats received 37 percent of the vote, also
down from the 37.7 percent they last received in the western
industrial state.
</P>
<P>
   The state election is the first since April, when the Christian
Democrats' new leader from former East Germany, Angela Merkel, took
over in the wake of a scandal sparked by former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's admission that he accepted secret -- and so illegal --
campaign contributions, which were never entered into the party's
accounting books.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their loss, Christian Democrats said Sunday's results
were nonetheless positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to match the results from the last vote in a
difficult political situation,'' said Christian Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Juergen Ruettgers. ''We can be proud of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers sparked a national debate with an election campaign
attacking Schroeder's plan to bring in 20,000 high-tech workers
from India and Eastern Europe. He insisted the jobs should go to
retrained Germans -- prompted opponents to accuse Ruettgers of
racism against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   North Rhine-Westphalia has been led for decades by the Social
Democrats, who under Schroeder have sinc 1998 run the federal
government in coalition with the Greens. Many saw the election as a
referendum on the national government.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Democrats were the day's big winners, more than
doubling their result since the last elections, the results showed.
They received 9.8 percent of the vote Sunday -- after failing last
time to clear the 5 percent hurdle required in Germany to
participate in government.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens had 7.1 percent, down from their previous 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Moellemann, state chairman of the Free Democrats, called
on the state's governor, Wolfgang Clement, to negotiate a coalition
with his party rather than stick with a ''coalition of the
losers.'' Greens leaders, however, insisted the governing coalition
would stay together, and Clement also pledged to undertake
''serious'' negotiations with his current coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, the Greens had never been in national government.
That was the same year the Free Democrats were last in federal
government, as the junior partner of the Christian Democrat-led
coalition
</P>
<P>
   Before the Christian Democrats' scandal, discontent over
Schroeder's attempts to wean Germans from their generous social
benefits had led to an embarrassing string of state election losses
for the Social Democrats last year.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Confident Without Miller  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller won't be around for Monday
night's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against
Philadelphia. The Indiana Pacers don't think they'll need him to
beat the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA on Sunday suspended Miller and 76ers center Matt Geiger
for their actions Saturday, when Philadelphia won 92-90 to avoid
elimination in the best-of-seven series. The league also suspended
Geiger for a second game and fined both players and the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done it before,'' Pacers center Rik Smits said Sunday of
winning without Miller. He noted Indiana beat the 76ers in
Philadelphia 92-90 in the final week of the season when both Miller
and starting point guard Mark Jackson sat out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did pretty well in that game, so it is definitely
possible,'' Smits said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just got to take care of business,'' Jackson said.
''This is not to say we're not going to miss him. But we're a very
capable basketball team. The motivation is to put these guys
away.''
</P>
<P>
   No NBA team has ever won a seven-game playoff series after
losing the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Travis Best said the Pacers want to eliminate the 76ers as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to breathe any more life into them,'' Best
said. ''They still have some fight in them. They come to play, and
they play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was clear Saturday. With 1:19 remaining in the third
quarter, Geiger knocked Miller to the floor with his second
flagrant foul of the game against the Pacers' guard. Miller jumped
up and swung an open hand to the face of the 7-foot Geiger, and
both players were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA announced Sunday that in addition to the suspensions, it
was fining Geiger $20,000, Miller $5,000 and the 76ers $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teams and coaches will be held accountable for the reckless
actions of their players,'' said Rod Thorn, the NBA executive in
charge of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6, if necessary, will be Friday in Philadelphia. If there
is no sixth game, Geiger would serve out the remaining game of his
suspension at the start of the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flagrant fouls, Jackson said the Pacers do not fault
Geiger.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Geiger did was unfortunate, it was cheap shots, it was
dirty, but he did his job. You have to appreciate it, but at the
same time, a penalty has to be paid,'' Jackson said. ''He did his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was on his team, I'd tell him to do the same thing. ...
They were fighting for their lives, they had a sense of urgency,
and they had to do something and he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller declined to speak with the media Sunday, but issued an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was out of character for me. I understand where the league
is coming from with the one-game suspension for retaliating, but I
can't let someone intentionally try to hurt me for the sake of
winning one basketball game,'' said Miller, who has averaged 26
points in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger denied he tried to hurt Miller or that he had been told
to intentionally foul him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach (Larry) Brown has never, or would never, tell anybody on
our team to go out and intentionally foul anybody. That was not my
intent at all. I would never want to hurt anybody,'' said Geiger,
who at 248 pounds, is 46 pounds heavier than Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no reason to try to hurt Reggie. ... He obviously
overreacted. If he thought I was trying to hurt him, I can
understand his frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Larry Bird said he wasn't ready to say who would
start in Miller's place or how the absence would affect his
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed. I really didn't think Reggie would
get suspended. I really didn't think Geiger would get suspended. I
just thought that it was two hard fouls,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers led 79-61 at the time of the second foul and Indiana
scored the next 15 points, eventually taking a 90-85 lead with 3:06
left.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Mayan City Discovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemalan archaeologists have unearthed
the initial remains of what they believe to be a Mayan city as
large as the sprawling, majestic ruins of the country's famous
Tikal site.
</P>
<P>
   A team of national scientists uncovered the ''El Pajaral'' ruins
in the northern Guatemalan state of Peten late last week. The city
is from the post-classic period, and is between 670 to 800 years
old, said Salvador Lopez, who headed up the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, told
Guatemala City's Siglo Veintiuno newspaper that it could take
several years before all of what El Pajaral has to offer is
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Tikal, 40 miles northwest of the new site, rivals other great
Mayan ruin sites such as Mexico's Chichen Itza and Honduras' Copan.
It has attracted international scientists and tourists for decades
because of its breathtaking temples -- some of which are more than
150 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez said preliminary research has revealed that El Pajaral
may contain ceremonial temples and other structures taller than
Tikal's.
</P>
<P>
   Though their work has been slowed by the start of the rainy
season, Lopez said his team already has discovered two imposing
ceremonial plazas and 13 buildings nearly 25 feet high, only three
of which remain complete.
</P>
<P>
   American archaeologist Ian Graham started excavating El Pajaral
in the 1970s. But his work was limited because he did not have the
backing of Guatemalan authorities, denying him access to decades of
research, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   That research, Lopez said, enabled his team to uncover the new
city, whose buildings are buried under centuries of dirt and brush.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation area, in dense mountain forest near the
municipality of La Libertad, 130 miles northeast of Guatemala City,
was extremely difficult to excavate because of its altitude, Lopez
said.

<HEADLINE> No Increase In Grand Canyon Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- A prescribed burn that
blew out of control on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park
remained at 7,000 acres as a break in winds allowed firefighters to
attack the blaze, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're using this window of opportunity to get as much done as
possible,'' said park spokeswoman Margee Hench.
</P>
<P>
   Calmer conditions through the weekend helped firefighters who
had been frustrated by gusty winds Wednesday and Thursday. But they
worked hard to dig fire lines in anticipation of stronger winds
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're told a weather front may be coming in, which will mean
more moisture, but also more wind,'' Hench said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began as a prescribed burn on April 25, designed to
help remove some brush and grasses on about 1,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Like the fire that burned through Los Alamos, N.M., strong winds
beginning Wednesday drove this one beyond the prescribed burn area.
</P>
<P>
   The fire hasn't threatened stores, housing or the North Rim
Lodge, where visitors were evacuated last week, Hench said.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 firefighters and support personnel fought the fire
Sunday, with the aid of seven helicopters and three airtankers.

<HEADLINE> Liechtenstein Says It's Not Corrupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) -- The small Alpine principality of
Liechtenstein said Sunday it is not completely corrupt despite the
arrests of many of its prominent citizens in a money-laundering
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests began Thursday night in an unprecedented police
action in this country of 32,000 people. More than 50 police
officers, including 23 borrowed from the economics police of
neighboring Austria, took part in raids on seven office buildings,
including headquarters of financial advisers and lawyers, and on
several private homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that at first glance it seems contradictory,''
Government Chief Mario Frick told The Associated Press. ''But if
you look closer, the global accusations aren't true that
Liechtenstein is a state of money launderers and criminals, all in
it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailed allegations were not disclosed, but charges included
suspicion of commercial investment fraud, money laundering and
links to organized crime, Investigative Judge Pius Heeb said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said there are suspicions that some of those
arrested have connections to the Russian mafia and Latin American
drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Among those under arrest are a brother of the country's chief
justice and a brother of Frick's deputy government chief. Also
arrested was Rudolf Ritter, brother of Michael Ritter, the deputy
head of government and economics minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the 25-seat parliament waived the immunity of one of
its members, Gabriel Marxer, so that he could be arrested. He is
brother of Benedikt Marxer, president of the National Court, the
highest judge the country.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of documents were seized in the raid and more
arrests were possible after the information was examined, Heeb
said.

<HEADLINE> Article Questions U.S. General  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several former military colleagues of Gen.
Barry McCaffrey questioned in a published report Sunday whether he
used unnecessary force in a battle with Iraqi forces after the Gulf
War ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ex-colleagues, retired Lt. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr.,
is quoted in The New Yorker magazine as saying that ''there was no
need to be shooting at anybody'' on March 2, 1991. ''They couldn't
surrender fast enough. The war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has investigated the allegations that McCaffrey ordered
an unnecessary attack and concluded there was no evidence of war
crimes or misconduct by McCaffrey or his troops.
</P>
<P>
   The article by reporter Sy Hersh ''is nothing more than a
revisionist history of the war,'' McCaffrey, now director of the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said that its research found:
</P>
<P>
   --There was disagreement among officers assigned to McCaffrey's
mobile headquarters about whether Iraqis had attacked American
forces, prompting McCaffrey's strong response. Patrick Lamar, the
operations officer of McCaffrey's division, told the magazine that
the initial skirmish that triggered McCaffrey's order to attack was
''a giant hoax. The Iraqis were doing absolutely nothing. I told
McCaffrey I was having trouble confirming the incoming'' fire.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Lt. Gen. John J. Yeosock said ''what Barry ended up
doing was fighting sand dunes and moving rapidly'' and McCaffrey
was ''looking for a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   --Maj. Gen. Ronald Griffith said McCaffrey ''made it a battle
when it was never one.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack ordered by McCaffrey destroyed some 700 Iraqi tanks,
armored cars and trucks, The New Yorker reported.
</P>

   ''Hersh says that the Iraqi forces at Rumaylah were in
'retreat,''' McCaffrey said in a response. ''However, he wasn't the
one watching a force spanning five miles, made up of hundreds of
Iraqi tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers face him. The
Iraqis fired on U.S. forces. The Army investigations unequivocally
concluded that the use of force in response was justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine noted that there were occasional ''bitter
disputes'' between McCaffrey and other generals over such things as
the perceived hoarding of tank and truck fuel by McCaffrey, whose
division performed the famed ''left hook'' maneuver that blocked
the retreat of Iraqi forces from the war zone in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho To Hold Elections in March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) -- Elections in this southern African nation
will be held next March, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili
announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pakalitha said his government had accepted a timetable proposed
by a team of international election experts that recently visited
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho, a poor country of 2.1 million entirely encompassed by
South Africa, last held elections in May 1998. The Lesotho Congress
for Democracy won, but opposition parties claimed the poll was
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest followed, and peacekeepers from South Africa and Botswana
entered Lesotho on September 1998 and stayed for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   South African police and army earlier this month stepped up
security along the borders to Lesotho after an anonymous letter
distributed in the capital Maseru and other cities had urged
citizens to raid and loot South African homes and shops.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also called on Lesotho citizens to stay away from
work for one week in protest against the government, a call ignored
by many workers.

By The Associated PressDong Kingman
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dong Kingman, a watercolorist whose work is in
the permanent collections of several major museums, died Friday of
pancreatic cancer. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman's work is represented in the permanent collections of
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the DeYoung Museum of Art, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, the Museum of
Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Hirshhorn Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oakland, Calif., in 1911, Kingman studied art and
calligraphy in Hong Kong, returning home to Oakland when he was 18
at the height of the Depression. His first one-man show, when he
was 20, was well received.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman was a project artist for the Works Projects
Administration from 1936 to 1941. He had his first New York show at
Midtown Galleries in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman had long been fascinated by the movies, and his
watercolors also were used to set the visual moods in films
including ''Flower Drum Song'' and ''55 Days at Peking.'' He served
as a technical adviser to ''The World of Suzie Wong.''
C. Eric Lincoln
</P>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- C. Eric Lincoln, a longtime Duke University
professor who was among the leading scholars of black religious
life, died Sunday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not determined Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, a professor emeritus at Duke, was an author or editor
of 22 books. His most well-known books were ''The Black Muslims in
America,'' written in 1961, and ''The Black Church in the
African-American Experience,'' written in 1990 with a former
student.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Black Church'' book, considered the definitive work on the
subject, revealed the strength of the black church in America but
also raised troubling issues, including the failure of the black
church to pay attention to young black males and the lack of young
blacks entering the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was cited in 1990 by Pope John Paul II for his
''scholarly service to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent work ''Coming Through the Fire: Surviving Race
and Place in America,'' took a personal look at racism in America.
He recalled a situation while growing up in Alabama when he said he
was beaten after objecting to only receiving a nickel for a sack of
cotton that should have brought him more than $3.
Keizo Obuchi
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, an
unassuming ruling party stalwart who defied early predictions of
failure as premier, died Sunday, more than a month after suffering
a debilitating stroke in office. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors blamed his death on complications from the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was prime minister when he was stricken and hospitalized
April 2. He later lapsed into a coma and was put on artificial
respiration. Days later, parliament elected Yoshiro Mori as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998 to widespread
expectations that his humble manner meant he lacked the nerve to
handle the country's deepening economic problems. The son of a
national lawmaker from Gunma Prefecture north of Tokyo would soon
prove his critics wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Before falling ill, Obuchi had established a solid record as
premier: He put Japan on a massive public spending plan to pull it
out of recession and pushed controversial legislation through
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His impact on the political scene was expected to continue even
after death. Analysts predicted that the outpouring of public
sympathy would give the ruling Liberal Democratic Party a boost in
parliamentary elections. The vote does not have to be held until
October, but Mori has indicated he will call it on a day laden with
symbolism -- June 25, Obuchi's birthday.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Troy Glaus and Scott Spiezio hit
back-to-back home runs with one out in the ninth inning, and Mo
Vaughn homered twice Sunday as the Anaheim Angels beat the Texas
Rangers 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez had put Texas ahead in the ninth with a homer off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (2-0) that made him 3-for-3 with two home runs
as a pinch-hitter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus tied the game against Francisco Cordero (1-1) with his
10th homer of the season and Spiezio followed with his fifth,
ending an 0-for-11 slide. Texas elected not to bring in John
Wetteland, who had saved the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's third multihomer game this season, the 27th of his
career, raised his season totals to 13 homers and 35 RBIs. Garret
Anderson also homered for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Texas batted around in the first inning against Jason Dickson,
making his first start since straining a hip flexor April 28, and
took a 4-0 lead. Mike Lamb singled for two runs and Bill Haselman
added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   After Vaughn's first homer cut the Rangers' lead in half in the
bottom half, Rafael Palmeiro's RBI double in the Texas second made
it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad doubled and Vaughn homered again in the third.
Anderson's leadoff homer in the fourth tied it at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza retiring his next 11 batters.
Loaiza allowed five runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The first 10,000 women entering Edison Field for the
Mother's Day game received roses, courtesy of a local floral
company. ... The Angels have 39 homers in their last 20 games.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 11, Giants 7  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton broke a tie game with an RBI double
and raised his major league-leading average to .417 as the Colorado
Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants 11-7 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who also leads the NL with 41 RBIs, left the game after
his go-ahead hit against Livan Hernandez (2-5) in the seventh. He
strained his right hamstring while rounding first base.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds followed Helton's double with an RBI triple to
help the Rockies complete their first three-game sweep of San
Francisco since July 10-12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In winning their fifth in a row at home, the Rockies scored at
least 10 runs for the seventh straight time at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (3-0) got the final two outs in the eighth inning
after Mike DeJean allowed Bobby Estalella's solo homer that pulled
the Giants to 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado added three runs in the ninth when right fielder
Armando Rios misplayed a single by Tom Goodwin into a three-base
error. The ball went all the way to the wall, allowing Brent Mayne,
Brian Hunter and Goodwin to score.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella went 3-for-4, and Terrell Lowery -- playing in place of
injured Barry Bonds -- was 3-for-3 with a three-run homer for the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado trailed 5-1 after four but scored two unearned runs in
the fifth and took the lead on four consecutive singles and a
sacrifice fly in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller's pinch RBI single off DeJean tied the game again
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants played their first game without Bonds, who sprained a
joint in his lower back Saturday. He was scheduled to fly back to
San Francisco on Sunday and have an MRI and X-rays taken Monday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants said they will await test results before
deciding whether to place Bonds on the disabled list for the third
time in 14 seasons. ... Hernandez gave up eight runs -- six earned --
in 6 2-3 innings after allowing six earned runs in his previous 23
2-3 innings. ... Colorado was 19-for-31 (.613) with two outs and
runners in scoring position in the first two games of the series.
... Rockies OF Tom Goodwin hit his seventh triple of the season,
matching a career high in just 31 games.

<HEADLINE> Parnevik Wins Byron Nelson Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Jesper Parnevik missed a 1-foot putt, but
not the one that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Swede overcame a horrendous blunder earlier in
Sunday's round by making par on the third extra hole to win the
Byron Nelson Classic in a thrilling playoff over hard-luck Davis
Love III and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who remains winless in his last 47 PGA Tour events, caught
a huge break when he was given relief from newly laid sod left of
the 18th green. He chipped to 5 feet, but missed the par putt. That
left Parnevik only a short putt for his second victory this year.
</P>
<P>
   It was gimme length, but not after what happened on the 12th
hole, when Parnevik somehow missed from that same distance. He
recovered with two birdies for a 4-under-par 66 that got him into
the playoff at 11-under 269.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson bogeyed the 72nd hole for a 65, but was
eliminated with a par on the par-3 17th, the second playoff hole,
when his 15-foot birdie putt lipped out.
</P>
<P>
   Love stayed alive with a 20-foot birdie on the same hole, but
will look back on two critical misses on the 18th. He had an 8-foot
birdie putt in regulation that would have given him his first
victory in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who was tied for the third-round lead with John Huston,
had a 69. It was seventh time Love has finished second since his
victory in the 1998 MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik earned $720,000 for the fourth PGA Tour victory of his
career. He will move into the top 10 in the world ranking by
winning against a world-class field, and now must be considered for
more than his flipped-up cap and eccentric behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   No one since Doug Sanders has won on tour with such outrageous
pants -- hot pink, the color of a Pepto-Bismol bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods nearly pulled off the greatest final-round comeback
of his career, with another eagle from the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Seven shots back to start the final round, he closed with a 63,
his lowest final round ever as a professional. But he missed a
15-foot birdie putt on the 18th and wound up one stroke out of the
playoff at 270, along with Huston (70).
</P>
<P>
   Butch Harmon, who caught a red-eye from Las Vegas early Saturday
to help Woods with posture problems, patted him on the back before
he went to the first tee and told him, ''See you on the driving
range before the playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   He was almost right.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 16th time in his last 19 tour events that Woods has
finished in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson surged into contention with birdies on the first two
holes and an eagle on No. 7, and he took the lead with a 20-foot
birdie on the 17th. He pumped his fist twice, rare emotion for
Mickelson, but a sign that he felt he had this one in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't made a bogey in 32 holes, but caught a plugged lie in
the bunker and two-putted for bogey from 25 feet to fall to 11
under.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and David Duval, the top two players in the world ranking,
were paired alone in the final round for the first time, both of
them seven shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged was more evidence that Duval's putter is holding
him back -- and that no lead is safe when Woods is on his game.
</P>
<P>
   From 99 yards away in the fourth fairway, his sand wedge hit
next to the hole, hopped twice and spun back into the cup for an
eagle, bringing back memories of Pebble Beach when his eagle from
the 15th fairway led to a seven-stroke comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery behind the green responded like fans behind the goal
posts after a game-winning field goal. Woods never saw the ball go
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to get excited over a shot when you never saw it,''
Woods said. ''At least at Pebble, I could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like Pebble, this put him back in the hunt. With two
more birdies for a 30 on the front nine, he trailed the third-round
leaders by only one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest galleries followed Woods, and some climbed trees to
get a better view. Woods didn't disappoint with decent birdie
chances on nearly every hole and the kind of emotion that left the
TPC at Las Colinas buzzing all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-putt birdie on the 16th, Woods got to 10 under and,
for the first time all week, was in a tie for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Love made a 15-foot eagle putt on No. 7 and a terrific birdie
from a fairway bunker on 10 put that put him at 12 under, and in
control of the tournament. That didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   He three-putted No. 12 for bogey, then again ran into trouble on
the 14th with a 4-wood into the trees that left him no option but
to pitch to the fairway. His bogey created a four-way tie for the
lead among Love, Woods, Parnevik and Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods narrowly missed birdies chances on the last two holes,
sinking to his knees in disbelief when his 15-footer on the 18th
caught the left edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if I could make that putt it might make things
interesting,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson Classic had all the excitement it could take for one
week.
</P>
<P>
DIVOTS: The three-man playoff was the largest in the Nelson
Classic for a 72-hole tournament. ... Duval finished with an
even-par 70, only the second time this year he has failed to break
par in the final round. Then again, he has yet to lead in the final
round of any tournament this year. He'll try again next week at
Colonial, but not before suiting up for batting practice with the
Texas Rangers on Monday. ... Jerry Smith, who had earned just
$3,358 for his career on the PGA Tour, had a 67 to tie for ninth.
He earned $116,000.

<HEADLINE> Women Said Expelled From Singapore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Nine foreign women married to Singaporeans have
been expelled because they have contracted HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, a newspaper report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times, citing unidentified sources, said that the
women were mainly from Thailand, Indonesia, China and the
Philippines. The women, who are not Singaporean citizens, carry
social passes, which allow them to stay in Singapore for a period
of up to a year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said another 10 women infected with the virus were
expecting to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration office was closed Sunday, so officials could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under Singapore's Immigration Act, non-citizens who have the HIV
virus are classified as ''prohibited immigrants,'' the paper said.
That means the 10 women who are still in Singapore will not be
allowed to renew their passes when they expire.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Singapore's health ministry announced that,
starting in March, foreigners who wanted to live permanently or
work in the city-state for over six months must undergo a medical
examination, including an AIDS test.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said those who were found to have active
tuberculosis or HIV infection would not be granted employment
passes and permanent residence papers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new rule, only workers applying for a work permit,
which applies to low-income jobs, needed to undergo a medical
examination. The rule now extends to all foreign jobseekers.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Morrow Out for Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas forward Brenden Morrow will miss the rest
of the playoffs after breaking his right ankle in the Stars' loss
in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie left wing left the ice Saturday night in the final
two minutes of the Colorado Avalanche's 2-0 victory. Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said Sunday that Morrow will not play again this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, like the rest of the Stars had a rough game. He took two
penalties in the first period that negated power-play opportunities
for the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   His third penalty of the game, for running into goalie Patrick
Roy midway through the third, further thwarted Dallas' chances at a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he was unsure who would replace Morrow in the
lineup for Game 2 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow had 14 goals and 19 assists during the regular season and
two goals and four assists in the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Ray Lewis' Murder Trial To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA LaHAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- It was 4 a.m. on Jan. 31, and the nightclubs of
Atlanta's trendy Buckhead district were sending post-Super Bowl
revelers into the cold night.
</P>
<P>
   A fight broke out among several young men, and soon two of them
lay on the ground, fatally stabbed. A limousine roared from the
scene when someone fired a gun at it.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the few undisputed facts in the murder trial of star
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis that begins Monday with jury
selection.
</P>
<P>
   He and co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting are
charged with murder in the deaths of Jacinth ''Shorty'' Baker, 21,
and Richard Lollar, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said in court documents that Lollar and Baker
argued with Lewis and his friends after they left Cobalt Lounge.
Lollar and Baker ran away after seeing their foes had knives, the
documents said, and Lewis, Sweeting and Oakley chased them down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witnesses observed Lewis grab and punch Lollar in the chest
area,'' the documents read. ''Sweeting, who was observed with a
knife seconds earlier, also punched Lollar in the stomach. During
the beating, Lollar was stabbed approximately four times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oakley pursued and ultimately caught Baker. Oakley punched and
beat Baker in his torso. ... During this beating, Baker was stabbed
approximately four times.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyers are expected to argue he didn't stab anyone and
acted as peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not have a knife; he did not use a knife,'' lawyer Ed
Garland said soon after being hired by Lewis in early February.
Garland said Lewis was a ''horrified bystander'' who tried to
prevent and then break up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   But if the prosecution can convince a jury that Lewis
participated in the brawl that led to the two deaths, he can be
convicted of murder even if he didn't stab anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the lookout in a bank robbery getting charged with
murder if one of the robbers shoots and kills someone,'' Erik
Friedly, spokesman for the district attorney, said in February.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Oakley and Sweeting have indicated they may argue
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, Oakley's attorney, asked Judge Bonner to bar
people from referring to Baker and Lollar as victims and said one
of them hit his client over the head with a champagne bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley and Sweeting are small-time criminals -- each with a long
arrest record -- with unlikely dreams of hitting the big-time in the
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has a four-year, $26 million contract with the Ravens and
is one of the NFL's best defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows how different his life is as a professional
athlete,'' said Kathleen Hessert, owner of Sports Media Challenge,
a Charlotte media relations company that advises college and
professional athletes. ''He knows how it feels to have a
multimillion-dollar contract in his hands and he knows he could
lose it all.''

<HEADLINE> Avs Recall Leading 1-0, Too  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche know better than to get
excited about beating the Dallas Stars in the opener of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it didn't get them anywhere last year.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado wasted the momentum of a 2-1 victory in Game 1 of last
year's conference finals by losing the next two games to Dallas.
The Stars won the series in seven games and went on to win the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs, who won Game 1 of the rematch 2-0 Saturday night, are
confident things will be different this time for a simple reason:
They're a better team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun to see the way guys are right now, how focused and
intense we are in every game and every practice,'' goaltender
Patrick Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has won 17 of 19, including 10 of 12 on the road. Since
adding Ray Bourque on March 6, the Avalanche are 21-4-1 -- and he's
missed the last three games with an injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque could return for Game 2 Monday night, but may take
advantage of the long layoff that follows and wait for Game 3
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the schedule is set up is in my favor,'' he said.
''But, believe me, if I am ready to go Monday, I'll go Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, meanwhile, will have to go without Brenden Morrow, who
plays on the same line with Mike Modano and Brett Hull. Morrow
broke his right ankle in Game 1 and is out for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Bourque's superb defense, the Avalanche won Game 1
because of the way they stopped the Stars' offense. Colorado's
approach was to hit hard, hit often and not give an inch of open
ice.
</P>
<P>
   The best example may have been in the first period when Dallas
center Modano was dumped into the Avalanche bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of the more physical games I've played in,'' Modano
said, ''but you expect that at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always expected of Colorado. Although the Avs play a
style similar to the hit-hungry Stars, Colorado usually emphasizes
its speed and skills over brute strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our game plan is we want to rock them,'' defenseman Adam Foote
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beating Dallas at its own game -- on its own ice -- speaks a lot
about the Avalanche's ability. The Stars had won their last eight
games at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's pretty safe to say it was the start of the war,''
Colorado coach Bob Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley was confident to use Game 1 as a testing ground for the
physical philosophy because he knows his team can handle it better
than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play better defense,'' he said. ''We have more options in
our lineup. We have a great commitment to defense from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who also believe they're better than last year, will
have to show a renewed desire to avoid going to Colorado down 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think we had the necessary level of determination
throughout our team,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''They have
enough people that can beat you one-on-one, but when the level of
determination is so high, we are going to have to have a much
bigger commitment throughout our group to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy ended Hull's seven-game scoring streak and the Avalanche
defense held him to three shots. Modano also had three, one in each
period. Joe Nieuwendyk had just one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to regroup,'' Modano said. ''We'll see how we respond
on Monday.''

<HEADLINE> Irwin Wins Nationwide Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Hale Irwin defended his Nationwide
Championship title Sunday, using impeccable course management for a
3-under-par 69 and a one-stroke victory over Vincente Fernandez and
Tom Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   A birdie at the par-4 12th moved Irwin to nine under and gave
the three-time U.S. Open champion a lead he never relinquished.
Irwin closed with six straight pars for a 9-under 207 total, his
26th Senior PGA Tour victory and the first prize of $217,500.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin needs three more victories to pass Lee Trevino for most
wins on the senior tour. His victory at the Golf Club of Georgia
last year, which came when he eagled the par-5 18th by holing a
wedge from 74 yards, started a run of five straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez and Jenkins, who both started the day three shots
behind second-round leader Larry Nelson and one behind Irwin, shot
69s to tie for second at 208.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez finished second at the Royal Caribbean Classic on Feb.
6.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who earned his first top-three finish of the year,
pushed his 6-iron close to the water on the par-3 17th, chipped
within five feet and missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the first repeat champion at the Nationwide, increased
his record earnings at the 10-year-old event to $843,100.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who began the day with a one-shot lead over Walter Hall
and Mark Hayes, birdied the first two holes to go 10 under, but
followed with two straight bogeys. Despite getting back to nine
under with a birdie at the par-4 8th, Nelson bogeyed Nos. 10 and 11
and never recovered. His 74 left him tied for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Hayes also unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who finished with a 77, played the final nine holes six
over par and finished in a tie for 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, the first-round leader, had no birdies in his final round
and closed with a 75.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that began with eight players within three shots of the
lead, Mike McCullough matched a course record by playing the back
nine in five under. McCullough, who birdied all four of the par-5s,
finished with a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan eagled No. 18 for a 70 and tied McCullough for fourth
at 209.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Bob Murphy, who won the 1995 Nationwide and finished
second last year, birdied Nos. 14, 16 and 18 to finish in a tie for
seventh place with a 68. ... A double-bogey at the par-4 16th
ruined Bruce Summerhays' chances. At five under after the double
bogey, Summerhays bogeyed the last two holes to finish with a 74.
... Tom Watson birdied 16 and 18 to finish with a 70 and in a tie
for eighth. Watson is still seeking his first senior win.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Insulted by Fine on Geiger  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers are insulted by the
NBA's decision to fine the franchise $50,000 over two flagrant
fouls by Matt Geiger, general manager Billy King said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The league decided to fine the 76ers in addition to the two-game
suspension and $20,000 fine it issued Geiger for his fouls Saturday
against Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the
Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The league is saying that myself, the organization, (coach)
Larry Brown and (owner) Pat Croce are irresponsible,'' King said.
''I take that as a personal insult to myself, Pat and Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that in the three years the trio have been with
Philadelphia, they have ''never condoned anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Larry Brown and I and Pat Croce, if you go back and looked at
our track record, we've never condoned any violence,'' King said.
''What Matt did was unfortunate, uncalled for ... but to fine us
and say we're reckless is absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was depressed over the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a history over doing things like that,'' he
said. ''I take it personally, as well as Pat. We probably have the
fewest flagrant fouls in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decision to fine the team, NBA vice president Rod Thorn
said ''teams and coaches will be held accountable for the reckless
actions of their players.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said such accusations were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just pointing a finger and saying we have no control over our
players, and don't respect the game or the league, and we're trying
to hurt people, I'm really disappointed about that,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' president, was unhappy with the
league's decision to suspend Miller for one game. The league also
fined Miller $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with the ruling because it benefits the wrongdoer
and encourages this type of provocation. The Philadelphia player
intentionally tried to take Reggie out on two occasions,'' he said.
''When Reggie retaliated -- only after the second provocation -- the
end result was that we lost our best player, not only for that
game, but for the next one, too. So it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller reacted to the second foul by striking Geiger with an
open hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Reggie literally violated the rules by pushing the
Philadelphia player in the face, any balance of equities would not
produce this decision,'' Walsh said. ''We think this sends the
wrong signal in the future and is not in keeping with the spirit of
the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird said Miller's reaction wasn't anything
he hadn't seen many times in his 13-year playing career and three
years as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie didn't throw a punch. It really was a pushing foul in
his face. It really wasn't a big deal. It was a typical NBA love
fest out there,'' Bird said.

<HEADLINE> Survivors Sought in Dutch Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- At first it looked like a
spectacular fireworks display had lit up the sunny afternoon, and
people streamed toward the green, yellow and red flares.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the whole fireworks depot blew up, obliterating
an entire working-class neighborhood and leaving at least 20 people
dead and 589 injured in this eastern Dutch city.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a day after 100 tons of fireworks exploded, emergency
crews searched for survivors among the charred wreckage of 400
flattened houses. They found themselves hampered by small fires
that kept the rubble red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   Although safety regulations require that explosives be stored in
separate, insulated bunkers, the depot's entire 100-ton store
detonated with a force that experts compared to a wartime rocket
attack. Officials said they had not ruled out arson.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 15 bodies have been recovered but authorities estimated
the death toll at 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction began when a series of blasts from the S.E.
Fireworks warehouse sent concrete blocks and glass shards flying.
Cascading fireballs and billowing black clouds swallowed the
neighborhood of Enschede North as throngs fled the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started as a small fire,'' said Omir Sobaa, 18, his wrists
swathed in bandages as he recalled the previous day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thought that a paper factory had gone up in
flames,'' he said. ''I saw fireworks and everybody started to
panic. Everybody started to run. And then I was knocked to the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   For many others, there was no escape in the smoke-shrouded
darkness. But they ran anyway, in every direction, their faces
streaked with blood, some with missing limbs, trampling children
underfoot, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most terrible thing that could happen to people,''
said Prime Minister Wim Kok, shaking his head in shock after
surveying the disaster area with Queen Beatrix.
</P>
<P>
   The day was doubly tragic for the Dutch queen. Her 88-year-old
father, Prince Bernhard, was in an intensive care unit after
complications from intestinal surgery, his seventh operation in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   As Beatrix toured an emergency shelter, mothers of missing
children clung to her and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Freek Tonis said he was working in his garden with his wife and
young child when the first explosion blew out windows in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a bang and we went to the corner to see what it
was,'' said the 35-year-old businessman. ''We thought it was a
fireworks display and wondered who would be setting off fireworks
in the middle of the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the desolate streets of Enschede North resembled a
bombed-out war zone. Rescue workers in bright yellow and orange
suits sifted through the smoldering ruins with sniffing dogs in
search of survivors and dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Blackened skeletons of homes stood silently as dark silhouettes
against a bright, cerulean sky. Cleanup crews solemnly hauled away
burnt-out automobile chassis lining streets strewn with pieces of
glass and concrete and blanketed with ash.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left of the fireworks warehouse was a gaping
crater. A neighboring supermarket had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Small fires still burned in the Grolsch Brewery across the
street, where fermentation tanks and inventory rooms were gutted.
The factory is one of two main production centers for Grolsch, a
leading Dutch beer brand. Employees were asked not to come to the
factory on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy was the worst to strike the Netherlands since an
Israeli cargo plane plowed into a tenement block on Oct. 4, 1992,
killing 43 people.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators and talk show hosts Sunday drew parallels between
the two disasters, noting that both struck low-income neighborhoods
with large immigrant communities. About one-quarter of Enschede
North's residents were of Turkish, Moroccan and Spanish origin.
</P>
<P>
   Sobaa, whose parents immigrated from Turkey before he was born,
was one of many residents who wanted answers to why city
authorities allowed a fireworks depot to be located so close to a
residential neighborhood. But mainly, he feared for those still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky,'' he said, as he strolled by the outdoor cafes in
the center of town. ''I have lots of friends and relatives who live
there.''

<HEADLINE> Charred NM Town's Residents Return  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE ROCK, N.M. (AP) -- Martha George marked her return home
Sunday by performing the most mundane of chores: She did her
laundry and watered the plants.
</P>
<P>
   George was among 7,000 residents, some of them in tears, who
were allowed to return to their homes in White Rock after being
forced to evacuate Thursday as a fire bore down on their mountain
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our town just looked like something very special,'' said
George, a 16-year resident. Asked how she felt, she said, ''Oh,
like heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   George, 62, was staying 20 miles away at her brother's home in
Nambe when she heard the word Sunday afternoon she could go home.
She jumped in the car and immediately drove back, tears filling her
eyes when she saw her home and everything in it safe. White Rock
escaped the fires unharmed, unlike neighboring Los Alamos, which
remained abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing she did was throw a bundle of laundry into the
washing machine. She then watered her plants, worried that they
might die in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Others hoped to get started on the simplest things, too: paying
bills or cleaning house. Ruby Alexander, a mother of three, said
she would ''run barefoot through the backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some saw their return as bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be home,'' said Mike Wismer, a 43-year-old
employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who was staying 50
miles away with friends in Hernandez. But, he added, echoing the
sentiments of his neighbors, ''We feel for the people who lost
their homes.''

<HEADLINE> Elian to Grandmothers: I Miss You  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez wished his grandmothers a happy
Mother's Day but said during a telephone message that was
videotaped and shown later Sunday here on state television that he
missed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congratulations!'' Elian told his maternal grandmother Raquel
Rodriguez in a telephone call captured on videotape Sunday morning.
He told her he had drawn her a flower on her special Mother's Day
card.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is here,'' the 6-year-old said in the call from the
farm in Maryland where he is staying with his father, stepmother,
half-brother and playmates from Cuba. ''Everyone is here but my
mama. She's missing''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the mother of Elian's mother, who died in the fatal
sea journey last November. She appeared to weep during the few
minutes of the call shown during an evening television show.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast was among the most personal and touching of the
programs aired in recent weeks on the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in their Sunday best, Rodriguez and Elian's paternal
grandmother Mariela Quintana sat in a television studio decorated
with fresh flowers while watching the tape of their call with
Elian. They were also shown a series of interviews conducted with
children from across the island offering love and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry, Elian will be back with you soon,'' a boy of
about 10 said. ''And you shouldn't feel alone: all of the Cuban
people are behind you. ''
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Day has special significance in Cuba and during the day
it is not uncommon for complete strangers to greet women in the
street with a Mother's Day greeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, the grandmothers were given floral
bouquets wrapped in ribbons and cellphone, and a big cake.
</P>
<P>
   During the show, Elian's godmother, Lourdes Martell, from his
hometown of Cardenas, remembered the 6-year-old's mother Elisabeth,
who perished in the sea journey that led to the international
custody dispute over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elisabeth was a good mother, a good daughter, a good woman,''
Martell said. ''I admired her very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Martell's statement appeared to contradict arguments by
attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives, who have said that if Elian
is returned to Cuba he will be taught that his mother was a traitor
to the communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro's government all along has portrayed Elian's mother
as a good person, and said she was bullied into taking her son on
the journey by her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank during an
illegal journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was reunited with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez in the
United States last month after an armed federal raid on the Miami
relatives' home where they boy had been staying.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, one
step below the U.S. Supreme Court, heard arguments Thursday on a
request by Elian's Miami relatives that a political asylum hearing
be held for the boy. Father and son must remain in the United
States pending the ruling, which is not expected for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Busch Stadium Grass Doesn't Impress  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Although the grass at Busch Stadium looks more
presentable, players don't think much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bare spots have been filled in and the field has lost
its two-tone look since the end of the last homestand May 4, St.
Louis Cardinals outfielders say the field remains treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   ''It ain't any different,'' Eric Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's terrible,'' Thomas Howard added.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers center fielder Todd Hollandsworth joined a long list of
visiting players complaining about the stability of the turf.
Previously, Tony Gwynn, Larry Walker and Brian Giles ripped the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's spotty out there,'' Hollandsworth said. ''From what I've
heard, it's been pretty bad. I guess it's probably better than it
was, but it still needs some work.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Walt Jocketty said he walked the field with
manager Tony La Russa and vice president Jerry Walker on Friday and
''we were very pleased with the way it looked.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was going to be rough the first couple of months.
It needed more sunlight and more rain and just time to grow, and
that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The field blends two grasses, Bermuda and rye. Jocketty said the
field was ugly earlier in the season because groundkeepers didn't
overseed with rye as much as they had in the past. If they had
overseeded, the field would have looked worse late in the season
rather than early.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to give it some time to grow,'' Jocketty said.
''There's no paint involved, I can tell you that.''

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Giambi hit his major league-leading
16th home run and drove in three runs to increase his total to 46,
also tops in baseball, as Oakland Athletics beat the Seattle
Mariners 7-2 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (5-2) won his fourth straight decision despite
leaving with a hamstring injury. He allowed two runs and seven hits
in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia was hurt covering first base on Alex Rodriguez's infield
hit in the sixth. He reached for a throw from Giambi and faced two
more hitters before leaving with tightness in his right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott (1-1) lasted four innings in his second start of the
season, giving up seven runs, five hits and six walks. Seattle,
which walked 10 A's in all, has lost five of seven.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that started 1 hour, 22 minutes late because of rain,
Miguel Tejada's fourth homer gave Oakland a 2-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs and Jeremy Giambi each drove in a run in third, then
Jason Giambi homered into the right-field stands in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia stranded four runners in the first five innings before
running into trouble following his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez doubled home a run to end Heredia's day, and Doug
Jones gave up a run-scoring single to Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mariners reliever Jose Mesa has a 6.55 ERA at home; it's
2.77 on the road. ... The A's lead the majors in runs (108) and
walks (85) in May. ... Rodriguez's infield single in the fifth gave
him a 10-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Suns 117, Lakers 98  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns are still alive in the Western
Conference semifinals. Boy, are they alive.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd had his first playoff triple-double and Cliff
Robinson, playing despite a sprained ankle, scored a career
playoff-high 32 points Sunday as the Suns avoided being swept with
a 117-98 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points any team has scored against Los Angeles
all season.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who has 31 career regular-season triple-doubles, had 22
points, a career playoff-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds. Rodney
Rogers added 17 points and Penny Hardaway had 16 for the Suns, who
beat the Lakers for the first time in eight tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still are up 3-1 and can clinch the best-of-seven
series with a victory at home Tuesday night, but they looked like
that other team from Los Angeles, not the NBA's powerhouse, in this
one. Phoenix led by 23 points at halftime and 29 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, in foul trouble most of the game, scored 24
points, eight below his playoff average, and was 4-for-12 from the
free throw line, 1-for-9 in the first half. Kobe Bryant scored 23
points for Los Angeles and Glen Rice added 15.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal drew his fourth and fifth fouls in a nine-second span and
went to the bench with 4:07 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He returned in the fourth quarter and capped a 10-1 run with a
stuff to cut the lead to 101-85 with 6:47 to play, the closest Los
Angeles came to a rally all day. But coach Scott Skiles put Kidd
and Robinson back in the game, Rogers scored twice and any doubt
about the outcome was over.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, playing with two screws in the left ankle he broke on
March 22, had been shooting 29 percent in the series and was
1-for-9 in Phoenix's 105-99 loss in Game 3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But he was as good as ever from the opening tip Sunday. Kidd was
8-for-13 from the field and made four of six 3-pointers. In one
37-second stretch, he had a rebound, assist, steal and 3-pointer to
give Phoenix its biggest lead with 4:25 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix led 71-48 at halftime, the most points scored against
Los Angeles in a half and tied for the most scored by Phoenix in a
half all season.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal clanking free throws off the rim like the Shaq of
old, missing eight in a row, the Suns shot 58 percent in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was questionable for the game after spraining his
right ankle in the third quarter Friday night, had 23 points in the
first half, including going 3-of-5 from 3-point range. His previous
career playoff-high of 30 came in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns outscored the Lakers 17-7 over the last 4:09 of the
first quarter to go up 38-24 when Kidd stole the ball and banked in
a 3-pointer from the top of the key at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's double-pump on a jumper inside the lane drew O'Neal's
third foul with 6:54 to go in the half. The shot went in to put the
Suns up 49-31.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal on the bench, Los Angeles cut it to 59-45 on Rice's
breakaway stuff after a turnover with 2:02 left, but the Suns
outscored the Lakers 12-3 the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: The Suns' 38 points in the first quarter were their most in
the 2000 playoffs by six. ... In the first quarter, the Suns'
backcourt of Kidd and Hardaway combined for 17 points and 11
assists. Kidd had 10 points and eight assists. ... The Lakers
haven't swept a playoff series since 1991 and haven't swept a
seven-game series since 1989. ... The previous most points given up
by Los Angeles in a half was 66 at Washington on Dec. 14 and in a
game was 114 at Sacramento on April 14. ... The entire Lakers' team
had 12 assists in the first half, the same as Kidd.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Service Held for Ala Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- A memorial service for Robert ''Rah
Rah'' Scott drew friends, co-workers and former teammates and
players to Coleman Coliseum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, an assistant basketball coach at Alabama, died of stomach
cancer Tuesday. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a friend, a co-worker and for the last couple of years
he was a teacher to me because of everything that happened,''
Alabama head coach Mark Gottfried said. ''He cared as much about
people as anybody I've ever been around.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was diagnosed with cancer in September 1999 but missed
only two regular season games last season.
</P>
<P>
   He played on a state championship team at Birmingham's Parker
High School. After his Alabama career, he was picked in the fourth
round by Golden State in the 1980 NBA draft and played
professionally overseas for six years.
</P>
<P>
   On a platform covered with flowers, speakers stood at a podium
Sunday between a portrait of Scott as an All-SEC player in 1980 and
a framed jersey. Two basketballs were placed on the casket.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama players filed by for a final viewing. The Crimson Tide
players served as pallbearers along with Alabama-Birmingham players
LeAndrew Bass and Myron Ransom and Alabama signee and prep star
Gerald Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was an assistant at UAB for three seasons after directing
West End High School to a state championship. He took the Alabama
coaching position in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Grizzard, a freshman last season, said Scott helped ease the
transition from high school to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel thankful to be around a man like Coach Scott,''
Grizzard said. ''All the things he told me I'll never forget. I
just wanted to tell him I love him and thank him for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama athletic director Mal Moore said Scott ''didn't leave
his qualities on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a man who showed that winning is universal,'' Moore
said. ''When we talk about the qualities that make student-athletes
successful, the words ring hollow compared to Rah Rah's actions. He
made something of himself and the world around him. He made an
impact.''

<HEADLINE> Supporters rally around the mayor but Democrats predict his demise  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Democrats used the Sunday talk shows to predict
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's U.S. Senate run is all but over, but
his Republican supporters insisted he could still pull off a
winning campaign if he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, meanwhile, continued to mull over his future in
private. Two sources would only say that he hadn't yet made up his
mind, while his campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, stated, in a
gloomy tone of voice, ''I've got no comment on anything. I've got
nothing to say on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in contrast, cheerily wrote the mayor's political
obituary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all over but the shouting,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said on CNN's ''Late Edition.'' ''As far as becoming the next U.S.
Senator, forget it! He never really wanted the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Ed Koch, speaking on ABC's ''This Week,'' agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to withdraw, and it has to be before the end of the
month because the Republican convention is taking place,'' Koch
said. ''There's no question in my mind he will drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans rallied 'round the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from Staten
Island, told NBC's ''Meet the Press'': ''Nobody knows at this
point. I talked to the mayor's staff as late as yesterday
(Saturday). They are still waiting for him to come to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''If there is one person in the United States of
America who can handle that pressure and rise to the challenge and
in fact may even be spurred on by that pressure, it's Mayor
Giuliani ... He's tougher and stronger than anyone ever gives him
credit for, so don't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has prostate cancer and is seeking a separation from
his wife, Donna Hanover, who publicly accused him of having an
affair with a former City Hall aide. The mayor is also flaunting an
ongoing relationship with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil, Georgette Mosbacher, a state committeewoman
for the Republican National Committee, told ''Fox News'': ''I
personally believe that he will step up to these challenges and
hopefully continue to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the same show, Rep. Vito Fossella, R-Staten Island,
added: ''He needs to take the bullets if he can, and I think there
will be a lot of people in New York who are still very much behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-Long Island and Wall Street multimillionaire
Ted Forstmann have expressed interest in running if Giuliani drops
out. The GOP's strongest potential candidate, Gov. George Pataki,
has said he is not interested. Molinari said neither she nor her
husband, former Rep. Bill Paxon, R-Buffalo, harbor any thoughts of
running.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-Long Island, told ''Meet the Press'' Sunday,
''I certainly intend to pursue the nomination'' if Giuliani drops
out, but said it was too soon to write the mayor off.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was anybody else besides Rudy, he'd be out of it by now
but he's very unpredictable,'' King said, adding, ''If he can
somehow get this in order, if he can get a clean bill of health
from the doctors, if the marriage problems recede in the
background, it's possible by Labor Day, you'll see once again a
Rudy vs. Hillary war and a lot of this will be in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella noted that ''despite all these problems with Rudy, Mrs.
Clinton has not moved in the polls one bit. And I think that says a
lot about the people of New York. They still want by and large Rudy
to stay in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Sunday's New York Post showed Clinton and
Giuliani remain neck and neck, with 42 percent supporting the first
lady while 40 percent support the mayor. Clinton's small lead is
well within the poll's 4.5-point margin of error. Only a third of
voters said Giuliani's troubles ''diminish his stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, citing unnamed sources, reported in its May 22
editions that Giuliani has chosen ''the most extensive and
time-consuming course of treatment for prostate cancer, an
operation followed by radiation therapy,'' and that the 3-month
treatment and recuperation period will force him out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor refuted the report Sunday, calling it ''totally
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not made a decision. As soon as I make a decision, I
will let you know.''

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels freed 139 of more than
500 U.N. personnel held captive into Liberian custody, Liberia's President
Charles Taylor said Sunday, after U.N. officials secured the release of 18
others. Taylor said 15 of the freed captives had been flown by helicopter to
Monrovia, while the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from the Liberian

Bank have filed suit in a federal court in Chicago against Islamic groups and
charities, claiming they raised money in the United States for Hamas, a radical
Islamic group that has carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis.
In an apparently unprecedented move, Stanley and Joyce Boim, invoked the federal
anti-terrorism law of 1990 against what their $600 million suit described as
Hamas-front organizations and individuals who collected funds in the United
States for relief and development on the West Bank and in Gaza.

the gun lobby and to work against lawmakers who oppose gun control. A smaller

Monument to hold a rally where they argued that guns were needed for

injured. In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli army
base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians
took place in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah. Those clashes began
as marches marking Monday's 52nd anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry To Fight Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida jury that already found tobacco companies
conspired to sell a dangerous product will begin this week to
consider a possible punitive penalty. Anti-smoking activists are
looking for a day of reckoning for an industry that has yet to pay
a penny to smokers who went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco plans to offer its $250 billion settlement over 25
years with states and restrictions on youth marketing as proof that
no more punishment is needed in the landmark case brought by an
estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers. But opponents expect the
nation's five biggest cigarette makers to pay billions more.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't be hundreds (of billions) because it has to be
nonbankrupting, but I think the industry is worth roughly $100
billion, and I think a fair punishment is a nice big hunk of
that,'' said Dick Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor
who hopes for a verdict in the tens of billions.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit against the companies was the first of
its kind to go to trial, and the punitive damages phase is
important enough that the industry's top executives plan to
voluntarily testify -- something they rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a good story to tell. The people running these
companies now are not the ones running the companies in the '50s
when most of this alleged wrongdoing occurred,'' said David
Adelman, tobacco analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''They
really and truly have reformed their business practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobson, a University of Michigan associate professor of
public health who researches the role of courts in shaping health
policy, predicts a change in tone from the 1994 congressional
testimony of tobacco executives who denied that cigarettes are
addictive in spite of internal industry documents stating the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the CEOs in this case to project a more conciliatory
tone and sympathy for sick smokers, warning that jurors would hold
any evasiveness against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look what happened to Microsoft based on Bill Gates'
depositions or Bill Clinton, where the public visually can see and
can read what they say and how they say it,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   The complex trial has completed two of three phases: the July
verdict holding the companies liable, and an April 7 ruling
awarding $12.7 million in compensatory damages for medical
expenses, pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the jury must decide whether to award punitive damages in
order to punish the companies for their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Robert Kaye will be asked Monday to rule on
motions in the case that have piled up since he went on vacation
two weeks ago. Opening statements are expected Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony is generally expected to focus on numbers:
Economists and actuarial experts will testify about the value of
the industry and the size of the class of smokers. The industry
intends to call a tobacco farmer and a convenience store owner to
speak to the economic impact of a big verdict against the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Using a conservative figure of 300,000 for the number of smokers
actually covered by the class-action lawsuit, lead tobacco attorney
Dan Webb noted in court that a punitive award of $500,000 each, low
by today's standards, would produce a $150 billion verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The simple math was one of the reasons for a bill passed by the
state Legislature this month. The industry will be allowed to
appeal by posting a maximum $100 million bond, an exception to the
standard appeal bond equal to about 125 percent of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   By Florida law, a verdict can't bankrupt a company, and a judge
would be required to reduce an overwhelming award. Consequently,
industry profits are what's at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''If an award comes down that's substantial as predicted, this
will send a message to other prospective jurors that the way in
which the tobacco industry has conducted its business and sold its
product is no longer acceptable,'' Jacobson said.

America who can handle that pressure and rise to the challenge and
in fact may even be spurred on by that pressure, it's Mayor
Giuliani ... He's tougher and stronger than anyone ever gives him
credit for, so don't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has prostate cancer and is seeking a separation from
his wife, Donna Hanover, who publicly accused him of having an
affair with a former City Hall aide. The mayor is also flaunting an
ongoing relationship with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil, Georgette Mosbacher, a state committeewoman
for the Republican National Committee, told ''Fox News'': ''I
personally believe that he will step up to these challenges and
hopefully continue to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted
Forstmann, have expressed interest in running if Giuliani drops
out. The GOP's strongest potential candidate, Gov. George Pataki,
has said he is not interested. Molinari said neither she nor her
husband, former Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., harbor any thoughts of
running.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told ''Meet the Press'' Sunday, ''I
certainly intend to pursue the nomination'' if Giuliani drops out,
but said it was too soon to write the mayor off.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Sunday's New York Post showed Clinton and
Giuliani remain neck and neck, with 42 percent supporting the first
lady while 40 percent support the mayor. Clinton's small lead is
well within the poll's 4.5-point margin of error. Only a third of
voters said Giuliani's troubles ''diminish his stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, citing unnamed sources, reported that Giuliani has
chosen ''the most extensive and time-consuming course of treatment
for prostate cancer, an operation followed by radiation therapy,''
and that the 3-month treatment and recuperation period will force
him out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor refuted the report Sunday, calling it ''totally
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not made a decision. As soon as I make a decision, I
will let you know.''

<HEADLINE> Mount St. Helens Eruption Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By HUNTER T. GEORGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Wash. (AP) -- The blast came without warning,
snapping trees and engulfing Jim Scymanky and three other loggers
in a suffocating wave of hot, black ash from Mount St. Helens.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from severe burns over 46 percent of his body and
struggling to breathe, Scymanky gave up hope of being rescued and
instead wondered how long it would take to die.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see. I can't breathe. I feel like I'm being buried.
The pain is just unbearable,'' he said Sunday of the day 20 years
ago when the mountain erupted. Hours later, two National Guard
helicopters swooped through the murky ash and rescued him. His
three co-workers perished.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Scymanky was among more than a dozen survivors who
gathered as part of an ongoing observance of the 20th anniversary
of the May 18, 1980, eruption that killed 57 people and stunned
scientists with its ferocity. The event was held at the Silver Lake
Visitor Center, located about 45 miles west of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Each survivor described the eruption from a different
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy and Keith Stoffel of Spokane had a bird's eye view from
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The two geologists were in a small airplane about 500 feet above
the summit when the north flank of the mountain collapsed in a
landslide that has been determined the largest in recorded history.
Massive explosions followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, 'Oh dear, this is the big one and here we are right
above it,''' Dorothy Stoffel said in an interview in front of a
visitor center display of aerial pictures she and her husband took.
</P>
<P>
   They snapped a few pictures and then realized they were in
danger. Their pilot put the aircraft into a steep dive to gain
speed and outrace the oncoming blast wave. They didn't have time to
be scared until they landed in Portland and raced into the
terminal, leaving the plane sitting on the tarmac with its doors
open.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Robert Rogers had spent days evading authorities
enforcing a no-trespassing zone around the mountain, which had been
shaken by earthquakes for two months. The Portland man, 30 years
old at the time, was on a nearby ridge on the west side of the
mountain and watched the eruption, which blew eastward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably the closest land survivor,'' he said. ''This is a
big part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors at Sunday's event showed slides and film.
</P>
<P>
   But not Scymanky. He escaped only with his life, and barely at
that.
</P>
<P>
   Scymanky, who lives in Woodburn, Ore., was working with a small
logging team above the Toutle River that bright and clear Sunday.
The four men figured they were safe because they were 10 to 13
miles from the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a Hispanic co-worker higher up on the ridge came
racing downhill shouting, in Spanish, ''The volcano is exploding!''
</P>
<P>
   Scymanky threw his saw aside and then -- BOOM -- he heard what
sounded like two jetliners bearing down on him. Within seconds, the
forest around him was leveled and he felt himself suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   The men tried to seek relief from their burns -- Scymanky said
his cotton gloves had melted onto his hands -- by heading down to a
river that usually runs cold and fast. But it had turned into
''gray muck.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, they sought shelter in their logging truck, which had been
moved by the blast but remained upright. The four squeezed into the
cab, increasing the pain from their burns as their shoulders and
arms touched. Finally, they could bear it no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to just get the hell out of there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four set off walking down a logging road. Scymanky said he
later learned from rescuers that they hiked 4.5 miles before
reaching a huge avalanche that blocked the road. The river below
was rising quickly as mud and volcanic debris filled the valley.
</P>
<P>
   They were trapped. Scymanky figured there was no hope of rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought to myself -- and I didn't say it to anyone else --
'how long is it going to take to die? This is a long, painful
death.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his colleagues made fateful decisions. One tried to climb
over the avalanche, while the other tried to beat the mudflow and
cross the valley below. Neither lived.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the helicopters arrived and carried Scymanky
and his lone remaining co-worker to safety. The co-worker later
died.
</P>
<P>
   Scymanky, who suffered burns on his back, neck, arms and legs,
never logged again. He now makes a living restoring antique cars.
</P>
<P>
   He has been back several times to the area where he believes --
he's not sure because the eruption completely transformed the
landscape around the mountain -- he almost died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, I still can't believe I made it out of there,'' he
said.

Tory Leader Vows To Enter Commons by Fall
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- Tory Leader Joe Clark says he will seek a Commons
seat by this fall, hoping to maintain some momentum for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Tories are anxious to have Clark back in Parliament so he can
raise his profile and battle the insurgent Canadian Alliance for
support where it counts -- in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''I repeat I'll be running in the federal election in Calgary
Center ... but in any event I expect to be in the House of Commons
by way of a by-election at least by the fall session,'' Clark said
Sunday as a four-day policy convention wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   The platforms approved by delegates include eliminating the
capital gains tax on personal income, a mandated elimination of the
federal debt within 25 years or less, and stable health care
funding to the provinces.

Documentary Focuses on Leper Colony
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Visitors to a campground on
D'Arcy Island near Victoria often sense an eerie feeling that
sharply contrasts with the tranquillity of the forested area
surrounded by pebble beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to most, they are treading on unmarked graves from a
sad and unacknowledged part of British Columbia's past.
</P>
<P>
   The island once housed a leper colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember getting off the boat and feeling a chill run
through my body,'' says Erik Paulsson, a documentary filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The story of what happened on D'Arcy Island between 1891 and
1924 is not recorded in any history books.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsson found out about the leper colony after reading a short
blurb in the back of a travel guide.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Columbia Archives in Victoria, Paulsson learned
that D'Arcy Island was virtually an escape-proof prison for lepers,
almost all of them Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a compelling and haunting documentary called
Island of Shadows: D'Arcy Island Leper Colony, 1891-1924.
</P>
<P>
   It premieres nationally May 17 on Vision TV at 7 p.m.

British Columbia Liberal Party Begins Nisga'a Nation Treaty
Challenge
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Only days after their
historic treaty took effect and the Nisga'a began to exert control
over their traditional territory, the British Columbia Liberal
party begins a court battle Monday to challenge the validity of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals want the British Columbia Supreme Court to declare
that the treaty creates a third order of government -- a violation
of the Constitution -- and valid ratification therefore requires a
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Under British Columbia law, such an amendment requires a
provincewide referendum, something the current NDP government has
steadfastly refused.
</P>
<P>
   If they win, the case is sure to be appealed and would likely
eventually end up in the Supreme Court of Canada.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Free Some U.N. Personnel  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels freed 139 of
more than 500 U.N. personnel held captive into Liberian custody,
Liberia's President Charles Taylor said Sunday, hours after U.N.
officials in Freetown secured the release of 18 others.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, speaking in Liberia's capital, said 15 members of the
latest group had been flown by government-chartered helicopter to
Monrovia, while the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from
the Liberian border town of Foya, 130 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor briefly introduced an Associated Press reporter to two
smiling but tired-looking men wearing new uniforms whom the
president said were freed Kenyan and Zambian peacekeepers. West
African and U.N. officials including Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
envoy to Liberia, Felix Downes-Thomas, stood by silently during the
meeting in the living room of Taylor's presidential mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokesman in Sierra Leone's capital said he was unaware
of the releases and officials at United Nations headquarters in New
York said they were unable to immediately confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the freed peacekeepers had been held in Sierra
Leone's eastern Kailahun district.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had been asked by regional leaders to mediate with
the rebels, lashed out at the United States, whom he said had
refused to offer air transport to evacuate the captives. Instead,
he said the captives had been forced to trek for nearly three days
through heavily forested eastern Sierra Leone to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Comment was not immediately available from U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberian president also warned that continued attacks by
Sierra Leone's pro-government forces against the rebels ''threaten
the lives'' of the remaining U.N. captives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday in Freetown, the rebels handed over 18 U.N.
peacekeepers -- 11 Indian troops and seven unarmed military
observers of various nationalities -- were released to U.N. soldiers
at Kailahun, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the U.N. force, Vijay Tetley, said the 18
captives freed in Sierra Leone were in good physical condition and
had not been harmed by the rebels. ''This gives us a glimmer of
hope for the future,'' Jetley said of the releases.
</P>
<P>
   The freed peacekeepers were among more than 500 members of a
U.N. force who were disarmed and taken into custody by
Revolutionary United Front rebels, who unilaterally ended a
10-month peace and restarted Sierra Leone's civil war earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In their eight-year campaign against various governments, the
RUF rebels have killed tens of thousands and intentionally
mutilated and dismembered many more men, women and children in a
bid to gain power through intimidation. Last July, they signed a
peace deal giving rebel leaders top government posts and amnesty
for war atrocities. The U.N. peacekeepers were sent to Sierra Leone
to oversee that peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels damaged the accord by taking peacekeepers
hostage. Then, a week ago, they opened fire on unarmed
demonstrators outside rebel chief Foday Sankoh's home. Thirteen
civilians and six soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, thousands of residents of towns near the
capital have fled into Freetown, fearing renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile pro-government alliance includes ex-junta soldiers
once allied to the RUF rebels and ragtag traditional hunter
militiamen known as Kamajors. After both its victories on Saturday
and Sunday, the troops staged raucous celebrations, arguing among
themselves and firing guns in the air, said journalists traveling
with the troops. No civilians were visible in the town.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Britain, Sierra Leone's former colonial
ruler, reaffirmed that its troops would not get sucked into the
civil war. Britain has contributed some 700 paratroopers, but only
to help U.N. peacekeepers, pro-government militiamen and ex-army
soldiers protect the airport and organize a defense of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The British mission was originally intended to evacuate its
expatriates from Freetown. That goal has been largely accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Guthrie, Britain's chief of Defense Staff, flew
into Freetown on Sunday from Senegal to evaluate the British
mission, saying its objective was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job here is to evacuate people, to secure this airfield
and though we are not part of the United Nations (peacekeeping
force), to give help to U.N. forces,'' Guthrie said. He declined to
answer questions about whether the British were preparing for a
possible offensive role.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Freetown have pleaded with the British troops
to stay. The British contingent has given pro-government forces
confidence that they have a safe rear guard in Freetown against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United Nations, they really let us down. But with the
British we are safe,'' said Michael Cesay, a security guard at a
Freetown church.

base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians

<HEADLINE> Waco Expert's Death Said Setback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A lawyer representing surviving Branch
Davidians in a wrongful-death lawsuit says the death of an infrared
expert who contended that shots were fired by the government during
the Waco siege is a major setback in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not giving up, but I don't know how we'll replace Carlos
Ghigliotti,'' said attorney Mike Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   Ghigliotti was hired last fall by the House Government Reform
Committee to review an FBI infrared videotape taken on the final
day of the Branch Davidian siege in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Washington Post that he had determined that repeated
flashes on the video came from government gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Ghigliotti's decomposed body at his office at
Infrared Technologies Corp. in Laurel, Md., on April 28 after a
building manager became concerned that the analyst had not been
seen for several weeks. A preliminary autopsy report showed the
42-year-old died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs had already notified the federal court that they
planned to use Ghigliotti as an expert witness in the trial, set to
begin June 19 in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he will take the depositions of British infrared
experts at Vector Data Systems, who were among those who conducted
a March 19 field test at Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the simulation to videotapes from the last day of
the siege, Vector found that the 1993 flashes were caused by
reflections off metal and glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were unable to identify any gunfire, either from government
forces or from Davidians, from either the (infrared tapes) or other
collateral imagery available to us,'' their report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said no one on their side fired any
shots on April 19, 1993, the day that a federal tear-gas assault
ended in a fire that destroyed the compound. More than 80 sect
members, including leader David Koresh, were killed.

<HEADLINE> Tens of thousands rally for strict gun control  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of mothers, many accompanied
by children and husbands, rallied in sight of the Capitol Sunday to
demand strict control of handguns while memorializing loved ones
and strangers felled by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Through personal stories of tragedy, songs, banners, posters,
T-shirts and tears, participants in the ''Million Mom March'' aimed
to send Congress a ''Mother's Day'' message: A new movement of
mainstream Americans is getting politically active, ready to battle
the gun lobby and to work against lawmakers who oppose gun control.
The march was organized by mother Donna Dees-Thomases of Short
Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politicians, take heed. We are watching you. The hands that
rock the cradles rule the world,'' said Dawn Anna, mother of Lauren
Townsend, a student killed in the Columbine High School shootings
that stunned the nation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Huge crowds thronged to the National Mall, the blocks-long grass
and gravel terrain that has been host to many Washington
demonstrations, under a brilliant spring sun. Though there were no
official crowd estimates, participants filled half a dozen blocks
on the mall framed by the museums of the Smithsonian Institution,
Congress and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds ranging from a few hundred to an estimated 4,000 in
Chicago and 5,000 in Denver showed up at similar rallies in dozens
of cities across the country -- from Maine to Michigan to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are Columbine,'' exclaimed a banner carried by Coloradans
who traveled here in remembrance of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control advocates didn't have the day to themselves,
however. A considerably smaller group of several thousand
counter-demonstrators gathered near the Washington Monument to hold
a rally where they argued that guns were needed for
self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   That demonstration, organized by a group called Second Amendment
Sisters, Inc., also included mothers who brought their children.
The group booed President Clinton's motorcade as it happened to
pass by, returning the president to the White House from church.
</P>
<P>
   ''My kids know, if you see a gun, you don't touch it. You leave
the area, you go tell a responsible adult,'' said Elitza Meyer,
from Watchung, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   When opponents of gun control marched toward the Capitol, they
came close to ''Million Mom March'' participants, who jeered and
chanted ''No NRA, No NRA. Your stupid guns kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, members of the pro-gun group yelled, ''Second
Amendment, civil rights. You give up your guns, we'll give up
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained at the White House, encouraging several hundred
rally figures to surmount ''the political mountain'' they had to
climb. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for a U.S. Senate
seat from New York, joined the demonstration. Neither she nor the
president appeared on the dais, although their messages carried on
jumbo television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did join the march for a time, but the crush of
onlookers forced her to a nearby road where she slowly made her way
to the Capitol on her own, shaking hands with well-wishers who
lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Maryland Democrat and a
daughter of the slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, said: ''You know,
Mothers Against Drunk Driving had an enormous impact against
traffic deaths and I think we can have the same impact here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, elected officials stood in the
background; the day was reserved instead for supportive
entertainers, including mistress of ceremonies Rosie O'Donnell, a
television talk show host, and for women who told painful, personal
stories of losing loved ones to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gun that killed my daughter in her classroom was one that
could be loaded by a 6-year-old, carried by a 6-year-old, and fired
by a 6-year-old,'' said Veronica McQueen, who was transformed into
a public figure when her daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot and
killed in her first grade classroom in Flint, Mich., last Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   For the gun-control rally, thousands of Mother's Day cards were
printed with the message: ''Forget the flowers ... forget the
chocolate ... forget breakfast in bed. This Mother's Day, give us a
present that lasts: common sense gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   There was room for personal notes to members of Congress, and
the cards were deposited in a letter slot beneath a model of the
Capitol Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Payne, of Woodbridge, Va., said he was a competitive
shooter and life member of the National Rifle Association but still
supported the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like Handgun Control Incorporated and I don't like the
hard line of the NRA,'' he said. ''People misuse guns and give my
guns a bad name. What I resent is handguns in the hands of
unsupervised kids, and parents who don't take time to control their
own weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Million Mom March'' principally wants trigger locks to
protect children and a national system that would register handguns
and license their owners. All major gun control legislation before
Congress has been stalled for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But blocks from the House and Senate chambers, Erika Heilbrink,
9, of Falls Church, Va., carried a poster with a toy gun stapled to
it. ''This gun has the same childproofing as a real gun. None,''
the poster said.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Reyes, of Washington's Maryland suburbs, carried a sign
saying, ''My son is not here this Mother's Day.'' Reyes said she
moved to the United States from Guatemala 30 years ago to keep her
children safe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of her six children, Nelson, then 29, was shot to death
in 1998 on a Washington, D.C. street by an elderly man who objected
to him parking in front of his house.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies After Running Marathon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A 39-year-old Quebec man collapsed and died Sunday
after finishing the National Capital Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Legare, of Lac. St. Charles, collapsed just yards past the
finish line where his wife and two of his three children were
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Legare, a researcher with the Canadian Forest Service and an
experienced marathon runner, was rushed into a nearby medical tent.
When he didn't respond to CPR, the staff used electrical shocks to
get Legare's heart to start again.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken by ambulance to a hospital where he was pronounced
dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was scheduled for Monday to determine the cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just staggered in and fell,'' said Andre Lachance, 67, a
former marathon runner. ''You could tell by the way the medical
people were acting that something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Legare is the first person to die while running the 26-year-old
event, although several runners have had heart attacks. Race
organizers wouldn't comment on the death.
</P>
<P>
   Legare completed the race in 3 hours, 3 minutes and 3 seconds --
believed to be a personal best. In 1998, he finished the Marathon
des Deux-Rives in Quebec City in 3:06:59. He completed the same
race last year in 3:07:06.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Deacon of Victoria, British Columbia won the race in
2:17:12.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israeli Troops Clash  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Frustration over stalled negotiations exploded
into violence Sunday as thousands of Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli troops -- demonstrations that left one Palestinian dead
and about 38 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli
army base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones
and Molotov cocktails over the fence. Palestinian police
halfheartedly chased away some of the demonstrators, and Israeli
troops fired rubber-coated steel pellets, injuring at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   Similar clashes involving thousands of Palestinians took place
in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah, injuring 11
Palestinians, an army officer and a border policeman, none
seriously. Those clashes began as marches commemorated Monday's
52nd anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe'' -- the term
Palestinians use to refer to Israel's creation, which displaced
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hussam Al-Jouhari of Rafidiye hospital in Nablus said five
of the protesters were injured by bullets. The Israeli army would
not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a meeting to discuss the release of 1,600
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli attacks ended in near
deadlock, with Israeli negotiator Oded Eran demanding that
Palestinian police first quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''No talks can produce positive results while the violent
demonstrations continue,'' Eran told reporters, but he said Israel
would continue to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who has given Israel
a list of 200 prisoners he wants freed, said he told Eran that
''the reason for these demonstrations must be addressed.''
Palestinian negotiator Qaddura Fares said the protests would
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern West Bank city of Qalqilya a young Palestinian
was killed in a clash with Israeli soldiers, a doctor said. Samar
Ahmad Awartani, 17, was fatally hit by a bullet in the chest, said
the doctor at Qalqilya hospital, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He added that about 12 demonstrators were injured by
rubber-coated steel pellets fired by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Megiddo military prison in northern Israel, guards fired
tear gas after prisoners holding a rally refused to disperse. The
army said the prisoners threw objects at the guards and burned
their tents.
</P>
<P>
   One guard and two prisoners were slightly injured, the army
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Palestinian family has a male relative who spent
some time in Israeli jails, and many Palestinian ministers and
lawmakers are former prisoners. Israel has released hundreds of
prisoners as part of detailed peace accords but says it will not
release Palestinians jailed for killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of violence comes as Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are having trouble reaching agreement on the thorniest
issues of the conflict between the sides: the future of Jerusalem,
claimed by both sides as their capital, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and final borders of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said in a statement
that while it did not accuse the Palestinian Authority of
instigating ''the violent winds'' sweeping across the Palestinian
areas, it expected Palestinian police to prevent the escalation.
The statement said that Israel had already fulfilled its obligation
to release prisoners as part of interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   In a move not directly related to the talks, Israel released
Salah Shihadah, a founder of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who
had spent nearly 12 years in an Israeli prison. Shihadah, 45,
served a 10-year sentence for ''security violations'' but had been
held since 1998 under so-called administrative detention, a clause
that allows security officials to jail suspects without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said Shihadah was the first commander of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, and organized the kidnapping and
killing of two Israeli soldiers. Prisoner Services spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said Shihadah continued his involvement with Hamas
from his prison cell but would not say if he was involved in the
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority has arrested Mohammed Deif, a high
ranking Hamas leader who is at the top of Israel's wanted list, a
Palestinian security source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel holds Deif responsible for a series of suicide bombing
attacks which killed 47 Israelis and injured 96, the Israeli
justice ministry said when it requested Deif's extradition last
year.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Unveil Social Security Plan  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeing Gov. George W. Bush reach out and touch
the legendary third rail of American politics is a bit of a shock
to some people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody has really run on a Social Security reform platform --
ever,'' conservative policy analyst David C. John said with a
slight sense of wonder. ''He's going to have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is betting that the potentially hazardous subject can
energize political fortunes, not just zap them into cinders.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Republican presidential candidate is set to make
the case that workers should be given the opportunity to invest a
portion of their payroll taxes on their own behalf -- and that the
costs of letting them do so can be borne alongside his tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic rival Al Gore is promising a sustained fight in
defense of a universal retirement system that pays Americans
less-than-stellar benefits but is held dear by them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that places the candidates in odd juxtaposition: a
conservative Republican looking ahead to the opportunities -- and
inevitably, the risks -- of a new economy in which half of American
households are invested in the stock market; and a trend-spotting
Democrat who, on this subject, wants to shore up the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said, 'Why are you bringing up such a touchy issue?'
Bush said Friday, when the recently volatile stock market moved up
a hair. ''I said, because I'm running to lead, is why.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to pay down the national debt and use the savings
from interest payments to support Social Security. He's been
spinning dark scenarios from Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think about what happens when that first generation of
Americans retires in a bear market,'' he said in Oregon. ''They
would be left trying to live on worthless paper and we as a nation
could be stuck with sky-high bailout costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of personal retirement accounts say the market has
never failed to rise in value over any 20-year period, even in bad
times, since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are tempted by the idea, but skittish, polls suggest.
Those mentioning the possibility of stock market declines show
support for partial privatization dropping below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is appealing to an emerging class of voters, including a
new generation of senior citizens, who have been investing in the
stock market and 401(k) retirement accounts and may be more open to
the idea of trusting Wall Street with their Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   When he introduces his plan, he is not expected to give many
specifics, now or in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Texas governor will continue to couch the issue as
he has done so far -- as a way to strengthen the basic Social
Security system while giving workers a chance, if they want it, to
make their retirement more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   In any Social Security debate, details are especially devilish,
says John, who lays out the argument for partial privatization in
his chapter of an 860-page ''briefing book'' compiled by the
Heritage Foundation for conservative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's much better served by being fairly vague on the topic,''
he said. ''There are a lot of tiny little details on any Social
Security plan that can trip up a candidate and it can easily be
turned into something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore needs details. In their absence, he's been able to
attack Bush for promoting a ''secret plan'' that could wreck Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats in Congress who support personal retirement
accounts or think they are worth exploring have suggested that Gore
cool off and stop using ''scare'' words.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, sponsors of a bipartisan plan in Congress for
personal retirement accounts wrote to both candidates asking them
to keep the debate clean. ''No matter where one stands on these
ideas, we must begin to talk honestly and directly, without
resorting to partisan attacks and demagoguery,'' wrote Democratic
Rep. Charlie Stenholm of Texas and GOP Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A particular challenge for Bush and other advocates of personal
retirement accounts is explaining how the basic system can be
strengthened by diverting perhaps 20 percent of the taxes that now
support Social Security retirement to individual stocks or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   According to a liberal economic analysis by the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, personal retirement accounts could mean
insolvency of Social Security trust funds 14 years sooner than is
now expected.
</P>
<P>
   Most prototypes require high start-up costs spread over several
decades, at least.
</P>
<P>
   That's because workers opting for personal accounts would be
putting less money into Social Security for many years before they
retire and start drawing the lower Social Security benefits --
supplemented by their own investments.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the expense will be less than if the system is left
as is, advocates argue. But until then, tough decisions would loom
about how to pay for the transition, and Bush is not filling in the
blanks.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Remembered As Changing Japan  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, an
unassuming ruling party stalwart who defied early predictions of
failure as premier, died Sunday, more than a month after suffering
a debilitating stroke while in office. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi died in Tokyo's Juntendo Hospital, said Michiko Shimizu,
an aide. Doctors blamed his death on complications from the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was prime minister when he was stricken and hospitalized
April 2. He later lapsed into a coma and was put on artificial
respiration. Days later, parliament elected Yoshiro Mori as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998 to widespread
expectations that his humble manner meant he lacked the nerve to
handle the country's deepening economic problems. The son of a
national lawmaker from Gunma Prefecture north of Tokyo would soon
prove his critics wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Before falling ill, Obuchi had established a solid record as
premier: He put Japan on a massive public spending plan to pull it
out of recession and pushed controversial legislation through
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His impact on the political scene was expected to continue even
after death. Analysts predicted that the outpouring of public
sympathy would give the ruling Liberal Democratic Party a boost in
parliamentary elections. The vote does not have to be held until
October, but Mori has indicated he will call it on a day laden with
symbolism -- June 25, Obuchi's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences after his death crossed both national borders and
party lines. Leaders worldwide offered their sympathy, while the
hundreds who gathered Sunday night at Obuchi's Tokyo home included
both senior LDP members and some of his most outspoken critics from
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
were saddened by Obuchi's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say again how very grateful I am for the leadership
that he gave to Japan during a very critical time and for the
partnership he gave to the United States,'' Clinton said at the
White House. ''I liked him very, very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori expressed his sadness over the loss of his mentor. ''He
dealt decisively with important measures affecting this nation's
economic revival as well as its internal and foreign policies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi's policies were bold, the results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   He helped set the Japanese economy on the path to recovery, but
his successors will pay the price. All the spending has given the
country an enormous fiscal deficit, and over the past six months,
support for his government has been dropping.
</P>
<P>
   But most seem to agree that one thing is undeniable: He proved
he was up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did what needed to be done -- bringing stability and a sense
of security to the Japanese economy,'' said Keith Henry, a public
policy analyst for the Tokyo-based Asia Strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to underestimate Obuchi. While other top politicians
grabbed headlines, Obuchi toiled behind the scenes, working his way
up the LDP ranks. A foreign analyst once said Obuchi had the
charisma of ''cold pizza,'' a comparison the Japanese media quickly
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi won election to Japan's powerful lower house of
parliament in 1963 at the age of 26 -- inheriting, in common
Japanese fashion, the seat held previously by his father. He first
served as a Cabinet official in 1979. In 1993, he became the
Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, one of three key party posts.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Obuchi took control of the biggest of several
rival factions in the LDP. He became foreign minister in 1997 -- a
post considered a stepping stone to the premiership.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's humble image was often cited as a key to his success.
Instead of the hard-driving style that is often frowned upon in
Japan, Obuchi favored low-key consensus-building.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, Obuchi is widely credited with furthering
Japan's warming relations with Russia and building closer ties with
South Korea, China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, he cobbled together an unwieldy
three-party ruling coalition. The coalition broke up just before
Obuchi fell ill, but the LDP still held enough seats in parliament
to guarantee its grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. A
private funeral was scheduled for Tuesday at Tokyo's Aoyama Funeral
Hall.

<HEADLINE> Drama Desk Awards Handed Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Copenhagen'' was chosen best play of the New
York theater season and ''Contact'' best musical Sunday by the
Drama Desk, an organization of theater journalists and critics.
</P>
<P>
   A revival of ''Kiss Me, Kate'' picked up six awards, more than
any other show. In addition to its prize for best musical revival,
the 1948 Cole Porter musical won awards for its star, Brian Stokes
Mitchell; director, Michael Blakemore; set design, Robin Wagner;
costume design, Martin Pakledinaz, and orchestrations, Don Sebesky.
Blakemore won a second direction award for his work on
''Copenhagen,'' which was written by Michael Frayn.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stoppard's ''The Real Thing'' was named best revival-play,
and its leading man, Stephen Dillane, won the top acting prize.
Eileen Heckert, who plays a woman suffering from Alzheimer's in
''The Waverly Galley,'' received the best-actress trophy. Heather
Headley, who portrays the title character in Disney's ''Aida,''
took home the prize for best actress in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lippa, who wrote the score for the off-Broadway
production of ''The Wild Party,'' was honored for best music, while
Stephen Sondheim won the Drama Desk award for best lyrics for
''Saturday Night,'' a show he wrote in the early 1950s but which
was not seen in New York until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' a dance musical, received three other awards
besides the top musical prize: choreography, Susan Stroman;
featured actress-musical, Karen Ziemba, and lighting design, Peter
Kaczorowski.
</P>
<P>
   The Drama Desk, which was founded in 1949, honors both Broadway
and off-Broadway productions.

<HEADLINE> 263 species seen in 'World Series of Birding'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Bird-watchers throughout New Jersey
cataloged 263 species in 24 hours in the state Audubon Society's
annual ''World Series of Birding.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition pitted 63 teams against each other to
see who could spot the most species of birds in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The winning team, sponsored by Nikon, saw 219 different species
by the time the contest ended Sunday morning. That topped by one
the second-place team, sponsored by Carl Zeiss Optical.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zeiss team inadvertently left one species off its tally
sheet, said team captain Peter Dunne, and the ''bird cards'' can't
be altered once they're turned in to contest officials.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the first-place team agreed to share the award with
the second-place team.
</P>
<P>
   The teams operate on the honor system when they claim to have
spotted a particular species.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your word is your bond in birding,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikon team consisted of Paul Guris, Adrian Binns, Megan
Edwards and Mike Fritz, all of Pennsylvania; and Bill Stocku of
Sierra Vista, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The Zeiss team consisted of Dunne, Don Freiday of Hunterdon,
Richard Crossley of West Cape May, and Will Russell of Tuscon,
Ariz.

Sierra Leone Rebels Free 139 U.N. Personnel

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Hours after U.N. officials in Freetown secured
the release of 18 others, Sierra Leone's rebels freed 139 of more than 500 U.N.
personnel held captive into Liberian custody, Liberia's President Charles Taylor
said Sunday. Taylor said 15 of the freed captives had been flown by helicopter
to Monrovia, while the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from the

   SINGAPORE (AP) -- A newspaper report said today nine foreign women married to
Singaporeans have been expelled because they have contracted HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. The Sunday Times, citing unidentified sources, said that the women
were mainly from Thailand, Indonesia, China and the Philippines. The women, who
are not Singaporean citizens, carry social passes, which allow them to stay in
Singapore for a period of up to a year. The report said another 10 women
infected with the virus were expecting to be sent home.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The parents of an American teen-ager slain on the West
Bank have filed suit in a federal court in Chicago against Islamic groups and
charities, claiming they raised money in the United States for Hamas, a radical
Islamic group that has carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis.
In an apparently unprecedented move, Stanley and Joyce Boim, invoked the federal
anti-terrorism law of 1990 against what their $600 million suit described as
Hamas-front organizations and individuals who collected funds in the United
States for relief and development on the West Bank and in Gaza.

Mothers Rally for Strict Gun Control
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of mothers rallied in sight of the
Capitol today to demand strict control of handguns. Participants in the
''Million Mom March'' aimed to send Congress a ''Mother's Day'' message: A new
movement of mainstream Americans is getting politically active, ready to battle
the gun lobby and to work against lawmakers who oppose gun control. Huge crowds
thronged to the National Mall, Congress and the Washington Monument. Crowds
ranging from a few hundred to an estimated 4,000 in Chicago and 5,000 in Denver
showed up at similar rallies in dozens of cities across the country -- from
Maine to Michigan to Oregon.

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Hundreds of evacuated residents of Los Alamos
returned today to seared homes, blackened yards and still-smoking vistas of
their abandoned town. Families without homes came together in Red Cross shelters
to mark the holiday, while churchgoers mourned their own losses but expressed
relief that nobody was hurt. The 7,000 people of neighboring White Rock,
meanwhile, were allowed to go home. The buses left Santa Fe for Los Alamos
throughout the day, carrying counselors, clergy and 389 residents.

Waco Expert's Death Said Setback
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A lawyer representing surviving Branch Davidians in a
wrongful-death lawsuit says the death of an infrared expert who contended that
shots were fired by the government during the Waco siege is a major setback in
the case. ''We're not giving up, but I don't know how we'll replace Carlos
Ghigliotti,'' said attorney Mike Caddell. Ghigliotti was hired last fall by the
House Government Reform Committee to review an FBI infrared videotape taken on
the final day of the Branch Davidian siege in 1993. He told The Washington Post
that he had determined that repeated flashes on the video came from government
gunfire.

Tobacco Industry To Fight Verdict
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida jury that already found tobacco companies conspired
to sell a dangerous product will begin this week to consider a possible punitive
penalty. Anti-smoking activists are looking for a day of reckoning for an
industry that has yet to pay a penny to smokers who went to trial. Big Tobacco
plans to offer its $250 billion settlement over 25 years with states and
restrictions on youth marketing as proof that no more punishment is needed in
the landmark case brought by an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers. But
opponents expect the nation's five biggest cigarette makers to pay billions
more.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks edged lower Monday morning in light
trading ahead of a key U.S. monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. The
U.S. dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 36.93 points,
or 0.21 percent, to 17,320.93 points at the end of the morning
session. On Friday, the average closed up 457.40 points, or 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 108.68 yen in late morning, up 0.38 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 108.89
yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started slightly lower Monday ahead
of the Federal Reserve Board meeting, when Fed policy-makers are
widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates by half a percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Tokyo shares will remain in a tight range as
players want to monitor the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting and
the impact of the expected interest rate hike on recently volatile
U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.40 points
to 10,609.37 at Friday's close. The Nasdaq composite index rose
29.49 points to close at 3,529.07 points.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,630.06
points. The TOPIX closed up 29.76 points, or 1.0 percent, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range as
many players retreated to the sidelines prior to Tuesday's Fed
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said stock and currency markets reacted little to a
25-percent rise in Japan's current account surplus in March
compared to the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's broadest measure of trade rose to 1.298 trillion yen
(dlrs 11.9 billion) in March, measured before adjustment for
seasonal factors, Japan's Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors paid scant attention to the announcement, however, as
the data is susceptible to sizable fluctuations, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.83 yen, up from
97.64 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7100 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7000 percent. Its price
fell 0.09 point to 100.77.

<HEADLINE> Intense Earthquake Hits Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A strong earthquake hit a remote area
of Indonesia on Monday, shaking houses and damaging buildings. No
casualties were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck central Sulawesi Island, 120 miles from the
site of an even stronger temblor May 4 that killed more than 46
people, injured more than 100 others and left 30,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's magnitude 6.2 quake was centered under the sea 350
miles southeast of the town of Palu, the Hong Kong Observatory
said. The town is 930 miles northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, is prone to
frequent seismic upheavals, sitting on major fault lines.

<HEADLINE> Power still out in Warren County; utility distributing water, ice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- GPU Energy said Sunday it is
distributing potable water and dry ice to customers in part of
Warren County who lost power from Saturday night's severe
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The storms caused widespread outages in the county's Washington
area, where high winds and lightning seriously damaged GPU Energy
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had 30-sum odd (utility) polls ripped out of the ground''
in that area, GPU spokesman Ron Morano said Sunday night. ''It was
pretty serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported wind damage in Washington
Township and numerous trees down along Route 57. Wind gusts of 58
mph were reported in nearby Harmony Township, where trees and wires
along Route 519 were torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Warren County, trees were reported blown down in
Franklin Township and Blairstown.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 29,000 GPU customers in New Jersey lost power
during the storm. All but 4,000 in the Washington area had service
restored by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''The customers that are out in that area are probably going to
be out until ... midday Tuesday,'' Morano said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, those customers can pick up dry ice and potable
water -- if they bring their own containers -- at the Harmony
Township Volunteer Fire Company on Brainards Road.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony Mayor Henry F. Skirbst said the storm spared almost
nothing in its path there, prompting him to declare a state of
emergency late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The township is devastated,'' he said Sunday. ''I've never
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Skirbst said officials were urging the local school district to
cancel classes until the township's situation improves. Some homes
still had no electricity, water or telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents claimed a tornado hit Harmony Saturday night, but
the National Weather Service said a funnel cloud in the area did
not touch down.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusting at 60-90 mph ripped off the tin roof and leveled
half of a barn on Garrison Road. At a property down the street,
wind gusts snapped off the top of a chimney and nearly destroyed
the roof and garage.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mitch Meluskey hit a three-run homer and Scott
Elarton limited Cincinnati to four hits in seven innings as the
Houston Astros won 10-3 Sunday night, snapping the Reds' six-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Houston won for the first time in three games and improved to
6-12 at Enron Field, the Astros' new home ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's homer, his fifth of the year, broke a 2-2 tie in the
fifth inning. He drove in Jeff Bagwell, who was hit by a pitch, and
Richard Hidalgo, who walked. Meluskey, who was 2-for-4 with two
runs scored, hit the first pitch over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (2-0) allowed two runs, struck out a season high eight
and walked five. He protected Houston's four-run lead in the
seventh, fanning Dmitri Young with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was 0-for-4 with a walk, had his career-high 18-game
hitting streak -- the NL's longest this season -- snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (2-5) lasted six innings and allowed six runs on 10
hits. He struck out three and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took a 2-0 lead in the first when Dante Bichette
singled to left-center, driving in Sean Casey and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who went 3-for-4, drove in Hidalgo from second with
a single to left center, cutting the deficit in half. The Astros
then loaded the bases on Meluskey's single and a walk to Elarton.
Roger Cedeno hit into a double play that scored Meluskey and tied
it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   After Meluskey gave the Astros the lead in the fifth, Bagwell's
RBI double in the sixth made it 6-2. Houston added four runs in the
eighth, highlighted by Bagwell's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Reds first baseman Sean Casey and third base coach Ron Oester
were ejected by plate umpire Mike Van Vleet after arguing a called
third strike in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro's triple to left center in the eighth off Joe
Slusarski drove in Eddie Taubensee with Cincinnati's final run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The attendance was 41,882, the Astros' seventh sellout in
18 home games ... Pokey Reese and Cedeno each stole one base to
remain tied for the NL lead with 14. ... Reds pitchers lead the
majors with 32 wild pitches.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Residents Tour Damage  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Made refugees by fire, hundreds of
evacuated residents of Los Alamos solemnly returned Sunday in
convoys of yellow school buses to the seared homes, blackened yards
and still-smoking vistas of their abandoned town.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of loss and joy marked Mother's Day for the region's
weary residents. Families without homes came together in Red Cross
shelters to mark the holiday, while churchgoers mourned their own
losses but expressed relief that nobody was hurt. In a sign of life
returning to normal, the 7,000 people of nearby White Rock, which
wasn't burned, were allowed to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The most poignant scenes, though, came in Los Alamos, where the
buses arrived from Santa Fe throughout the day. They carried
counselors, clergy and 389 residents up winding roads to the
mountain community of 11,000 that was suddenly emptied of life four
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip home was incomplete: Access was limited, and most
were forced to see the damage from behind windows as the buses
slowly moved through town. The handful who did get off the bus
photographed or videotaped the damage, but were told not to get too
close.
</P>
<P>
   Only residents whose homes were destroyed were allowed back into
Los Alamos. Burned-out cars sat near scorched trees in
neighborhoods now painted in shades of gray. In one lot, a
solitary, charred brick staircase climbed a story high. Nearby
stood a pair of apparently untouched wood bird feeders, one with
seed still in it.
</P>
<P>
   Some cried, and others sat in stony silence, seemingly stunned
by the extent of the destruction, said Jack Downing, a Red Cross
psychologist who traveled on one of the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Opsahl, a 64-year-old Red Cross volunteer whose home was
still smoldering, said she was more worried about her neighbors
than about her own loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're already starting to think about rebuilding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of White Rock were allowed to return to their
homes three days after they were evacuated in the middle of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready to go right now,'' said Agnes Finn, who shouted with
joy after hearing the decision at a Red Cross shelter at Pojoaque
High School. ''It's good news, but after I let out my shriek, I
almost felt guilty because some of my friends had lost their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 8-year-old son, William, came up and asked: ''Can't we just
go home?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, residents gathered for church services and
Mother's Day celebrations, searching for meaning in a fire that was
intentionally set by the government to clear brush and grass then,
fed by winds, swept across a swath of northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki Mang spent the morning with her four children, ranging in
age from 2 to 8, at a Pojoaque shelter, where a Mother's Day turkey
brunch was held for displaced families.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Joe, was in Los Alamos helping with a database
tracking the fire's damage.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't mind not being the center of attention this
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got out of there with our lives and our kids,'' she said.
''No matter what comes of this, I have the most valuable things.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire grew to 42,200 acres on Sunday, but fire officials said
wind and cooler weather helped the more than 1,000 firefighters
battling the blaze. They used bulldozers and other equipment to
clear vegetation that could catch fire; others used helicopters and
plane to dump water and fire retardant. Near White Rock, crews had
cut away an eight-mile stretch of vegetation to stop the fire from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Although homes weren't in danger, residents of Abiquiu, the town
that inspired painter Georgia O'Keeffe, were encouraged to leave as
the fire knifed across canyons and plateaus carpeted in ponderosa,
juniper and pinon.
</P>
<P>
   The danger to Los Alamos and neighboring White Rock receded
Friday. By that time, the fire had destroyed 260 homes and
threatened the high-security Los Alamos National Laboratory, one of
the nation's most important facilities for nuclear weapons
research.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's major facilities emerged unscathed, but the fire
destroyed several trailers, a temporary building and workshops and
offices that were part of the lab complex where the atomic bomb was
built in a World War II program known as the Manhattan Project.
Officials said they would delay the planned reopening Monday to
allow for more safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos residents will not be allowed to return to their
homes permanently until the end of the week, perhaps later,
emergency officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt promised residents they will
have answers by Thursday about why the National Park Service
started the blaze May 4 at neighboring Bandelier National Monument.
Park Superintendent Roy Weaver was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation, and Babbitt said all prescribed fires in the West
would be put on hold for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If mistakes were made people will be held accountable, there's
no question about that,'' Babbitt said Sunday on ABC's ''This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   North of Los Alamos, the fire had threatened cliff dwellings
considered sacred by the Santa Clara Pueblo. But crews were able to
stop the flames an eighth of a mile from the visitor's center, said
Calvin Tafoya, the tribal administrator.
