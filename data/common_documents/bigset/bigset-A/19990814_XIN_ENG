UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of 14 senior
U.S. Congressional staff members paid a visit to the United
Nations, and exchanged views with senior U.N. officials here on
the U.S.-U.N. ties and the U.N. operations in Kosovo, the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such delegation which toured the United
Nations since May 1999, an event considered by the U.N. and
Congressional staff participants as an important step in binding
the U.S.-U.N. divide.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was organized by the Humpty Dempty Institute
(HDI), a not-for-profit organization with its headquarters in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Cwerman, HDI president, said, "The institute recognizes
that a robust U.S.-U.N. relations -- one capable of surviving
frank discourse and punctuated policy departures -- requires
trust, engendered through increased interaction and exchange
between the American public policy-makers, and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the largest debtor, has put the United
Nations deep in a financial crisis by owing the world body 1.6
billion U.S. dollars for past and current assessments, two-thirds
of the total dues.
</P>
<P>
Facing possible loss of the U.S. vote in the General Assembly
next year, U.S.-U.N. relations are, in the words of the U.N.
Secretary-General and the U.S. Secretary of State, at a critical
juncture.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Receives Fund for Hyacinth Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
received a total sum of 3.9 million U.S. dollars from Egypt to
help remove water hyacinth in the Kiyoga Lake in the central part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Andruale Awuzu, Minister of State for
Works, when he met the parliamentary committee on natural
resources here Friday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The fund would not be scattered into several departments. It
would only be used by the Ministry of Works, Housing and
Communications, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which provides drinking water for all the neighboring
 districts, has been blocked by water hyacinth, plant leaves and
soil.
</P>
<P>
Water blockade had caused flooding to several districts,
stripping those who live by fishing of their sole means of
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government sent a team of experts to Uganda in
1998 to help remove the water plant from Lake Victoria, the
world's second largest fresh water lake.
</P>
<P>
River Nile is a lifeline for all those living nearby. The
Egyptian government has been greatly concerned about the quality

<HEADLINE> British MP Optimistic for Solution of Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A British parliamentarian
expressed optimism here on Friday that there is likelihood that
the long-standing division of the Cyprus island be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Eddie O'Hara, speaking on behalf of visiting British MPs after
meeting with Cyprus' Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou, also
stressed that any solutin to the issue must safeguard the unity of
Cyprus, the return of all refugees to their homes, freedom of
movement and should be based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
"We are heartened that recently, the G-8 group (the seven most
industrialized nations plus Russia) countries have expressed
their concern that the Cyprus issue has gone unresolved for 25
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of G-8 urged the Greek
and Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any
pre-conditions and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
O'Hara said that any solution of the Cyprus issue "must be
based on one Cyprus people, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek
Cypriots, one Cypriot nationality, one Cypriot state, one island
of Cyprus with one international identity."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kyprianou said efforts for a solution must
forcus on averting anything that could consolidate the current
division and Turkish occupation of the island's northern part.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that things on Cyprus issue may get a
turn for the better but also warned of more difficult times
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Sees 750,000 Kosovo Albanians Returning Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Three quarters of a
million Kosovo Albanians have returned to homeland since the
return of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to Kosovo two months ago, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Less than 50,000 Kosovo Albanians are still in neighboring
countries in the region, the U.N. agency said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 91,000 who were evacuated to 29 different countries
during the 78-day U.S.-British air-strikes against Yugoslavia from
March 24 to June 12, nearly one third have returned, UNHCR
estimated.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past two months of UNHCR presence in Kosovo,
around 130,000 Serbs and Roma fled Kososvo to other parts of
Serbia and Montenegro, brining to 180,000 the number of
non-Albanians displaced from Kosovo, according to UNHCR figures.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said UNHCR is deeply concerned
about the security situation of Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Since there have numerous incidents of murder and Serbs have
been forced out of their homes, Eckhard said, it would not be
possible for UNHCR to encourage Serbs to return to their homes
until adequate levels of security exist.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Several United Nations
agencies have been engaged in examining depleted uranium in
Yugoslavia, a U.N. spokesman announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
They include the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Atomic

Eckhard said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The kind of bombs were dropped during the 78-day air-strikes by
U.S. and British-led forces of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Yugoslavia said the long-term effective
weapons began to take toll on Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the group is collecting information from a variety
of sources and a review meeting will take place in Geneva on
September 1 to decide on whether to send a full-scale assessment
mission to the region to examine the issue of depleted uranium in
greater detail.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Coffee Production Affected by Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia loses 30 percent of
its total coffee production annually due to coffee-bean disease, a
senior official of the Trade and Industry Ministry said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The disease mainly affects coffee beans grown in rainy areas of
the country, Brook Debebe, deputy minister of the ministry, told a
seminar on coffee-bean disease.
</P>
<P>
He said a considerable amount of coffee plantation had been
protected from the disease by applying 15 types of
disease-resistant coffee beans in coffee producing areas over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, one of the third largest coffee producers in Africa,
has been making efforts to increase its coffee production by
popularizing improved coffee variety.
</P>
<P>
With more than 300,000 hectares of acreage under coffee,
Ethiopia produces about 250,000 tons coffee annually, one third of
which are for export.

CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The volume of Egyptian exports during the first nine
months of the fiscal year 1998/1999 amounted to 3 billion
U.S. dollars, the Arab daily Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States is ranked as the biggest importer of Egyptian
goods, followed by the European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU ranks as the biggest exporter to Egypt, and the U.S. the
second.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's total exports to Russia and the Commonwealth
of Independent States stood at 24 million dollars, to Arab states
at 405 million dollars, to Afro-Asian countries at 328 million
dollars and to Australia 3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Bank deposits of Lebanon's private sector stood at
1.1 billion U.S. dollars during the first six months of this year,
said a report by Lebanon's Francebank.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed a slowdown in bank deposits of the
private sector to such factors as the stalled Middle East peace
process, Israel's continuing aggressions against Lebanon and the
oscillation and repercussions of the domestic political factors,
weakening overall economic performance, the Arab daily Al Hayat
Friday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt signed a contract with two companies - one Dutch
and the other Danish for the construction and management of a
containers station in East Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri said after the
signing ceremony Wednesday that Egypt adopted the BOT system in
implementing projects in the fields of electricity, transport,
road construction and other utilities.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt had spent 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds (430
million U.S. dollars) on building a waterway to East Port
Said.
</P>
<P>
The containers station will cost 480 million dollars of which
40 percent will be undertaken by the Egyptian side and the Dutch
and Danish companies 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The docks of the new containers station will be 2,400 meters
long and will handle 2.5 million containers a year. The digging
of a 2,200 meter-long waterway is currently under way.

<HEADLINE> British Nuclear Ships Pass S. African Coastline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The two British ships
carrying nuclear fuel from France to Japan rounded the Cape coast
between Wednesday and Thursday and were well clear of the South
African coast, Pretoria's navy spokesman Glen Knox said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the navy was not tracking the vessels, the Pacific
Pintail and the Pacific Teal, because they were so far out.
</P>
<P>
"The closest they came to our coastline was 320 miles but they
stayed outside the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ)," Knox
said.
</P>
<P>
The ships are carrying about 450 kgs of mixed oxides of uranium
and plutonium fuel.
</P>
<P>
"We had one vessel on standby in case they entered our waters
but they were well out of the EEZ. They had no influence on us.
</P>
<P>
"They reported their positions when they approached our
coastline and we plotted the route they followed," Knox said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two vessels could have come to within 12 nautical
miles of the coast if they had wanted to under international
maritime law but they had adhered to a request by the government
to stay out of South Africa's territorial waters and its larger
marine EEZ.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation from the African National Congress in
the Western Cape said it had met Environmental and Tourism
Minister Valli Moosa on Thursday to raise its concerns about the
shipments.
</P>
<P>
Moosa assured the delegation that the government was
investigating the issue of nuclear shipments and was currently
developing further policy, ANC spokesman Max Ozinsky said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ozinsky said the Western Cape ANC's main concern was that the
two ships had the right to enter South African waters without
informing the government.
</P>
<P>
The company responsible for the fuel was not prepared to give
the government an assurance that the ships would not enter South
Africa's EEZ, Ozinsky said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also concerned at reports that a further 10 shipments
will be rounding the Cape every year."
</P>
<P>
Last month environmental group Greenpeace International called
on South Africa and all coastal nations on the route of the
shipment to oppose the transport, while environmental groups
protested outside the French, British and Japanese embassies in
Cape Town on August 6.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin, Primakov Agree to Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian prime ministers
Sergei Stepashin and Yevgeny Primakov have agreed "on the forms
and plans for cooperation and the coordination of their work," the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
They reached this agreement during a three-hour one-on-one
meeting Thursday at Primakov's country home, Interfax said,
quoting sources close to Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
"Stepashin continues active consultations," the sources said,
adding that in the several days following his dismissal last
Monday, he has discussed Russia's political situation with no less
than 80 percent of the country's provincial leaders.
</P>
<P>
"By Monday, he will make a decision concerning his political
future," the sources said. "The decision will be coordinated with
key political forces. All his efforts will be directed solely at
preventing the further exacerbation of the political and economic
situation," they said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Stepashin said that he lost his job, less than
three months after taking over from Primakov last May, because he
had "never wanted to be anyone's servant."
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever bought me. It cannot be true, after all, that
everything can be bought and sold in our country," Stepashin said
in an interview with the Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
He last met with President Boris Yeltsin early Monday in the
presidential country residence near Moscow, when he got the final
word that he was fired.
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a very difficult decision for him to make,"
Stepashin said, referring to Yeltsin's decision to oust him. But
he hinted that somebody in the Kremlin entourage was behind his
demise.
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived in Gorki early in the morning, he was not
alone. That is enough evidence that he needed some kind of support
to make the decision," Stepashin said, noting that he had not
expected to be fired.
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday (August 5) I had a preliminary conversation with
the president. And after that really wonderful conversation with
Boris Nikolayevich -- it had been a long time since we talked like
that and understood each other like that -- I left for a very good
trip to some Russian regions -- at his advice, by the way.
</P>
<P>
"And when I came back, I wasn't really ready for such a turn of
events as on Monday," Stepashin said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Activists Scuffle with Jewish Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace
Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they
toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they
called illegal settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
The activists and settlers pushed and sometimes threw punches
at each other on the hilltop about three miles from the
settlement of Itamar in central West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The visitors called the outposts set up by the settlers
illegal, but a spokesman for the settlers said the camps were
within the range of Itamar and called the tour of the activists
provocative.
</P>
<P>
The tour was cut short at a nearby settlement of Berakha,
where Israeli soldiers barred the activists from entering,
declaring it a closed military zone.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing legislator Uzi Landau from the Likud party called
on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ban similar "provocative visits"
by members of Peace Now, a watchdog monitoring settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office early last month, Barak has pledged to
move forward the peace process stalled under the three years
of rule by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu. But he
has been at odds with the Palestinians over Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have urged Barak to dismantle all the
settlements, calling them illegal and inconsistent with peace
accords signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to halt building of new settlements, but
vowed not to remove existing ones before Israel and the
Palestinians enter the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The ex-army chief has said that large blocs of Jewish
settlements would remain under Israeli control after a permanent
peace accord was reached as a result of the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Peace Now said that Jewish settlements
are expanding under Barak's government at a faster pace than
under the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
The group said in the month since Barak took office, the
Housing Ministry has issued tenders for the construction of 1,517
apartments in the settlements, six times the average monthly rate
of house construction in the settlements under the former
government.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Ministry said the figures were incorrect and
tenders had been issued for only 678 new homes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 150
settlements which scattered in the West Bank and Gaza, dividing
the areas into many isolated parts.

ANKARA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Friday approved a constitutional change in the Political
Parties Law, the presidential press center said here Friday.
</P>

instructions and act on decisions from foreign countries,
international institutions and some real and legal bodies which
are not of Turkish nationality and oppose the independence and
territorial integrity of Turkey, said the new law.

<HEADLINE> China Smashes Netherlands at World Women's Volleyball GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Local favourites China lived up
expectations when they came from one set down to outclass the
Netherlands 29-31, 25-23, 25-15, 25-23, here Friday at the opening
day of the 1999 World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix Macao Leg.
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands played a big game tonight," said Chinese head
coach Hu Jin who earlier coached Chinese national team between
1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
"But finally we had the game of the night," Hu added. "After we
trailed one set, our players showed their strength to pick up the
confidence to beat them out."
</P>
<P>
After levelling five times, world runners-up China opened a big
lead in the first set at 21-18 with solid defence and powerful
offence.
</P>
<P>
But the Dutch spikers, who finsihed fifth in Atalanta Olympic
Games, came back to overtake the led at 23-22, 24-23 and 26-25
mainly due to errors from the Chinese and their own powerful
spikes. They finally sealed the tough set at 31-29.
</P>
<P>
At 8-12 in favour of the Netherlands in the second, the fast
Chinese fought back for another see-saw game. After a series of
successive blocks, the Chinese clinched the set at 25-23.
</P>
<P>
With the ability of defense and block and quick changes in
tactics, the Chinese dominated the third before the Dutch fought
back again in the fourth, with the two teams exchanging lead
before the Chinese chalked up the match at 25-23.
</P>
<P>
In another match Friday, Brazil did not meet much resistance
from the Italians, winning in consecutive sets 25-20, 25-17, 25-20.
</P>
<P>
There are four legs in this year's tournament with world top
eight women's teams involved. Apart from the above four teams,
Cuba, Russia, South Korea and Japan are competing simultaniously
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The eight teams then were re-grouped and contest in Chinese
Taipei and the Phillipines respectively in the following weekend.
</P>
<P>
The first three teams will join hosts China to vie for the
title at the Grand Prix finals in Yunnan, China at the end of the
month.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Condemn Lee's Separatist Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Scholars in east China's Fujian
Province strongly condemned Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement
and told Lee that his only way out is to return to the "One China"
stand.
</P>
<P>
Wu Nengyuan, head of the Taiwan Institute of the Fujian
Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, said at a forum that Lee
and the Taiwan authorities' peddling of the separatist remark is
the most serious incident in the cross-Strait relations in decades.
</P>
<P>
The statement constitutes a grave challenge to the peaceful
reunification of the motherland, undermining the foundation of
cross-Strait relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lee, in pursuing his own ambition, gambles with
the security and welfare of the 21 million people of Taiwan, an
act that has aroused the utmost indignation of the entire Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huaji, of the academy, said that since 1988, more than 200
Taiwanese scholars have visited the academy, which has also sent
27 scholars to Taiwan to conduct academic exchange.
</P>
<P>
"These exchanges have facilitated further cross-strait academic
exchanges and are conducive to the peaceful reunification of the
motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement is groundless from any
perspectives, and is totally unacceptable to people of the
academic circles across the straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many other scholars also expressed their indignation and
condemned Lee's separatist remark at the forum held in this
capital city of Fujian.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects U.S. Contention Over Pakistani Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- India Friday rejected the
United States contention that New Delhi had not respected the
agreement signed with Pakistan in 1991 on the prevention of
airspace violations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry claimed that the
Pakistani military aircraft was shot down in Kutch area of the
western Gujarat state under standard operating procedures after it
failed to comply with all warnings and signals.
</P>
<P>
The reaction came in response to official comments from
Washington that India had not respected the agreement by shooting
down the Pakistani plane and that the incident had taken place at
a "highly disputed" area.
</P>
<P>
Citing article two of the agreement that "combat aircraft will
not fly within 10 kilometers of each other's airspace", the
spokesman said that "the Pakistani aircraft fell well within the
rubric of this clause".
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Pakistani intrusion had taken place in four
parts of the border area with the first three intrusions taking
place at the border which had been delineated and clearly
demarcated and the last intruding deep into Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Referring to article one of the agreement which stipulates that
in case of any inadvertent violation, prompt investigations are
undertaken and the other side informed about it, the spokesman
alleged that in this case since Pakistan did not comply with the
signals to land, no other option was left.

NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi government has
rejected media reports that over 475 civilians were killed in
renewed clashes with Hutu rebels in the suburbs south of capital
Bujumbura early this week, saying just a dozen were killed, the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The attack in broad day-light on a market place at Kanyosha
had caused panic among residents who fled to the capital, while
the army was engaged in mop-up operations of the Hutu rebels in
the hills of Mubimbi, Mutambu, and Muhuta communes.
</P>
<P>
The army and the Hutu rebels have been trading accusations,
blaming each other for the atrocities committed against civilians.
</P>
<P>
''This is mere fabrication. I do not know where those reports
got the figures,'' Appollinaire Gahungu, presidential spokesman
told RNA in a phone interview from capital Bujumbura. Gahungu said
that only 11 assailants and one gendarme were killed during the
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Cease Fire Temporarily for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to
oust president Laurent Kabila have declared a seven-day cease-fire
to allow the anti-polio vaccination campaign to go smoothly,
rebels sources in eastern Congo said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire was effective at mid-night Friday and will go
on for a week, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) in Goma Emile
Ilunga said that this halt of hostilities was a humanitarian
gesture, but had nothing to do with the Lusaka July 10 cease-fire
agreement his group has so far refused to endorse.
</P>
<P>
A small hitch had occurred on Thursday when Ugandan troops had
 impounded a cargo plane chartered by the WHO carrying 400,000
doses of vaccine at Buta airport on claims that it had not sought
landing clearance first.
</P>
<P>
"They should let this plane unload the medicine, otherwise it
will expire," Moise Nyarugabo, the RCD-Goma Vice-President told
RNA Thursday. But the plane was later allowed to discharge the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
In rebel-controlled territory, the operation began at 10:00
a.m. local time. In Goma, a high turn-out has been noted, rebel
sources in the area have announced.
</P>
<P>
''We love Congolese children, we want all of them to be
vaccinated,'' Nyarugabo said. Up to 10 million Congolese children
are expected to benefit from the anti-polio vaccination campaign.
</P>
<P>
The operation is likely to face constraints relating to
communication problems as the road and rail-way networks in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo are in a shambles or have

<HEADLINE> Three Sentenced to Life Imprisonment in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three were part of a group of 17 genocide suspects from
Rushashi and Musasa commune who had been jointly tried by the
Rushashi court, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Four of the suspects were sentenced to jail terms ranging from
five to 25 years, while five others who were found guilty of theft
and destruction of property, were requested to pay compensation to
the victims.
</P>
<P>
Five other suspects were released after the court found them
not guilty of charges. The 1994 genocide in Rwanda claimed the
lives of more than half a million people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and
Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan prisons are crammed with over 124,000 genocide
suspects most of whom are waiting for trial. Since the beginning
of genocide trials in December 1996, Rwandan criminal courts have
judged over 1,500 cases, with over 300 death penalties handed
down.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is looking for alternatives to speed up trials of
genocide suspects, in resorting to traditional courts called
''Gacaca'' in the country which are due to begin in the year
2,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement was reached during discussions between OPEC
president Rilwa Lukman and top Rwandan government officials, when
Lukman concluded a two-day visit to Rwanda Thursday, the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said that OPEC will release about over 18 million U.S.
dollars donated by the organization before the 1994 war and
genocide. The amount will be used to import petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
''Before 1994, OPEC had given Rwanda financial support to
implement different projects, including the construction of
roads,'' Lukman declared. ''The same relations were extended to
other fields like communication, transport, agriculture, and
health,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the OPEC president and Rwandan authorities
devised ways of resuming bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers New Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
provide Ethiopia with new contributions totalling over 12 million
U.S. dollars to support emergency food relief efforts currently
underway in Ethiopia, the U. S. embassy announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S. donation will be used to support the Ethiopian
government's efforts to save lives, improve the nutrition of
drought affected people and to support household food security
recovery, a press statement by the U.S. embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Five million people were reportedly in need of emergency food
assistance in Ethiopia this year following a long period of
drought in large parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 14-month-old Ethio-Eritrea border conflict has
 displaced more than 330,000 people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government food aid to Ethiopia since October of 1998
has reached 310,000 metric tons and is valued at more than 80
million dollars, according to a press release.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Engaging Britain on Gold Sales: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was making
headway in its dealings with Britain on how to minimize the
negative effects of the planned sale of half its gold reserves,
Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Phumzile Mhlambo-Ngcuka said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is an ongoing dialog between us and that country, and we
 believe it is going to pay off," South African Press Association
quoted her as telling parliamentarians in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) decision
to review its plans to sell off 10 percent of its gold reserves.
Such a move would harm several undeveloped countries which export
gold, including South Africa, the world's largest gold producer,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Thank God reason has triumphed in the IMF," she said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had planned to sell one million ounces of gold to fund
debt relief, but said last month other mechanisms would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
Mhlambo-Ngcuka said the government felt if gold sales were used
to finance debt relief, it would have the effect of replacing
trade with aid.
</P>
<P>
She said South Africa was not trying to stop others from
selling their gold reserves, but wanted a reliable mechanism that
would minimize any harmful effects, to be put in place.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it would be premature for gold mining
companies to plead poverty at this stage and start laying off
workers. However, it was too early to start celebrating a revival
in the gold price.

<HEADLINE> UK Plutonium Stockpile to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's stockpile of
weapons-grade plutonium could double to 150 tons as the country
has no means of dealing with high-level radioactive waste, said a
government-commissioned report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report by consultants Quantisci, which was leaked to the
media, said no technology exists to deal with plutonium which is
created during the course of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Britain has a stockpile of 92 tons of plutonium,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Reprocessing, or turning spent nuclear fuel from power stations
into either vitrified waste or new nuclear fuel, generates
billions of pounds for British Nuclear Fuels, a state-run concern
set for partial privatization within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear campaigners, who have long argued that nuclear
reprocessing is a sham, have welcomed the report because it views
plutonium as a waste.
</P>
<P>
"Plutonium has in past studies being classed as a fuel, but
this report classes plutonium as a waste and calls for urgent
plans for its treatment to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons
proliferation," Rachel Western, nuclear campaigner at Friends of
the Earth, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drive behind reprocessing was to produce plutonium for use
in weapons and also to produce enough plutonium so it could be
used as a fuel in so-called fast-breeder reactors, a Reuters
analysis said.
</P>
<P>
Uranium, which powers most nuclear power stations, was thought
to be scarce and there were worries that stocks would run out. In
the 1950s and 1960s designers started looking at fast-breeder
reactors which could use and generate plutonium. But
environmentalists say these arguments are no longer valid.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Earth's Western said reprocessing at Sellafield
in northeast England should now cease at once to stop adding to
the plutonium stockpile.
</P>
<P>
But a British Nuclear Fuels spokesman said the company does not
regard plutonium as waste.
</P>
<P>
"We regard plutonium as energy in the bank. Future generations
would question us if we were to dispose of an asset like this,"
the spokesman was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Togo to Intervene in Liberia-Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Togo have launched a
joint diplomatic initiative to douse the escalating tension
between their west African neighbors, Guinea and Liberia, over the
recent abduction of six foreign hostages within Liberian
territory.
</P>
<P>
A high-level official of the Nigerian Foreign Ministry said
here Friday in capital Abuja that a Nigerian delegation would
visit both countries to try to encourage dialog in resolving their
current conflict.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two countries rose after the abduction of
western aid workers by rebel gunmen in an area where Liberian
government troops are fighting Guinea-based rebels. Liberia has
been accusing Guinea, its northern neighbor, of harboring
"dissident forces" whom it blamed for the abduction.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Liberia has lodged a protest with the United
Nations Security Council against its fellow member of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which has responded by
placing its troops in Liberia in alert.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group calling itself the "Joint Forces for the
Liberation of Liberia" reportedly prevented 100 aid workers from
escaping the unrest in northern Liberia to safety in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
But Nigerian Foreign Ministry said Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and the chairman of the 16-member ECOWAS, Gnassingbe
Eyadema of Togo, were determined to ensure the increasing rhetoric
against unrest did not degenerate.
</P>
<P>
"Both presidents are working to ensure the fragile peace
secured for the sub-region with the July 7 peace plan between
rebels and the government in Sierra Leone marked the beginning of
an era of peace for the sub-region," said the foreign ministry
official.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect for S. African Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A suspect has been arrested
 for the assassination of a South African opposition party leader
Sifiso Nkabinde, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in Pietermaritzburg in the east of
the country Friday, Bulelani Ngcuka, national director of Public
Prosecutions, said the suspect was arrested in KwaZulu-Natal
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made by a team of investigators after six
months of hard work.
</P>
<P>
Nkabinde was gunned down in Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal, on January
23, shortly after he was elected as leader of the United
Democratic Movement (UDM) in the province.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Nkabinde was acquitted on 16 murder charges
and two of incitement to murder. The charges pertained to several
incidents of violence in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
Ngcuka said a further three arrests were imminent and warrants
of arrest had already been issued by the Richmond magistrate.
</P>
<P>
He declined to give the exact location or any further details
of where the man was arrested, except to confirm that the suspect
was from KwaZulu- Natal.
</P>
<P>
He said three other arrests were expected to take place over
the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Payment Balance Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya said
here Friday that the country's overall balance of payments was a
deficit of 63 million U.S.dollars in June 1999 compared to a
deficit of 194 million dollars in June of last year.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the central bank said the improvement in
the payment balance is a result of good performance in the capital
account, offsetting the widening in the current account.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the current account deficit widened by
194 million dollars to 332 million in the 12 months to June 1999
from 138 million dollars in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the country's trade deficit widened as
exports declined and imports rose and there was also a fall in
services account surplus.
</P>
<P>
The capital account improved with a surplus of 269 million
dollars at the end of June as against a deficit of 56 million
dollars a year ago, the report said, adding that there was also
an increase in long-term capital inflows while long-term capital
outflows decreased.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign exchange reserves in Kenya fell to 969 million
dollars or 3.7 months of import cover at the end of June, 1999,
from 1.083 billion dollars, or to 4.2 months of import cover in
the same period last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official foreign exchange reserves stood at 657
million dollars down from 771 million dollars last year, and
commercial banks' foreign exchange reserves remained at 312
million dollars, the same as in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Public Debt More Than Half of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's public debt was 476.4
billion shillings (about 6.44 billion U.S. dollars), or 64.4
percent of its gross domestic product, at the end of June,
according to a Central Bank of Kenya report available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for August, the central bank said the
figure was 1.1 billion shillings ( around 15 million dollars) less
than that for the same time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic debt accounted for 150.3 billion shillings (2.03
billion dollars) while external debt amounted to 326.1 billion
shillings (4.41 billion dollars)," it said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the external debt registered a drop of 5.8
billion shillings (78.4 million dollars) from June 1998.
</P>
<P>
External debt service in 1998/99 (July/June) amounted to 28.4
billion shillings (450.7 million dollars) compared to 29.2
billion shillings (395 million dollars) in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said domestic debt had increased 4.8 billion
shillings (65 million dollars) compared to that in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new debt had accumulated in the process of
servicing external debt and meeting government budgetary
requirements, it said.

<HEADLINE> All English Pregnant Women to Have HIV Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- All pregnant women in England are
to be offered HIV test in an effort to reduce the rising number of
babies born with the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
The tests are to be recommended to women as part of their
routine ante-natal screening, but there will be no element of
compulsion, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The measures, announced on Friday by Health Minister Tessa
Jowell, are designed to cut by 80 percent the number of babies
born HIV positive by the year 2002. They are also aimed at
improving treatment for women with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Women known to be HIV positive can take anti-viral drugs during
pregnancy to minimize the risk of transmitting the disease to
their babies during birth. At the moment, two-thirds of the women
who are HIV positive do not know they are infected.
</P>
<P>
The UK has one of Europe's highest maternal HIV transmission
rates. In 1997, 265 mothers in the UK were HIV positive and as a
result about 50 babies were born with the virus.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
higher Friday, lifted by a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent rise in
the July U.S. producer price index.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index, which had been trading down 24 points
before the release of the U.S. producer price figures, rebounded
to close up 1.49 percent, or 91.8 points, at 6,245.1.
</P>
<P>
Strong support came from Wall Street where the Dow index was up
around 135 points as the London session ended its third successive
positive close.
</P>
<P>
The rise by the FTSE 100 came in the wake of a 138-point jump
Thursday, and again featured strong gains in the heavyweight bank,
telecom and pharmaceutical sectors.
</P>
<P>
But dealers attributed much of the strength in the big three
sectors to traders and short-term investors who were looking to
close short positions.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, talk of a possible merger in the banking sector
and receding interest-rate fears spurred a buying spree on the
electronic Xetra Dax, which closed up 1.79 percent, or 92 points,
at 5,219.43.
</P>
<P>
Commerzbank gained 8.17 percent after a media report that
contact with BfG Bank could lead to Commerzbank's purchase of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
BHF Bank, listed on the MDAX, gained 29.39 percent as Dutch
financial group ING made an offer for outstanding shares in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Paris's blue chip CAC 40 closed up 1.5 percent Friday, boosted
by more positive signals on the U.S. economy after weaker than

<HEADLINE> Abortion Still Banned in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's top health official
Friday confirmed that abortion is illegal except under
exceptional circumstances such as when the health of the mother
was in danger.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary for the Health Ministry Julius Meme made
the remarks in a bid to defuse the growing row over his earlier
statements on possibility to legitimatize abortion.
</P>
<P>
Pro-life activists had regarded such a signal as an apparent
government acknowledgment that abortion was acceptable and
strongly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church, which has many followers in Kenya, is
opposed not only to abortion but also to the use of
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
Meme reaffirmed the government's position that abortion could
be effected only if the attending doctor deemed the health of the
mother to be is in danger.
</P>
<P>
"Such abortion," he said, "can then be carried out in a
licensed health facility."
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said a majority of doctors at an on-going
seminar in the country's Eastern Province suggested abortion ought
to be legalized while some opposed it, saying it was tantamount to
murder.
</P>
<P>
Each year a lot of Kenyan women die of abortion-related
complications because abortion is illegal and the women dare not
to go to hospitals but turn to quacks.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil on New Two-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices rallied to a
22-month peak of 21 U.S. dollars a barrel Friday, buoyed by
Nigerian supply disruption, declines in U.S. oil stockpiles and
OPEC output restraint.
</P>
<P>
London September futures for Britain's Brent crude touched the
psychological 21 U.S. dollar level, its highest since October 9,
1997, before dropping back to 20.88 U.S. dollars for a 39 cent
gain.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil is more than double the historic lows touched
at the turn of the year following disciplined reductions in supply
under a market rescue accord by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said data this week from the United States showing
falling inventories of crude and petroleum products had underlined
the success of OPEC producers in tackling a glut which early this
year dragged Brent below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil stocks in the United States, the world's largest
consumer, now are 6 percent lower than a year ago while gasoline
inventories are 4 percent smaller, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The price drew more immediate strength Friday from news that
oil major Texaco declared force majeure on some Nigerian oil
exports, meaning it cannot guarantee meeting all of its sales
commitments, due to community unrest in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
Output curbs implemented by OPEC after a meeting in the Hague
in March are expected to erase excess inventories entirely in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, traders are concerned that prices may be due for
a reverse after the heavy gains of recent weeks, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
"Scepticism has emerged about future price trends which we
attribute to concern that OPEC will raise its production at the
September 22 meeting," Reuters quoted Merrill Lynch as saying in a
note to clients. "We continue to believe that this will not occur
and that OPEC will reaffirm its commitment to the Hague
agreement."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Ali Rodriguez
said he did not expect any change in OPEC's production policy when
the group meets next month. The cartel has agreed to maintain
supply curbs for a year until the end of March which may leave a
shortfall in supplies during winter months.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based International Energy Agency said earlier this
week that world oil demand was expected to accelerate next year,
while only marginal extra supplies would emerge from non-OPEC
producers.
</P>
<P>
A recovery in Asian economies would help double global demand
growth from 900,000 barrels a day this year to 1.8 million bpd in
2000. It expected only 660,000 bpd of extra non-OPEC supply, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Warns Against Support to Terrorists in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said on Saturday that terrorists in the republic of
Daghestan are trying to impose anti-constitutional order and any
outside support to them will be considered as "glaring
interference" in Russia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the warning in a special message to U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, the foreign ministers of the G-7
industrialized countries, and other member states of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the European Union, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and some Islamic countries,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said "there are indisputable facts indicating that the
terrorists are getting financial, material and other assistance
from outside.
</P>
<P>
"Any form of support for the terrorists' actions will be
considered as a glaring interference in the internal affairs of
the Russian Federation with all the consequences it entails,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the international community
understood the situation.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is a global deadly challenge, and much has already
been done in the fight against it in order to consolidate efforts
within the framework of the U.N., the G-8, the CIS and other
international organizations," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities have launched a massive campaign
against the Islamic militants who have infiltrated a number of
Daghestani villages near the republic of Chechnya a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The air force, interior troops, elite special police squads,
and armed volunteers were involved in the operations, which have
reportedly caused panic among the rebels and forced them to
abandon some villages they seized.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges KFOR to Halt Violence Against Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The international peace-keeping
force in Kosovo (KFOR) must step up measures to prevent brutal
acts of violence against Serbs, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is made more serious by what the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) has called a "systematic
campaign" of violence and brutality, Dini said in an interview
with Rome's daily La Republica.
</P>
<P>
KFOR has been hampered in its efforts to control the situation,
Dini said. He also pointed a finger at the slow selection
procedure for the special United Nations police force that is
being assembled to take over law and order duties in the province.
</P>
<P>
Dini denied rumors of a split between certain European nations
and the U.S. on the future status of Kosovo and NATO's involvement
in the transition phase.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, UNHCR declared that the escalating violence
against Serb residents of Pristina, the Kosovo capital, has
reduced their numbers from 20,000 to less than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Instances such as the shooting of two women, aged 70 and 79, in
their homes Monday night are signs of a growing tide of violence
aimed at driving the remaining Serbs out of the province with a
majority of ethnic Albanians, Dini noted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Cleaning Up of U.S. Rivers, Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- In his weekly radio address
Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Environmental
Protection Agency to work together with states to clean up the
nation's most polluted rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton ask them first to identify the most polluted waters and
then to develop strong, enforceable plans to restore the rivers
and lakes to health.
</P>
<P>
This is a continuation of work begun in 1972 with passage of
the federal Clean Water Act. The goal of the latest cleanup plan
is water clean enough for swimming or fishing, the president said.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the nation's waterways do not meet the
swimming or fishing test. According to a study by states and the
EPA, about 20,000 polluted waterways fail to meet the standard.
This includes about 300,000 miles of rivers and shoreline and
close to 5 million acres of lakes. It was reported that recently
half a million of fishes in Potomac River have been killed by the
polluted water.

<HEADLINE> Wildcat Well in Tibet Gushes Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A wildcat well in the Luenpola
Basin of the Tibet Autonomous Region gushed crude oil this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The region's first commercial flow of crude oil was announced
July 9 in the same basin, in the northern part of the "Roof of the
World", according to the China National Star Petroleum Corporation
(CNSPC), which is in charge of the exploration.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 tons of high-temperature steam was pumped into
the No.1 Luenpola wildcat well, which is 4,700 m above sea level,
from July 26 to August 11, and after 60 hours of well sealing, oil
began to gush out, CNSPC Vice-President Zhou Baixiu said.
</P>
<P>
The successful trial exploration has proven more than three
million tons of oil reserves, indicating a medium-sized oilfield
with some 10 million tons of reserves, he said, adding that his
company will test a third wildcat well in September.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the latest development is of great
significance for the social stability and economic development in
Tibet, a region traditionally short of energy.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban 75 Illegal Drug Bazaars By October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to clamp down on 75
illegal medicine trading bazaars nationwide by October.
</P>
<P>
In a massive drive to regulate the country's medicine market,
related departments at various levels are asked to start a ban on
illegal purchases and trading of medicines and the traditional
Chinese herbal medicines, and traders without licenses.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the State Drug Administration, told a
conference held here today that China has made progress in this
respect in the past few months. For example, 22 illegal drug
outlets had been shut down in central China's Hunan Province alone,
and 1,442 individual traders without licenses were punished, Zheng
added.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that the focus of the work in the latter half of
this year is to abolish illegal drug markets and curb fake drug
products in order to protect the consumers' interests.
</P>
<P>
He urged local authorities to strictly follow the country's
regulations and laws on medicine dealings, and make sure that the
75 illegal drug bazaars are closed down by this October.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Unions Slammed for Forming Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Federation of Trade
Unions Saturday accused the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions of
ditching the workers by turning into a political party.
</P>
<P>
The federation said in a statement that the unfortunate part
was that the congress was using membership fees to launch the
party.
</P>
<P>
"Trade union subscriptions paid by members of the unions are
meant for membership service. It is going to be a serious problem
when the resources are used for political purposes," said the
federation.
</P>
<P>
The congress announced early this year that it was turning into
a political party to challenge the ruling party in the year 2000
parliamentary elections and the presidential elections coming up
in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The federation said the workers should reject the idea since no
 referendum was held on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of each individual subscriber to rise and
resist the misuse of his or her subscriptions," said the
federation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there were reports that some unions affiliated to the
congress were on a collision path with the mother body warning it
to desist from pursuing a political agenda.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Inaugurated to Link Scandinavia, Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Oresund Strait bridge,
which connects the Scandinavian Peninsula with Denmark, was
inaugurated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 7.8-kilometer road and rail bridge also completes the link
between Scandinavia and the European Continent. Denmark already
has links with the mainland through the Great Belt bridge and the
Kleiner Belt bridge.
</P>
<P>
After the last 140-meter-long concrete section was put in place
on Saturday morning, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, Crown
Prince Frederik of Denmark, and another 700 honored guests
attended the inauguration ceremony on the double-decked bridge 68
meters above the sea.
</P>
<P>
Danish Trade Minister Pia Gjellerup and other officials
delivered speeches on the economic significance of the bridge to
Sweden and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The Oresund Strait bridge has a four-lane motorway and a dual-
track electrified railway running from Malmo, the third largest
city of Sweden, to Denmark's Pepparholmen Island, a 4-kilometer-
long artificial island which in turn has a 4-kilometer tunnel link
with the Danish capital Copenhagen. The construction of the tunnel
finished earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the 16-kilometer link between Denmark and
Sweden, comprising the Oresund Strait bridge, the Pepparholmen
Island and the tunnel, began in 1995. When it opens for traffic on
July 1, 2000, it will take just 10-12 minutes to travel between
the Danish capital and Malmo in Sweden, compared with today's 45-
minute ferry ride.

<HEADLINE> Diaries Expose Japanese Aggressors' Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three diaries depicting the
Japanese aggressors' atrocities during the Nanjing Massacre 60
years ago were contributed today to the Memorial Hall for the
Victims of the Nanjing Massacre in this capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The diaries, written by Sun Jichang, a Chinese secretary to the
German ambassador to China from 1937 to 1940, depict in detail the
horrible casualties inflicted upon the people of Nanjing by the
Japanese troops in their attack against the city from August to
December in 1937.
</P>
<P>
According to the diaries, when the Japanese troops occupied
the city, Sun and other embassy workers retreated to a ship on the
Yangtze River, and he saw all the houses along the river ablaze
and the whole city red with flames, and refugees streaming out.
</P>
<P>
Experts have confirmed that Sun's depictions of this major
historical event conform to the historical records.
</P>
<P>
Sun died in 1992, at the age of 92, and his diaries were
contributed to the memorial hall by his nephew, Sun Jinming, a
retired official, at a seminar held here today on new findings
concerning the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Zhao Jianmin, a history professor at Shanghai-
based Fudan University, said that he has confirmed that the
Japanese troops confiscated 880,000 volumes of books from
libraries in Nanjing during their occupation.
</P>
<P>
Historians from Japan also displayed evidence confirming the
Japanese troops' massacre of ordinary Chinese citizens in the city.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeks Foreign Investment to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has turned to independent
power producers (IPPs) built with foreign investments in an effort
to meet the rising demand for electricity in recent years, an
economic weekly has reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) said
demand for electricity increases by 7-8 percent annually in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began resorting to foreign-funded IPP projects in
mid-1990s when the country could no longer rely on itself to
finance the new electricity projects, said the London-based
magazine which focuses on reporting Mideast economy and business.
</P>
<P>
The first such project entails the addition of two 340-megawatt
(MW) units to the Sidi Krier power station, west of the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 220 kilometers northwest of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A group led by InterGen of the United States has signed with
the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) all the relevant
contracts for the 480-million-U.S.-dollar project, whose
engineering and procurement work has been going ahead smoothly.
</P>
<P>
ABB Alstom Power, a company recently formed by Zurich-based ABB
Asea Brown Boveri and France's Alstom, is to supply the turbine
generators, and Babcock &AMP; Wilcox of the U.S. will provide the
boilers for the plant.
</P>
<P>
The plant, due for completion at the start of 2001, will be
constructed in the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) system. The
EEA is to pay for the power that InterGen produces at 0.026
dollars a kilowatt-hour (kWh).
</P>
<P>
Egypt has offered to Electricite de France (EdF) next two IPP
schemes, involving 650-MW plants at Suez and East Port Said, two
cities at the southern and northern ends of the Suez Canal, MEED
said.
</P>
<P>
The next IPP project is expected to be a 650-MW plant for Sharm
el-Sheikh, a Red Sea resort in southern Sinai, for which bids are
expected to be invited internationally towards the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
About 10 more IPPs have been listed by EEA to be issued for
foreign bid up to 2005, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Courts Reign in Somali Capital After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Normalcy returned to Hodon
district, South Mogadishu, late Saturday morning after heavy
fighting between the forces of the Islamic courts and freelance
armed gangs Friday evening and early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdunasir Dahir Mohamed, one of the courts'
officials involved in the fighting, their forces had been provoked
by what he called elements trying to destabilize the security of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out Friday evening after residents of the
district tried to establish an Islamic court of their own to
improve the security in their residential areas as well as
restoring the rule of law. The existing Islamic courts
immediately reacted by offering a battle wagon and several heavily
armed militiamen to safeguard what would be the new Islamic court
headquarters in Hodon district.
</P>
<P>
Fighting resumed early Saturday morning with the two sides
exchanging heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available. However,
officials from the Islamic courts said two of their men were
wounded during the fighting Saturday morning and one of their
fighters died late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The gunfire exchange subsided at about 9:00 a.m. local time
Saturday morning with the freelance armed gangs were defeated and
chased away deep into Bermuda area, the most dangerous part of the
capital in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
Abdunasir Dahir Mohamed told reporters that his forces have
achieved a victory against the bandits and would teach a similar
lesson to whoever tries to undermine their activities.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of a central administration in Mogadishu, the
Islamic courts now remain the most powerful and united force
existing in the capital following the collapse of the Libya and
Egypt-sponsored administration of Mogadishu announced by some of
the city's warlords including Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts are trying to spread their influence
steadily and control the capital and even the southern regions. In
this endeavor, the Islamic courts also seem to be gaining more
support and popularity since the areas under their control are
relatively bandits free.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, unlike the armed clashes with the involvement of the
factional leaders, no lootings or killings of clan affiliations
have taken place when the Islamic courts are involved in any armed
confrontations against any group.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golkar May Review Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party
said Saturday that it was not impossible that the party reviewed
incumbent President B.J. Habibie's nomination as the candidate for
the next president if there were no enough support from other
parties to back Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"We hope other parties will give support (to Habibie). But if
only, I repeat, if only support that we expect cannot be reached,
perhaps we will make review. But it is just in case 'if only.' We
of course keep struggling to make success," Golkar General
Chairman Akbar Tanjung said at a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar has nominated Habibie for the 1999/2004 term of
presidency. Habibie is in competition with Megawati Soekarnoputri,
leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
which won this year's June 7 election with a relative majority.
</P>
<P>
Akbar, whose party took second place in the election, was still
optimistic that the Habibie bid would succeed and get support from
other parties and factions in the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), which will meet in November to elect the country's next
president.
</P>
<P>
"But we are still optimistic that we have enough chance to win
the presidential race," Akbar added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his party would make deal with other parties
to find a way to strengthen the composition of the next
administration.
</P>
<P>
"If our candidate is elected, we may propose other parties be
accommodated in the next administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Chairman of the National Awakening Party (PKB)
Matori Abdul Djalil Saturday reiterated his support to Megawati.
</P>
<P>
"We should give a priority to the winner of election. The party
is PDI-P. So give priority to Megawati to race in the presidential
election next November," Matori said in a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will
comprise members of the House of Representatives plus 200
appointed regional and interest groups' representatives. The House
itself will have 500 members, 462 of whom will come from the 48
political parties that contested the June 7 election. The
remaining 38 members will be military personnel and policemen
appointed by the Armed Forces leadership.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Defense Minister Resigns on "Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted a government source as
saying that it was unclear about the nature of the illness but one
source said recently, "he had been unable to sustain
conversations for long."
</P>
<P>
The former army chief who was flown abroad for medical
attention in June was reported then to be suffering from a
psychological disorder described as clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
He hurriedly returned to the country to beat the deadline for
the screening of ministerial nominees by Nigeria's Senate which
has unanimously approved his nomination.
</P>
<P>
On assumption of duty as defense minister, Danjuma promised to
ensure that during his tenure, the military institutions would be
rid of political soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"My first priorities will be to cleanse the armed forces,
especially the army and militarize the military," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the inauguration of the new government on May 29 this
year, Obasanjo has carried out two principal reforms in the armed
forces. The first was the retirement of service chiefs and then
the retirement of about 200 officers of the army, navy and air
force.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Punch newspaper quoted sources as saying President
Obasanjo was deeply affected by the Danjoma's resignation and
immediately tried to persuade him to reconsider his decision
because of the negative effect the resignation may have on his
administration.
</P>
<P>
Apart from summoning the defense minister, the sources said,
the president also contacted Danjoma's close associates to join in
the bid to prevail on him to shelve the idea.
</P>
<P>
One source said, "if he sticks to his guns as he would like do,
it will be a big blow to the young government. Defense is not
just any other ministry. It is a sensitive portfolio. That was
probably why the president was jolted and began immediate
consultations to find the best way to handle the situation."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Legislators Net in Furniture Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Against widespread public protest,
members of the National Assembly or parliament started collecting
cheques Friday for their own furniture allowance which was also
proposed for Senators.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate President Evan Enwerem warned Friday in Benin,
Edo State, against what he called "excessive demands for personal
comfort" by the legislators, which he said were being used as a
tool for blackmail by "the enemy within", said the Guardian
newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, their behavior could send the wrong signals to people
opposed to democracy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem reminded members of the House of Assembly that only
negative reports are carried about them in the press and warned
that "we could unwittingly destroy ourselves in this way."
</P>
<P>
The senate president urged the state lawmakers to be wary of
forces of destabilization within their midst.
</P>
<P>
The cheques were cleared by the National Assembly bureaucrats
Thursday, the day the allocation of their quarters by balloting
was done.
</P>
<P>
A member of the House of Representatives who preferred not to
be named lamented that people from his constituency had been
sending signals for their own share of the furniture largesse
since last week, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The government, after hot debate, agreed last week to pay each
member of the 109-member Senate 3.5 million naira (about 37,000
U.S. dollars) and their counterpart in the 360-member House 2.5
million naira (26,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decision ignited strong protests throughout Nigeria when
the west African nation is currently under-going severe financial
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Stresses Constitutional Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that opening-up the ownership of land
and public utilities to foreigners will not only boost technology
transfer but also open up new markets for Philippine products both
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly television program, Estrada said that once
foreigners are allowed to own lands and certain public utilities,
factories will be built and jobs will be generated, thus his
country will be exporting products and not contract workers.
</P>
<P>
"Products will be manufactured here, and we can reduce the
number of overseas contract workers going abroad because they will
now be working here, and we are going to export products instead
of workers," the president said.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 4 million Filipinos are working in 182
countries and regions in the world, and they earn the country 6
billion to 7 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is campaigning for charter changes, which, he said, are
aimed at accelerating economic reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, foreigners' ownership of land
and public utilities is limited to no more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition forces have accused the president of trying
to extend his six-year term by amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same program, Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu allayed fears that the economic reforms envisioned by the
president in the new constitution would result in unlimited
exploitation of the nation's natural resources to the disadvantage
of the Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
He said the underlying objective of the proposed new economic
nationalism of attracting foreign investments is to hasten the
country's development and in the process, uplift the living
conditions of the people, especially the poor.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Trade and Industry,
who was also a guest in the TV program, said that in the past
years the Philippines lagged behind in economic growth compared
with its neighbors, which allowed foreigners to own lands for
industrial, and even for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest available figures in 1997 showed that
Indonesia got 4.7 billion dollars in direct foreign investments,
Malaysia 3.8 billion dollars, Thailand 3 billion dollars, and the
Philippines only 1.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Belfast Parade Marches On After Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A traditional Protestant
Apprentice Boys' parade marched down the main nationalist Lower
Ormeau Road in Northern Ireland's capital of Belfast on Saturday
without major incident after police removed sit-down protesters.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters who had planned to block the Protestant
march were carried away by officers as police cleared half the
road shortly after 5:30 a.m.(0430 GMT). Nineteen police officers
and a number of protesters were injured.
</P>
<P>
During the parade, bottles were thrown, but none of the
marchers were injured.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's main parade, which took place in the Northern
Ireland city of Londonderry, known as Derry to its largely
Catholic population, involved up to 10,000 marchers and 150 bands.
It is also facing nationalist protests by residents from the
Catholic Bogside area.
</P>
<P>
Both parades were given the go-ahead by the Northern Ireland
Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
The religious leaders have appealed for calm during the marches,
which take place on the eve of the first anniversary of a car bomb
in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people and wounded hundreds
more on August 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Parades by the Protestant Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys
have been the subject of controversy for many years in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The marchers view the parades as a traditional expression of
their culture, but in Catholic nationalist areas they are often
viewed as triumphalist and intimidating.
</P>
<P>
The two parades are to commemorate the 1689 Siege of Derry,
when Protestant apprentices shut the gates of the walled city
against the forces of the Catholic King James II in December 1688.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Protestants died before the city in that war and
Londonderry is now 75 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Ireland is deadlocked due to a
long-running dispute between politicians from the majority
Protestant and minority Catholic communities over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Irish Republic are currently seeking ways to
revive last year's Good Friday peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet to Fight Extradition to Spain: Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet intends to fight extradition from Britain to Spain where
he suspects he would not get a fair trial, his son said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio Pinochet told BBC that his 83-year-old father
would not go to Madrid voluntarily to face charges of human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
He said his father, who is currently under house arrest outside
London, is in poor health. He said he is worried that his father
might die in custody.
</P>
<P>
"Go direct to Spain? No. We think we have to keep to the
process that has already started," Pinochet's son said.
</P>
<P>
"In Spain he is already judged. It would not be a fair trial in
Spain," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chilean military officials are now in Britain to
see Pinochet. They will meet him together with his Spanish lawyers,
"and discuss what they have to do in case he has to go to Spain,"
the son said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very worried that during the process, which could last
a long time -- I don't know how long -- he might die because his
health could further deteriorate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital last October while
he was recovering from a minor operation. A Spanish judge has
accused Pinochet of being responsible for the deaths and
disappearances of more than 3,000 people. The judge has also asked
Britain to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face trial.
</P>
<P>
Though Pinochet has denied the charges, Britain is scheduled to
begin the extradition proceedings on September 27.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Key Members Accumulate Fortunes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Investigations have shown that
key members of the Falun Gong sect accumulated fortunes through
selling books and audio-visual products on Falun Gong to
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Yao Jie, Li Xiaomei and Li Xiaobing, key members of the
outlawed "Falun Dafa Research Society" in Beijing, the sect's top
governing body, earned more than 1.5 million yuan in two years,
selling related publications to practitioners, according to
Beijing's public security and press and publishing departments.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaomei and Li Xiaobing are sisters. They began to sell
Falun Gong-related books and audio-visual products in 1997, at the
instigation of Yao Jie, a kingpin of the society.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have uncovered that Li Xiaobing gave more than
one million yuan to Yao Jie and over 200,000 yuan in tape sales to
a related company in east China's Shandong Province.

<HEADLINE> Former Falun Gong Practitioners Repent Folly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Falun Gong's
practitioners Chinawide are repenting their foolishness in
believing Falun Gong and are revealing its harmfulness with their
own sad stories.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shenghua, a lecturer and a Communist Party member from the
Shanghai Teachers' University, vowed to sever his ties with the
Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
He said four year ago he started to practice Falun Gong out of
interest, and was soon addicted to it. After that, he neglected
his research work and alienated his friends.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his folly to insufficient study of Marxist theory
and lack of political judgment.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yilian, another practitioner, living in south China's Hunan
province, has just been discharged from a local mental hospital.
He was the hospital's 15th patient afflicted with mental illness
after practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
These people trusted Li Hongzhi's "prophecy" that the world is
about to blow up, and his promise that one can become immortal if
he or she practices Falun Gong. Such people often suffer from
severe fever and mental instability, according to doctors.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals have organized a special group to give these
people immediate treatment, and many have become normal and
realized Falun Gong's mischief.
</P>
<P>
Three daughters of a Falun Gong victim in east China's Anhui
province told reporters, in tears, that Falun Gong killed their
parents.
</P>
<P>
"After practicing Falun Gong, my mother refused to take
medicine or receive any kind of medical treatment. We saw her high
blood pressure and heart disease getting worse day by day," one
daughter said.
</P>
<P>
"We forced her to go to a hospital, which made her better for
some time, but she turned to the witchcraft again, and killed
herself in the end," she said.
</P>
<P>
His father was extremely upset afterwards, and died of cerebral
bleeding just two weeks after their mother's death.
</P>
<P>
To save more people from Falun Gong, local authorities and
departments Chinawide have made various efforts. In Shenyang, an
industrial base in north China, former practitioners of the Anshan
Iron and Steel Company have attentively studied the local
government's publicity brochures on getting rid of superstitious
ideas and fostering scientific thought.

The two sisters contracted and registered a book store in 1998
in the name of others in the city's Dongcheng District. The book
store had since become the base for spreading the fallacies of
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
In June and July, related departments uncovered Falun Gong-
related publications valued at more than five million yuan at the
book store and the sisters' homes.
</P>
<P>
In Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, local authorities unearthed the largest illegal
underground publishing house in the region, and confiscated large
numbers of Falun Gong-related publications and pictures of Li
Hongzhi, the sect founder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Dalian City, in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, several illegal publishing centers have been seized and
the confiscated publications have been destroyed, winning applause
from more than a thousand spectators, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Targeted For U.S. Drug Blacklist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department is
recommending that Canada be added to a drug blacklist, a list on
which Panama, Colombia and Mexico have already been identified, "
the Globe and Mail" said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation will go to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. She will decide on whether or not to seek approval from
President Bill Clinton on the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented U.S. action has provoked alarm and a flurry
of diplomatic activity among senior Canadian officials in an
attempt to contain an escalating battle between the two
neighboring countries, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to "shame" Canada into waking up and taking necessary
actions, U.S. State Department officials recently informed Ottawa
about their serious concern over the drug problem, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence reports suggest the amount of heroin and
marijuana moving through Canada into the United States has reached
alarming proportions, the newspaper said.

CHANGSHA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A rainstorm that has been

Trip

China has voiced its strong resentment and firm opposition to
the U.S. government for allowing the Dalai Lama to visit the
United States, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here

</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Dalai Lama's recent trip to New York, Zhu
said China has already made a solemn representation to the U.S.
side.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is an inalienable part of the Chinese territories, and
the Tibet issue is entirely China's internal affairs, which brooks
no interference from any foreign country, Zhu said, adding that
the Dalai Lama is not merely a religious figure but a "political
exile" engaged in the activities of splitting China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minster Nawaz
Sharif Saturday said that his country is fully capable of giving
telling response to enemy if war was thrust on it.
</P>
<P>
"There should not be any doubt in this respect," he said in his
address at the national ceremony here to mark the country's 52nd
independence day.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the Kargil incident has drawn the attention of the
international community and all major powers towards the Kashmir
issue and that "they have been compelled to realize that peace
cannot be established in the sub-continent until an urgent
solution of Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan cannot remain a silent spectator over the
"inhuman and barbaric atrocities" being committed by Indian
security forces in the southern part of Kashmir controlled by
them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif said Pakistan has always endeavored for a
peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had appealed to the Kashmiri Mujahideen
(freedom fighters) to withdraw from Kargil heights so that
"tension is reduced and atmosphere for talks can be restored."
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's restraint should never be construed as a
sign of weakness, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Sharif regretted that India had shot down a naval aircraft of
Pakistan under training on August 10 resulting in the death of 16
people on board.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the entire world is now well aware of the fact that
Kashmir is a basic dispute. "Unless this problem is resolved
according to United Nations resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri
people, there will be no peace in South Asia."

<P>
KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 18 Ugandan companies are
preparing to participate in the Rwanda Expo'99 International Trade
Fair slated for August 21-29 in a bid to penetrate the regional
market.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's participation, being facilitated by the Uganda Export
Promotion Board, also serves as a launch pad for the country's
products in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), the New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This show is important to the Ugandan business community,
particularly the manufacturers, because the volume of bilateral
trade has increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is becoming the destination for Ugandan products. In
1998, Uganda exported goods worth 70.4 million U.S. dollars to
Rwanda compared to 46.1 million dollars to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's exports to Rwanda include bicycles, dairy products,
edible oil, soap, beer, Uganda Waragi, plastics and roofing
materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Francis
Masakhalia has said the biggest challenge in luring investors to
Kenya is its image which has been dented by corruption.
</P>
<P>
He noted it had to improve Kenya's image for creating an
enabling environment for investment as he addressed the opening of
a two-day annual seminar of the Institute of Certified Public
Secretaries of Kenya Friday in Mombasa, a sea port in southeastern
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard Saturday quoted the minister as
saying that to deal with corruption, every Kenyan should take it
upon him or herself to improve governance which requires
accountability and transparency in the management of economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Saying it took two to tango, Masakhalia stressed that the fight
against corruption must target both the giver and the receiver.
</P>
<P>
He noted that organizations should put in place internal
control to facilitate early detection of corruption practices
perpetrated by their employees.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned that Kenyans should stop accusing one
another over the country's plight to protect the country's
interests.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Autonomy Ballot Campaign Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two rival camps in East Timor
kicked off their campaigns ahead of the August 30
U.N.-administered autonomy ballot on Saturday, according to the
Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the 14-day campaign, Governor Abilio Jose Osorio
Soares is of the view that a door-to-door campaign model is much
better than others to implement in avoiding the two rival groups
from any unexpected possibilities.
</P>
<P>
"The door-to-door campaign model will give more security
guarantees than such other models as a massive gathering," he told
a press conference in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said the civil servants who planned or wanted to be involved
in the campaign must leave out their official uniforms so that
their involvement in it is for a personal basis as part of East
Timorese society.
</P>
<P>
They cannot use any local government-owned facilities, like
funds and vehicles, in participating in the pro-autonomy campaign
rallies, he said, adding that the local administration will be
neutral during the campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Soares called on his people to realize the importance of a
conducive situation during the campaign period, in the balloting
day and after the ballot.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) officials
to explain the autonomy package that the governments of Indonesia
and Portugal and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had approved in
the New York Agreement on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior officials of Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N.
endorsed the formation of a consultative body in East Timor to
facilitate peace and cooperation following the ballot on the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
The body would be made up of 25 representatives, U.N. special
envoy Jamsheed Marker said after completing the two-day tripartite
talks at the Foreign Ministry here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The list of the members would be announced soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Marker said the tripartite talks would reconvene in Lisbon on
August 26 "in order to continue the discussion on the remaining
stages of the process."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian delegation Nugroho Wisnumurti, who
is director general for political affairs at the Foreign Ministry,
said the consultative body would begin its tasks on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow the
territory's people to choose whether their homeland should become
an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The merger of French banks has come into a chaos, as the
Banque Nationale de Paris will obtain about 60 percent of the
shares of the bank Paribas, while waiting for an arbitration of
the French Ministry of Finance on its take-over bid against
another private bank, the Societe Generale, from which it has
taken control of 42 percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Mid-West state of Kansas has decided to allow
public school teachers either teach the theory of creation of the
Bible or the Darwinist theory of evolution of species according to
their choice of conscience. The decision by the Kansas State Board
of Education made up a victory for the ultra-conservative charches
who reject Darwinism.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A new battle on the origin of life was launched after the U.
S. state of Kansas has made the teaching of the theory of
evolution of species by Charles Darwin a commonplace option for
teachers of public schools. Leaving the door open to creationist
thesis and obscurantism, the decision has triggered a political
and scientific outcry in the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian troops started a major offensive on Friday to
eliminate the Islamic fighters who controlled several villages in
Dagestan. Moscow also threatened to bomb Chechnya which had served
as a base for the Islamists.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K.R.
Narayanan Saturday urged the nation to stem the tide of population
explosion in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation on the eve of Independence Day, he
said that the country's population is "increasing at an alarming
rate and it has been estimated that India's population would cross
the one billion mark on Independence Day."
</P>
<P>
"One third of our people still live below the poverty level,"
he continued. "Almost half of our adult population is illiterate
and more than half of our children are undernourished."
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to have political and social will to
stem the tide of population explosion "instead of frittering away
our energies in the pursuit of the politics of power and pelf."
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed that the magnitude of these
problems is so immense that if the country does not address them
as "our over-riding political, social and economic priorities, the
galloping population would overwhelm us in the future."

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Governor Hopes Rupiah to Strengthen Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril
Sabirin Saturday expressed his hope that the rupiah can again
strengthen next week after a week-long weakening following the
Bank Bali scandal which rocked the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"God willing, the rupiah's value will rebound after undergoing
fluctuations in the past few days," Sabirin told reporters
following a meeting with President B.J. Habibie here.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 7,930/7,980 per U.S. dollar in the
interbank spot market here Friday, 70 points down from the
previous day's closing at 7,860/7,910 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said the rupiah was ideally traded at the level of
6,000 to 7,000, but it had weakened to almost 8,000 rupiah against
the greenback in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah had weakened following the alleged criminal action
in an interbank transaction between publicly listed Bank Bali and
the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
The two institutions, Bank Bali and IBRA, had allegedly
committed a criminal act which also involves a member of the
ruling Golkar Party's central executive board.
</P>
<P>
Bank Bali allegedly paid Golkar's Deputy Treasurer Setyo
Novanto and other businessmen related to Golkar some 550 billion
rupiah (80.87 million U.S. dollars) in commission for recovering
904.6 billion rupiah (about 133 million dollars) in interbank
credits.
</P>
<P>
Habibie had pledged that the government will probe into the
scandal that rocked Bank Bali.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Allows Foreign Tourists to Buy Tax-Free Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists visiting
Thailand will be allowed to buy locally-made automobiles with tax
exemption and lower prices, a senior Finance Ministry official
said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai News Agency quoted Somchainuek Hengtrakul,
director-general of the Customs Department, as saying that given
the tax exemption, automobiles purchased under the scheme would be
60 percent cheaper than those sold on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists could then drive the cars to travel in the
country and even drive out to neighboring countries which have
road-links with Thailand, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme is initiated by the Customs Department and will be
proposed to the cabinet soon, if approved, it will be launched in
November, making Thailand the first ASEAN country to do so," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Somchainuek said that the initiative, similar to that earlier
introduced by the European Union, is aimed at promoting "Made in
Thailand" products and boosting Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists could either ship the purchased cars back to
their countries, or sell them to local buyers, who would then have
to pay full tax and other fees as those sold on the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Urged to Lift Ban on Gypsum Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi cement producers have
urged the government to withdraw a ban on the import of gypsum, a
raw material for cement, saying that otherwise the country's
fast-growing cement industry may face a crisis due to the ban.
</P>
<P>
The cement industry in the country has achieved a remarkable
growth as a result of increasing domestic demand during the last
decade, the Independent daily newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cement production capacity now stands at about 3 million
tons against that of only 200,000 tons in 1972, and the present
demand is about 6 million tons, leaving a shortfall of 3 million
tons per annum, the Cement Manufacturers Association was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2004, Bangladesh will become self-sufficient in
cement, and if trade negotiations with neighboring countries go in
the right direction, the cement industry is likely to emerge as a
new export sector.
</P>
<P>
If the ban on the import of gypsum is not withdrawn
immediately, it is feared that cement production will suffer and
lead to higher import of cement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment has already recorded registration of 35
factories with a capacity of about 14 million tons, of which 15
have already gone into operation while three more will go into
production soon.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 10 factories with 100-percent foreign investments will
also go into production by the year 2002, while eight with a
production capacity of 4 million tons of 100 percent local
investment are at the early stage of construction. If all the
approved projects go into production by the year 2004, the cement
sector will need about half a million tons of gypsum annually.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produces gypsum as a by-product, and it is used as
soil fertilizer. Gypsum is also used for producing cement and
accounts for 5 percent of the raw material.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has estimated that 200,000 tons of
gypsum will be needed for the farm sector while the cement sector
has a current demand of about 150,000 tons against the local
availability of 200,000 tons, leaving a shortfall of 150,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> China Upsetted by Italy at Women's Volleyball GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy pulled off an upset victory
over World runners-up China 3-0 here on Saturday at 1999 World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix Macao Leg.
</P>
<P>
The scores are 29-27, 26-24 and 27-25, which marked the first-
ever victory for Italy over China since they beat China 3-2 at the
same tournament two years ago in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While Italian head coach Angiolino Frigoni kept calm over the
win, saying "Today's victory doesn't mean tommorow's win", his
Chinese counterpart Hu Jin acknowledged that "the Italians played
better than us today."
</P>
<P>
Hu explained that China suffered the defeat mainly due to
unforced errors and low successive percentage of first offence.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the defeat suggested China's arch-rivals were not
only those traditional ones such as Cuba, Russia and Brazil, but
also Italy, the Netherlands, Croatia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
World number fifth Italy, where volleyball is the most
practised women sport, looked in top form for a steady performance
as they fought back from behind in three sets to win the crucial
points respectively.
</P>
<P>
China opened a good start by leading to 19-16, but were blocked
by the Italians at the net, conceding the lead to 24-23. After
saving four set points, the Chinese lost the set at 29-27.
</P>
<P>
After leading at 22-20 in the second set, China was again
stopped from the brink of the victory as the Italians caught up to
level the score at 24-24 and kept the winning rhythm for two big
points with powerful spikes and an block-out from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the third set, the two teams exchanged the
leads till the score deadlocked at 19-all.
</P>
<P>
The more powerful and steady Italians then took three points in
a row, and increased their advantage to 24-21.
</P>
<P>
The fighting Chinese saved three match points and came back to
overtake the lead at 25-24. At the crucial point, the Italians'
spikes told everything that the Chinese could not cope with. They
took three points consecutively, sealing the match in 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In another game on Saturday, three-time winner Brazil showed
their superority of firm defence and powerful spikes and totally
controlled the game from the very beginning, finishing the match
25-18, 25-17 and 25-20 over the Netherlands in just 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we lost so easily is that we are too tired today
because yesterday's match against China was finished too late, "
said Dutch head coach Pierre Mathieu.
</P>
<P>
Asked for the prospect on Sunday's match against China,
Brazilian head coach Bernardo Rocha de Rezende said: "It is going
to be a tough one."
</P>
<P>
He added that China was not as strong as last year because they
were testing now. "We have to play better than today so that we
can have chances to beat them."
</P>
<P>
Italy is to meet the Netherlands on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Orders Probe Into Manila Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to
conduct an exhaustive probe into Friday's explosion at the NBI
headquarters in Manila, which killed seven people, a senior
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in an interview here
that Estrada issued the order when he met NBI Director Federico
Opinion Friday night in the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"When Director Opinion reported to the president Friday, he
(Estrada) told him to get to the bottom of this case," Zamora
said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview here Saturday, Opinion said he has
relayed the president's directive to his staff immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I instructed them to conduct an exhaustive investigation,
whether it was the result of an accidental incident or if it was
deliberate. I want the truth to come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
A pre-dawn explosion Friday rocked the NBI building in Manila,
killing seven persons and injuring 12 others.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which was centered in the NBI's Special
Investigation Division (SID) office, sparked a two-hour fire.
Several firearms and ammunition as well as office equipment and
documents were damaged by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, NBI Director Opinion said the explosion could be
targeted at SID chief Ruel Lazala, who headed a team which had
conducted a big drug operation recently.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Stop Sending Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Young Africans Welfare
Association (YAWA) has called on African leaders to stop sending
youngsters to the battle front in the continent.
</P>
<P>
During the young people's pan-African consultative conference
held in Lusaka Friday, the association expressed concern at the
number of young people who are dying in armed conflicts currently
ravaging the continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ireen Lungu, chairperson of the association's University of
Zambia branch, was quoted by Saturday's Times of Zambia newspaper
as saying at the conference that young people in Africa had great
potential to develop their continent, and peace was a prerequisite
to sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Young people required good quality education, health care,
employment and other social amenities for them to fully exploit
their potential and contribute to the socio-economic development
of Africa, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She also said young people should have their human rights such
as freedom of expression guaranteed including their right to life
and development.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, President of the association Aalgernon
Situla expressed concern at the number of innocent and potentially
productive young people dying in wars being perpetrated by some
African leaders.
</P>
<P>
African countries should give young people a chance to free
themselves from continued oppression and contribute toward
sustainable development of the continent, Situla said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the leaders involved in armed conflicts to resolve
their differences through dialog in order to give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
He commended Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for his
tireless efforts in trying to bring peace to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and expressed hope that the cease-fire which
was signed on July 10 in Lusaka would be successfully implemented.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Eight people have been admitted
to Mulago hospital's cholera treatment center following another
outbreak of the epidemic in Uganda's capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
This cholera outbreak was mainly blamed on the current heavy
rains, Saturday's Monitor newspaper quoted Cholera Camp Manager
Bwire Godfrey as saying.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the public to take precautionary measures when
handling food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kampala District Health Director Misaki Mubiru has
deployed health workers to sensitize residents on cleanliness,
saying if the situation worsens, all unhygienic eating and
drinking places would be closed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 153 Ugandans have died of cholera in the country so
far this year. About 3,053 cholera cases have been reported since
the beginning of 1999, bringing the cumulative number to 52,216
since the last epidemic outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Internet Becomes More Popular in Mideast: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Internet is gaining a
wider popular appeal among communities in the Middle East,
drawing more users from lower educational backgrounds and entering
more homes than offices, a study said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year and a half, the number of Internet users in
the region who hold only a high-school diploma or less has
dramatically increased from 17 percent to 27 percent, said the
study issued by Internet Arab World magazine.
</P>
<P>
The increase has come entirely from new adult users, it added.
</P>
<P>
The users with an undergraduate university degree remained
dominant at 58.6 percent among the Internet users in the Arab
world, which are estimated at 1.1 million now.
</P>
<P>
Holders of PhDs and master's degree account for 14.5 percent of
1,000 surveyed, which was a drop of about 5 percent over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The study, made in cooperation with DITnet, is based on a user
profile survey conducted on-line for the second time in a year and
a half.
</P>
<P>
One of the significant outcomes of the survey is that an
increasing number of users are spending more time on the Internet
at home than in office.
</P>
<P>
The majority of respondents, 72 percent, said home was the
primary place where they accessed the Internet, while only 22
percent said it was the office.
</P>
<P>
Many factors are contributing to the increasing popularity of
the Internet among Arab users, which include falling rates of
Internet access that are encouraging more people to subscribe at
home, and an increasing awareness of the benefits and various
services available on-line.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that the average age of Internet users in
the Arab world had, meanwhile, increased by one year to reach 30,
but remained younger than the global average, which stands at 33.
</P>
<P>
The Internet community in the Arab world remained
overhelmingly dominated by men, with only a marginal increase in
women users in the sample from 4.2 percent to 6 percent, the study
said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Officer Arrested on Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese army officer assigned
to the country's House Speaker Nabih Berri's security team has
been arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
First Adjutant Hussein Ali Alayyan, also known as Abu Alayyan,
was arrested Monday night at his home near the country's southern
coastal city of Sidon while in radio contact with an unidentified
party, a security source said.
</P>
<P>
Alayyan was allegedly communicating with members of Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His wireless transmission apparatus and his official handgun
were confiscated, the source said, adding the suspect served on
the security team assigned to Berri's home.
</P>
<P>
Before he joined the army several years ago, Alayyan was a
member of Berri-led Amal Movement and led the group's
anti-Israeli resistance operations in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Berri's office declined comment on the report when contacted
by the paper.

<HEADLINE> Quake Rocks Indonesian Capital, West Java </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A tectonic earthquake measuring
6.0 on the Richter scale jolted Jakarta, Lampung, Bengkulu and
West Java provinces at 07:16 a.m. local time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The central Meteorological and Geophysical Agency said in its
statement here that the quake's epicenter was located in the Sunda
Straits, about 350 kilometers west of Jakarta and 80 kilometers
beneath the sea surface.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, several people were going out their office during
the quake, particularly those whose office were in high buildings.
</P>
<P>
In Lampung, according to the Antara News Agency, the quake
caused panic-stricken residents to stay outdoors.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are no reports of damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a quake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale
rocked Kupang, capital of East Nusa Tenggara, while the previous
day (August 12) a quake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale also
jolted the central Sulawesi town of Luwuk.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, comprising thousands of islands which are part of
the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire," is prone to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
In February 1994, Lampung suffered serious damage from
earthquakes, causing 207 people to die and thousands of people
injured.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges African Govts to Control Tobacco Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is urging African governments to come up with appropriate
laws to control the use of tobacco to avoid tobacco-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Harare Friday, the WHO said that if
nothing is done in the next 20 years, deaths caused by tobacco in
Africa will double and represent nine percent of all deaths.
</P>
<P>
"This can be prevented if African governments pass and enforce
appropriate laws to control the use of tobacco and undertake a
sustained campaign to inform and educate the people about the
dangers of tobacco smoking," the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The organization said because of intensive advertising
campaigns by the tobacco industry to promote their products,
tobacco smoking had reached epidemic proportions and was fast
becoming a major public health hazard in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for Africa to check the tobacco epidemic
before it becomes a much bigger public health problem. We have
enough priority problems already. We should not add tobacco," WHO
regional director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He said while some countries may argue that tobacco sustained
their economies, studies by the World Bank and other institutions
had shown that tobacco was bad economics because of its negative
effect on the health of the population.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The social, economic and disease burdens caused by
tobacco far exceed the seeming economic benefits or gains it
provides."
</P>
<P>
Tobacco provides a sizeable portion of the foreign exchange
earnings of some African countries such as Malawi, Tanzania,
Uganda, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, under its Tobacco Free Initiative Program, which was
launched last year, provided crop substitution among tobacco
growing nations. The suggested crops were vegetables, flowers,
citrus fruits and cotton, among others.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Cease-fire in Congo for Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Parties to the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have agreed to temporarily lay
down arms to make way for the immunization of over 10 million
children against polio-myelitis, the daily Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three-phase national immunization program will cover the
whole of the war-ravaged country of about 50 million people.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Samba, director of World Health Organization (WHO)
regional office for Africa, said this in Harare Friday.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the warring forces, including Uganda- and
Rwanda-backed rebels, agreed to the temporary cessation of
hostilities after a series of meetings spearheaded by United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which also involved international partners,
took six months.
</P>
<P>
Belligerents from both sides are taking part in the program,
which is incorporating measles vaccination and administering
vitamin A supplements.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Health For Peace", the campaign is part of the WHO's
initiative to clear the world of vaccine-preventable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Samba said to show their commitment, the governments of Rwanda
and Uganda were even sending staff to assist in the program.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary cease-fire has nothing to do with the Lusaka
peace agreement. This is not a political matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase started Friday and is expected to last at the
weekend. The second phase is planned for September 17 to 19, while
the third is scheduled for October 22 to 24.

<HEADLINE> China resents U.S. Government's allowing the Dalai Lama trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China voices its strong
resentment and firm opposition with the U.S. government for
allowing the Dalai Lama to visit the United States, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the Dalai Lama's recent trip to New York,
Zhu said China has already made a solemn representation to the U.S.
side.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is an inalienable part of the Chinese territories, and
the Tibet issue is entirely China's internal affairs, which brooks
no interference from any foreign country, Zhu said, adding that
the Dalai lama is not merely a religious figure but a political
exile engaged in the activities of splitting China.
</P>
<P>
"China demands that the U.S. adheres to its stance of
recognizing Tibet as a part of China and not supporting 'the
independence of Tibet', and that it immediately put a halt to its
erroneous acts of interfering in China's internal affairs
concerning the Tibet issue," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Police Warn Against Swindlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Police departments of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) have warned the residents against the
tricks of international swindlers who lure people with attractive
"prizes and special offers."
</P>
<P>
Some European-based companies are sending letters to targeted
people in the UAE, informing they have won valuable prizes like
gold ornaments, a house, or a luxury holiday in an expensive
destination, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
"They ask their would-be victims to send certain amounts of
money and the prizes will be sent to them by mail or courier," the
Khaleej Times daily quoted the sources as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of such swindling letters have landed in the
UAE recently, they noted, adding that a massive awareness campaign
has been launched to protect people from the gangs of swindlers.
</P>
<P>
Some letters say the targeted person has won a diamond ring, an
expensive watch, a holiday in a European resort or simply an
amount of money. The tricksters say a small amount is needed for
sending the prize.
</P>
<P>
Other letters, according to crime investigation officers, ask
UAE residents to receive some large amounts of money and then hand
them over to a third party, for the service they could be paid a
good commission.
</P>
<P>
"But the targeted person here would have to pay an initial
amount of money or send his credit card number or bank account
number," police officers said.
</P>
<P>
Many people got shocked when they knew that they had lost
their hard-earned cash, having fallen victim to these tricks.
</P>
<P>
The countries from which the letters were sent include Spain,
the United States, the U.K. and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"People had called the numbers shown on the letters and found
that they were all incorrect numbers," the officers said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people contacted the embassies of these countries and
discovered for themselves that the offices of these tricksters'
companies did not even exist."
</P>
<P>
The police admit that it is difficult for them to contain
this problem unless people themselves fight the crime by refusing
to accept tricksters' offers.

<HEADLINE> Deflationary Pressure Eased In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The decline in China's price
indices eased off a little last month, raising hopes that the
country's economy is climbing out of its deflationary cycle, today
's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index (RPI), negative since October 1997,
dipped 2.6 percent in July on a year-on-year basis, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics. The RPI for the year's first
seven months was down 3.1 percent after falling 3.2 percent in the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The broader consumer price index (CPI), which also covers
services, was 1.4 percent down in July, averaging minus 1.7
percent for the first seven months. The CPI dropped 1.8 percent
during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the improvement of the indices in July to
a recovery in the prices of meat, poultry and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales totaled 238 billion yuan (28.7 billion US dollars)
in July, up 5.6 percent over the same month of last year. The
growth rate was unchanged from June.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it plans to raise the salaries of civil
servants and increase benefits for pensioners and workers laid off
from state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Growth in public sector fixed assets investment was the major
force driving the economy in the second half of last year and the
first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it will expand spending in the second
half of the year to give a fresh stimulus to the economy. But the
volume of spending has not yet been announced.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in the foreign trade sector would also assist the
government in its efforts to prevent economic growth from slowing
further.
</P>
<P>
China's exports totaled 17.3 billion US dollars in July, up 7.5
percent over the same month of 1998.

<HEADLINE> JP Morgan Minimizes Crisis Risk in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 13 (Xinhua) -- International investment
firm JP Morgan considers it is "not very probable" that an
economic crisis would follow the change of government in Mexico in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo's financial strategy
strengthened the economy of his country and reduced its
vulnerability toward the flight of foreign capital, said the JP
Morgan's financial consulting institution in an analysis dated in
July and published Friday in the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
The changes of government have been characterized for the last
25 years by big devaluation that evaporated the savings of the
people, increased the foreign debt of businessmen, raised
inflation and reduced the growth of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The institution pointed as favorable factors for the Mexican
economy a flexible rate of exchange as well as the reduction of
the proportion of the current account deficit to the gross
domestic product from 5 percent during the third four-month period
of 1998 to 2.8 percent during the first four-month period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other positive measures are the guarantees of foreign financing
of 17 billion U.S. dollars, including International Monetary Fund
resources, and the strengthening of the local banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican economy "starts to recover" after the "mini
recession" at the end of 1998 and the foreign resources will
permit it to dampen any eventual flight of capital, which would
contain any devaluation, it added.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan said elections scheduled for July 2 next year when
the next Mexican president will come out will be "the most
transparent and competitive of the last 70 years" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The institution said that there are minor risks of financial
speculation in the political environment in Mexico and that the
only risk factor for the Mexican economy is the weakness of the
banking system of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said at the beginning of the year that he would deliver
"clear accounts" to his successor, referring to the fact that 20
days after his assumption of office, a flight of capital inherited
from the previous government caused an economic crisis in December
of 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest hydro-
electric power project, which is being built at the Three Gorges
of the Yangtze River, is getting funding from the booming southern
Chinese province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The project has used 230 million yuan (27.7 million US dollars)
in funds channeled through Guangdong Province for the dam,
relocation of local people, and for public facilities in the last
six years, according to a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
Feng Keye, who is in charge of financial aid for the project,

in building energy, telecommunications, and transportation systems
in the new communities for the relocated people, in answer to the
central government's call for help.
</P>
<P>
Private firms in Guangdong have taken over a number of
lackluster businesses near the dam project site through mergers or
outright purchases to help them leave an area that will be under
water when the dam is completed in early next century.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents planning tours
abroad can now apply for personal passports with a certificate
proving they have at least 4,000 U.S. dollars in the bank, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the past, all personal passport applicants were required to
provide letters of invitation and financial guarantees from their
relatives and friends abroad, to ensure they had someone to turn
to for help if they encountered problems during their trip.
</P>
<P>
This will henceforth only be required when emigration officials
deem it necessary, said Liu Chengshe, an official with the Exit
and Entry Administration Division of the Beijing Public Security
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Passports will be valid for five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bureau has also simplified the procedures for
payment of passport and service charges as well as for passport
applications for those leaving the country on business.
</P>
<P>
The bureau handled more than 90,000 applications in the first
six months, some 30,000 more than the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Climate Changes to Harm Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Central America is highly
vulnerable to climate changes and will suffer the consequent
effects in the coming century, Christina Figueres, Director of the
American Sustainable Development Center said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Figueres said the sea level could rise between 15 and 95
centimeters in the next 100 years, threatening the coast
settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The layer of the atmosphere that produces the greenhouse
effect has undergone concentration of gases of 30 percent in the
last 100 years, which might raise the temperature of the Earth,"
said the environmentalist in an interview with the RPC Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Earth will undergo the greenhouse effect resulting from the
concentration of gases and the temperature of the planet will rise
1 to 3.5 degrees centigrade in the next 100 years, said Figueres.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization in the countries of the northern
hemisphere and the irresponsible deforestation in the developing
countries are to blame for this climate change, she said.
</P>
<P>
Both activities have brought about carbon dioxide emissions,
which form a blanket around the Earth and retain the heat of the
sun radiation.
</P>
<P>
"These phenomena cause a rise in the planet's temperature,
which has many effects," such as the dangerous rise of the sea
level, droughts, hurricanes, storms and the migration of
agricultural zones, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Director said that the concentration of the gases that
produce greenhouse effect could increase the incidence of
diseases such as malaria and dengue in the region.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crude Oil Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan crude basket
price rose to 17.28 U.S. dollars per barrel, the country's Mining
and Energy Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This level represented a 89 percent recovery in oil prices so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices have recovered by more than six dollars since
March thanks to an output cut of two million barrels, a decision
made by the producing countries on March 12, which will hold until
April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The oil basket price dropped 5.69 dollars per barrel in 1998
and, as a result, the Venezuelan government lost six billion
dollars or 43.5 percent in its revenue.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela saw its
profits down by 84 percent to 766 million dollars due to the oil
market crisis.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Economy Displays Resilience in 1998: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy displayed
considerable resilience in 1998 despite many hiccups caused by
external issues, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri
Lanka said in its annual report released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
These included the East Asian currency crisis, a decline in
Russian tea purchases and Indo-Pakistan nuclear tests, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The external sector performed reasonably well in 1998 to post
a positive balance of payment out-turn. Both exports and imports
recorded much lower increases, exports by 2.1 percent and imports
by 0.9 percent as compared with increases of 13 percent and 8
percent respectively in 1997," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were positive developments in foreign
direct investment (FDI) despite lesser official capital flows,
lower privatization proceeds and negative portfolio flows.
</P>
<P>
"According to estimates, the FDI flows increased from 129
million U.S. dollars in 1997 to 137 million dollars in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Tea prices, which remained buoyant for a few years, continued
to remain high during the first half of the year, but slipped in
the second half following the collapse of the Russian market.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, export earnings from tea showed only a modest
growth of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the impact of intense competition from East Asian
countries whose currencies depreciated sharply in the wake of the
Asian financial crisis, international prices for rubber and
coconut declined in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thus export earnings from rubber and coconut dropped by 45
percent and 32 percent in U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Sri Lanka's industrial exports increased
by 3.1 percent in 1998 compared with an earnings growth of 14
percent recorded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The major cause for the slow growth in industrial exports was a
drop in the value of petroleum product exports and other
industrial exports by 24.7 percent and 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the downturn in commodity prices in the
international markets following the recession in East Asian
countries helped Sri Lanka contain its import bill.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the trade deficit is estimated to have declined
from 1,225 million dollars in 1997 to 1,157 million dollars in
1998, a drop of 5.5 percent.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's popular
satirist and journalist Jaime Garzon was killed by two gunmen on
his way to work early Friday as the country's bumpy peace process
took its latest toll.
</P>
<P>
Colleagues said Garzon had received threats from right-wing
paramilitary groups who did not like his sympathetic stand toward
the left-wing rebels. He had helped organize rebel news
conferences and served as an intermediary between guerrillas and
the families of kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old journalist, comic and political activist, was
shot in the head several times when he was pulling his jeep to the
offices of Radionet, where he worked as a morning host, police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a witness, one of the gunmen got off a motorcycle
and shot Garzon point blank five times.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Pastrana condemned the assassination and
ordered police to hunt down the killers as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"It was not just that he made us laugh. Jaime in large part
identified with the sentiments of Colombians, with what we were
thinking," Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
The killing added to a rising wave of paramilitary, guerrilla
and drug trafficking violence as the country struggles hard along
the road to national reconciliation.

<P>
Gullit blasted Rennie after the game and was alleged to have
made comments to the Sheffield match official after the game, and
now the FA have confirmed that they have charged Gullit with
misconduct after receiving the referee's match report.
</P>
<P>
"Ruud Gullit has been charged with misconduct for alleged
comments made to Uriah Rennie at the end of last Saturday's game,"
FA spokesman Steve Double said. "He has 14 days to respond."
</P>
<P>
But Double added that the investigation into Villa boss Gregory,
who was also mentioned by Rennie in his report, was still
continuing.
</P>
<P>
"Further investigation into that is going on," Double said.
</P>
<P>
Shearer had appealed for Rennie to re-consider his decision
after he and nearby Villa players were bemused by the second
yellow card.
</P>
<P>
But Rennie stood firm and upheld his judgement and insisted
that Shearer had been dismissed for "persistent misconduct."

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has been striving to make its scientific institutions
more market-orientated by turning scientific organizations
specializing in technological developments and consultancy into
corporate entities.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial plan concerning the implementation of
scientific and technological reform, financial allocations for the
province's 39 scientific organizations engaged in technological
development will be halted gradually over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Financial allocations to another 18 organizations specializing
in technical consultancy will also be reduced by 70 percent in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The money thus saved will be used to support major scientific
and technological research programs in the concerned organizations.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province, which is in the forefront of China's reform
and opening-up drive, has 69 provincial-level scientific and
technological organizations.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the plan, workers at these scientific and
technological organizations will be encouraged to buy stakes in
their respective new corporate entities -- share-holding companies
with limited liability or joint-stock cooperative companies --
following the reform.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Military Fortification Discovered In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have discovered
a number of military buildings dating back to the Western Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. - A.D. 24), south of the Yellow River in Xin'an
County, in Central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The site is 178 meters long from south to north and 29 meters
wide from east to west, with walls, cornerstones, and alleyways.
There are many tiles with the Chinese character "Guan" (which
means "fort" or "pass" in the Chinese language) on them that have
been found at the spot that local archeologists say were specially
used for military forts.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists say they believe the site was part of a
central Chinese military fort at Hanguguan and might have been
used as a storehouse for food or weapons.
</P>
<P>
The discovery indicates that Hanguguan was not only a military
fort but also the main section of a system of fortifications that
ran to the Yellow River, the archeologists say, and it provides
valuable materials for the study of the economy, military affairs
and transportation during the ancient Han Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Vismara Wins Second Gold at Military World Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Croatia, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy's European
championships runner-up Lorenzo Vismara on Friday won his second
gold medal at the Military World Games here when he took the men's
100 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
He clocked 49.56 seconds, ahead of silver medalist Sergei
Ashikhmin of Russia at 50.71. Another Russian Dmitry Chernychov
timed 51.37 to finish third.
</P>
<P>
Vismara set the International Military Sports Council record in
the event.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with the victory, especially for the fact
that I had prepared for the European Championship in Istanbul,"
said Vismara, also the winner in Thursday's 50 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"I managed to stay in good shape and set the new CISM record,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In women's 100 meters backstroke, Russia's Yuliya Fomenko beat
China's world record holder He Cihong to second place.
</P>
<P>
Fomenko timed one minute 3.74 seconds, nearly one full second
ahead of He, whose world record of 1:00.16 remains intact since
1994.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about the gold medal," said Fomenko after the
win.
</P>
<P>
But another Chinese Le Ying swam well in women's 200 meters
freestyle to beat Fomenko to second place.
</P>
<P>
She clocked 2:02.31 to snatch the gold, followed by Fomenko in
second place and Zhang Dan of China in third.
</P>
<P>
"I was not in top form these days but winning a gold medal of
course made me happy," said Le.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Agassi Reach Semi-finals at ATP Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- World No. 1 American Pete
Sampras cruised into the semi-finals of the $2.2 million ATP
Championship today with an easy victory over nemesis Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands in Cincinnati, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who turned 28 on Thursday, posted a 6-4, 6-2 victory
over the seventh-seeded Krajicek, extending his winning streak to
19 matches and setting up a semi-final matchup with countryman
Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the third seed, won a lengthy third set tiebreak and
advanced with 6-2, 7-6 (12-10) victory over No. 6 Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Sampras beat Agassi in straight sets in the
Wimbledon Final on July 4.
</P>
<P>
In another quarter-final match, fourth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia beat Britian's Tim Henman, the fifth seed 7-5, 7-5.
Tonight, second seed Patrick Rafter of Australia faces unseeded
American Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek had won four straight matches over Sampras, last
season's runner-up at this event.
</P>
<P>
"Richard has given me problems throughout my career," Sampras
said. "His game is kind of very similar in our styles of play.
When he gets hot, he is very, very tough to play. I knew he has
had a great record (against me).
</P>
<P>
"It was very close in the beginning," said Krajicek. "We were
pretty equal in the beginning and just whoever was going to take
his chances and also seeing how he has been playing the last
couple of weeks. I think it just happened who was most confident
at the moment."

<HEADLINE> Bucks Name Ernie Grunfeld New General Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ernie Grunfeld, who was run
out of New York before the Knicks made their stunning run to the
NBA Finals in the lockout-shortened season, today was named
general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks, replacing Bob Weinhauer.
</P>
<P>
Weinhauer was fired Wednesday, despite helping the Bucks to
their first playoff appearance since 1991. But coach George Karl,
who signed a four-year, $20 million contract with the Bucks before
last season, has a large say in personnel matters and is expected
to form a more cohesive tandem with Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
Grunfeld was relieved of his duties on April 21 as the Knicks
struggled to find any sort of cohesion during the regular season
following the acquisitions of Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell
via trades.
</P>
<P>
Despite barely entering the playoffs at 27-23, Grunfeld was
vindicated as the Knicks became the first eighth seed to reach the
NBA Finals, which they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.
</P>
<P>
Grunfeld, 44, had served the Knicks organization for 17 years,
including the last eight-plus in the front office. He started as
director of administration in 1990 and continually was promoted to
president and general manager midway through the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
The Bucks lost free agents Dell Curry and Michael Curry to
Toronto and Detroit, but re-sign veteran guard Haywoode Workman.
</P>
<P>
Grunfeld had a nine-year NBA playing career that ended with the
Knicks in the 1985-86 season. He also served within the
organization as a broadcaster and coach before joining the front
office before the 1990-91 season.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Hire McHone, Drew Assistant Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Detroit Pistons coach Alvin
Gentry today filled out his staff, hiring Mo McHone and Larry Drew
to join assistant George Irvine.
</P>
<P>
McHone just completed a coaching stint for USA Basketball,
leading a collection of CBA All-Stars to a silver medal at the Pan
Am Games. McHone led the Skeyforce to four CBA Finals appearances
in five years.
</P>
<P>
Drew served as an assistant coach the past seven seasons with
the Los Angeles Lakers, but new coach Phil Jackson opted to re-
unite with his former Chicago Bulls staff of Tex Winter, Jim
Cleamons and Johnnie Rodgers. Drew was an assistant for Laker
coaches Randy Pfund, Del Harris and Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
McHone also has ectensive NBA experience, serving an assistant
to Stan Albeck with both the Cleveland Cavaliers and San Antonio
Spurs from 1979-83. McHone was named interim coach of the Spurs
during the 1984-85 season, posting an 11-20 mark.
</P>
<P>
Drew was originally drafted by the Pistons with the 17th
overall pick in the 1980 draft. After starting as an advance scout,
Drew has been spending more time on the sidelines in recent years,
including ocaching the Lakers in summer leagues.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson 'Very Hopeful' Keane Will Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Alex Ferguson has admitted to
being "very hopeful" that Roy Keane will stay at Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The club's skipper is set to delay a decision on his future -
he had been due to make an announcement on Saturday on whether to
accept United's contract offer. That move, combined with United
manager Ferguson's confidence, now points to the Republic of
Ireland international agreeing to stay at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
"I am very hopeful," said Ferguson. "I think Roy knows the
value of the club and he loves playing for Manchester United. That
's a strong set of cards to hold in your hand, and you add all
these things up, he's captain of the club and having a terrific
spell."
</P>
<P>
He added: "But he is undecided about a lot of things and I
think quite rightly he's taking his time with it - you shouldn't
rush into these things anyway.
</P>
<P>
"But hopefully he'll stay," he told Sky.
</P>
<P>
Keane's original plan was to make his announcement on Friday,
and then postponed it to following Saturday's home game against
Leeds.
</P>
<P>
However Keane's lawyer and adviser, Michael Kennedy, said he
may need even longer to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said: "Roy Keane is considering his position and he
will make a decision in the next day or two."

<HEADLINE> Hill: I Have Justified My 5m Pay Packet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Formula one driver Damon Hill
admitted on Friday that he did not deliver on his whopping 5
million pounds-a-year pay packet.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion revealed the failings and
frustrations of his final season in Formula One which saw him
controversially quit the last race in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I have gone from Roadrunner to Wile E. Coyote,"
said Hill, referring to the famous cartoon characters, after
crashing out of Friday's first practice for Sunday's Hungarian
Grand Prix. "Nothing I do seems to work." If Hill resembled the
Roadrunner, an unstoppable speed merchant, during his 1996
championship winning year, this season he has been more like the
hapless coyote who failed in everything he did.
</P>
<P>
"It has been very, very frustrating this season," added the
Jordan driver who came close to quitting last month but will
retire at the end of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I have not delivered and that makes it awkward when you know
you have not fufilled your potential.
</P>
<P>
"It has been tough to bear and I have shown that as I have lost
my temper a few times. But I wouldn't be a racing driver if I didn
't have that aggression.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I am not in control of the car. If I could control
the car everything else would be alright.
</P>
<P>
"It has been quite a disappointing year, not only because I
have had a lot of bad luck but because when I have had
opportunities I have not done as well as I would have hoped.
</P>
<P>
"The car has obviously been a better car throughout the year
than last year, and that has made it more difficult for myself."
</P>
<P>
Hill, who will be 39 next month, has managed just five points
from 10 races this year compared to the 33 collected by Heinz-
Harald Frentzen.

WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale prices
increased just 0.2 percent in July because a big jump in energy
prices overwhelmed a sharp drop in food costs, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The July's advance in the Producer Price Index matched the 0.2
percent rise in May. It was slightly better than expected. Many
analysts had been anticipating that the prices would rise 0.3
percent in July. June's prices had actually fallen 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the moderate gain in wholesale prices, if matched
at the consumer level, could ease concerns somewhat at the Federal
Reserve about a potential breakout of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets were buoyed by the better-than-expected
news on inflation. The bond market rallied, pushing the yield
down on Treasury's 30-year bonds, and Dow Jones industrial
average closed up 184.26 points at 10,973.65.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 1.7 percent, compared to no change for all of 1998.
The rise in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big jump
in energy costs, which had been falling for much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
For July, energy costs picked up 3.4 percent, led by 12.7
percent increase in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
The July gain in gasoline prices was the largest since a 26
percent surge in April, which helped push overall wholesale prices
up by 0.5 percent that month, the biggest increase this year. That
gain plus an even bigger rise in consumer prices in April put the
Fed on inflation alert and led to a June 30 increase in a key Fed
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The 3.4 percent rise in energy costs in July was partially
offset by a 0.9 percent drop in food prices. Beef prices, which
had risen sharply in June, declined by 3.4 percent in July, the
biggest one-month drop since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories,
wholesales prices were unchanged in July, after having fallen 0.2
percent in June.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Turkish Tractor Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Friday that it will lend 35 million
U.S. dollars to Uzel Makina Sanayi A.S. of Turkey to help the
tractor maker modernize.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to move the company's manufacturing
plant from a crowded district of Istanbul to Duzce, about 210
kilometers away, and increase productivity and capacity.
</P>
<P>
Uzel Makina Sanayi produces agricultural tractors, diesel
engines and automotive parts. The company was established in 1930
as a carriage manufacturer, and later started manufacturing
automotive components. It began producing tractors in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Uzel Makina Sanayi is 85 percent owned by members of the Uzel
family through a holding company, and the remaining 15 percent of
the shares are traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the project are 98 million dollars. IFC's
investment includes a loan of 20 million dollars for its own
account and a syndicated loan of 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The mission of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is to
promote private sector investment in developing countries, which
will reduce poverty and improve people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Soar On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Friday as a government report on wholesale prices eased
concerns about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 184.26 or 1.7
percent at 10,973.65. The blue chip index rose 1.59 points
Thursday,
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 29.52 or 2.18 percent at 1,327.68 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq index rose 88.32 or 3.83 percent at
2,637.81.
</P>
<P>
Stocks soared after the Labor Department reported that
wholesale prices rose a less-than-expected 0.2 percent in July,
rising hopes that the Federal Reserve would not take aggressive
actions to prevent inflation from the U.S. economy. The moderate
rises in wholesale prices suggested inflation remained under
control.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been worried about the possibility of raising
interest rates for the second time in the Summer after the
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned three weeks ago
that the Federal Reserve would act "promptly and forcefully" to
preempt inflation if new data suggested that the pace of cost and
price increases will be picking up. Investors also fear a third
rate increase if risks rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 10.75 at 621.38 and the
American Stock Exchange index rose 3.09 at 783.74. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.23 at 434.05.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,951 up, 1,077 down and
516 unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 689.97 million shares from 742.42
