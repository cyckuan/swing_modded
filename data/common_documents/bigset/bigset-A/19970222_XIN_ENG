<HEADLINE> Chinese Expedition Team To Hike Through World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expedition team will
for the first time hike through the world's longest, deepest, and
highest canyon in April.
</P>
<P>
The team, organized by the China Association of Scientific
Expedition, is expected to spend one month walking through the
Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon in south Tibet.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, the group will try sailing down the swift
current of the river. No other explorers have succeeded in similar
attempts.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by Gao Dengyi, vice-chairman of the
association, at its second congress which was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists measured the canyon in 1994, determining
that it is 494 km long with an average depth of some 5,000 m,
which sets a world record in terms of length and depth.
</P>
<P>
The canyon, which U-turns around the Himalayas, is famous for
its layered rocks and lush plant life.
</P>
<P>
The association, set up in January 1989, has successfully
conducted expeditions to such places as Mount Qomolangma and the
Taklamakan Desert, with cooperation from their counterparts in the
United States and Japan.

for his great contributions to China's opening-up and reform
process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in his message to Chinese

"He will be long-remembered in China and elsewhere for setting
China on a successful course of economic reform," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog described Deng as an "important
statesman" whose opening-up and reform policy has brought China
"great economic success" and has contributed greatly to the "close
and trusting relations" between China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In her condolence message to Chinese President Jiang, British
Queen Elizabeth said Deng "will be long remembered by the people
of China, in whose history he played such a notable part."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major, in his message to Chinese
Premier Li Peng, said Deng's "visionary concept of 'one country,
two systems'... made a major contribution to the conclusion by
Britain and China of the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong in 1984."
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said Deng's policy of the
the opening up to the outside world has provided greater
opportunities to "further develop traditionally good relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil, in his condolence message to
Jiang, said the legacy of Deng, a great reformer with decisive
contributions to China's economic development and opening-up, will
be of crucial significance to China and its place in the world in
the future.
</P>
<P>
President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici of Malta, in his message to Jiang,
said: "Deng Xiaoping's rich experience in leadership has
contributed towards the transformation of China into a great and
powerful nation."
</P>
<P>
"He will always be remembered as the architect of China's
opening to the outside world and to new ideas and he was indeed
one of the great statesmen of this century," Bonnici said.

Lazarenko today described Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as "an
extraordinarily outstanding figure" and expressed condolences on

the two sides expressing their wishes to have close links in
various fields, South African Press Association reported today.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Rate Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
remained stable in January from December at 2.2 percent,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Compared with January 1996, Canadian consumers had to pay
higher prices for gasoline, car insurance, air travel as well as
for food, university tuition and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they benefited considerably from lower
mortgage interest rates, the federal fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, consumers experienced an average
price rise of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise was a result of increased charges for telephone
services, food, natural gas, women's clothing and cable
television.
</P>
<P>
Around the country, increases in the annual inflation rate
ranged from 0.7 percent in British Columbia (B.C.) province to a
high of 3.1 percent in the province of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
B.C. consumers benefited particularly from lower prices for car
insurance, new vehicles, gasoline and shelter, while Nova Scotians
were hit with higher price increases for food, fuel oil and
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 737 Is Less Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing 737, the most
popular passenger jet, is less safe than other airliners because
the failure of a single valve, the one that controls the rudder,
can cause it to crash, the National Transportation Safety Board
was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said however the board did not ground the
planes or even declare them unsafe. And Boeing and the Federal
Aviation Administration disagreed that the plane was less
airworthy than others.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have noted that failure of the valve is rare, and
have suggested that recent changes in operating procedures by the
airlines could compensate for the problem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Only last month, in a decision announced by F.A.A.'s Vice
President Al Gore, said it planned to propose replacing the
valves. That proposal has not officially been made, however,
because Boeing is still designing the replacement valves.
</P>
<P>
F.A.A. believed that it had solved the mystery of two 737
crashes in the country since 1994. Safety investigators have
long suspected that unusual rudder malfunctions were responsible
for the crashes.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that if Boeing were applying today for
permission to sell the plane, the request would not be approved
because the 737 violates a fundamental design criterion: that no
single failure be capable of causing a crash unless the failure is
"extremely improbable."

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for International Efforts to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) here today called for international efforts to prevent
blindness and visual disability warning that blindness and serious
visual disability will become a major socioeconomic burden
worldwide and may even balk progress in some middle and low income
countries.
</P>
<P>
In meetings held this week in Geneva, experts from WHO and
nongovernmental development organizations (NGDOs) called for a
global initiative for the elimination of avoidable blindness which
could bring together the international community, governments, a
broad spectrum of NGDOs and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
Currently, close to 150 million people worldwide suffer from
significant visual disability, 38 million of whom are blind. The
number will double by the year 2020 if national and international
efforts to avert blindness and visual disability are not
intensified, WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima pointed out.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts say that more than two-thirds of this blindness and
visual disability could be avoided through adequate and timely
prevention or treatment.
</P>
<P>
WHO's strategies to fight major causes of avoidable blindness
and visual disability include the strategy for the provision of
cataract surgery as part of primary health care and the so-called
"SAFE" strategy for elimination of trachoma: Surgery for
trichiasis (inturned eyelashes), Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness
and Environmental improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO press release, over 70 percent of seven
million people who become blind each year receive treatment and
their vision is restored. So, the number of blind persons
worldwide is currently increasing by up to two million per year.
80 percent of the new cases are related to aging.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan People Mourn Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- People from the island
province of Taiwan have been expressing sympathy and concern over
the death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away
in Beijing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Deng had made contributions in advocating reform and opening
up...and creating a new chapter for the exchanges between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits," wrote Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Foundation for Exchange across the Taiwan Straits, in a letter to
Wang Daohan, Chairman of the Association for the Relations across
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He asked Wang to relay his condolences to Deng's family.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan media have given extensive coverage to Deng over the
past two days. Editorials published in Thursday's "China Times"
and other major newspapers described Deng as "a figure who cannot
be written off by history" and "a man whose death has attracted
worldwide attention."
</P>
<P>
According to some articles, readers can understand, when
reviewing Deng's entire life, that "a devastated Chinese history
filled with war and colonial humiliation has come to an end, and a
peaceful, developing and modern era has arrived."
</P>
<P>
Some papers said that the common wish shared by the people on
the both sides of the Taiwan Straits is that China should become
stronger and more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland is
another of Deng's contributions that cannot be ignored by history,
and the event is an outcome of the creative idea of "One Country,
Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Some editorials mentioned the principle of "Peaceful
reunification" proposed by Deng, hoping that people on the both
sides of the Taiwan Straits will realize China's time-honored
dream and come together.
</P>
<P>
Well-known figures from academic and economic spheres have also
expressed their condolences, and discussed the impact of Deng's
death on the cross-straits relations. Some of them believed that
as long as the motherland's economy continues to develop, Taiwan
businessmen will feel at ease.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Says Great Efforts Needed to Qualify for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today said great efforts would be required for Germany and other
European Union members to meet the strict criteria for joining the
planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to German industrialists in Bonn, Kohl
said "The Maastricht Treaty stability criteria are not
negotiable... They must be adhered to."
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted that meeting those strict criteria would
require "considerable efforts".
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty requirements, an EU member state
wanting to join the Euro must bring its budget deficit to less
than three percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and total
national debt to less than 60 percent of GDP.
</P>

experts as saying on Wednesday that Germany's budget deficit would
soar to 3.5 percent of GDP in 1997 due to exploding costs to fund
jobless benefits.

<HEADLINE> Troops to Station In Hong Kong Mourn Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong have been mourning the death of former
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, vowing to carry forth Deng's ideal
of "One country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, officers and soldiers have been greatly
saddened by Deng's death, but intend to channel their grief into
work by ensuring the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Articles written by army men have been posted on blackboards
and billboards, and signs telling of Deng's death are up in army
camps.
</P>
<P>
No training programs have been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
"At the news of Deng's death, our soldiers pledged in writing
to show their determination to accomplish more in their
training. Nobody is willing to leave the training ground," said Xu
Jitao, a company commander.
</P>
<P>
At the troop's logistics base, officers and soldiers said that
they are focusing more on their work. "We wish we could finish two
days' work in one day, which will ready the troops to be stationed
in Hong Kong smoothly," one officer said.
</P>
<P>
They have also reviewed Deng's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, particularly his ideas on the
question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to mourn Deng is to work harder, and ensure Hong
Kong returns to the motherland smoothly," commander Liu Zhenwu
said.
</P>
<P>
Deng had hoped to visit Hong Kong by riding in a wheelchair.
"Unfortunately, he left us too early. But we can still take
comfort by maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability," said political commissar Xiong Ziren.

<HEADLINE> Deng's Hometown In Mourning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- When the news of Deng
Xiaoping's death reached Guangan County, hometown of the legendary
revolutionary in Sichuan Province, residents were deeply sorrowful.
</P>
<P>
People lined up in shops to buy pictures of Deng, as well as
black armbands and white paper, traditional symbols representing
grief for the dead.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Daiying, a retired teacher, cried when she learned the
news. She and her grandson tied flowers made of white paper onto

</P>
<P>
"It was Deng Xiaoping who made us become rich," she said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bozhong, secretary of the county's Party committee, with

</P>
<P>
Teachers and students in the No. 1 High School, where Deng had
studied, left their breakfast and held a meeting to mourn
Deng. Headmaster Jiang Baosen told them, "We must make Deng's Alma

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cotton Output Set to Fall This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Seed cotton production in
Zimbabwe this season is expected to decline to about 270,000 tons
from last year's output of 283,000 tons mainly due to incessant
rains which fell during the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Commercial Cotton Growers Association chief executive Doug
Pascoe said here today the worst affected had been the communal
farmers, particularly those in northern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''This year there were indications that the crop was going to
increase because of high seed sales. But there has been some
effect on the crop by the rains, particularly the late planted
crop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''We have had reports of water-logging and we are now
estimating production will be less than that produced last
season, and our estimate is of a crop of between 260,000 tons and
270,000 tons from an original forecast of 300,000 tons,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Hopes Chirac Visit Will Boost It's NATO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Romania holds a lavish
reception for French President Jacques Chirac on his arrival for a
two-day visit, hoping he might help bring Bucharest into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was received at the airport here by his Romanian
counterpart, Emil Constantinescu, and a 21-gun salute as the soil
welcomed the first major Western leader in six years.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, an advocate of Romania's bid to be admitted in NATO's
first batch of expansion, was eagerly awaited here as NATO is
scheduled to announce who will be invited to join in July.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that France provides our most solid support among
NATO member states is already well known," Constantinescu said in
a local radio interview today before Chirac's arrival.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is the first to visit since 1991, when his predecessor,
the late Francois Mitterrand, was also warmly welcomed. France has
strong and traditional links with Romania, one of the few
countries in eastern Europe where French is widely spoken.
</P>
<P>
Romania has hoped Chirac can persuade Washington into backing
its admission bid, saying its position on the Black Sea and
proximity to former East Bloc republics make its inclusion
strategically important.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on a European tour this week said Romania's prospects
were still not very good. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
are believed to be the leading candidates in the bid drive.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said Constantinescu's pledges to speed up
market reforms may have improved Romania's chances.
</P>
<P>
And Russian President Boris Yeltsin made no objections to
Romanian membership during his talks with Chirac in Moscow earlier
this month, said the French president on the eve of his Bucharest
visit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Russians, though always opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion, know they cannot stop the Western military
alliance from taking in their former allies.
</P>
<P>
NATO, for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed during
the Cold War to confront the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.

<HEADLINE> China Worked out 22 Laws in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee, China's top legislative
body, reviewed 31 draft laws in 1996, and approved 22 measures
during the year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates that the legislature has been speeding up
its lawmaking process," said an official with the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of its term of office in 1993, the Eighth NPC
has placed legislation as its highest priority in its five-year
work agenda, in order to facilitate the establishment of the
socialist market economic structure in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the Eighth NPC and its standing
Committee have formulated 94 laws and decisions in the past four
years, accounting for nearly one third of the laws promulgated in
the past 18 years of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
To date, major laws concerning the establishment and operation
of the market economic structure, such as the corporate law, the
labor law, and the law against unethical competition, have been
made, as well as the lawyers law, the people's police law, the
prison law, the judges law and the procurators law, which are
indispensable to the country's construction of a solid legal
system.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the revised version of the criminal procedural
law, adopted in March last year and effective on January 1 this
year, has been considered a milestone in the building of the
country's sound legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth NPC has been the first to map out the list of laws
to be made, and it is expected that this plan can be carried out,
the official with the NPC Standing Committee said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the agenda, there are still nearly 30
laws and decisions yet to be made in the last year of the term
office, and the legislature still faces a heavy task, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the laws that need to be drafted are more
complicated, or still controversial, such as the law on
supervision, the securities law, a unified contract law and the
law on state planning, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official pledged that in spite of these difficulties, the
NPC and its Standing Committee will move forward in its last year
in office to reach the goals already set, and will ensure the high
quality of the laws.
</P>
<P>
A major revision to the criminal code, which is to be discussed
at the upcoming session of the NPC for approval, will be another
historic step in the country's legal system progress, observers
maintained.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Continue to Mourn Deng Xiaoping (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- At the time of China's
traditional Lantern Festival -- a day marked by family reunions --
people throughout China are in mourning for former leader Deng
Xiaoping who died Wednesday in Beijing at age 93.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers in three major power machinery factories
in the northeast city of Harbin recalled Deng's visit there in
1958, and his conversations with them and their factory leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Today is the Lantern Festival when we would have to take a day
off. But all of us have decided to continue work in remembering
Deng," said Ji Enlin, a worker.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, home of a dense population of state-run
enterprises, workers vowed to perpetuate the spirit of hard work
which Deng advocated, and to turn out more products as symbolic
gifts for the late leader.
</P>
<P>
Workers in the No. 1 Tractor Machinery Factory remembered Deng's
visit to the plant in 1964, where he discussed technical
renovations with the staff.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the policy of reform and opening up initiated by
him, the factory's situation now is quite good," said general
manager Fang Gang, adding that the workers will certainly unite
around the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at its core.
</P>
<P>
The news of Deng's death has spread quickly throughout rural
areas, and saddened farmers who have benefited from his reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 cadres and farmers gathered in front of the Xibaipo
village government building in Shanxi Province when they learned
Deng had died.
</P>
<P>
"It is Deng's policy that has changed the poor village's
outlook. Last year the per capita income in the village was 1,200
yuan, several hundreds times that of 20 years ago," said Yan
Sanshan, secretary of the village Party committee, adding that
every household has new housing and enough food.
</P>
<P>
Yan Chaoshu, a private driver, said that she liked Deng's
policy of allowing people to become rich, and "since I have
already become rich, I will help other people to get rich as well."
</P>
<P>
In Shexian County, Hebei Province, an old revolutionary base where
Deng had fought for six years, people talked about his donation of
12,000 yuan to aid 38 children whose parents were killed by floods
last year.
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, Deng led us to take part in the liberation
movement. In the modern days, he brought us the policy to
encourage people to get rich. We have got out of poverty, and our
lives are becoming better and better," said Zhang Qiulan, 67,
crying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Legally Binding NATO Document, Primakov Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
give legal binding power to a proposed document on NATO-Russian
relations, said Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov today.
</P>
<P>
Russia still opposes the NATO's oft-stated eastward expansion,
Primakov told a press conference after his second meeting with
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Russia will do everything it can to minimize the negative
consequences of NATO's expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov proposed that NATO, a traditionally
U.S.-dominated Western military alliance, be converted into a
political body mainly for peacekeeping purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said his country will not
interfere in NATO's internal affairs and will not seek
participation in its decision making process on collective defense.
</P>
<P>
In her remarks at the press conference, Albright said she and
Primakov had made "substantial progress" during their talks, but
some complicated issues were still there.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that NATO will safeguard the European security
together with Russia instead of continuing the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. state secretary, who arrived here Thursday for a
two-day visit, vowed that NATO has no plan to deploy nuclear
weapons in Central and Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leader Elected Mayor of Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zoran Djindjic, the President
of the opposition Democratic Party, was elected mayor of Belgrade
at Friday's constituent session of the Belgrade assembly, held in
keeping with a special law adopted by the Serbian assembly.
</P>
<P>
Djindjic was elected by a secret ballot as the only joint
candidate of the opposition coalition Zajedno, which has a
majority of 68 in the city assembly. Zajedno coalition is
comprised of the Democratic Party, the Serbian Renewal Movement
and the Civic alliance of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno has won local elections in 14 major cities in
Serbia. Until this week, the Zajedno had organized massive rallies
and demonstrations in Belgrade and other Serbian cities over the
past 12 weeks to demand the recognition of their victories. A
special law passed 10 days ago by the Serbian parliament
reinstated Zajedno's victory and stopped the opposition's daily
street protest.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, the Serbian Radical Party, another non-allied
opposition party, strongly criticized Djindjic's political
activities, charging him, among other things, of insincerity and
links with the German state security service, Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Zarko Seslija from the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)
also urged that several candidates run for the mayor's office, but
his proposal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
The vote for the mayor was proceeded by a unanimous election of
a verification committee which verified the mandates of all 110
Belgrade assembly deputies, which including 67 from the Zajedno
coalition, 24 from SPS and the Yugoslav Left, and the rest from
other two small parties.

<HEADLINE> Osman Atto Slams Italian Envoy's Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Somali faction led by
Osman Hassan Ali Atto today slammed Italian Special Envoy
Giuseppe Cassini's mediation in Somalia, saying he knows nothing
about the underlying facts of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast statement, radio South Mogadishu supporting
Osman Atto urged the Italian government to stop Cassini's
activities in Somalia, and nominate another envoy to take his
place so that the peace initiatives can go on.
</P>
<P>
Cassini is the man who managed to bring together the opposing
factions of Mogadishu together -- Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed and
Hussein Mohamed Aidid -- for the first time in Somalia at Ramadan
hotel on January 20.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by Osman Atto did not participate in the
meeting which had discussed the affairs of the war-torn capital,
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Cassini left Mogadishu last week after spending a week in the
Somali capital where he met Ali Mahdi and several other community
leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known why Osman Atto condemned Cassini today.
Cassini met representatives of Osman Atto in North Mogadishu
during his visit in the capital, briefing them on why Atto's
faction was excluded in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Some sources disclose that Cassini had tried to meet Osman
Atto's men in the war-revaged Bosnia vicinity, Southwest of the
capital, but Ali Mahdi had advised him not to do so.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi only two days ago accused Hussein Aidid of
undermining the peace initiatives launched by the Italian diplomat
by excluding Atto in the talks, and commended him for trying to
find a solution to the conflicts in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Consultative Body Mourns Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A seminar was held here today
to recall late leader Deng Xiaoping's contributions to the United
Front work and the people's political consultative achievements.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held by the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that the principle of free thinking and
seeking truth from facts is the essence of Deng's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who died Wednesday in Beijing at age 93, was the chairman
of the National Committee of the CPPCC after Mao Zedong and Zhou
Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Deng had always placed great importance on the work of the
United Front and the people's political consultative body. Under
his five-year-leadership, the CPPCC experienced remarkable
development, participants said.
</P>
<P>
It was at Deng's suggestion that many mishandled cases
occurring during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) were redressed,
they recalled.
</P>
<P>
Deng had stressed that the CPPCC should be guided by patriotism
and socialism, and that it should realize the unification of the
entire Chinese nation and build a socialist democracy, they said.
</P>
<P>
All of Deng's remarks should be studied thoroughly and regarded
as invaluable for the CPPCC's work, they added.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Nagwang Jigme, vice-chairman of the CPPCC, recalled
Deng's contributions to the peaceful liberation and development of
Tibet. The "Ten-point Policy" that served as the guideline for the
peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951 was put forward by the
Party's southwest bureau, which was headed by Deng.
</P>
<P>
The participants also mentioned Deng's instructions on the
development of science and education.

Bosnia-Herzegovina led 2-0 at half-time.

<P>
In face of the strong Vietnam defence, Bosnia scored its first
goal by Dzelaludin in the 29th minute through employing high and
long passes to confuse their opponent.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia grew in confidence from there on and started to pump
the ball from the centre into the penalty box, leaving their
strikers to do the rest.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia earned the first penalty when Turkovic Almir was
charged by Vietnam goalkeeper Tran Minh Quang in a one-to-one
situation. Malaysian referee Nik Ahmad Yaakob pointed for the
penalty and also flashed the yellow card to the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Pintul Sanin converted the penalty in the 44th minute for a
2-0 lead in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The match turned into a dramatic affair in the second half
when the Vietnamese goalkeeper and defender Nguyen Hu Thang were
given the marching orders for infringement.
</P>
<P>
Tran Minh Quang was the first to be given the red card in the
tournament which opened here last night when he charged Bosnian
striker Muharemovic Dzelaludin in the 52nd minute and Nguyen Hu
Thang in the 66th minute for clearing the ball with his hands.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia converted another penalty in the 67th minute through
Smjecanindzemo after Nguyen Hu Thang handed the ball.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Links Infections to Allergy, Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Johns Hopkins scientists
have found the first hard evidence that viral infections can help
cause asthma and allergies, a connection long suspected but never
directly confirmed in the lab.
</P>
<P>
Researchers showed that weak viral infections can cause immune
system B cells to produce immunoglobin E or IgE, a protein that
orchestrates the reactions that cause allergies and many cases of
asthma, according to the medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests we might one day be able to reduce the incidence
of allergy and asthma by vaccinating children against mild
childhood viral diseases that traditionally haven't received much
attention," said Dr. Farhad Imani, chief scientist of the research
team.
</P>
<P>
In test tube studies, scientists exposed human B cells, which
recognize and attack a particular type of intruder, to rhino and
vaccinia viruses. B cells normally attack germs with IgM or IgG.
Imani found that after viral infections, many of the cells
switched to making IgE.
</P>
<P>
"If you have a group of B cells that is producing IgE, you're
going to be allergic to whatever that group of B cells is
sensitive to," Imani explains.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that stronger viruses of causing
serious disease were less likely to trigger the switch to IgE than
weaker viruses rapidly defeated by the immune system.
</P>
<P>
Imani and his team plans further studies both to determine
which viruses will switch on IgE and to flesh out the link between
the activation of anti-viral protein kinase and the start of IgE
production, according to the Hopkins Medical Institutions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pakistan to Tighten Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today urged the new Pakistan government headed
by Nawaz Sharif to tighten security in the wake of killing of an
Iranian diplomat in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told a press conference that the Iranian government
has followed the case in a very serious way and examined it both
from "political and legal" perspectives.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday noon in Multan Punjab province of Pakistan, four
terrorists forced their way into Iran's Cultural Center there and
opened fire on the staff, killing director of the center Mohammad
Ali Rahimi and six local employees.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Iran has lodged a
protest with Pakistan over the incident, demanding for serious
and basic examination of the case.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the new government headed by Sharif is
determined to confront such breaches of the law inside the
Pakistani society."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the incident was not a good sign of security
inside the Pakistani society.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that security problems do not pertain to any
special group in Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We hope that the new government would be able
to overcome such problems in the Pakistani society in view of
its mandate in the recent Pakistani elections and its powerful
presence in the Parliament."
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of unrest in the Pakistani society is by
no means welcomed by us. On the contrary we like to see
Pakistan is able to advance its development and construction as
an important Islamic country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the relations between Iran and
Pakistan would gain importance and strength day by day.
</P>
<P>
On a question of possible U.S. and Saudi Arabia being
behind of the incident, Velayati said: "It is not very remote
that there are hidden hands from abroad being behind such
affairs, which are neither in the interest of the people of
Pakistan nor in the interest of Iran, and not even in the
interest of the Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
English daily Tehran Times today issued an editorial on
the incident. It said that it is for the second time that
an Iranian cultural attache falls martyr to the bullets of
terrorists in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, extremist groups, receiving spiritual and
material supports from certain regional and foreign countries,
have assumed the responsibility for the heinous acts," said
the daily.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the Pakistani officials should arrest and
bring the culprits to justice as soon as possible for the
sake of bilateral ties as well as their own security and
national interests.
</P>
<P>
"In fact it is the duty of Pakistan to ensure the
security of foreign diplomats in that country," it said,
"unfortunately, over the past few years, sectarian riots have
become a dirty feature of Pakistani political landscape."
</P>
<P>
This very dirty game, it noted, backed by those determined
to tarnish Iran-Pakistan relations, has gained extra-territorial
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
"Because Iran-Pakistan friendly relations are not in the U.S.
interests, Washington clutches at every straw to undermine the
relations of the two brotherly nations," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It further reiterated that Pakistani officials should be very
watchful not to allow the U.S. to interfere with the domestic
affairs of their country, for creating instability in the region is
the U.S. prime objective.
</P>
<P>
A report from Islamabad said that the Pakistani police Friday
night rounded up three people on charge of terrorist attack on the
Iranian Cultural Center in Multan.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Albright, visiting Moscow, tried to
assure President Yeltsin and the Russian people that NATO was "no
longer a situation of you versus us." But she seemed to make
little headway in easing Russian anxiety about the expansion of
the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
-- The Agriculture Department said a new machine for deboning
beef contaminated ground beef with bits of bone and spinal cord.
That could be a health issue because spinal cord tissue has been
implicated in mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr reversed course
and said he will not leave his post after all until the
investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of unemployed adults will begin losing
food stamps Saturday, the result of one the most controversial
provisions of the nation's new welfare law. By the end of the
year, an estimated 1 million people will have been affected by the
the measure.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Intensified Efforts in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned against complacency in
the peace process in Liberia although positive developments have
been made in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"While acknowledging the considerable progress that has been
made, we must now intensify, rather than relax our efforts," the
U.N. chief told the second ministerial meeting of the special
conference on Liberia in New York.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was jointly organized by Nigeria, United
States and the Netherlands, hosted by the U.N. on Thursday,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Positive developments were seen particularly in the areas of
disarmament and revitalization of the civil society in the past
three months, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, pressure must be maintained on the parties, as well
as all others involved in the process, he said, adding: "The
momentum must be sustained. That is why this meeting is both
timely and necessary."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the key challenges to the restoration of
lasting peace in Liberia are the political will to do what needs
to be done, the courage to cooperate in order to get the job
done, and the need to provide the necessary resources.
</P>
<P>
"How all of us respond to these challenges will determine the
chances of success in Liberia," Annan said, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general called for the provision of
additional resources to ECOMOG, the peacekeeping force dispatched
by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Additional resources should also be provided to the
re-integration of demobilized fighters into the society and
reactivation of basic institutions of government and the society.
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Ikimi, the Nigerian foreign affairs minister
who was at the meeting, it is important for ECOWAS to harmonize
its position with that of the U.N. and other agencies involved in
the peace process in Liberia, and to seek material and logistic
support.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi delivered a special message from General Sani Abacha,
Nigeria's head of state and chairman of ECOWAS, during a meeting
with Annan. But he did not give specific details of the message.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Annan as "very successful", Ikimi
said that they also discussed "a variety of issues that affect
our sub-region, particularly our country."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia has met recently and
confirmed that general elections will be carried out in
war-ravaged Liberia in May as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
An electoral framework has also been produced during the
meeting, taking into consideration the U.N. recommendations on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
However, as Annan put it, some of the issues are yet to be
resolved. They include decisions on whether elections will be
conducted only in safe havens or countryside, how the
"coordination" between the U.N. and ECOWAS will be implemented,
the contributions to be made by the European Union and others,
as well as the type and degree of assistance that will be needed
by the Liberian electoral authorities.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recently helped airlift some 1,200
additional troops to Liberia from certain West African countries
to reinforce the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, which has been asking for
more troops to expand peacekeeping operations.

reducing ground water recharge and stream base flow.
</P>
<P>
In addition, poor cultivation, deforestation and overgrazing
have had similar effects.
</P>
<P>
More and more African countries have now come to realize the
importance of water to people's living and social and economic
developments. They are now building dams and reservoirs,
channeling water into the fields and digging water wells to fully
utilize its water resources.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they have already undertaken national
environmental action plans which highlight the importance of
water in environmental management.
</P>
<P>
Water resource assessments and the reform of water policies
and institutions have been undertaken in many countries. National
programs for water supply and sanitation are being developed and
implemented across the region incorporating new ideas that focus
on participation and private sector involvement.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, African countries are coordinating and
cooperating on joint protection of water resources shared by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 international drainage basins in
Africa. It is significance to strengthen cooperation and
management of water resources among african countries.
</P>
<P>
The study ''African Water Resources: Challenges and
Opportunities for Sustainable Management'' identifies five
development imperatives: household water security, catchment area
and wetland protection, food security, water quality and human
health, an intra-national and international conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
It needs huge investments to rationally develop and protect
water resources in Africa. The World Bank assesses that 4.7
billion U.S. Dollars will be needed to provide clean water and
sanitation services to all households in SSA over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
And, if African countries add another 6 million hectares of
land to irrigation over the next 10-15 years, the capital costs
will amount to nearly 30 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The African water resources construction plan receives support
from the U.N. organization and the international community. ''The
U.S. System-wide Special Initiative on Africa'' published last
March puts the stress on water resources plan in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It will mobilize approximately 2.5 billion Dollars in external
resources and 4.5 billion Dollars in internal resources over the
next decade to expand water and sanitation services in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It plans to spend 700 million Dollars a year to enable at
least 80 percent of African population to share safe water in the
next decade or earlier.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Water-scarcity Hinders African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- About two-thirds of
sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) rural population and one-quarter of
the urban population are without safe drinking water, and even
higher numbers of people lack adequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
It means that out of a total of 600 million people in SSA,
273.5 million of the rural population and 45.6 million of the
urban population are without safe drinking water, a research
study published here say.
</P>
<P>
In connection of recurrent droughts and crops failures in some
areas of the African continent, the decline in rate of food
security and the increase of food-deficit population, as well as
water-borne and water related diseases kill millions of lives
every year.
</P>
<P>
All these facts indicate that water-scarcity has become one of
obstacles to African development.
</P>
<P>
Africa has numerous famous rivers and lakes and its rich water
resources are African people's treasures. According to statistics
available, Africa's hydro-power potential is one-fifth of the
world's.
</P>
<P>
Famous longer rivers on the continent, such as the Nile, the
Congo, the Niger, the Zambezi and the Senegal, are not only the
cradle of ancient African civilization, but also African
resources for development.
</P>
<P>
However, rainfall and distribution of water resources in
different areas of the continent are extremely uneven.
</P>
<P>
The huge Sahara Desert keeps on marching south and frequent
droughts in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa have proved
that these areas are facing a threat of water-scarcity.
</P>
<P>
The situation will be more serious and the areas of
water-scarcity will certainly rise with the increase of
population and the development of industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to experts' assessment, the number of water-scarcity
countries will rise to 12 at the end of the century, and 22
African countries will become water-scarcity by 2025.
</P>
<P>
It means that two-thirds of the Africans will face a serious
threat of water-scarcity at that time. They include north African
countries, most east African nations and some southern African
countries and five west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Water-scarcity in Africa, as expected, is related to the
distribution of rainfall and variations of weather. But it is
also related to the shortage of water conservancy facilities in
Africa and backwardness of development, utilization and
management of water resources in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, which is called ''a water tower of Africa'', for
example, villagers in some mountainous areas usually go over 10
kilometers to fetch water because there is no water facilities in
or near their villages.
</P>
<P>
The country has now utilized less than two percent of its rich
hydro-power potential, and only 5 percent out of an estimated 3.5
million hectares of land suitable for irrigated agriculture has
so far been utilized for irrigation development.
</P>
<P>
In Addis Ababa, the water supply now only meets 60 percent of
the city's potable water needs due to limited capacity of
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Water Resources, the nation now
utilizes less than five billion cubic meters out of a total of
110 billion cubic meters of water resources it has at its
disposal. But the government has allocated about 91.9 million
U.S. Dollars this year to tap the country's water resources.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that the defense cooperation
between Iran and India was not on the agenda of bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a question at a joint press conference with
visiting Indian Foreign Minister G.M. Gujral.
</P>
<P>
He said "We are more or less self-sufficient in terms of
military equipment and that is why no talks were held with my
Indian counterpart regarding defense issues and the purchase of
armaments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Iran has already bought three Russian-made
submarines.
</P>
<P>
However, some specialists and diplomats said earlier that Iran
has tremendous interest in Indian-made war ships, especially
aircraft carrier. But Iran's weak financial capability hinder
itself from the purchase.
</P>
<P>
Gujral has said that nuclear cooperation with Iran is not on
the agenda during his visit to Tehran in the India-Iran joint
commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about U.S. sanction on Iran, Gujral said at the press
conference, "India is opposed to the imposition of unilateral
sanction on any country," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "India also believes no country should interfere in the
internal affairs of another sovereign country."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Mourn Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- People in Shanghai have been
mourning the death this week of China's former senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, who had spent seven Spring Festivals with them.
</P>
<P>
Deng died Wednesday in Beijing of complications of lung
infections from the advanced stage of Parkinson's Disease. He was
93.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1994, Deng came to the east coast city, China's
largest, during every Chinese Lunar New Year holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, secretary of Shanghai CPC committee, tearfully
recalled Deng's last trip here, saying that though Deng is gone,
Party members and Shanghai's 13 million people will surely
observe his will to realize the modernization goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Deng told him that he must "catch the tail
of the 20th century," and seize every opportunity for the city to
modernize itself.
</P>
<P>
Other Shanghai leaders recalled Deng's 1988 visit. Accompanied
by Jiang Zemin, then mayor of Shanghai, Deng extended New Year's
greetings to Shanghai residents and shook hands with artists.
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmin, a general manager, still remembered Deng's
instructions in 1992 when Deng told him that practice is the
sole criterion for testing truth and encouraged Shanghai people to
introduce more foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Xiaoping's statements have greatly inspired us. Over
the past five years, our development zone has attracted a total of
1.6 billion US dollars," he said
</P>
<P>
When news of Deng's death reached an electronics company he had
inspected, employees recalled his remarks. The leader said that
when capitalist products and technology are used in socialist
countries, they take on socialist characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shunlong, Party secretary of Maqiao Town where Deng
visited five years ago, said that Deng was very happy that day
because he saw that farmers' lives had improved.
</P>
<P>
"When I told him that all this was a result of his good policy
of reform and opening up, the old man smiled from the bottom of
his heart," Wang recalled.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Party committee as well as many government
departments have held memorial services for the legendary figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Various mourning activities
in memory of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping continued today
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two and a half days more than 20,000 people from
various circles have offered condolences to Deng at the mourning
hall inside the office building of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch.
</P>
<P>
Long queues of mourners appeared early this morning outside the
Xinhua building, due to which Xinhua advanced the opening time
half an hour to 9:00 am.
</P>
<P>
Wearing white flowers and black armbands, the mourners moved
slowly into the mourning hall and bowed to a large portrait of
Deng to pay their respects to the deceased. They included
business people, Buddhists, students from colleges, middle schools
and primary schools, teachers, workers, tourists from the
Chinese inland areas, and foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged woman respectfully put three cups of wine in
front of the portrait to commemorate the great man in traditional
Chinese way; an old man with walking sticks moved into the
mourning hall with the help of others. He kneeled down in front of
the portrait and choked with tears.
</P>
<P>
A professor from the Chinese University of Hong Kong brought
his three children with him to offer condolences to Deng. "Deng
Xiaoping is a great leader of the Chinese nation, his contribution
has benefited every Chinese. I brought my children here so that
they can have a chance to commemorate this great man and when they
grow up, they can make more contribution to the country," he said
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
Local media continued to report on various mourning activities
on the mainland, in Hong Kong and overseas. Newspapers carried
long and intensive articles on the life and deeds of Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China Group, Guangdong Enterprises Group and some
other organizations also set up mourning halls for their staff to
mourn Deng. Some middle schools used morning meetings to introduce
Deng's glorious life and great deeds to students.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Oil Minister Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of
Oil Gholam Reza Aqazadeh arrived in Kuwait today for a
two-day official visit aimed at boosting bilateral cooperation
in the field of oil.
</P>
<P>
He said upon arrival that Iran and Kuwait were two important
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and prospects of cooperation between them were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
He said he was carrying proposals for the Kuwaiti side on
cooperation between the two countries in the field of oil
and that the visit would lay the foundation for an expanded
exchange of information on oil.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran are two major oil producing countries in
the world. Kuwait has a proven oil reserve of about 80
billion barrels and its current crude production is 2 million
barrels per day with a daily oil refining capacity of
700,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Iran produces some 4 million barrels of oil daily from
which it refines about one million barrels. Iran's oil refining
capacity is estimated at 1.24 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh noted that Iran purchased large quantities of
petroleum by-products in the last few years from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran was expected to open within the next few
months a new oil refinery in Hormuz straits with a
production capacity of about 240,000 barrels of oil daily.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa
Mohammed Al-Mazidi were timely ahead of the forthcoming OPEC
meeting to coordinate position, adding that both Kuwait and
Iran were for the price-fixing and for adherence to OPEC
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh, during his stay here, will also convey a verbal
message from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to Kuwaiti
Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He said the question of the delineation of territorial
waters between the two countries would also be probed in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Iran recently said that it wants to boost cooperation in
various fields with Arab Gulf countries. There was a firm desire
to consolidate relations between the two Gulf countries, Aqazadeh
said.

Committee for Deng Xiaoping, that came on February 20 through the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Mr. Deng Xiaoping contributed his whole life
without qualms to the well-being of China and its people. A great
statesman and a man of wisdom and foresight, Mr. Deng brought the
most remarkable economic success in the world to China.
</P>
<P>
"China today enjoys social stability, substantially improved
livelihood, and a rising international status. The new generation
of leaders led by General Secretary Jiang Zemin are leading the
country forward at a steady pace. This is what Mr. Deng was
seeking all his life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Deng is most admired and respected by the Hong Kong
community. With unmatched vigor, he developed the innovative
concept of 'one-country, two systems' for Hong Kong to return to
China on 1 July, 1997. He also laid a sound foundation for Hong
Kong's long-term stability and development beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We had been looking forward to Mr. Deng's visit to Hong Kong
after our return to our motherland. To our regrets this wish of
ours can never be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure a smooth transition for Hong Kong, we will need to
work even harder and in greater unity to prepare for the
establishment of the HKSAR Government, so as to translate fully
Mr. Deng 'one-country, two systems' into reality, and to
contribute to the great cause of unifying the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
With great sorrow, Tung said he extended his deepest
condolences to Mr. Deng's family.
</P>
<P>
In her message, Rita Fan said that Deng dedicated his whole
life to the country. The concept of 'one country, two systems',
which he began and which will remain unchanged for 50 years is
far-sighted and will lay a solid foundation for China's resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
be established and the Provisional Legislative Council will do its
utmost to prepare for all work in an orderly way so as to carry
out the policies of "the Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
with a high degree of autonomy and fulfill Mr. Deng's desire to
maintain Hong Kong's stable transition, stability, and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Insurance Service Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The insurance service in vietnam
registered the highest growth rate last year at 20 percent,
netting a total revenue of some 1,300 billion Vietnamese dong
(over 110 million U.S. dollars), local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Operating on Vietnam's insurance market now are five domestic
companies, one joint venture with Britain and Japan, and 31
representative offices of foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Insurance Company leads the insurance business,
commanding some 80 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
In the face of unhealthy competition practices among insurance
companies such as attracting customers through administrative
measures, the Ministry of Finance is planning to enhance control
over the insurance business and to regulate competition by
encouraging new forms of insurance such as occupational insurance,
foreign investment insurance and agricultural insurance.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese President Optimistic About Macao's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio said here today that he still holds an optimistic view on
the future of Macao after the passing away of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a interview with the press that he deeply
believes and is very optimistic that the future of Macao will be a
success because it is the common wish of both China and Portugal
that the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will come into
being under the policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"The idea of 'one country, two systems' is a great creation of
Deng Xiaoping," said Sampaio, who is on a visit to Macao prior to
his state visit to Beijing next week. "It is a policy of vision
and a good way in handling issues left over from history. Let's do
our best to carry it out."
</P>
<P>
The president again expressed his mourning over the passing
away of Deng, praising him as a "great man of the century" and a
"strategist." He paid his last respect to Deng at a mourning hall
here Thursday after Deng passed away Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio stressed confidence in and mutual respect for the
founding of the Macao SAR, adding that the Macao SAR thus
established will be a pride as the success of the "one country,
two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the relationship between the two peoples and
governments of Portugal and China is "excellent" and that
relationship will further grow as leaders of the two countries are
in constant contact and exchange ideas on the implementation of
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio is scheduled to leave here for Beijing Sunday. Some 40
Portuguese entrepreneurs and businessmen will go along with him
during his tour of Beijing and northeast China's Liaoning
Province.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Welcome Appointment of SAR Principal Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Local newspapers these days
gave wide coverage to the appointment of 23 principal officials of
the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), saying the move will benefit the smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa released the list Thursday
shortly after the appointment by the Central People's Government
of the 23 officials he nominated.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said in its commentary Friday that nearly all the
top civil servants in the Hong Kong government will stay on to
serve the HKSAR, and this "guarantees continuity and stability of
the 180,000-strong civil service, and boosts their morale and
confidence."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the local civil service as a major force in
maintaining Hong Kong's stability, the Central People's Government
has all along attached great importance to the smooth transition
of the service and done much work in this aspect, which laid a
good foundation for the smooth transition of the incumbent senior
officials, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in its editorial that the
Chinese government has made every effort for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and long-term prosperity and stability, and the effort
was testified again by the appointment.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the "one country, two systems" principle, the
Chinese government has made no concessions on issues concerning
sovereignty while showing full confidence and respect for Tung
Chee Hwa and his administration in governing the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in Oriental Daily News today said that the list of
Tung's team was released as scheduled in spite of the death of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
This showed that the mourning of the great man didn't affect
the process and arrangement concerning Hong Kong's smooth
transition, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's approval of all the nominees presented by Tung was a
testimony to its promise on 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy," the
paper continued.
</P>
<P>
It also mentioned that members of the team have vowed to do
their utmost for the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Sing Pao Daily News today praised the list as reducing changes
in the transition of the government to the minimum.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran, India and Turkmenistan
singed a trade and transit agreement here today in a bid to boost
trilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, Indian Minister of External Affairs Inder Kumar Gujral
and Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmyradov.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, India will ship its goods and cargoes to
the Central Asian state of Turkmenistan via Iran.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities would open many avenues for Indian goods
to reach central Asian republics and vice versa, beside greatly
benefiting Iran.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that it will cut the transport costs by
at least one-third. Earlier, the goods were being exported
through Russia, which made transportation costs more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the three countries also signed a
memorandum of understanding on the admission of Kazakhstan into
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also looks forward to the
participation of Russia in the network in the near future.
He said that Iran opens its gate to all countries.
</P>
<P>
Gujral also said that the document has built the future of
cooperation not just in trade but also in culture and economy as
well.
</P>
<P>
"We keep talking about the benefits of South-South
cooperation. This agreement is the materialization of one," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tripartite cooperation agreement is not just
limited to the three countries and others can join in as
well. "Within the framework of the agreement, we can use each
other's specialties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Turkmen Foreign Minister Shikhmyuradov said "Turkmenistan is
ready to launch the trilateral cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Taliban Repel Rival Attack Northwest of Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
has repulsed an attack by forces loyal to a rival Shiite Muslim
faction in a strategic valley northwest of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
About 15 rival soldiers were killed and 8 wounded in the
fighting, according to reports of the Taliban-controlled Radio
Shariat in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Forces of the Hezb-e-Wahdat faction of Karim Khalili launched
the attack Friday on the Taliban positions in the Sheikhali area
in the Ghorband valley but was pushed back, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which captured Kabul last September, is
currently locked in a standoff with Khalili's forces in Sheikhali,
about 150 kilometers from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Sheikhali is the gateway to the Hezb-e-Wahdat base in central
Bamyan province.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim faction joins an anti-Taliban alliance with
the forces of former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood and
northern Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The Bamyan province lies to the west of the Ghorband valley
linking Kabul and the anti-Taliban alliance controlled north.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took control of the Ghorband valley, 70 kilometers
northwest of Kabul in late January.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the African and
Middle East countries have sent messages to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to express condolences over Deng Xiaoping's death.
</P>
<P>
In his message, President of Cape Verde Antonio Monteiro said
that Deng Xiaoping "is one of the most outstanding statesmen of
this century, whose passing away is not only an irremediable loss
to the People's Republic of China, but also an irremediable loss
to the whole mankind."
</P>
<P>
President of Comores Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim said in his
message that he was "shocked to hear the sad news of Deng
Xiaoping's death, China's great leader, statesman and
diplomat. Deng has devoted his whole life to building China into a
strong country in the world, and is always a great leader in the
hearts of the people of Comores."
</P>
<P>
In his message, President of Cote d'Ivoire Henri Bedie said,
"Mr. Deng is a creative and dignified statesman. He introduced an
opening-up policy to create an economic miracle in China. We
deeply feel the vacancy after he passed away."
</P>
<P>
President of Gabon Hadj Bongo said, "Deng Xiaoping is an
excellent strategist to lead China's recent economic and political
reforms. The international relations of recent years have also
absorbed his important impact and wisdom."
</P>
<P>
President Didier Ratsiraka of Madagascar said in his message,
"Mr. Deng has made great achievements in developing China's
economy and relations with foreign countries, especially in
strengthening friendship and cooperation with the developing
nations. People who love peace in the world will never forget him."
</P>
<P>
President of Mali Alpha Konare said that the Chinese people as
well as people of the world have lost a great statesman in Deng
Xiaoping's death. The reformer, who led China's opening up and
construction, will live forever. "May Deng's efforts to uphold the
lofty spirit of justice, peace and unification inspire all the
Chinese people and their offsprings to build a great China in a
world of ever growing peace and unity."
</P>
<P>
President of Niger Ibrahim Mainassara said, "We express our
deep respect for Deng Xiaoping, great chief architect of China's
reform. It was he who introduced the opening-up policy, developed
China's economy, raised the Chinese people's living standards and
improved China's relations with foreign countries, especially
those in Africa. His passing away is not only a heavy loss to the
Chinese people, but also a heavy loss to the whole international
community."
</P>
<P>
President of Togo Gnassingbe Eyadema said Deng Xiaoping "is one
of the outstanding figures in the history of the People's Republic
of China, and also one of the greatest statesmen of the
contemporary world. Deng, who was clear-minded, wise, decisive and
full of charisma, has won the respects of all the people as he is
a hero of China's revolution and the first reformer in modernizing
China. Deng is a senior leader who always loved to listen to
people's opinions and paid close attention to the international
changes."
</P>
<P>
President of Tunisia Ben Ali said, "We the Tunisian people
mourn the loss of the Chinese leader with high respects and will
miss his virtues and the achievements he has made for peace and
prosperity in Asia and the world at large. The reform in economy,
politics and society introduced by Deng Xiaoping has entered China
into a prosperous and economically fast developing era. His great
achievements will be valued forever."
</P>
<P>
President of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh said, "The passing away
of Deng Xiaoping, a highly experienced leader, costs me a
friend. Deng, who loved his people and was royal to his country,
took an active part in the international cause of humanism,
justice and peace." He also expressed his hope to further develop
bilateral relations and cooperation between Yemen and China.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Iranian President Akbar Rafsanjani said he was
"upset and sorrowful" at "the sad news about the passing away of
Mr. Deng Xiaoping, the leader and the architect of the reforms in
the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
"He played a great role while he was leader in the

<HEADLINE> Privatisation To Go On in Zanzibar, Says Amour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dar es Salaam, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar will continue to
privatise public enterprises to make them competitive under economic
liberalization, Zanzibari President Salmin Amour has daid.
</P>
<P>
Opeining a Zanzibar Cigarette Factory at Maruhubi, Amour said in
Zanzibar on Friday his government had no resources to help poor
performing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"No way to help sick public industries", noted Amour adding that
privatisation was a solution to increase efficiency and
profitability of the state owned industries.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had invested a lot of money in public
factories but most of them failed to utilise the resource to
stimulate the growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Cigarette Factory was built in 1973 with Chinese
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Amour assured full support to the foreign firm -- INTERBEX of
Switzerland, which has leased the factory for 25 years from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The foreign company has 90 percent shares while the Zanziabari
government has 10 percent shares.
</P>
<P>
According to the factory's General Manager Mohammed Mbaaye, the
factory had also signed an agreement with an international cigarette
company, the Rothmans, to help scout for market abroad.
</P>
<P>
The factory produces three kinds of cigarettes -- Sportsmen,
Challlenge and Baridi.
</P>
<P>
Mbaaye said the factory had a capacity of manufacturing 24,000
cartons of cigarettes worth 1.6 million US dollars per year.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Presidents to Meet in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will go to Damascus today to discuss the latest development of the
Mideast peace process with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which comes prior to Mubarak's meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington next month, is expected
to coordinate the Egyptian and Syrian positions on reviving the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is aimed at unifying Arab stances and getting
acquainted with the Syrian position regarding the peace process to
discuss it with the new American administration," said MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, has been a strong advocate in defending Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Assad last met in November in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam made a lightning visit here last Saturday and
delivered a message to Mubarak from al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, seen as the cornerstone to an overall
Middle East peace, have been stuck over the fate of the strategic
Golan Heights since last March.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists on the full return of the Golan Heights captured
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war for peace as agreed by previous
Labor government, a position rejected by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he could not guarantee to abide by any
verbal pledges by his predecessors about handing over the
strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
Syria has warned the United States, a key sponsor of the
Mideast peace process, not to lose credit in the Arab world by
supporting the Israeli demands.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has asked UNICEF
to co-operate more closely with the Organisation of African Unity on
conflict prevention and resolution as a strategy on child survival.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma
in talks with the Executive Director of UNICEF, Carol Bellamy,
at State House in Dar es Salaam on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the program of child survival and development could
not be achieved in an environment of ethnic conflicts which were
taking root in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also called on concerted efforts to discourage the emerging
tendency of child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He commended UNICEF for its special initative on Africa and
urged the organisation to work out a program of credit scheme for
women, as they were the ones who "bear the brunt of economic crisis".
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, the visiting head of UNICEF, who signed a new five-year
program with the Tanzanian government on Friday, said Africa was a
priority area for UNICEF.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says He Has No Intention to Seek Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that as far as he is concerned, re-election
or an extension of his term through constitutional amendment is
already a closed case.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it very clear that as far as charter changes are
concerned where the president is involved, either in terms of
extension or a second term, I am not interested in that," Ramos
said in an interview with a group of Filipino reporters.
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to the statements made by his
sister, Senator Leticia R. Shahani, and his uncle, Congressman
Simeon Valdez, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shahani was quoted by media as saying that Ramos "is still
studying his options" regarding the proposed amendments to the
charter, under which the president is only allowed to serve a
single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Valdez, on the other hand, reportedly said the stand of the
Ramos administration, or the ruling party Lakas-NUCD (National
Union of Christian Democrats) is "extension (of the president's
term), no elections in 1998."
</P>
<P>
President Ramos stressed that neither Shahani nor Valdez is
authorized to speak on his behalf or for the Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear as I have said to all of you that as far as
charter changes are concerned where the president is involved,
either in terms of extension or a second term, I am not pushing
that," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Senator Shahani, Congressman Simeon Valdez, and some
so-called spokesman of the party said, they do not -- at the
moment -- speak for the party because as chairman, I have not yet
convened them to a caucus on this matter," said Ramos, who will
have to step down in June 1998 under the current Constitution.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin that he was very sorry to hear the
death of Deng Xiaoping, an outstanding political leader and the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Performance Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy
performed better than expected with the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growing 8.2 percent in 1996, the ninth consecutive year of
high growth, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Anwar who is also finance minister, said: "latest figures we
obtained point to economic growth and overall progress that is
very encouraging and reassuring."
</P>
<P>
The figures were better than projections made previously but
"this does not mean that we should be complacent," he said at a
press conference after chairing a National Finance Council meeting
at the Treasury here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government's current account continued to be
high, recording a surplus for four consecutive years after taking
into account the expenditure on development.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we must continue to strengthen the government's
finances by controlling consumption expenditure that is
unimportant, and increase savings so that the country's dependence
on foreign funds, especially loans, for investment can be
reduced."
</P>
<P>
"This will not only reduce the national debt servicing burden
but also curb inflationary pressures," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the trade balance for 1996, Anwar said that based on
interim figures, a surplus of 9.1 billion ringgit (about 3.64
billion U.S. dollars) was recorded in 1996 compared with the
projection of 4.643 billion ringgit (about 1.8572 billion dollars)
made in the 1997 National Budget presentation. In 1995, the
surplus was 233 million ringgit (about 93.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, exports grew 6.4 percent to 191 billion ringgit (about
76.4 billion dollars) while imports grew by 1.5 percent to 181.9
billion ringgit (about 72.76 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Anwar attributed the strong trade balance in 1996 to the robust
GDP and slower consumption expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Good performances of the manufacturing sector with a 12.2
percent growth, service sector 9.4 percent and construction
sector 9.0 percent were main factors for the growth in GDP in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Due to the government's tight fiscal and monetary policies, the
private sector consumption expenditure growth was down to 9.8
percent in 1996 compared with 13.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said investment expenditure increased 11.9 percent (against
23.3 percent in 1995) to 105.3 billion ringgit (about 42.12
billion dollars) with private sector investment expanding 9.7
percent (against 28.9 percent in 1995) to 73.1 billion ringgit
(about 29.24 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Anwar said 89 percent of national investments in 1996 could be
funded from domestic sources compared with 80 percent in 1995 as
the slower growth in consumption expenditure resulted in an
increase in the national savings rate.
</P>
<P>
"This is an inspiring development because we are able to reduce
our dependence on loans for investment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth in consumption expenditure also reduced the
pressure on prices and helped limit inflation to 3.5 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
He said the current account deficit for 1996 shrank to 11
billion ringgit (about 4.4 billion U.S. dollars), or 4.7 percent
of Gross National Product (GNP) from 18.69 billion ringgit (about
7.476 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Central Bank's reserves rose to 70 billion ringgit
(about 28 billion U.S. dollars) to sustain at least 4.4 months of
imports in 1996 compared with reserves of 63.8 billion ringgit
(about 25.52 billion dollars) at the end of 1995 that could fund
4.1 months of imports.

<HEADLINE> Report: Arab's IT Market Amounts to 2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The combined value of the
information technology (IT) markets of all the Arab countries
caters for a similar volume of activity to that handled by the
Israeli market on its own, reported bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was made by the general manager of
Meta Group-Israel, Jimmy Schwartzkopf. The IT market throughout
the Arab world, including North African Arab countries, totaled
around 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996. The Israeli IT market
conducted around 1.9 billion dollars of business in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, with a population of 17 million, accounted for
the lion's share of IT activity in the Arab world in 1996, with
650 million dollars, followed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
with about 500 million dollars, which, in view of its relatively
small population of 2.5 million, constitutes the most advanced
Arab state in terms of IT usage.
</P>
<P>
Third in this field is Egypt, with around 450 million dollars
but with a population of close to 58 million people.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzkopf said that 320,000 personal computers were sold in
Arab countries in 1996 -- 100,000 in Saudi Arabia, 60,000 in
Egypt and 40,000 in the UAE. He added that the Israeli IT market
is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10 percent, but the
Arab countries experience a faster growth rate in this
sector.

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Sector Urged to Use Opportunities to Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XISHUANGBANNA (Yunnan), February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen called on employees
in China's tourism industry to seize market opportunities and look
for greater development in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also responsible for the country's tourism, made
the remarks during an on-going meeting on tourism in
Xishuangbanna, in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made a special visit yesterday for the
meeting, and noted that tourism made 10 billion U.S. dollars from
overseas tourism services last year, fulfilling former senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's desire in 1978 that China expand its
tourism industry rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Qian urged employees to solve problems in the process of
development and to keep on improving quality in the sector to turn
tourism into a leading sector of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that tourism should not rely only on increasing
numbers of tourists, but should try every means possible to
encourage tourists to stay longer in China to increase tourism
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Qian called for a greater effort at promoting cultural and
ethical progress, improving service quality, and using better
service to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
He also urged employees to work hard to change the practice of
just offering simple sight-seeing services by providing a range of
choices for tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said that employees of the tourism industry were very
saddened at the death of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and called on them
to turn their grief into strength and to continue to work hard for
greater successes in the tourism industry under the leadership of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Jiang
Zemin as the core.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director of the China National Tourism
Administration, attended the meeting, along with leading local
officials.

</P>
<P>
All participants at the meeting said that Deng's incomparable
historical feats will be remembered forever, and that his theory

</P>
<P>
On the main board, turnover almost doubled to 2.149 billion
shares worth 11.168 billion ringgit (about 4.4672 billion U.S.
dollars) from 1.147 billion stocks valued at 5.767 billion ringgit
(about 2.3068 billion dollars).

Second board volume increased to 304.331 million shares worth

Share prices on the KLSE appear set to edge higher next week

</P>
<P>
They said the breach of the 1,280 resistance level would set
the pace for prices to test the crucial resistance of 1,300 points
in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
However, the upward momentum next week is not expected to be a
smooth ride but would involve upswings and downswings in a
consolidation to form a base to chart higher levels, they added.
</P>
<P>
Rotational play on lower liners and nibbling of index-linked
counters are again expected to be the highlights of trading.
</P>
<P>
While continued bullish sentiment would provide the impetus for
further rises, a strong upsurge might be dampened by worry over
redemption by foreign institutions, they said.
</P>
<P>
But a research manager said investors should not be unduly
afraid of significant selling by foreign institutions.

Wednesday, closed the week one sen lower at 303.00 sen (about
121.2 cents) from 304.00 sen (about 121.6 cents) at the previous
week's close. SMR 20 posted a bigger drop of three sen to close at
296.00 sen (about 118.4 cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Foreign inquiries were also noted to have shied away from the
market during the week as most of them shifted interest to other
markets to make cash buys.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rubber market seems headed for further loss of
ground next week with prices expected to move sideways in
range-bound trading.
</P>
<P>
Many dealers hinted if the dull situation did not improve, RSS
One is set to move down to test the 300.00 sen (about 120 U.S.
cents) level and to stay within a 10-point range to 290.00 sen
(about 116 cents) next week.
</P>
<P>
Trading will remain softer in the light of further reluctance
by buyers and sellers to enter the market due to the absence of
fresh leads, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) this week, the metal
prices ended at 14.64 ringgit (about 5.856 U.S. dollars) per kg,
up 23 sen from 14.41 ringgit (about 5.764 dollars) at the previous
week's close.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover increased to a hefty 655 tons from 242
tons for the three trading days the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Buyers were mostly Japanese, Europeans and locals who
re-entered the market after the lunar new year holidays and
Moslem's fast-breaking festival.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM posted a premium of 35 U.S. dollars against the London
Metal Exchange (LME) this week, widening from 20 dollars
previously.
</P>
<P>
Tin prices on the KLTM are expected to continue their firm
trend next week but trading will remain volatile on the uncertain
performance of the LME, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The supply and demand factor, if left unchecked, would have a
direct impact on the movement of prices locally, they said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for local tin would be boosted by the expected
continuation of the stronger trend of the U.S. dollar against the
ringgit this week which would make the metal relatively
"inexpensive" in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Talks on Bhutanese Refugees Called in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali lower house
committee has urged the government to resume high-level talks with
Bhutan on the resolution of the Bhutanese refugee problem in
Nepal, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs and Human rights
Committee at a Friday meeting decided to call for fresh
Nepal-Bhutan ministerial talks on the refugee issue, which arose
seven years ago when tens of thousands of Bhutanese, mostly of
Nepalese origin, flooded into Nepal due to Bhutan's "one nation,
one people" policy.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting said that earlier bilateral talks had
been deadlocked and the categorization of refugees proposed by the
Bhutanese side further hampered the efforts to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The previous seven rounds of bilateral talks at the ministerial
level in the past four years made no progress on the repatriation
of nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees living in eight camps in
eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has maintained that all refugees in Nepal should be
repatriated but Bhutan only agreed to take back those it
considered genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The two countries differ on how to categorize the status of the
refugees as most of them are of Nepalese origin.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali house committee Friday also asked the government to
hold talks with India on ensuring the refugees' right to return
home.
</P>
<P>
The committee expressed its concern over the tensions
occasionally on Nepal-India border as the Indian authorities
obstructed Bhutanese refugees from returning to their home country
through Indian territory after allowing their entry into Nepal via
India.

<HEADLINE> Work on Chittagong Airport Project in Full Swing Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- With the beginning of
improvement on the runway, the main work of the giant Chittagong
International Airport project is expected to start within the next
three months and be completed in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh claimed
that on the completion of the Japanese government-funded project,
the airport of this country's largest port city would become one
of the leading airports in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ahmedul Islam Chowdhury, the acting project director, said that
the overlaying of the 10,000-foot-long runway was continuing
smoothly at the cost of 260 million taka (about 6.5 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The airport project, worth of 5.5 billion taka (about 137.5
million U.S. dollars), was approved by the Bangladeshi government
in last June and accordingly a soft loan agreement of 4.448
billion taka (about 111.2 million U.S. dollars) was signed with
the government of Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to the project plan, the airport would render
services to as many as 520,000 passengers per year by the year
2005 while about 896,000 passengers would pass through the airport
on the completion of the final phase in 2015.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Stronger Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China urged the United
States today to seize the opportunity to bring a stable and
healthy Sino-U.S. relationship into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Li Daoyu, the Chinese ambassador to the
United States, at a symposium marking the 25th anniversary of the
signing of the Sino-U.S. Shanghai Communique.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is time both China and the United States
increase dialogue and enlarge cooperation," Li said, "It is time
both countries meet the challenge of history and work to bring a
stable, healthy Sino-U.S. relationship into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"Of course we still have differences as we did 25 years ago,"
he said, adding that the two countries should work to narrow or
resolve the differences and "at least not let the differences
stand in our way and upset our cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, history has given our two countries a remarkable
opportunity to work closer together," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the symposium, which was sponsored by the
United States-China Policy Foundation, the ambassador stressed
that the issue of Taiwan was the "most important and sensitive" in
the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said: "To properly handle the Taiwan issue holds the key to
a stable Sino-U.S. relationship."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue had remained the core of the Shanghai
Communique, which represented a major breakthrough toward the
normalization and improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, and also of
other two major communiques between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to strictly abide by the principles laid out
in the documents relating to the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Only when these principles are observed,... can we avoid the
interference of the Taiwan issue with China-U.S. relations and
ensure a stable bilateral relationship," Li affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Yu Enguang, the senior vice-president of the Chinese
International Culture Exchange Center, told a symposium here that
the United States and China should strengthen their relations at
the turning point of the century.
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts at the symposium also urged a stable relationship
between the two countries, stressing that they shared common
economic and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Howard Lange, director of the office of Chinese and
Mongolian affairs of the U.S. Department of State, said common
interests between U.S. and China have become "multi-faceted."
</P>
<P>
"For the future, we need to make a continued commitment,
dedication and application of imagination of the same quality
which produced the Shanghai Communique," Lange said.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly differences persist, but we should not let any one
of them to dominate our relationship," he told the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was attended by John Holdridge, former U.S.
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
Arthur Hummel, former U.S. ambassador to China, Chas Freeman,
former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international
security, Richard Soloman, President of the U.S. Peace Institute,
and Doak Barnett, a famous U.S. expert on China.
</P>
<P>
All the figures, who used to play an important role in the
process of normalizing U.S-Chinese relations, recalled the process
leading to the signing of the Shanghai Communique and stressed the
importance of the document.
</P>
<P>
Freeman, who presided over the symposium, noted that the
"historical event" had not only changed the U.S.-Chinese
relations, but also the world.

<HEADLINE> Green Light Given to IFAD Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The 161 members of the United
Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
have finally agreed on its budget for the next three years, after
five years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
IFAD President Fawzi Al-Sultan said agreement was reached
Thursday night, giving IFAD a total of 485 million U.S. dollars,
80 million less than its last triennium.
</P>
<P>
The refinancing meant that the organization would be able to
push ahead with 33 ongoing projects designed to fight hunger and
rural poverty in low-income and food-lacking countries.
</P>
<P>
The budget reduction resulted largely from the decision of the
United States to reduce its contribution from 82.8 million to 30
million U.S dollars. Oil-producing member countries of OPEC also
reduced their contributions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big problem which relates to the general policy of
the United States towards the United Nations," said Al-Sultan.
</P>
<P>
He said a great deal of work needed to be done at the political
level to reverse this trend.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Objects to NATO Expansion: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia today restated its
opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We are still negatively disposed," Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said at a joint news conference with American
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was on a two-day visit
here to try to ease Russia's concerns over the alliance's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting on Thursday, they also failed to overcome
their differences over a charter to create a new relationship
between the former Cold-War foes.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Russia demanded the pact be "legally binding"
for both sides, while Albright only guaranteed personal assurances
by United States President Bill Clinton and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said at the conference that the agreement should be
ratified by the parliaments of all 16 NATO members, as would be
done to any document on NATO expansion, if the alliance enlisted
new members.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the newly sworn-in State Secretary proposed that
the U.S. and Russian groups worked together to finish the document.
</P>
<P>
Trying to persuade Russia that NATO was no longer directed
against Russia, Albright offered reductions in the ceilings of
NATO tanks and other non-nuclear weaponry in Europe, which were
set by a 1990 conventional forces pact.
</P>
<P>
She also proposed forming a NATO-Russian joint brigade for
peacekeeping in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Noting Russia's willingness to do everything to minimize any
complications arising from the enlargement, Primakov said Russia
preferred keeping the NATO military infrastructure away from its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Albright admitted that creating a constructive charter was
obviously complex and would require a lot of hard work, but she
said: "We have established a work plan to try to get as much of
this accomplished and as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
She said the NATO-Russian charter should not be a mechanical
document and should allow for evolution of bilateral relations and
cater to the emerging needs of European security in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not indicate the time limit for the
conclusion of such an agreement between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Moscow was the sixth leg of Albright's round-the-world tour.
She has been to Italy, Britain, Germany, France and Belgium, and
will travel to South Korea, Japan and China.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Moves to Attract More Investment from HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Export Processing
Zones Authority (BEPZA) has taken up elaborate programs to attract
more foreign investments, especially those from Hong Kong, in its
industrial parks, according to a press release of the BEPZA.
</P>
<P>
Moazzem Hossain Khan, executive chairman of the BEPZA, is in
Hong Kong attending a number of seminars and symposia on
investment.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long stay in Hong Kong ending February 25, Khan
will also meet with various prospective investors and brief them
on highly competitive package of financial incentives and other
facilities being offered to investors in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has already set up 19 industries in the export
processing zones of Bangladesh with a proposed investment of more
than 66 million U.S. dollars. Of these, 11 industries are in
Chittagong and the rest in the Dhaka Industrial Zone.
</P>
<P>
HK investments are mainly in the fields of knitted fabrics,
garments, sweaters, bags and sports items, caps, dyed and finished
fabrics, electronics products and cotton yarn.

<HEADLINE> S'pore's Think Tank on China to Close Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of East Asian
Political Economy (IEAPE), Singapore's research center on China,
will close down from March 31, and its work, together with some
existing staff will be taken over by the National University of
Singapore, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the close-down came because the institute
has had a hard time recruiting and keeping overseas scholars, and
attracting Singaporeans to do research on China.
</P>
<P>
The institute will be taken over by the Center for Advanced
Studies (CAS) at the National University of Singapore from April,
subject to Cabinet approval, it said.
</P>
<P>
The IEAPE, first set up as a company in 1983 as the Institute
of East Asian Philosophies, will return its funds, including
endowment moneys of some 65 million Singapore dollars (about 46
million U.S. dollars at current exchange rate), to the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the IEAPE's task of preparing
research materials on China for the Cabinet will continue under
the new set-up.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gungwu, IEAPE chairman, was quoted as saying that the
institute had struggled to draw and retain good scholars from
China in the last four years. "There is no doubt in my mind that
the university is really the ideal place to attract research staff
rather than a company," he said.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) will gain immeasurably from the impending
expansion of its membership but there will be formidable problems,
a seminar held here was told Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The addition of three new countries will make ASEAN more
representative of South-East Asia. This will give it a stronger
voice in international forums where issues affecting the region
are discussed," Robert Teh, a senior officer of the ASEAN
secretariat's Bureau of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) said in a
statement concluding the three-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on trade and investment cooperation in Southeast
Asia was organized by the ASEAN Secretariat and the United Nations
Economic Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam and is expected to admit Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar in the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
Teh said that beyond the political advantages, an expanded
ASEAN would gain considerable leverage in enhancing its global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the seminar said ASEAN would also face significant
challenges from expanded membership and that the most serious
might be a widening gap between the more developed and lesser
developed members.
</P>
<P>
"But we take comfort from the findings of the seminar that the
enhancement of trade and investment cooperation in Southeast Asia
may provide the solution to the problem," Teh said.
</P>
<P>
However, some speakers said there would be no direct impact on
the economies of the existing members because of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by senior government officials from
the seven ASEAN members and Cambodia, Laos as well as
representatives from the Asian Development Bank and the United
Nations Development Program.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China urged the United
States today to seize the opportunity to bring a stable and
healthy Sino-U.S. relationship into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Li Daoyu, the Chinese ambassador to the
United States, at a symposium marking the 25th anniversary of the
signing of the Sino-U.S. Shanghai Communique.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is time both China and the United States
increased dialogue and enlarged cooperation," Li said, "It is time
both countries met the challenge of history and worked to bring a
stable, healthy Sino-U.S. relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we still have differences as we did 25 years ago,"
he said, adding that the two countries should work to narrow or
resolve the differences and "at least not let the differences
stand in our way and upset our cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, history has given our two countries a remarkable
opportunity to work closer together," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the symposium, which was sponsored by the
United States-China Policy Foundation, the ambassador stressed
that the issue of Taiwan was the "most important and sensitive" in
the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said: "To properly handle the Taiwan issue holds the key to
a stable Sino-U.S. relationship."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue had remained the core of the Shanghai
Communique, which represented a major breakthrough toward the
normalization and improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, and also of
other two major communiques between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to strictly abide by the principles laid out
in the documents relating to the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Only when these principles are observed,... can we avoid the
interference of the Taiwan issue with China-U.S. relations and
ensure a stable bilateral relationship," Li affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Yu Enguang, the senior vice-president of the Chinese
International Culture Exchange Center, told a symposium here that
the United States and China should strengthen their relations at
the turning point of the century.
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts at the symposium also urged a stable relationship
between the two countries, stressing that they shared common
economic and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Howard Lange, the director of the office of Chinese and
Mongolian affairs of the U.S. Department of State, said common
interests between U.S. and China had become "multi-faceted."
</P>
<P>
"For the future, we need to make a continued commitment,
dedication and application of imagination of the same quality
which produced the Shanghai Communique," Lange said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Provisional Legislature Meets in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Council
(HKSAR) met here this morning to lay out the administrative
framework for its future operation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting presided over by PLC President Rita
Fan Hsu Lai Tai, signifying that the legislative preparation for
the establishment of the future HKSAR is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the meeting, members of the PLC observed a
three-minute silence to pay tribute to Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping, who passed away in Beijing Wednesday night at the age of
93.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan spoke highly of Deng's contributions to China and the
reunification of Hong Kong to China. She said: "The concept of
'one country, two systems' devised by Deng laid the solid
foundation for the Chinese government's resumption of sovereignty
over Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rita Fan first reported on the interim
arrangements for servicing the PLC and the setting up of working
groups to consider administrative and procedural matters.
</P>
<P>
As an interim arrangement, a small team from the staff of the
British Hong Kong government Legislative Council Secretariat, has
been engaged by contract by the HKSAR Chief Executive to provide
service to the PLC between now and July 1, 1997, she said. The 15
or so staff members, including an assistant secretary general, an
assistant legal advisor and a number of committee, translation,
clerical and secretarial aides will provide administrative support
and service to the PLC until July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The PLC Secretariat will set up an office in Shenzhen, where
meetings of the PLC and its committees and working groups will be
held before July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Two resolutions were passed unanimously to set up two working
groups respectively, one on administrative matters and the other
on rules of procedures, with 12 members each.
</P>
<P>
The PLC meeting then adjourned at around 10:00 a.m., and the
two working groups began close-door sessions concurrently to elect
their conveners, determine terms of reference and operating
procedures and formulate future preliminary work plans.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Matters Working Group is expected to
consider administrative matters, such as staffing arrangements and
domestic arrangement for meetings, while the Rules of Procedure
Working Group is expected to consider rules of procedures for the
PLC.
</P>
<P>
When the groups' sessions are over, the PLC meeting will resume
to endorse resolutions, to be moved respectively by conveners of
the two working groups. The meeting of the provisional legislative
body is expected to conclude at noon.
</P>
<P>
Established in Shenzhen in December 25, 1996, the PLC will
continue to operate until the first Legislative Council of the
HKSAR is elected around June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan said that before June 30, 1997, the PLC would only
make preparations for the legislative work after July 1,
1997. Therefore, it would by no means affect the current
Legislative Council under the British Hong Kong government. The
PLC will hold its formal meetings in Shenzhen, the city bordering
Hong Kong, in the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Romania Defends Its Two-Year Negura Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Athletics
Federation (FRA) Friday defended its decision to impose a two-year
ban on women's cross-country runner Iulia Negura, which prevail
over the four-year suspension of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Negura was banned until December 1998 by the
FRA and stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the
anabolic steriod stanozolol at the 1996 European cross-country
championships in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian national team also lost their silver medal, but
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reinieri insisted the punishment meted out
to Negura should have been harsher.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is we (IAAF) have a rule which is unenforceable in
many countries. We have more and more places where it's impossible
for our rules to be applied. State law prevails," he was quoted by
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
FRA president Iolanda Balas said in Bucharest the FRA had sent
the IAAF a copy of Romanian sports rules adopted last year, which
allow for shorter bans for first doping cases, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Under those rules, a first doping offence is punished with a
two-year ban, with a life ban following in case of a repeat.

<HEADLINE> New Gas-Supply Facilities to Be Finished in Beijing This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A new trans-provincial natural
gas pipeline is expected to supply clean energy to residents of
the Chinese capital by September 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 900-kilometer-long pipeline has been
laid, stretching through north China's Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei
provinces. And construction of the entire group of gas supply
facilities is in full swing in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi-Beijing gas pipeline will greatly benefit the
environment in Beijing and improve local people's lives by
upgrading the city's energy supply, according to a report in
"Beijing Evening News."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of families in Beijing who use
gas will increase to 1.08 million by the year 2000, compared with
some 600,000 at present, thanks to an average annual supply
capacity of 500 million cubic meters of natural gas to Beijing in
the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
"The project will play an important role in alleviating air
pollution in the city, especially the downtown area, which has
been suffering from a shortage of clean energy," a report from the
"China Daily" quoted environment expert Xiang Baiqin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xiang blamed the worsening air pollution in Beijing on the
unreasonable fuel mix, about 70 percent of which is coal.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the content of the suspension compound sulfur
dioxide in the city's air is much higher than the state
standard. During winter, about 5,000 tons of dust falls on the
city every day, due to heavy smoke caused by burning coal, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to a government plan to boost the use of clean gas
across the city, natural gas will be adopted in all
central-heating supply facilities and coal-burning furnaces in
restaurants and other public facilities in major downtown
areas.

PARIS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it will
"do everything possible" to help resume the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks, which broke down one year ago due to differences over the
future of the Golan Heights seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will go to Israel,
Syria and Lebanon on March 4 to 6 to contribute to the resumption

Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
"France is ready to contribute to the resumption of
negotiations, and to the logic of peace," he said, adding that
France attaches great importance to concert with the United States
and its European partners in mediating peace in the Middle East.

France and the United States differed last year over the role
Europe should play in mediating peace talks between Israel and its

"The persistence of grave tension in southern Lebanon, which
brought about lately the death of two Lebanese civilians, has made
it more urgent than ever for us to search conditions which could
allow the resumption of discussions between Israel and Syria, and
between Israel and Lebanon," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France maintains close contacts with Syria and Lebanon, and has
improved lately its relations with Israel with the visit to Paris

<HEADLINE> Portillo Supports US on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo today expressed firm backing to American
proposals on eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Portillo said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's idea
of a NATO-Russia brigade, in which Russians would serve alongside
their former adversaries, was "imaginative" and the British
government had agreed to participate in the planning process.
</P>
<P>
Portillo said it was important for the West to "win the
argument" for enlargement of the NATO alliance and not to be put
off by those arguing that it would upset Russia, according to TV
and BBC reports.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow has successfully influenced opinion formers here to
write about Russian sensitivities and we have to get this into
balance," Portillo said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russian sensitivities had to be respected,
but so did those of eastern and central European countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is not NATO trying to make itself bigger. It is a response
by NATO to the legitimate moral pressure by those countries who
want to be included in international institutions," he added.

NEW YORK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street were
mixed today as blue chips edged higher and technology issues
retreated.
</P>
<P>
Without any economic news to excite the market, stocks were
lower at the start of trading, bounced back by midmorning, then
seesawed again.
</P>
<P>
Heavy profit-taking in the technology sector forced the Nasdaq
down, while blue-chip stocks struggled to post modest gains.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.24 points to 6,931.62.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume was 478.30 million compared with 490.267
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.03 to 801.77

<HEADLINE> US Evacuates Embassy Dependents From Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
evacuating dependents of its embassy staff in Tajikistan because
of what it called the worsening security in the Central Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said today that the move
was prompted by the killing Tuesday of two embassy security guards
by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The guards, locally hired ethnic Russians, were among seven
people -- including five Russians -- gunned down in separate
attacks Tuesday in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Davies said a total of five dependents were being pulled out on
scheduled flights, leaving 12 embassy staff in place.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that thus far only ethnic Russians have been
targeted but in our judgment the situation is such that we should
also bring dependents out, and we're doing that," Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Major European Shares Down on Wall Street's Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
opened sharply lower today but managed to regain some of their
early losses later in the day to close off their lows, though
still in the negative ground.
</P>
<P>
A modest recovery today on Wall Street and firmer index futures
helped leading British stocks to emerge from their day's lows, but
the FTSE 100 index still ended the day down 0.4 percent, or 19.3
points, at 4,336.8, a drop of 4.2 points on the week.
</P>
<P>
The market had earlier fell by 0.8 percent, depressed by the
Dow's sharp decline Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Frankfurt also ended the week lower with
sentiment dampened by the overnight losses on Wall Street and a
weaker bond market, with the DAX-30 index 11.94 points lower at
3,184.09, down 64.09 on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's sharp decline, profit-taking and market
consolidation undermined French shares, with the CAC-40 index
closing down 12.40 points at 2,562.84, 64.58 points weaker than a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 19.3

<P>
PARIS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko arrived in Nice, southern France, this evening after a
three-week stay in his own country, as he again rejected any
negotiation with the rebels today.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Mobutu flew
directly from his hometown of Ghadolite in northern Zaire, and
went to his private residence in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin bordering
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean government rejected this evening any
negotiation with the rebels, saying that the "appeal for
negotiation in the context of the hour... was aimed at above all
transforming the present war of invasion of the country into a
civil war."
</P>
<P>
It also accused the appeal of trying to undermine "the
established institutional order" of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South Africa said today that Zairean government representatives
and rebels began consultations with South African and American
diplomats Thursday in Cape Town over possible face-to-face
meetings between government officials and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government said in a communique that any
possibility for holding talks is excluded before what it called
"withdrawal of all the foreign troops having attacked our
country."
</P>
<P>
It said that the rebel leader, Laurent-Desire Kabila, is only a
puppet of some foreign countries and to hold talks with him is to
"legitimize him and confer to him a status which he actually does
not have."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Officials Mourn Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian officials, foreign
diplomatic missions and the Chinese community in the country
today went to the Chinese Embassy here to express condolence to
late Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohammed Marwa, the Administrator of Lagos State, said
in his condolence message that with Deng's death, China and
indeed the entire world have been robbed of a great, pragmatic,
beloved and respected leader.
</P>
<P>
Deng's courage and vision have led to China's modernization,
making the country a formidable force in the world as it is
today, he said.
</P>
<P>
When expressing his condolence, Lev. A. Parshin, the Russian
Ambassador to Nigeria, noted that it is Deng's great vision of a
strategist of China's reforms and modernization that propels the
country's present might and dynamic economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said the years of Deng's leadership saw further development
and the strengthening of the warm and friendly relations between
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Wood, the Vice-Chairman of Nigeria-China Friendship
Association, said that all the overseas Chinese in Nigeria felt
very sad about Deng's death and will always remember him for all
the prosperity and glories he had earned for China.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce expressed the
"deepest sympathy" to Deng's death in its message of condolence,
saying the chamber "recalls with nostalgia the role of this great
ruler in shaping world history and transforming China into a true
giant."
</P>
<P>
At the liaison office of the Chinese Embassy in Abuja, the
Nigerian capital, Nigerian Minister of Steel and Power Bashir
Dalhatu and some foreign diplomats there also expressed their

<HEADLINE> Fabricated Statement Put 3 in Jail for 18 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Britons jailed 18 years
for murdering paperboy Carl Bridgewater were freed today on bail
pending a full appeal in April.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hickey, his cousin Vincent Hickey and Jimmy Robinson
had protested their innocence since being sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1979 for the murder of Carl Bridegewater.
</P>
<P>
Robinson told a press conference after two hours of legal
representation, "We are not child killers.... For long lonely
years we have cried and been racked with despair. People have
looked at us with hate in their eyes."
</P>
<P>
Their release is the latest in a number of wrongful
imprisonment cases in Britain that date back to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
There was "substantial" and "widespread" police malpractice in
the Bridgewater murder case, the Appeal Court heard in today's
court presentation.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mansfield QC claimed the malpractice involved "a number
of very high-ranking officers" and "a vein of corruption" ran
through the case.
</P>
<P>
New evidence of a fabricated statement was "only a small part
of serious substantial widespread malpractice," he added.
</P>
<P>
The release of the three innocents marks a triumph for those
who tirelessly campaigned for clearing the case.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing their release, a prominent campaigner, Chris
Mullin, MP, said, "This is wonderful news. My only question is:
Why has it taken three visits to the Appeal Court, seven police
investigations and 18 years to reach a conclusion which has been
obvious for a long time?"
</P>
<P>
It was inevitable that mistakes would be made in the criminal
justice system, Home Secretary Michael Howard said on BBC TV's
Question Time.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as an infallible system of human
justice," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- No progress was registered in
the talks between U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) Chief Rolf
Ekeus and the Iraqi side on transferring the missiles engines
destroyed by Iraq to the U.S. for testing, a U.N. official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks also focused on the disclosure of the documents about
Iraqi weaponry programs to the UNSCOM, said Roger Knight, a
special assistant to the director of the Ongoing Monitoring and
Verification (OMV) center in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"There is not any movement on the talks between Mr. Ekeus
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. And it is too
early to say that any key dispute can be solved during
the UNSCOM chief's stay," said Roger.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks were held between Ekeus and the Iraqi side
on Thursday evening and Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation was headed by Tariq Aziz and included
other senior officials such as Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf and Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Another session of the talks between the two sides will be held
this evening, according to the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, the UNSCOM chief in charge of disarming Iraq under the
U.N. resolution 661, arrived here Thursday afternoon on a routine
visit, which is paid once every two months, and will stay here
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The sanctions prevent Iraq
from selling oil until it has destroyed its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
In December, Iraq began selling limited quantities of oil under
a special U.N. program for the purchase of needed food and
medicine.

Only a man of such experience and wisdom could have carried out
fundamental social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
In the book of mourning, Milosevic said: "With the deepest

strengthening of its unity, the quick reunification of its
territories and the progress of the friendly Chinese people."

<HEADLINE> CBI Revises down UK Economic Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) cut its prediction for economic growth Thursday on
worries about the strength of sterling and exports prospects.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic forecast published Thursday, the
employers' organization suggested that the economy will grow by
2.8 percent this year, a reduction of 0.3 points on predictions
made just three months ago, specifically because of the strength
of sterling against leading currencies.
</P>
<P>
It also trimmed next year's forecast by 0.1 percent to 2.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sterling's strength also led to markedly weaker CBI figures on
manufacturing output, where the growth forecast is down from 3.4
percent to 2.5 percent; investment is down from 8.1 percent to 5.4
percent growth, and export growth is down from 4.6 percent to 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI knocked 0.3 points off its inflation
projections to 2.2 percent, as it believed that the slowdown in
the growth rate will provide further relief from any threat of a
rise in interest rates while the strength of sterling will reduce
import prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the downward revisions in the CBI forecasts
are a blow to government hopes of a faster rate of economic growth
in an election year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Venezuelan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
here this afternoon with visiting Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Miguel A. Burelli Rivas, who on behalf of Venezuelan President
Rafael Caldera Rodriguez, the Venezuelan government and people,
expressed his profound sympathies over the death of China's former
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his appreciation, Li said that Deng, an outstanding
leader enjoying great prestige, made legendary contributions to
the development of the Party and the nation, and his death is an
unaccountable loss for China.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that people of all ethnic groups across China
are grieving for Deng, which illustrates their love and admiration
for him.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Chinese people will undoubtedly turn grief
into strength, carry forward Deng's unfulfilled wish under the
leadership of the Party's Central Committee with Comrade Jiang
Zemin at the core, and continue the great cause of socialist
reform, opening up and modernization drive initiated by Deng," Li
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that since China and Venezuela established diplomatic
relations in 1974, bilateral friendship and reciprocal cooperation
in various fields have been strengthened and produced satisfactory
results, with frequent high-level contacts and deeper mutual
understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Venezuela have much in common regarding
many important international issues, describing the two countries
as trustworthy friends and cooperative partners.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic cooperation, Li said that the two
economies are different and highly complementary, and have a great
potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both sides signed three cooperative agreements on
energy last year, and in particular, the two on bilateral cut oil
cooperation, are of significance for the development of bilateral
long-term and stable economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Li also recalled his visit to Venezuela last November, and
expressed his thanks for the warm reception given to him by the
Venezuelan government and people.
</P>
<P>
Burelli said he is pleased to visit China, and mentioned Li's
successful visit to Venezuela, saying that some agreements reached
during that visit are now in effect.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's development, Burelli said that in the past few
years, China has enjoyed a rapid economic growth and is playing an
ever-important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Venezuela pays much attention to the development
of its relations with China, and is willing to work with China to
further strengthen bilateral friendship and cooperation,
especially in the fields of energy and mining.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress, also met with Burelli and his
party here today.

<P>
When word of Deng's death spread to Yaogang village, Feidong
county, east China's Anhui Province, where Deng's troops were once
stationed, the villagers said that the living conditions were very
bad when Deng lived there. But now, with policies initiated by
him, all the villagers have adequate housing and can lead a
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
"Thinking of this we can hardly hold back our tears," said one
villager. "We have made up our minds to construct our village
better and mourn the great man through our efforts and
achievements."
</P>
<P>
In downtown Hohhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, people of all ethnic groups listened to the
radio for broadcasts of Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhanshan, a 53-year-old farmer from suburban Babai township,
said that he mourned Deng's death, for without Deng's correct
guidance most of the farmers would probably still live in absolute
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Retired teacher Cui Shuxun, 73, and his family observed three
minutes of silence after hearing the death of Deng. Wuliji, an old
herdsman from a suburban county told a reporter that Deng had
brought a lot of good to the herdsman and they all supported him.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old farmer Wang Guihua burst into tears when he read
about Deng in the newspaper. He said that only days before, he had
watched the 12-part TV documentary titled "Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guohui, the deputy director of the provincial committee
of the China Democratic League in Sichuan Province said that Deng
not only made great contributions to China during his lifetime,
but also donated his body to science.
</P>
<P>
Xie Shenglin, a 70-year-old Islamic religious leader in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said that after
the third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC, Deng
created order out of chaos and correctly implemented the Party's
religious policies. This satisfied the people's need for normal
religious activities and showed respect for the customs of all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"We Muslim people will carry forward the great man's legacy to
be of one heart and one soul with the Party and the central
government, in order to continue to make our contribution to the
unity of all nationalities and the stability of society," said
Xie, who is also the vice president of the China Association of
Islam.

<HEADLINE> World Bank President Proposes Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
D. Wolfensohn has proposed to the bank's board a major initiative
for revitalizing the 50-year-old institution, the Washington Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative aims at making the World bank less bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, dubbed "The Strategic Compact", the
bank's 180 member nations would authorize the spending of 250
million dollars over the next two years on training, staff
transfers and information system, according to documents released
by the bank Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the bank's management vowed to make the institution
considerably more lean and efficient at the end of the two years.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that no specific target for job reduction has been
made, the documents said that "the best estimate we have is a
range of 500-700 separations" over next two years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank employs about 10,000 people worldwide with 8,600
in its headquarters in Washington. It lends more than 20 billion
U.S. dollars a year to the governments of developing countries for
projects of social benefits.
</P>
<P>
The initiative marks the most comprehensive and detailed
efforts by Wolfensohn since he took the post of president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that the move comes at a time when the
bank is under strong pressure from the U.S. Congress, the No. 1
donor, which has refused in recent years to fully fund U.S.
government's contribution to the bank.

He Chen, a primary school student in Beijing's Haidian
District, said that he wanted to eat a sweet dumpling for Deng
this morning. The Chinese customarily eat such dumplings during
the Lantern Festival, which is today.
</P>
<P>
"Grandpa Deng made our life so sweet, but left us before he
could have a sweet dumpling," the child said sadly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, many officials and employees of the
central government departments have expressed their shock over
Deng's death. They said that Deng's passing is a loss to the
Chinese that cannot be measured, and that his theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics is modern China's Marxism
and a scientific guide for leading the country forward.
</P>
<P>
They voiced their determination to carry forward Deng's
unfulfilled wish, and follow the guidance of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the
core, in a bid to push the Chinese socialist drive forward.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Multinational efforts to
clinch the first face-to-face talks between Zaire's warring
parties continued today in Cape Town, the legislative capital of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Associationn (SAPA), South
African officials yesterday had separate meetings with Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko's envoy Honore Nzambo and Zairean
rebel leader kabila's adviser Bizima Karaha.
</P>
<P>
So far, Pretoria officials declined to reveal details of the
talks between the Zairean warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kinshasa, Zaire quoted a rebel official on Friday
as saying that Kabila is ready to talk to Zairean government
officials on condition that they are mandated to take decisions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kabila claimed that he had refused to go to Cape Town
because Mobutu had sent an envoy instead of showing up himself.
However, informed sources said Kabila still left open the
possibility of making the trip.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean rebels, known as the Banyamulenge, took up arms
last October, accusing the Mobutu government of denying them
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Banyamulenge leaders insist that they are Zaireans who have
been in what is now eastern Zaire for more than 200 years.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Tajik Peace Talks End in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The inter-Tajik peace talks
ended after the Tajik government and the opposition signed three
documents in Iran's northeastern city of Mashhad today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the documents
were signed by Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and leader of
the opposition group Abdullah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not reveal the contents of the three
documents concluded at the end of the two-day peace talks, which
started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the two sides considered the documents as
significant and described the signing day as a historical day
for the Tajik nation.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov, describing the outcome of the talks as an honor for
the Tajik people, said the negotiating parties would strive for
implementation of the reached agreements.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the ongoing differences would be
fully set aside by continuing to maintain the current goodwill
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran had favorably paved the ground for the
convention of the session, in which the parties attained a
desirable outcome.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati disclosed that the
inter-Tajik negotiating parties had worked out a document which
defined the form of the future Tajik government and the
opposition group's contribution to the commission of Tajikistan's
national interests.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that each of the parties would have an
equal chance to contribute to the commission, which is to be
chaired by the opposition group and militant forces.
</P>
<P>
He said the major difference between the document signed in
Mashhad with that signed in Moscow was that percentage of
the opposition group's contribution in the commission has
increased.
</P>
<P>
He added that the share of the opposition in administrational
affairs stood at 30, that of the government at 50 and that of
other groups at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiating parties had also signed another
statement, which condemned any terrorist act in the republic.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the main problem faced by the parties
seemed to be solved following clarification of ratio of the
opposition group's contribution, therefore the agreement was the
most significant accord of its kind signed since the initiation
of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the opposition forces would not be disarmed
as long as a lasting stability has not been established in
the republic.

<HEADLINE> UK Students Shun Teacher Training Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- There is a sharp drop in the
number of school-leavers and undergraduates wanting to become
teachers in Britain this year, fueling concern about an impending
shortage of qualified school staff.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Universities and
Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), applications for 4-year
undergraduate courses at teacher training colleges in September
drop from 75,900 last year to 66,733, 12 percent down on last
year's already depleted total.
</P>
<P>
Demand for postgraduate training as secondary teachers has also
fell by 13.5 percent, from 12,660 last year to 10,955 this year,
and the lack of interest is becoming critical in mathematics,
modern languages, technology and science.
</P>
<P>
The figures have sparked fears that schools would soon face a
big recruitment crisis.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' unions blamed the government for presiding over the
"constant denigration" of the teaching profession, saying that
"this is a sad reflection of the way this government has allowed
the education service to be denigrated".
</P>
<P>
Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of
Teachers, said that attracting young people was becoming more
difficult because teachers were underpaid, yet had to take on
bigger work loads in crumbling class rooms.

KUWAIT CITY, February 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prince Charles
arrived in Kuwait this afternoon starting a week-long official
Gulf tour which will also take him to Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He was received at the airport by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, Deputy
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah and other Kuwaiti high-ranking governmental
officials.
</P>
<P>
His visit was on the invitation of the three Gulf
oil-rich countries to help promote traditional bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, Charles will renew his strong
friendship with the Kuwaiti royal family and people, Kuwaiti
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said they were confident that the visit would give a

and military fields.
</P>
<P>
Charles, who will meet the Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber

<HEADLINE> Palm Farming to be Promoted in Western Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A palm farming plan for
Kigoma Region, western Tanzania, is in the offing in the
government campaign to promote palm farming as a cash crop in the
region.
</P>
<P>
An Agricultural officer in the region told reporters in the
town of Kigoma today that the government has started distributing
hybrid seedlings in the districts of Kigoma, Kasulu and Kibondo,
where there are 50,000 hectares of land suitable for the crop.
</P>
<P>
According a report reaching here, the official said since the
inception of the project to promote palm farming in the region in
1987, 11 percent of the suitable land has been planted with
palm trees.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from offering hybrid seeds imported from Ghana and Malaysia
through the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) assistance, the
goverment offers training to extension staff and peasants on improved
husbandry of the crop," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The palm oil crop thrives mainly in Kigoma and Kasulu
districts, where there are 5,148 and 435 hectares respectively of
the crop, while trial farming is going on in Kibondo district.
</P>
<P>
The crop produces two types of oil, red palm oil from the outer
layers and kernel oil from its nuts.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, red palm oil is mainly used for food purposes
while the kernel oil is used for the manufacture of soap.
However, internationally, these oils are used in industrial
installations as lubricants and in tin-plating.
</P>
<P>
Palm, a tropical plant, which entered Kigoma, Tanzania, 65
years ago from the Congo River Basin, now also thrives in Tanga,
Morogoro, Mbeya, and Coast regions in the country.  enditem

BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq categorically denied on
today that an Iraqi arrested in Lebanon has any connections
with the Iraqi intelligence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Iraq News Agency (INA) today, a foreign
ministry spokesman criticized as groundless the news carried by
some press agencies to the effect that an Iraqi citizen had been
placed under arrest in Lebanon on charges of illegally entering
the country and having links with the Iraqi intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Those who trumped up such lies were bent on poisoning the
air of fraternity between Iraq and Lebanon and hampering
efforts exerted to restore bilateral Diplomatic relations, the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Bassam Ya'qoub Yousuf, born in Baghdad in
1969 and bearing passport no.1884/1009129, was an ordinary Iraqi
citizen, whose occupation was veterinarian. He has neither
official connections with the Iraqi government nor official
status.
</P>
<P>
Bassam left Iraq legally on October 6, 1996, the spokesman
said, adding that had he violated Lebanese laws, he would
be the one to blame, and the Lebanese authorities would
have the right to take legal action against him.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Urges France to Help Lift Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today urged
France to take steps more "actively and realistically"
toward the total lifting of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an article published today, Al-thawrah daily, organ of the
Arab Baath Socialist Party, said France is seeking to adopt a
position on international issues distinct from that assumed by
the U.S., especially in relation to the U.N-imposed embargo on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While taking its positions, France is trying to stick to the
limits of the international laws and U.N. resolutions. On the
contrary, the U.S. persists in making the U.N. resolutions as
tools to serve its anti-Iraq political aim, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statements given by French Foreign
Ministry's spokesman two days ago on France's different view with
the U.S. toward the embargo on Iraq, the paper said such a French
attempt would be in vain unless France develops its position more
fairly and courageously in dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged France and other states to respect the
international legitimacy and recognize Iraq's fulfillment of its
obligations toward U.N. resolutions with an open mind free from
political calculations and interests.
</P>
<P>
France can take the chance to develop an positive position by
working for the release of Iraqi assets frozen abroad to cover
the costs of Iraqi pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia this year,
the paper stressed.

<HEADLINE> Report: Albright Faced With "Jewish Dilemma" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The recent revelations
about Madeleine Albright's Jewish roots have heightened a new
dilemma for the new U.S. secretary of state, English-language
bi-weekly The Jerusalem Report said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a report filed by the magazine's Washington
correspondent, as Albright struggles to shape her own team, the
top candidates for a slew of senior posts happen to be Jewish. If
all are appointed, there is bound to be talk of a "Jewish
conspiracy," a Jewish foreign policy analyst was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Albright could draw fire from other
U.S. minorities, not to mention pro-Arab critics who argue that a
Jewish appointee for assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs
could harm U.S. foreign policy in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, the ambassador to Israel, is the leading
candidate for this job. So far, ironically, the only public
opposition to his appointment has come from the right-wing
Zionist Organization of America, which considers Indyk to have
been too close to Labor's Shimon Peres during last year's
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Indyk's rivals for the post include Ned Walker, a former deputy
to Albright at the U.N. and now ambassador to Egypt, and Chris
Ross, ambassador to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Albright has already promoted special Middle East coordinator
Dennis Ross, a Jew, to be her senior counselor, a position that
brings the rank of under secretary of state, and trouble-shooting
responsibilities extending well beyond the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright has chosen two non-Jews, Strobe Talbott and Thomas
Pickering, a former ambassador to Israel, as her No.2 and No.3
respectively. But at the next level, Jews lead the lists of
contenders for the six regional assistant-secretary posts.

1.3 million three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Briefing members of the press after an extensive tour of the
park to assess the damage of the prevailing drought, he noted
that a large number of the birds had migrated to the neighboring
lakes Elementaita and Bogoria where the water levels are still
habitable for them.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, other bird species and animals have not been
affected much although the lake water level had receded.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the flamingoes, which are one of the
country's main tourist attraction, will be back when the rains
come in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The warden pointed out that the Lake Nakuru, about 165
kilometers northwest of Nairobi, is now being served by a water
spring where most of the animals have flocked.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the park authority has managed to keep the
water level of the lake at a strategic water point by using pumps
to ensure that the animals continue to have enough water.

LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Portugal wants to enhance
trade link with Zambia, according to sources from the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) here
today.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI is to sign a trade agreement with the newly launched
Portuguese-Zambian Commercial and Industrial Association (PZCIA).
</P>
<P>
PZCIA was formed a month ago to help enhance trade
between Portugal and Zambia, which has not been so impressive in
the past.
</P>
<P>
PZCIA head Herculano Anjos is in Lusaka for discussions with
Zambian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said PZCIA will help link up the two countries' businessmen
so as to help boost their two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, a delegation of Portuguese entrepreneurs
will arrive in Zambia later this year.
</P>
<P>
Anjos said Zambia is rich in natural resources but has
remained closed to Portugal which, if given necessary
informations, will see many businessmen and potential investors
coming into the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
He said PZCIA will act as a liaison office between the two
nations by giving appropriate information on products available
in either country.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to bring in new lines of trade in Zambia in
which we can also exchange some of Zambia's natural resources for
technology and equipment," Anjos added. enditem
