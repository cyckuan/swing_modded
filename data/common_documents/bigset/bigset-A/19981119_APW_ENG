France to introduce tough anti-doping law

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the aftermath of the scandal-plagued Tour de
France, French lawmakers adjourned debate on one of the world's
toughest anti-doping laws early Thursday morning without taking a
vote.
	   The bill, approved by the Senate in May, was expected to pass
without problem in the National Assembly later Thursday when
lawmakers reconvened after a few hours sleep.
	   The legislation would create a powerful doping prevention
committee, order federations to show that they are acting to stamp
out the use of illegal drugs, and punish individuals found
prescribing, supplying, facilitating, encouraging and using such
substances.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials would make up the nine-member committee.
	   It would have the power to impose specific penalties, and
stiffen sanctions where it believes that sports federations have
failed to crack down on doping.
	   The credibility of the system rests not only on its ability to
test individual athletes, but also to control federations that are
too lax, said Jean-Claude Nery, an official at the Culture
Ministry.
	   Under the bill, the Ministry of Sports will have the right to
carry out raids on premises and order athletes to undergo medical
examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
	   Furthermore, the government will only issue sports licenses to
authorities that have a certificate showing that they are combating
doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her central policy since coming into office in June
1997, admits that clamping down on doping will be a long, hard
struggle.
	   ``There will need to be a battle from day to day to reverse the
flow,'' Buffet said before presenting the bill.
	   ``We cannot believe that once the law has been passed and
applied, we have dealt with the problem,'' she said.
	   Buffet also said that she would give details of the law to the
next meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in an
attempt to promote a more coherent international anti-doping
policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for admitting to the use of the
performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO), gave new impetus
to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals.
	   On Tuesday, French daily Liberation said that an internal report
from France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS),
``Doping and Sports,'' identified widespread doping in French
sports, particularly among adolescents and at small sports clubs.
	   The last official government study, in 1992, found only 69
positive doping cases among 8,000 tests.
	   But the newspaper quotes an unnamed CNRS official as saying that
the problem is far more widespread.
	   ``We are very concerned because we can see death lurking at the
end of the race,'' he said.
	   With growing commercial pressures, ``the door is open to
commercialization of sports, to corruption and cheating,'' the
report said.

Indonesian president warns of more chaos if reforms fail
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Thursday that civil unrest could escalate and threaten national
unity if student protesters prevent his government from passing
promised political reforms.
	   The warning came after clashes broke out last week between
protesters who want faster democratic change and government
security forces trying to stop them from marching into the
country's Parliament building. The violence triggered riots
elsewhere in Jakarta, and as many as 16 people died.
	   Angered by the shooting deaths of students by the military,
protesters planned more demonstrations on Thursday. The previous
day, several thousand students streamed through the capital and
laid flowers outside the gates of the heavily guarded Parliament
building.
	   Habibie, who has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system
set up by his predecessor, Suharto, said it was vital for the
government to implement a dozen reforms passed by the nation's
highest legislative body.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, filled with holdovers from
Suharto's authoritarian era, approved the decrees on Friday in a
session marred by violence on the streets. Students suspect the
assembly wants to stall democratic reform.
	   ``The stakes are very great,'' Habibie said in a speech at the
presidential palace. If reforms fail, he said, ``it will not be an
impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark riots in May that led
to the ouster of Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Chief among Habibie's reforms is a plan to hold Parliamentary
elections in May or June 1999, which he has promised would be
conducted impartially. Still, suspicions abound that the ruling
Golkar party will try to dominate the electoral machinery as it has
in previous years.
	   ``We will be able to witness together which forces will win the
support of the people and which ones will not,'' Habibie said.
``The government has resolved to conduct a really honest, just and
democratic general election.''
	   The reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly that passed them and is now
sitting in its own right.
	   The assembly did not heed student demands that the military be
banned from politics. Instead, it chose to gradually reduce the
number of appointed Parliament seats held by the armed forces from
its current quota of 75.
	   Students also want Suharto to be tried on charges of corruption
and human rights abuses, but the assembly chose only to name
Suharto in an anti-corruption decree. The measure could bolster an
investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   The Republika newspaper on Thursday reported that the government
is investigating whether it can seize a cattle ranch near Jakarta
that is owned by Suharto. Local villagers have laid claim to the
land.
	   Police announced Wednesday they had charged 10 opposition
activists, including two retired generals, with orchestrating last
week's violence in a bid to topple Habibie's government. If
convicted, they could be imprisoned for life.
	   Opposition figures and students have demanded that military
chief Gen. Wiranto resign in the wake of the shootings. Hundreds of
people were injured.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said autopsies on the bodies of some of the eight students
who died showed some had been killed by live ammunition.

England ready to topple Australia for the Ashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart is
confident his side will take the initiative from the first ball of
the new Ashes cricket series starting Friday at the Gabba ground.
	   With batting linchpin Mike Atherton coming through a draining
fitness test on the eve of the five-match series unscathed,
England's prospects of beating Australia first up are greater than
they have been for many years.
	   And Australian skipper Mark Taylor agrees with Stewart's upbeat
assessment.
	   ``They (England) are most certainly a confident side,'' said
Taylor, who will be playing his 100th test Friday. ``Looking at
England in recent years, this will be our toughest Ashes series.''
	   Taylor, fresh from a historic 1-0 Australian series win in
Pakistan, will lead an Australian side that has made winning a
habit, with vice-captain Steve Waugh the only member of the current
team who has lost an Ashes series.
	   Australia has totally dominated Ashes contests since former
captain Allan Border's outfit destroyed England 4-0 in 1989. Taylor
played his first full series on that tour, bursting onto the
international scene with 839 runs at an average of 83.90.
	   ``We have been very lucky our younger players have been brought
up with a winning feeling, unlike the English, and it is a
tradition we don't won't to break,'' Taylor said.
	   Taylor, one of the most successful captains in the modern game
with 26 wins from 45 tests, reflected on his first Ashes series.
	   ``We went there written off,'' he said. ``The worst side to
leave the Australian shores, popgun attack, inexperienced batting
line up. We came back 4-0 winners. If it hadn't rained, we would
have won 6-0.
	   ``So it can change very quickly, I keep telling the players
`don't let it get away early, once it slips away it's hard to get
back'.''
	   England under Stewart has been far more consistent than in the
past, winning a hard-fought series over South Africa earlier this
year 2-1, England's first win in a five-matches series on home soil
in 13 years.
	   However, they came unstuck soon after when they were embarrassed
by Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan in a one-off test at
the Oval.
	   But Stewart is confident that after beating the South Africans,
his side is strong enough mentally to take on the might of
Australia and said the opening session was crucial to the entire
series.
	   ``You want to set the tone early,'' Stewart said. ``The first
two balls of the test here four years ago when (Michael) Slater cut
`Daffy' (Philip DeFreitas) for two fours set the tone, and we want
to get off to a good start like we did at Edgbaston two years ago.
	   ``Cricket is all about learning to win and learning to lose, and
Australia has learned how to win. When it gets tight they generally
get ahead of you, but we are learning to do that.''
	   ``We have to make sure that when we recognize that situation we
have to grab it. The key is to make sure you stay ahead of the
opposition, which they (Australia) make a habit of doing.''
	   Teams:
	   AUSTRALIA (from): Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater, Justin
Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Damien
Fleming, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Stuart MacGill, Glenn
McGrath.
	   ENGLAND (from): Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain,
Alec Stewart (captain), Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, John
Crawley, Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser,
Allan Mullally.
	   Umpires: Darrell Hair (Australia) and K.T. Francis (Sri Lanka).
TV Umpire: Peter Parker (Australia).
	   Match Referee: John Reid (New Zealand).

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Nick Faldo and John Daly, two
multi major winners looking for a way back into form, were happy
enough with their cautious sub-par starts at the World Cup of Golf
on Thursday.
	   But the Englishman and American were upstaged by a young
Japanese player without even a minor victory to his name.
	   Yasuharu Imano hit off in the first group and had the
outstanding score with an 8-under 64 on a Gulf Harbor course
playing better than expectations.
	   His round was enough to lead his two-man outfit to the front of
the 32-nation field in the 43rd edition of the teams event.
	   Imano, yet to win in two seasons as a professional, is ranked
31st on the Japanese tour and was making his first appearance at
the World Cup. Teammate Mitsutaka Kusakabe, also on debut, was less
spectacular with a 70 on the new 6,288-meter (6,850-yard) course as
Japan ended at 10-under 134, three ahead of nearest rival South
Africa.
	   Both players capped their rounds in the strokeplay format with
birdies at the 18th as good approaches left them within 10 feet.
	   ``My putting was very good today and I hit every green but
one,'' Imano said through an interpreter. ``It's my first time in a
team match and my leader (Kusakabe) helped me read the line.''
	   Scores were low despite several players tipping trouble from the
winds swirling around the ocean-front course. Tournament officials
appeared to heed the warnings on pin placements, giving the players
plenty of birdie chances. Imano said the greens were ``perfect''
compared to a day earlier.
	   The 479-meter (517-yard) par-5 2nd gave up five eagles and 33
birdies from the 64 players.
	   Several teams made a run at Japan but were unable to maintain
momentum as the wind picked up through the day.
	   Faldo, playing here in a bid to kick-start his form after a
difficult season, made a great start and was 5-under through the
opening nine. He dropped a shot at 10, got it back at 11 and
dropped it again at the spectacular par-4 16th, a hole which slopes
wickedly towards the Hauraki Gulf seas.
	   ``That's the highest I could have shot,'' said Faldo. ``There
were faults _ it was a case of looking, looking and looking,
identifying them and then working on one drill.''
	   England was at 3-under after David Carter's 1-over. Carter took
painkillers for a shoulder injury and struggled to read the break
on the greens.
	   Daly, who relished his previous U.S. team experience at the
Dunhill Cup this year, shot a 2-under 70 including an eagle at the
par-5 6th and a bizarre bogey at the 12th.
	   The bogey came when he was forced to hit a second ball from the
tee after his first was ignored by stewards and could not be found
in the rough. He had another bogey at the 14th.
	   ``That was the two holes that cost me a good four or five
shots,'' said Daly. ``But we hung in there and we're right in the
tournament and that's all we wanted today.''
	   Daly's teammate Scott Verplank also had 2-under as the pair were
placed seven shots behind the leaders.
	   Costantino Rocca, playing his ninth World Cup for Italy, had the
second best individual score with a 7-under 65. His partner,
Massimo Florioli, was 2-over, leaving Italy in a three-way tie for
fifth.
	   South Africa was second in the team's event, three behind Japan
at 7-under after David Frost shot a 66 and Nic Henning had a 71.
	   Sweden's Patrik Sjoland (68) and Mathias Gronberg (70) were tied
for third at 6-under with Australia's Peter O'Malley and Richard
Green, who both had 69s.
	   Pre-tournament favorite Scotland was 2-under after a
disappointing round from Europe's top player Colin Montgomerie.
	   He started well enough, with three birdies in the opening six
holes, but then gave the shots back to finish level. Andrew Coltart
also had three birdies from the opening six but dropped one.
	   Large galleries watched New Zealand's first hosting of the event
and Daly was clearly the biggest draw. Germany's Sven Struver got
the loudest reception however. He relieved himself in the trees on
16 and after finishing was sent on his way with a burst of cheers
and applause.

Clinton on economic recovery mission to Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton opened his trip to Asia
on Thursday with plans to prod Japan to act decisively to revive
its sputtering economy and boost recovery throughout the region.
	   The president arrived at Haneda International Airport and headed
directly to the Imperial Residence for a meeting with Emperor
Akihito.
	   Gripped by its worst economic recession since World War II,
Japan remains the key to protecting American prosperity, the
president said as he left the White House on Wednesday for a
five-day economic mission to Asia. He plans stops in Tokyo; Seoul,
South Korea; and Guam, the U.S. Pacific territory that has been hit
hard by Japan's recession.
	   ``Nothing is more important to restore stability and growth in
Asia than efforts to restart Japan's economy. It has long been
Asia's engine of growth,'' Clinton said.
	   ``Just as the world looked to us in America six years ago to put
our economic house in order, today nations look to Japan to take
decisive steps to help the Japanese people restore growth in Asia
and around the world.''
	   Beginning with a handshake with Emperor Akihito, Clinton will
confer with Japan's highest leaders and address the Japanese people
before traveling to South Korea, which has its own set of economic
and security problems.
	   In his departure statement, in which he did not mention the
congressional impeachment inquiry he left behind him, the president
made clear his view that the economies of Asia and the United
States are intertwined.
	   ``If people overseas lose their jobs, they can't afford American
products, and our workers and farmers pay the price,'' he said.
	   Clinton said the United States has met its own obligations to
halt the global economic crisis. It has helped the International
Monetary Fund, has pressed the World Bank to double its
expenditures to help people whose lives have been hurt by the Asian
crisis and has organized an aid package for Brazil to keep the
crisis from spreading.
	   ``Now we're taking our efforts directly to Asia, where the
crisis began and where we must work to bring it to an end,''
Clinton said.
	   This week Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi unveiled a dlrs
196 billion package of spending and tax cuts to spur Japan's
economy, Japan's eighth recovery plan in eight years of economic
distress. The White House fears the package will turn out to have
less punch than advertised.
	   Clinton said his agenda with the prime minister includes
discussing efforts to implement Japan's commitment to banking
reform, stimulate consumer demand and growth, deregulate the
Japanese economy and open Japanese markets to free trade.
	   Traveling on to Seoul later in the week, Clinton will encourage
President Kim Dae-jung in his own efforts to reform banking and
corporate practices ``and getting growth back on track.''
	   ``I will be essential in this regard, not only for the
government to act, but for Korea's big business conglomerates to do
their share for economic reform,'' Clinton said.

	   Anne Moran, CARE's executive director for the Southwest United
States, said the agency expects to raise about dlrs 500,000 from
gate receipts, television revenues and contributions from the
tournament.

	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis,
playing in their final doubles tournament as a team, beat Ellis
Ferriera and Rich Leach 6-4, 6-4 Wednesday in the opening round of
the ATP World Doubles Championship.
	   The Dutchmen, ranked No. 1 in the world, improved their 1998
record to 42-4, the best winning percentage on the ATP Tour this
season. Together they have won 38 titles, including this year at
Wimbledon.
	   The pair has appeared in six previous World Doubles
Championships and has never lost an opening round match.
	   Eltingh, 28, announced his retirement from tennis following the
conclusion of this event.
	   ``We want to go out on top,'' Haarhuis said following the match.
``That means winning here in Hartford and finishing the year as the
best team in the world.''
	   Eltingh became a new father this year and admits his heart is
close to home.
	   ``I've been playing tennis seriously since I was 12,'' he said.
``It's been a great career, but I just know that I won't have to
pack my bags anymore.''
	   Later Wednesday, Don Johnson and Francisco Montana upset the No.
2 seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
	   The heavily favored Indian team of Bhupathi and Paes breezed
through the opening set, but after getting to 4-4 in the second set
failed to close out the winning, forcing the match in to the
decisive third set. The final set went to a tiebreak, with Johnson
and Montana getting the early break and holding on for the win.
	   ``The way they (Johnson and Montana) played tonight, they would
have beaten a lot of teams,'' said Bhupathi. ``They returned very
well and we had chances, but could not convert them.''
	   In the final match of the day, the French team of Olivier
Delaitre and Fabrice Santoro upset No. 3 seeds Todd Woodbridge and
Mark Woodforde of Australia, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3, 6-4.
	   Also Wednesday, Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor defeated Sandon
Stolle and Cyril Suk, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Philippine shares slightly lower on profit-taking, peso higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares finished slightly
lower Thursday, with early gains trimmed by profit-taking, traders
said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
1.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1819.01 points after a three-day
rally. The index climbed 41.54 points Wednesday to 1820.77.
	   The market has gained 108.79 points, or 6.4 percent, in the last
three days, taking it within a few points of its 1997 closing level
of 1869.23. It surged to as high as 1,856 on Thursday before
falling back as investors began cashing in on the recent gains.
	   The broader All Shares Index was unchanged at 582.96. It
finished 11.67 points higher Wednesday.
	   Losers overshadowed gainers 63 to 33, while 46 issues were
unchanged.
	   Among those shares which retreated amid the bout of
profit-taking were Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and Metro
Pacific Corp.
	   ``Clearly, it was a technical correction. Most issues were
already at, or near, their peak,'' said Erwin Balita, analyst for
Securities 2000 Inc.
	   Meanwhile, the Philippine peso was slightly higher against the
U.S. dollar in early trading Thursday, with slack demand for both
currencies, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged about 39.911 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System in the morning, down from Wednesday's average of 39.947
pesos.
	   Traders said most participants in the spot market are
maintaining their currency positions while waiting for fresh news
that could affect the movement of the peso.
	   There also are rumors that the central bank does not want the
peso to appreciate above 39.50 to the dollar, they said.
	   The central bank has not indicated a preferred level, saying it
wants the peso-dollar rate to be determined by the market.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton opened his trip to Asia
on Thursday with plans to prod Japan to act decisively to revive
its sputtering economy and boost recovery throughout the region.
	   The president arrived at Haneda International Airport and headed
directly to the Imperial Residence for a meeting with Emperor
Akihito. While en route to that meeting, Clinton spoke by telephone
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who just returned from
Russia and briefed Clinton on the economic and political situation
in Moscow.

President of scandal-tainted NEC vows to restore company image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Struggling to restore its image after a defense
contract scandal, Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. announced
Thursday it will create a special inspection office to prevent
further abuses.
	   Thirteen officials at NEC and two affiliates have been arrested
on suspicion of overcharging Japan's Defense Agency in equipment
contracts. The company has also acknowledged overbilling Japan's
space agency.
	   NEC President Hisashi Kaneko told reporters that the new
``inspection headquarters'' will be under his direct control and
will be set up early next year.
	   ``It is our duty to embark on the difficult road of restoring
the company's reputation,'' Kaneko said.
	   Kaneko also said NEC will request that the Defense Agency and
the National Space Development Agency allow a neutral third party
to study how much NEC should reimburse them for the overbilling.
	   Kaneko warded off speculation that he would resign over the
scandal, saying that it was his responsibility to ensure the
company reforms itself and regains the trust of shareholders and
the public.
	   NEC Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto has stepped down to take
responsibility over the scandal, although he has said he was not
directly involved in it.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
the Defense Agency totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 13.9
million).
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested on
suspicion of allowing the inflated billings in exchange for cushy
jobs at NEC-linked companies for retiring agency officials.
	   NEC says it overbilled NASDA 2.3 billion yen (dlrs 19 million)
between late 1993 and early 1998.
	   NEC, Japan's largest PC maker, is the world's second-largest
computer chip maker after Intel Corp. It owns more than 50 percent
of California-based Packard Bell NEC, which controls about 10
percent of the world's computer market.

20th Century Fox pulls out of Thailand for ``King and I'' remake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; UPDATES with film board reaction; ADDS
background, byline.
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Frustrated by official disapproval over
its script, 20th Century Fox announced Thursday it has dropped
plans to shoot a new version of ``Anna and the King'' on location
in Thailand.
	   Fox said in a statement that shooting for the remake of the
classic films ``Anna and the King of Siam'' and the ``The King and
I'' will instead be shifted from Thailand to neighboring Malaysia.
	   The Thai Film Board has twice turned down script proposals for
the new film, saying they were disrespectful of the 19th Century
ruler King Mongkut and the monarchy of Siam, as Thailand was then
known.
	   The remake stars Oscar Award-winner Jodie Foster in the role of
Anna Leonowens, the Victorian governess Mongkut hired to teach his
children English, and Hong Kong action star Chow Yun Fat as the
king.
	   Fox's statement expressed regret over ``excessive bureaucracy
and political red-tape. This decision to move production was not
made with any disrespect or outrage.''
	   ``The simple truth is that time has run out,'' Fox said. ``In an
effort to avoid costly delays that could undermine the entire
project, the studio has exercised its ability to change
locations.''
	   Thais highly revere their monarchy and feel previous versions of
the story, based on Leonowens' disputed memoirs, portray Mongkut as
a brutal buffoon rather than as a linguist and Buddhist scholar.
	   Insulting the monarchy remains a crime that carries a prison
term of three to 15 years. The current king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, is
the world's longest-reigning monarch, with 52 years on the throne.
	   No local film showing any of the nine kings of the current
dynasty has ever been made.
	   Though the 1946 version of the film, starring Rex Harrison and
Irene Dunne, was screened in Thailand, the movie based on the
Broadway musical starring Yul Brynner a decade later was banned.
	   Fox tried to adapt the current script to get the film made in
Thailand, but industry insiders said after it was rejected for a
second time last week that the Film Board was unlikely ever to
approve it.
	   Thipawadee Maenyart, a board official, told The Associated Press
on Thursday that the body had nothing to do with Fox's decision to
move.
	   ``It depends on them,'' Thipawadee said. ``We will look at their
final script if they want to try again. Our duty is to correct what
is inaccurate.''
	   Fox's local coordinators said they were unaware of the studio's
decision, which was announced in a fax sent from Beverly Hills.
	   Thais feel that Leonowens exaggerated her memoirs to give
herself a central place in the Siamese court and that in reality
the king probably met her only once. The ``King and I'' scenes
where Deborah Kerr dances with Brynner rankles them as demeaning
and silly.
	   Fox's statement insisted that this time, the film makers wanted
to portray Mongkut in a more historically accurate light. But the
board was unmoved.
	   ``The history depicted in `Anna and the King' was due for a
fresher and more honest interpretation,'' Fox said, adding it still
intends ``to reintroduce this classic tale with the care and
respect it deserves.''
	   Fox is embroiled in a second dispute with Thai authorities over
plans to film a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle, ``The Beach.'' Forestry
officials have ordered shooting on a southern island suspended for
two weeks pending a new review over possible environmental damage.

Indonesian president warns of more chaos if reforms fail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Habibie says time is running out in 2nd graf.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Thursday that civil unrest could escalate and threaten national
unity if student protesters prevent his government from passing
promised political reforms.
	   ``We are running against time,'' Habibie said. ``Concrete
measures have to be taken immediately.''
	   The warning came after clashes broke out last week between
protesters who want faster democratic change and military forces
trying to stop them from marching into the country's Parliament
building. The violence triggered riots elsewhere in Jakarta, and as
many as 16 people died.
	   Angered by the shooting deaths of students by the military,
protesters planned more demonstrations on Thursday. The previous
day, several thousand students streamed through the capital and
laid flowers outside the gates of the heavily guarded Parliament.
	   Habibie, who has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system
set up by his predecessor, Suharto, said it was vital for the
government to implement a dozen reforms passed by the nation's
highest legislative body.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, filled with holdovers from
Suharto's authoritarian era, approved the decrees on Friday in a
session marred by violence on the streets. Students suspect the
assembly wants to stall democratic reform.
	   ``The stakes are very great,'' Habibie said in prepared remarks
distributed by his office. If reforms fail, he said, ``it will not
be an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark riots in May that led
to the ouster of Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Chief among Habibie's reforms is a plan to hold Parliamentary
elections in May or June 1999, which he has promised would be
conducted impartially. Still, suspicions abound that the ruling
Golkar party will try to dominate the electoral machinery as it has
in previous years.
	   ``We will be able to witness together which forces will win the
support of the people and which ones will not,'' Habibie said.
``The government has resolved to conduct a really honest, just and
democratic general election.''
	   The reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly that passed them and is now
sitting in its own right.
	   The assembly did not heed student demands that the military be
banned from politics. Instead, it chose to gradually reduce the
number of appointed Parliament seats held by the armed forces from
its current quota of 75.
	   Students also want Suharto to be tried on charges of corruption
and human rights abuses, but the assembly chose only to name
Suharto in an anti-corruption decree. The measure could bolster an
investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   The Republika newspaper on Thursday reported that the government
is investigating whether it can seize a cattle ranch near Jakarta
that is owned by Suharto. Local villagers have laid claim to the
land.
	   Police announced Wednesday they had charged 10 opposition
activists, including two retired generals, with orchestrating last
week's violence in a bid to topple Habibie's government. If
convicted, they could be imprisoned for life.
	   Opposition figures and students have demanded that military
chief Gen. Wiranto resign in the wake of the shootings. Hundreds of
people were injured.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said autopsies on the bodies of some of the eight students
who died showed some had been killed by live ammunition.

Indonesian Minister says peaceful protests won't harm investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protests in Indonesia will not
harm investor confidence as long as the demonstrations are
peaceful, senior Indonesian economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on
rebuilding Indonesia, Ginandjar said ``many countries are
undergoing the same transition to democracy,'' adding that
investors have not fled other these nations.
	   Foreign investment is seen as a key to Indonesia's efforts to
overcome the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Ginandjar was speaking days after deadly clashes between student
protesters and police left as many as 16 people dead, including
eight students.
	   He said the recent student protests do not have a negative
impact on perceptions about Indonesia, but that looting and rioting
would make potential investors nervous.
	   ``We have to separate students protesting with firm belief from
looting and rioting,'' he said. ``If (student protests) are
peaceful, I don't think it will affect confidence.''
	   Riots erupted briefly on Saturday in Jakarta.
	   The violence last week was the worst in the capital since May,
when much heavier rioting and looting helped unseat President
Suharto after three decades in power.

Japan hangs three; makes first public announcement of execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan hanged three death row inmates Thursday, the
Justice Ministry said in the first direct government announcement
of an execution.
	   The names of the three, their crimes and the places where the
executions took place were withheld, despite the eased rules on
informing the public of executions, said Justice Ministry spokesman
Yuichi Sawada.
	   Earlier this month, Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura ordered
a review of the government's long-standing policy of refusing to
release information about capital punishment.
	   Under the new policy, the dates and number of executions are
announced by the ministry.
	   According to Kyodo News agency, Akira Tsuda, 59, was executed in
Hiroshima for kidnapping a 9-year-old boy for ransom and murdering
him in February 1984.
	   Masamichi Ida, 56, was hanged in Nagoya for killing three people
for insurance money, and Tatsuaki Nishio, 61, was executed in the
same city for murder, Kyodo reported.
	   The new policy sheds a limited light on the secretive workings
of the Japanese criminal justice system.
	   Death row victims are believed to be held for years in solitary
confinement and not told when they will die until the morning of
their execution. Family members are typically informed days later
to pick up the body.
	   Until Thursday, the only information released by the ministry
about executions came in an annual report saying the total number
of death sentences carried out during the previous year.
	   The government has defended the secrecy, saying that it was
needed to respect the privacy of crime victims and spare criminals'
families from shame and embarrassment.
	   In June this year, Japanese media cited unidentified sources as
saying three convicted murderers were hanged. The ministry has said
six people were executed in 1996, followed by four people executed
in 1997.
	   Earlier this month, the U.N. Human Rights Committee urged Japan
to cut back on crimes punishable by the death penalty and improve
conditions for prisoners on death row.
	   The Japanese government defends the use of the death penalty on
grounds that public opinion supports it.

France to introduce tough anti-doping law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts lead. Assembly expected to reconvene after 0800 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers were expected to adopt stiff
penalties Thursday for athletes and physicians who take and
prescribe banned performance-enhancing drugs, as part of a backlash
against a Tour de France plagued by doping allegations.
	   Lawmakers in the National Assembly considered the law, expected
to be one of the world's toughest anti-doping measures, in a late
night session before recessing early Thursday. The bill, approved
by the Senate in May, was expected to pass without problem later
Thursday when lawmakers reconvened after a few hours sleep.
	   The legislation would create a powerful doping prevention
committee, order federations to show that they are acting to stamp
out the use of illegal drugs, and punish individuals found
prescribing, supplying, facilitating, encouraging and using such
substances.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials would make up the nine-member committee.
	   It would have the power to impose specific penalties, and
stiffen sanctions where it believes that sports federations have
failed to crack down on doping.
	   The credibility of the system rests not only on its ability to
test individual athletes, but also to control federations that are
too lax, said Jean-Claude Nery, an official at the Culture
Ministry.
	   Under the bill, the Ministry of Sports will have the right to
carry out raids on premises and order athletes to undergo medical
examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
	   Furthermore, the government will only issue sports licenses to
authorities that have a certificate showing that they are combating
doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her central policy since coming into office in June
1997, admits that clamping down on doping will be a long, hard
struggle.
	   ``There will need to be a battle from day to day to reverse the
flow,'' Buffet said before presenting the bill.
	   ``We cannot believe that once the law has been passed and
applied, we have dealt with the problem,'' she said.
	   Buffet also said that she would give details of the law to the
next meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in an
attempt to promote a more coherent international anti-doping
policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for admitting to the use of the
performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO), gave new impetus
to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals.
	   On Tuesday, French daily Liberation said that an internal report
from France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS),
``Doping and Sports,'' identified widespread doping in French
sports, particularly among adolescents and at small sports clubs.
	   The last official government study, in 1992, found only 69
positive doping cases among 8,000 tests.
	   But the newspaper quotes an unnamed CNRS official as saying that
the problem is far more widespread.
	   ``We are very concerned because we can see death lurking at the
end of the race,'' he said.
	   With growing commercial pressures, ``the door is open to
commercialization of sports, to corruption and cheating,'' the
report said.

Minister warns Olympics organizers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Federal Sports Minister Jackie Kelly
warned Sydney Games organizers Thursday about creating another
debt-plagued Montreal Olympics after it was revealed the wages bill
of senior executives had doubled.
	   The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
annual report shows 5.73 million Australian dollars (3.61 million
U.S. dlrs) was paid to 23 executives in 1997-98, compared with 2.62
million Australian dollars (1.65 million U.S. dlrs) paid to 17
executives in 1996-97.
	   Figures showed three executives received 400,000 Australian
dollars (252,000 U.S. dlrs) or more this year compared with one
last year.
	   Kelly said she would be watching out for the ``bottom-line''
cost of organizing the 2000 Games.
	   ``We don't want to see a Montreal,'' Kelly said, referring to
the 1976 Montreal Olympics in Canada, the greatest financial
catastrophe of the modern Olympic era, which ran up an estimated
loss of around 630 million U.S. dlrs.
	   ``We want to see the whole Sydney Olympics be successful, not
just as a national event for Australia of which we can be
incredibly proud, but also a financial success,'' she said.
	   SOCOG denied there had been a blowout in senior executive
salaries.
	   A spokesman said a number of executives had been appointed
midway through the last financial year, so their full salaries were
not included in the 1996-97 figures but showed up in 1997-98.

suffered another night of disappointment when cloud cover and poor
weather blocked their view of what had been billed as the most
spectacular celestial fireworks in 33 years.
	   Gathered atop this mountain at its historic Buddhist temple or
enjoying tailgate parties in pickups parked along the winding
approach, many of the Thai and foreign visitors were scanning the
skies for the famed Leonids meteors for their third night in a row.
	   They expected Wednesday night and early Thursday morning to be
their last good chance to see the meteors, the end of the peak
viewing period predicted by astronomers. But once again, Mother
Nature interfered.
	   After a spectacular sunset, clouds shifted over Doi Suthep and
nearby Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest peak, and cast an opaque
pall over the northern Thai skies. Shortly after midnight (1700 GMT
Wednesday), however, streaking meteors became visible.
	   For about two hours, the meteors traced white streaks across the
inky skies. Spectators, many of them curled on straw mats under
warm blankets to keep off the chill, pointed skywards as new ones
appeared every 20 minutes or so.
	   The overall verdict that the show was more satisfying than on
Tuesday night _ when as many as 10,000 people flocked to the peaks
and were dismayed by thick clouds _ but still not as spectacular as
they had hoped for.
	   ``Hardly anything happened yesterday,'' said Rachata Pitak, 26.
``The authorities and the media had played up the event too much,
resulting in major disappointment for many people.''
	   Wichai Thepquanyern, 18, made a few wishes on falling stars,
asking for health and longevity.
	   ``I don't think the wish will necessary come true,'' Wichai
said. ``But it's better to be safe than sorry.''
	   Unlike Tuesday night, authorities in the nearby city of Chiang
Mai did not turn off city lights to make a better view for the
star-gazers and there was no major police presence to direct
traffic up the slopes.
	   The meteor craze appeared to have burned out in other Asian
cities, too, where big crowds had turned out Tuesday night but were
disappointed by bad weather.
	   In India, astronomers blamed pollution and cloud cover,
speculated they had misjudged the time and finally said that India
had simply not turned out to be the vantage point they had
originally thought it would be.
	   Four people in Japan died of accidents thought to be linked to
the meteor shower _ a 19-year-old woman who fell off a bridge while
trying to get a glimpse, and three people in an auto accident
blamed on a driver distracted by the display.
	   The Leonids meteors, so named because they were thought to
originate in the constellation Leo, are actually the long,
streaking tail of the Tempel-Tuttle Comet. The meteoroids forming
it are particles, some no larger than a grain of sand, shed by the
comet.
	   They appear over Earth every year, usually in November, but only
come close enough to be seen by amateur star-gazers every 33 years.
	   For the first time this year, they were passing through skies
filled with orbiting satellites. Operators, fearing that collision
with even a speck could damage their costly satellites, maneuvered
them to minimize the chances of impact.

	   In Anaheim, California, Marty McInnis scored the go-ahead goal
on a third-period power play as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the
New York Rangers.
	   Anaheim got off only 16 shots to the Rangers' 30, but Mighty
Ducks goalie Guy Hebert let just one get past him, running his
personal winning streak to four.
	   The Mighty Ducks, winners of three straight, have never lost to
the Rangers in Anaheim, with a 5-0 all-time record at home against
them.
	   Steve Rucchin scored in the second period and assisted on
Anaheim's other two goals, including Paul Kariya's empty-net goal
in the closing seconds. Niklas Sundstrom scored for New York.
 &UR; Sharks 5, Kings 4
	   In San Jose, California, Tony Granato's two third-period goals
and Jeff Friesen's two-goal, one-assist performance lifted the San
Jose Sharks over the Los Angeles Kings.
	   Granato's first goal, on a 15-footer from the right, tied the
game 4-4 at 6:28 of the third period. His second came in a
shorthanded situation with 7:07 left in the game when he picked up
a missed shot by Marcus Ragnarsson and scored from eight feet.
	   That proved to be the game winner, as San Jose improved to 4-1-2
in its last seven games. Los Angeles lost its fifth straight and
eighth in its last 10.

Difficult day for Daly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ All eyes were on John Daly at
the World Cup of Golf Thursday _ except when he needed them most.
	   Daly was the center of attention for a New Zealand record
first-day crowd which lapped up his power hitting and fell in love
with him as he chain smoked his way through a beautifully crisp
afternoon at the oceanfront Gulf Harbor course.
	   Despite all the attention, Daly's round of 2-under 70 was
sabotaged on the 12th when no-one seemed to watching where his tee
shot went. It headed into the rough but the stewards were having a
daydream.
	   ``Well I thought I hit a pretty good drive and nobody seemed to
see where it landed,'' Daly said. ``I thought it was just over the
right bunker.
	   ``Then I hit my third shot off the tee and landed it right on
the front of the green and got another bad break.''
	   The ball rolled back down the fringe and rested in some wood
chips.
	   ``I hit a great fourth shot out of the wood chips that just
didn't release up the hill, but I made a great putt and (teammate)
Scott Verplank made birdie, so we didn't lose any ground there.''
	   Daly and Verplank were seven shots behind surprise leaders Japan
after the first round of the teams event.
	   Verplank, a former U.S. amateur champion whose career has been
plagued by illness, said he was happy with U.S. team's position.
	   ``I didn't think I played all that well, but we didn't kill
ourselves so we can out and play well tomorrow, the next day and
the next day and we will be all right,'' Verplank said.
	   Daly was 3-under through six holes, including an eagle three at
the straightforward par-5 6th.
	   ``I hit a little seven iron in there and made a little eagle and
I was off to the races,'' Daly said. ``I thought, you know, we were
going to start making a lot of birdies. We just kind of hung in
there and didn't do anything stupid and like I said we're right in
it.''
	   While plenty of fans wanted to have a chat with Daly, one got a
chance.
	   The U.S. played against Venezuela, whose Miguel Martinez seldom
left Daly's side, chatting and laughing with the American
throughout the round.
	   Martinez, playing again after three years working on an oil
field in his home country, said he was a big fan of the big man.
	   ``This was one of the greatest days of my life to play with this
guy,'' Martinez said. ``I haven't played for a lot of years and
this is awesome.''

Singapore union umbrella organization to slash co-op prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Seeking to appease workers facing imminent wage
cuts, Singapore's union umbrella organization said Thursday it will
cut dlrs 14 million off its co-op prices and other services.
	   The government-linked National Trades Union Congress, which
represents 78 unions and labor associations, operates a
co-operative supermarket chain, runs health care centers, sells
insurance, grants mortgages and provides other low-cost services.
	   About half of the cuts will be distributed among NTUC's various
co-op services, principally through lowered costs for basic foods
and commodities at NTUC's 65 supermarket branches, which are
effective immediately and valid through June of next year.
	   The remaining price reductions, totaling 11.6 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 7 million), include deferred payment of premiums and
mortgages.
	   ``The National Trades Union Congress notes that the impending
wage cut or even loss of jobs will put a strain on workers,
especially lower income families,'' said the organization in a
statement. ``The group intends to play a part in helping workers
cope with this difficult period.''
	   When Parliament convenes on Monday, the government is widely
expected to endorse a 10 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 6 billion)
package to reduce business costs in recession-hit Singapore.
	   The bulk of the cuts will come from worker's salaries and
pension funds.

For villagers near volcano, rumblings just a way of life

<TEXT>
	   COMALA, Mexico (AP) _ In his 60 years of living on the slopes of
the Colima volcano, Jose Mendez Reyes has seen it all: red hot
rocks setting grass fires as they spiral into fields; his village
awakening under a blanket of whiteness _ crops, animals and houses
covered in volcanic ash.
	   He and 240 others from the villages of Yerba Buena and Juan
Barragan were evacuated Wednesday when the volcano five miles
(eight kilometers) away gave signs of erupting.
	   Still, but most were not scared. It's all part of the price they
pay for the rich soil the volcano brings.
	   ``I've seen worse. ...I've seen it rain rocks like fire,''
Mendez Reyes said as he settled in for the night at a makeshift
shelter in a school in Comala, 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the
peak.
	   The 12,530-foot (3,800-meter) Volcan del Fuego _ Spanish for
Volcano of Fire _ is considered one of the most active and
dangerous volcanoes in North America. The mountain is commonly
known as the Colima Volcano _ though that name sometimes includes
the taller but extinct Nevado de Colima volcano three miles (5
kilometers) to the north.
	   In recent days, volcanologists have recorded thousands of small
tremors in the volcano and have detected chemical changes in waters
near the mountain, 280 miles (450 kilometers) west of Mexico City.
Blocks of rock have tumbled from the peak.
	   Opinions differ about what all this means. After officials flew
over the volcano in a helicopter, the interior ministry said the
volcano's rumbling heralded at worst a new, limited lava flow.
Local radio stations called the evacuations a false alarm.
	   But others aren't so sure.
	   ``I don't think, frankly, that anyone knows what the volcano is
going to do,'' said Jim Luhr, a geologist at the Smithsonian
Institution. ``Many of us believe that Colima is entering a stage
of activity which will probably _ we don't know when _ terminate
with a large explosive eruption like the one that occurred in
1913.''
	   It's hard to gauge the strength of the 1913 blast _ the only
written observations were by Jesuit monks at a nearby monastery _
but it was strong enough to blow out windows and shower ash in
towns miles (kilometers) away.
	   Living under the volcano does take a psychological toll.
	   Alfredo Alcaran Briseno, director of a public school in Comala,
told of how one 14-year-old girl fainted Wednesday morning after
teachers gave volcano warnings.
	   Marcia Fajardo, a 26-year-old mother of two, talked about how
frightened she was when she was awakened at dawn Wednesday and told
to leave Yerba Buena.
	   ``I was afraid, because the volcano was going to cover
everything with lava,'' she said, her 5-year-old daughter Irene
clutching her skirt.

Indonesian Minister says peaceful protests won't harm investment

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protests in Indonesia will not
harm investor confidence as long as the demonstrations are
peaceful, senior Indonesian economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on
rebuilding Indonesia, Ginandjar said ``many countries are
undergoing the same transition to democracy,'' adding that
investors have not fled other these nations.
	   Foreign investment is seen as a key to Indonesia's efforts to
overcome the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Ginandjar was speaking days after deadly clashes between student
protesters and police left as many as 16 people dead, including
eight students.
	   He said the recent student protests do not have a negative
impact on perceptions about Indonesia, but that looting and rioting
would make potential investors nervous.
	   ``We have to separate students protesting with firm belief from
looting and rioting,'' he said. ``If (student protests) are
peaceful, I don't think it will affect confidence.''
	   Riots erupted briefly on Saturday in Jakarta.
	   The violence last week was the worst in the capital since May,
when much heavier rioting and looting helped unseat President
Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Ginandjar said Indonesia's battered economy has begun the
process of recovery, but added that a full-fledged rebound will
take time to achieve.
	   ``The process will not be without setbacks. Some will come from
those seeking to express political will after so many years of
silence,'' he said.
	   The economic official said Indonesia was enjoying a growing
trade surplus and rising levels of machinery investment.
	   The currency, the rupiah, which collapsed last year, has begun
to appreciate against the U.S. dollar and did not drop during last
week's political events, he noted.
	   ``This suggests perhaps more than any other indicator the
markets have recognized our improvement,'' Ginandjar said.

Dollar higher against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices; ADDS 10th graf trader quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in afternoon
trading Thursday after fresh economic data released overnight
showed a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit. Tokyo stocks
declined.
	   The dollar bought 121.83 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.61
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late
level of 121.65 yen overnight in New York.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 244.77 71.52
points, or 1.68 percent, to close at 14,354.46 points. On
Wednesday, the average closed up 186.23 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar was buoyed by the U.S. Commerce
Department's announcement Wednesday that the trade deficit for
September was dlrs 14 billion, down 11.7 percent from a revised
record of dlrs 15.9 billion in August.
	   That led many economists to upgrade their estimates for third
quarter economic growth.
	   But with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled to arrive in
Japan later in the day to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, market players were wary of heightened pressure from
Washington for Japan to get its economy in order.
	   Comments reflecting U.S. displeasure over Japan's bilateral
trade surplus would likely boost expectations of strong action by
Tokyo to help its economy, pushing up the yen, dealers said.
	   ``People are reluctant to buy the dollar further from here.
There is no doubt that Clinton will call for a recovery in Japan's
economy and warn against Japan's widening trade surplus,'' said
Toru Okuni, vice president and chief dealer in the Tokyo office of
Toronto Dominion Bank.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices dropped in thin trading as
investors awaited the outcome of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's efforts to form a coalition.
	   ``The market was in a wait-and-see mode. Buy orders didn't come
in and the indexes moved on the slightest sell orders,'' said Yasuo
Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,104.00. The
TOPIX closed up 5.77 points, or 0.52 percent, the day before.
	   The LDP reportedly plans to form a new political alliance with
the opposition Liberal Party. Obuchi was scheduled to meet with
Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa later Thursday.
	   The LDP has a majority in Japan's powerful lower house of
Parliament, but needs some support from opposition members in the
upper house to ensure swift passage of legislation.
	   Profit-taking caused share prices to dip earlier in the session.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.845 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.830
percent, driving its price down to 108.45 yen from 108.59 yen.

``Slow runnings'' start for Jamaican golf pair

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ World Cup of Golf veteran
Seymour Rose, 58, said the slowed greens of the seaside Gulf Harbor
course made it a difficult first day for him _ 31 years after he
first played his first cup tournament in Mexico City.
	   After practice and pro-am days of criticism for the fast-running
greens, keepers cut them longer, causing Rose problems with his
short game.
	   Seymour fired a first round 80, which tied him third-last on the
64-player field. With playing partner Delroy Cambridge adding a
respectable even 72 to lie 27th in individual standings, the team
made a slow first day start to the tourney, ending tied for
third-last at 152 with Mexico.
	   Tail-enders are Luxembourg (159) and Netherlands (163).
	   A self-taught golfer who turned pro in 1960, Rose said at age 16
he was shooting par rounds on the local nine-hole course, learning
``as you go along. You sort of make sure you copy the guys who are
doing well.''
	   Living in the cricket-mad West Indies meant ``golf was not big
in Jamaica, it never took on among the local people.''
	   But living beside the local course as a kid made its impression.
	   ``I'm straight out of the old school,'' he said when asked why
he responded to the applause of gallery crowds.
	   ``Some of these (other) guys make a nice shot and they never
hear (the applause), y'know. They're there for something
different.''
	   Rose said he was pleased to have gone around with Welsh veteran
Ian Woosnam and teammate Phillip Price.
	   ``It sure helps to play along with these guys,'' Rose said.
	   Being a club superintendant at the Super Club golf club in
Jamaica's Runaway Bay meant he didn't see much international
competition each year.
	   ``I still maintain my (golf) professionalship and I'm still a
pro there. I play on my own course every day _ but it's not
(international) competition.''
	   But Rose remains fiercely proud of representing his country at
what he calls the Olympics of golf.
	   ``You're playing for the country and you want to make yourself s
proud as you can out there,'' he said as stood with sweat
glistening on his face after a tough round.
	   His best performance at a World Cup was a tie for 25th in teams
and a 37th in individual play. He will try again for the Jamaican
team at next year's World Cup in Malaysia. rl-tjh

Lufthansa plane makes emergency landing at Singapore airport

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Lufthansa plane carrying 73 passengers and
crew members made an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi
Airport Thursday after damaging its landing gear on takeoff.
	   ``While it was taking off, it apparently hit the open cover of a
runway light, so this caused some damage to the landing gear,''
Lufthansa senior corporate communications executive Ian de Souza
told The Associated Press.
	   No one was hurt in the incident, he said.
	   Bound for Frankfurt, the Airbus A-340 plane left Singapore at
11:20 a.m. (0320 GMT), but flew for some time before the pilots
realized there was a problem, de Souza said.
	   After the pilots concluded that the landing gear was damaged,
they returned to Singapore and dumped their fuel over the sea
before the emergency landing at 1:35 p.m. (0535 GMT), he said.
	   All the passengers were evacuated immediately after the plane
touched down, said an official of the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore, who confirmed that there were no injuries.
	   Witnesses at the airport said four fire trucks had surrounded
the plane as it sat about two-thirds of the way down one of
Changi's runways.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian politicians are shedding tears
over skyrocketing onion prices with state elections just a week
away, and the voting is widely seen as a referendum on the
popularity of the federal governing coalition that has been in
power less than a year.
	   Though the elections won't directly affect Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee, they could result in a political realignment in
the world's most populous democracy.
	   The run-up to Wednesday's elections for four state assemblies
have been dominated by one issue: high food prices. Devastating
floods that destroyed crops have pushed prices of onions _ a key
ingredient in savory Indian dishes _ and other staples to all-time
highs across India.
	   Few people believe politicians when they say they will bring
down food prices if voted to power. Produce from farms pass through
a complex network of brokers and consumers end up paying four to
five times what the farmer gets. Successive governments have tried
to reform the system in vain.
	   Newspapers are speculating that the Bharatiya Janata Party now
in power in the capital city of New Delhi and in Rajasthan state,
could lose to the Congress local elections in those two areas over
food prices. The Congress, which is in power in the populous
central state of Madhya Pradesh, is riddled with reports of
corruption and is widely expected to lose to the BJP there. The
northeastern state of Mizoram is witnessing contests between
regional groups over mostly local issues.

20th Century Fox pulls out of Thailand for `King and I' remake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with social critic saying opportunity lost, grafs
9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Frustrated by official disapproval over
its script, 20th Century Fox announced Thursday it is dropping
Thailand from plans to shoot a new version of ``Anna and the King''
starring Jodie Foster.
	   Fox said in a statement that shooting for the remake of the
classic films ``Anna and the King of Siam'' and the ``The King and
I'' will be shifted to neighboring Malaysia.
	   The Thai Film Board has twice turned down scripts for the
proposed film, saying that they were disrespectful of 19th century
ruler King Mongkut and the monarchy of Siam, as Thailand was then
known.
	   The remake stars Oscar-winner Foster in the role of Anna
Leonowens, the Victorian governess Mongkut hired to teach his
children English, and Hong Kong action star Chow Yun Fat as the
king.
	   Fox's statement expressed regret over ``excessive bureaucracy
and political red tape. This decision to move production was not
made with any disrespect or outrage.''
	   ``The simple truth is that time has run out,'' Fox said. ``In an
effort to avoid costly delays that could undermine the entire
project, the studio has exercised its ability to change
locations.''
	   Thais highly revere their monarchy and feel previous versions of
the story, based on Leonowens' disputed memoirs, portray Mongkut as
a brutal buffoon rather than the linguist and Buddhist scholar he
was.
	   Insulting the monarchy remains a crime that carries a prison
term of three to 15 years. The current king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, is
the world's longest-reigning monarch, with 52 years on the throne.
	   Sulak Sivaraksa, a social critic twice acquitted of insulting
the monarchy, said that the Film Board had wasted a historic chance
to get inside the project and attempt to influence its accuracy.
	   ``A movie is a movie,'' Sulak said. ``Even stories you have read
in history books are not all correct. You have to use your
intelligence to judge if you will believe the writers.''
	   Though the 1946 version of the film, starring Rex Harrison and
Irene Dunne, was screened in Thailand, the movie of the Broadway
musical starring Yul Brynner a decade later was banned.
	   Fox tried to adapt the current script to get the film made in
Thailand, but industry insiders said after it was rejected again
last week that the Film Board was unlikely ever to approve it owing
to cultural sensitivity.
	   Thipawadee Maenyart, a board official, told The Associated Press
on Thursday that the body had nothing to do with Fox's decision to
move.
	   ``It depends on them,'' Thipawadee said. ``We will look at their
final script if they want to try again. Our duty is to correct what
is inaccurate.''
	   Fox's local coordinators, who contended Thailand could have
influenced the film better if it stayed involved with the shooting,
said they were unaware of the studio's decision, which was
announced in a fax from Beverly Hills.
	   Thais feel that Leonowens exaggerated her memoirs to give
herself a central place in the Siamese court and that in reality
the king probably met her only once. The ``King and I'' scenes
where Deborah Kerr dances with Brynner rankle them as demeaning and
silly.
	   Fox's statement insisted that this time, the film makers wanted
to portray Mongkut in a more historically accurate light. But the
board was unmoved after a revised script was submitted last week.
	   ``The history depicted in `Anna and the King' was due for a
fresher and more honest interpretation,'' Fox said, adding it still
intends to make the film ``with the care and respect it deserves.''
	   Fox is embroiled in a second dispute with Thai authorities over
plans to film a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle, ``The Beach.'' Forestry
officials have ordered shooting on a southern island suspended for
two weeks pending a new review over possible environmental damage.

17 opposition activists banned from leaving Indonesia after

protest &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Seventeen opposition activists who
have been charged or questioned over deadly student protests last
week have been banned from leaving Indonesia, officials said.
	   Security forces fired at protesters who tried to march Friday on
Parliament, where a special government assembly was passing
political reforms that fell short of their demands.
	   Later others, including some police officers, died when rioting
broke out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 16 died. Police say 13 were
killed.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   President B.J. Habibie claimed that some activists had
orchestrated the protests as part of a plan to topple his
6-month-old government.
	   Police rounded up suspects for questioning during the weekend in
the first crackdown on opposition figures since Habibie replaced
Suharto, his mentor.
	   Director General of Immigration Pranowo said 17 people had been
banned from traveling abroad following a police request.
	   Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said 10 suspects had
been formally charged with trying to attack the government. They
could face life in prison if convicted.
	   More could be charged soon, Togar said.

Malaysia pins hopes on sprinter to end medal drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's athletic squad is
pinning its hopes on a powerful sprinter from Borneo Island to end
its decade-long gold medal drought at the Asian Games, a news
report said Thursday.
	   Watson Nyambek, currently the country's fastest runner, will
compete in the 100-meter race in the Dec. 6-20 games in Bangkok,
Thailand, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   A native of Sarawak state in northern Borneo, Nyambek sprinted
to a silver medal at the Asian Track and Field Championships in
Japan this year, finishing in 10.42 seconds.
	   The last time a Malaysian won this event was at the 9th Asian
Games in 1986.
	   Malaysia's other medal hopes in the Asian Games are 100-meter
sprinter G. Shanti and male high jumper Loo Kum Zee.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks.
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders
met to complete preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern
West Bank that is to be carried out by Friday.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent
of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Avner Sinwani said he moved to Ganim, a settlement of 51
families, for a peaceful, rural life-style and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers and
barbed wire. ``If we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think
anyone will want to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told
Israel radio.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has been deeply
divided over the Wye River peace accord under which Israel is to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Thursday's Cabinet session was expected to be stormy. Israel
radio said hawkish Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan was
considering resigning if the pullback was approved Thursday.
	   However, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani of the
centrist Third Way party, was confident that the withdrawal would
go ahead. Kahalani said he understood from the prime minister's
office that the Palestinians had met all their obligations.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel expects
confirmation of:
	   _A Palestinian decree against incitement;
	   _A decree regarding illegal weapons and a plan to be submitted
to the Americans detailing how arms will be collected and stored;
	   _A list of 10 Palestinian fugitives who should be in jail by
Thursday.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians had
kept their commitments. ``I hope that the Israeli Cabinet will not
come up with any excuses today. We fully cooperated with them (the
Israelis) in the past few days, and we expect the same from them,''
Erekat said.
	   In addition to the first troop pullback, Israel is also to
release 250 Palestinian prisoners by Friday. The Palestinians have
complained that most of those on Israel's list were either workers
caught without a work permit in Israel or criminals, rather than
security prisoners. The dispute has not been settled yet.
	   Later Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials are also to
sign a protocol for the opening of a Palestinian international
airport in the Gaza Strip. However, it was not clear whether the
airport would open on Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud
Abbas, and Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon resumed talks for
a final peace treaty. Negotiations had been suspended since May
1996. The talks will open formally with a ceremony next week and
will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab conflict
including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish settlements
and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.

Lufthansa plane makes emergency landing at Singapore airport

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Lufthansa plane carrying 73 passengers and
crew members made an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi
Airport Thursday after damaging its landing gear on takeoff.
	   ``While it was taking off, it apparently hit the open cover of a
runway light, so this caused some damage to the landing gear,''
Lufthansa senior corporate communications executive Ian de Souza
told The Associated Press.
	   No one was hurt in the incident, he said.
	   Bound for Frankfurt, the Airbus A-340 plane left Singapore at
11:20 a.m. (0320 GMT), but flew for some time before the pilots
realized there was a problem, de Souza said.
	   After the pilots concluded that the landing gear was damaged,
they returned to Singapore and dumped their fuel over the sea
before the emergency landing at 1:35 p.m. (0535 GMT), he said.
	   All the passengers were evacuated immediately after the plane
touched down, said an official of the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore, who confirmed that there were no injuries.
	   Witnesses at the airport said four fire trucks had surrounded
the plane as it sat about two-thirds of the way down one of
Changi's runways.
	   De Souza said emergency personnel were replacing several tires
before moving the plane off the runway, which it was blocking.
	   ``Lufthansa Airlines is investigating the cause of the
incident,'' said CAAS spokeswoman Huang Peiling.
	   She added that the pilots had detected a tire burst, but she
could not elaborate on the cause.

Imelda Marcos praises Hawaii court decision on treasure award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos on Thursday praised the Hawaii Supreme Court after it
overturned a dlrs 22 billion judgment against the Marcos estate in
an alleged stolen treasure case.
	   The court ruled Tuesday that the judgment in favor of Filipino
treasure hunter Rogelio Roxas was based on evidence that was too
speculative.
	   Roxas claimed that Marcos had seized a 3-foot (one-meter)
jewelry-stuffed statue of a Buddha and a crate full of gold hidden
by Japanese soldiers during World War II that he had discovered in
a tunnel in northern Baguio City in 1971.
	   ``Once again, the U.S. courts and judicial system work,'' former
first lady Imelda Marcos said in a statement.
	   Mrs. Marcos described as ``ludicrous'' the dlrs 22 billion,
which ballooned with interest to dlrs 43 billion, awarded by a
lower court to Roxas.
	   Roxas had believed the looted treasure was buried by Japanese
troops under Lt. Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita during their occupation of
the Philippines.
	   He said he was jailed after Marcos learned of the discovery and
released after five years of torture. He found the tunnels empty.
	   After Marcos was deposed in 1986 and fled to Hawaii, Roxas sued
him in Honolulu for allegedly stealing the treasure. On the eve of
the trial in 1993, Roxas died mysteriously in the Philippines.
	   Several witnesses testified during the trial that they saw
stacks of gold bars in Malacanang Palace in Manila and the
Marcoses' summer palace, and the late president called it the
``Yamashita treasure.''
	   Another piece of evidence was a 1971 photo of a U.S. Air Force
officer and Roxas flanking a golden Buddha statue.
	   The jury awarded Roxas' estate dlrs 22 billion, one of the
biggest civil jury awards in history.
	   The high court ordered another hearing to determine the value of
the golden Buddha statue and the single crate of gold that Roxas
opened. They originally were valued at about dlrs 1.4 million.
	   The court also upheld a dlrs 6 million award to Roxas for being
assaulted and falsely imprisoned.
	   ``It's devastating. It's not every day that you lose dlrs 43
billion,'' said lawyer Daniel Cathcart, who represents the estate
for Roxas.

Israeli helicopters strike suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships attacked
suspected Hezbollah guerrilla bases in south Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said Thursday.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, had
no word of casualties in the air raid at 11:30 p.m. (21:30 gmt)
Wednesday on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Zibqine
and Jibal al-Boutoum.
	   The valley, near the southern port of Tyre, is believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas seeking to force Israel from the
occupation zone it has maintained in Lebanon since 1985.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israel carried out an air raid after
Hezbollah detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was
traveling near the Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   While Hezbollah claimed it caused casualties among the Israeli
troops, Lebanese security officials said they were unaware anyone
was wounded.
	   The repeated Israeli attacks come at a time of heightened
tension in the region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near
the Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   Hezbollah leads the campaign to oust about 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 of their Lebanese militia allies from the occupation zone
that Israel maintains is needed to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.

Head of Buddhist order drops re-election bid after rival monks
</HEADLINE>
clash &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with head monk withdrawing bid for third term, grafs
1-3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The head of South Korea's largest
Buddhist order dropped his bid for a third term after a violent
clash between his supporters and rival monks Thursday.
	   ``As the head of the order, I take responsibility for the
current situation. I decided to cancel my bid for the sake of
Korean Buddhism,'' said Song Wol-ju, head of the Chogye order.
	   Song's current term ends Friday and the order will be led by
deputy monks until a new head is elected. The election, scheduled
for last Thursday, was postponed and a new election date has not
been set.
	   Earlier Thursday, seven shorn-headed, gray-clad monks were
injured in a clash between rival factions for control of Chogye
temple in central Seoul.
	   The melee began when about 20 monks, armed with helmets and
shields and aided by 100 hired bodyguards, stormed the five-story,
pagoda-shaped headquarters of the temple.
	   Fifty rival monks holed up inside the building fought back by
hurling down fire extinguishers and furniture and spraying water
from hoses, repelling the invaders in a half-hour battle.
	   The temple grounds were strewn with smashed window panes and
burned furniture and garbage. Police said the injured were
hospitalized with minor head and other injuries.
	   The leadership dispute in Chogye erupted last week when Song
announced his bid for a third four-year term.
	   His opponents, including the order's spiritual leader, Wol Ha,
83, urged him to step down, accusing him of incompetence and
corruption. When he refused, they raided the temple, the
denomination's headquarters, and took control.
	   Thursday's raiders were supporters of Song, who has been trying
in vain to regain control of the temple.
	   Song has accused his opponents of trying to block his efforts to
reform the 1,000-year-old order.
	   Chogye, which emphasizes zen meditation, claims 8 million
worshipers. South Korea has a population of 44 million.

Japan's top automakers suffer domestic slump in recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domestic auto production and sales at Japan's
leading automakers in October fell from year-earlier levels, hurt
by the economic recession at home and in Southeast Asia.
	   Japan's No. 1 automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. said domestic
production fell 12.1 percent to 285,576 vehicles, as sales slumped
17 percent to 141,897. At Nissan Motor Co., production fell 6.4
percent to 129,094, and sales tumbled 14 percent to 61,857.
	   Honda Motor Co. said its output fell 3.7 percent to 114,714, as
sales sank 20.4 percent to 55,794. And Mazda Motor Corp. said its
production declined 5.9 percent to 68,789, as sales skidded 7.1
percent to 22,631 vehicles.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was the one bright spot among the top
five automakers, reporting increases in both production and sales.
Mitsubishi's output rose 11.5 percent to 104,837 vehicles, as sales
also rose 11.5 percent to 45,348 vehicles.
	   Exports were not much better in October.
	   Toyota said exports declined 13 percent as shipments to Europe
and Asia fell. The company's overseas production, however, rose 20
percent thanks to steadily expanding output at its operations in
the United States, Canada and Britain.
	   Nissan said its exports were flat from a year earlier. Exports
to Oceania and the Middle East rose, while exports to Asia, Latin
America, Europe and North America fell.
	   Overseas production tumbled 16.8 percent because of inventory
adjustments in North America and Mexico, as well as weak sales in
Asia.
	   Honda said its exports rose 1.1 percent, helped by favorable
demand for the CR-V sports utility model and the Accord in North
America. Overseas output increased 9.1 percent.
	   Mazda exports tumbled 15.8 percent, dropping for the first time
in four months. A spokeswoman for Mazda attributed the drop to
falling exports to Asia and North America, where shipments were
held up because of shipping-related matters.
	   Mitsubishi's exports in October rose, climbing 1.3 percent.
Overseas production fell 23.7 percent as production in Asia and the
United States declined.

Myanmar to issue high denomination banknote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The Central Bank of Myanmar will put
1,000-kyat banknotes into circulation beginning Nov. 25, state-run
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The new notes will be the highest denomination banknotes in
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   The 1,000-kyat note _ worth about dlrs 160 at the official rate
of exchange, but only about dlrs 3.10 on the free market _ is green
with a lion as its main motif.
	   The existing banknotes and coins in denominations of one, five,
10, 20, 45, 50, 90, 100 and 500 kyat will continue to be legal
tender.
	   The 20-, 50-, 100- and 500-kyat notes issued in 1994 also have a
lion as their main motif, unlike earlier notes that have Myanmar's
independence hero, Gen. Aung San, and two other patriots pictured
on them.
	   Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a bitter critic
of the current military regime, is the late Aung San's daughter.

Copper miners stay underground to protest unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some 150 miners barricaded themselves
deep in their copper mine in western Romania to protest unpaid
wages, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
	   The miners went down the Gura Barza mine Wednesday afternoon and
spent the night 200 meters (660 feet) underground near the city of
Deva, Sorina Buda, a spokeswoman for Deva Cooper Mine, said by
telephone.
	   ``We have promises from Bucharest that the money will come but
we do not know when,'' Buda said from the city, some 300 kilometers
(188 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   Some 800 miners are employed at the Gura Barza mine.
	   Miners have only been paid 60 percent of their October salary.
Salaries are often paid late in Romania because many companies are
owed money from other companies.
	   The miners vowed to stay underground until all their arrears are
paid. Copper miners make an average of 1.7 million lei (dlrs 170) a
month, about 40 percent higher than the average salary in Romania.

Amnesty International condemns government, rebels for civilian
</HEADLINE>
deaths &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Burundi's Tutsi-controlled military has
killed hundreds of innocent civilians, and Hutu rebel groups have
wrongly killed dozens more in a fifth year of civil strife, a human
rights group said Thursday.
	   Amnesty International called on both sides to stop killing
people not involved in the hostilities and to respect international
law.
	   ``The main target of the Burundian army has been the Hutu
civilian population,'' the London-based group said in a report.
	   ``The various Hutu-dominated armed opposition groups and other
militias ... have killed scores of unarmed civilians,'' it said. In
some cases, Hutu rebels have killed or ill-treated Hutu civilians
as punishment for their alleged cooperation with government forces,
the report said.
	   The report charged government soldiers with killing hundreds of
Hutu men, women and children, mostly in retaliation for Hutu rebel
attacks; torturing and executing without trial Hutu suspects in
detention; and raping women in camps for those displaced by
fighting.
	   It said most of the killings occurred in areas of heavy
fighting, making verification of events difficult.
	   Amnesty International said government soldiers wrongly killed at
least 165 Hutu civilians in the Mutumba commune, south Bujumbura,
on Nov. 3 in retaliation for a rebel attack a few days earlier.
	   The government, acknowledging the wrongful deaths of 56
civilians, has since apologized for the killings, ordered an
investigation and arrested three soldiers in the case.
	   Hutu rebels have been fighting to topple the government of
President Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi and retired army officer, who took
power in a coup in 1996.
	   Buyoya has promised to stem the ethnic violence that has wracked
Burundi since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu, in
1993.
	   Since then more than 200,000 people have died. Peace talks,
which began in June, resulted in a cease-fire that failed.
	   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the escalating
violence in Burundi, and called for a cease-fire and swift
punishment for those responsible for recent killings.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks.
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders
met to complete preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern
West Bank that is to be carried out by Friday.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent
of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Avner Sinwani said he moved to Ganim, a settlement of 51
families, for a peaceful, rural life-style and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers and
barbed wire. ``If we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think
anyone will want to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told
Israel radio.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has been deeply
divided over the Wye River peace accord under which Israel is to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Thursday's Cabinet session was expected to be stormy. Israel
radio said hawkish Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan was
considering resigning if the pullback was approved Thursday.
	   However, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani of the
centrist Third Way party, was confident that the withdrawal would
go ahead. Kahalani said he understood from the prime minister's
office that the Palestinians had met all their obligations.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians had
kept their commitments. ``I hope that the Israeli Cabinet will not
come up with any excuses today. We fully cooperated with them (the
Israelis) in the past few days, and we expect the same from them,''
Erekat said.
	   In addition to the first troop pullback, Israel is also to
release 250 Palestinian prisoners by Friday. The Palestinians have
complained that most of those on Israel's list were either workers
caught without a work permit in Israel or criminals, rather than
security prisoners. The dispute has not been settled yet.
	   Later Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials are also to
sign a protocol for the opening of a Palestinian international
airport in the Gaza Strip. However, it was not clear whether the
airport would open on Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud
Abbas, and Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon resumed talks for
a final peace treaty. Negotiations had been suspended since May
1996. The talks will open formally with a ceremony next week and
will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab conflict
including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish settlements
and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.

Israeli helicopters strike suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES cycle designator, CLARIFIES that helicopters strafed
area, details on damage

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships attacked
suspected Hezbollah guerrilla bases in south Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said Thursday.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, had
no word of casualties in the strafing runs during which the
aircraft fired 60mm cannon shells at 11:30 p.m. (21:30 gmt)
Wednesday on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Zibqine
and Jibal al-Boutoum.
	   The valley, near the southern port of Tyre, is believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas seeking to force Israel from the
occupation zone it has maintained in Lebanon since 1985.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israel carried out an air raid after
Hezbollah detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was
traveling near the Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   While Hezbollah claimed it caused casualties among the Israeli
troops, Lebanese security officials said they were unaware anyone
was wounded.
	   The repeated Israeli attacks come at a time of heightened
tension in the region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near
the Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   Hezbollah leads the campaign to oust about 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 of their Lebanese militia allies from the occupation zone
that Israel maintains is needed to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.

ACB delays decision on Hair calling Sri Lankan matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board (ACB)
postponed Thursday a decision on whether umpire Darrell Hair should
officiate in limited-overs matches involving Sri Lanka this season.
	   Sri Lankan cricket authorities have asked the ACB to ban Hair
from umpiring their matches in the triangular one-day tournament
also involving Australia and England starting in January.
	   The ACB held a directors' meeting Thursday where Hair's recently
published book, ``The Decision Maker,'' was discussed.
	   In the book, Hair details the furor that surrounded his calls of
no balls on Sri Lankan offspinner Muttiah Muralidharan for throwing
in the December 1995 test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   Hair described Muralidharan's bowling action as ``diabolical''
and wrote he would no ball the offspinner again should he deem his
action illegal.
	   ACB chairman Denis Rogers said the board considered a report on
the book at Thursday's meeting from chief executive officer Malcolm
Speed.
	   He said the board had sought further advice on the matter from
the International Cricket Council (ICC).
	   ``We received a preliminary report on the publication from
Malcolm Speed and considered letters exchanged between the board of
cricket control for Sri Lanka and the ICC,'' Rogers said.
	   Muralidharan was called for no balls for throwing by Hair seven
times in a three-over period in the 1995 Test.
	   Following the tour of Australia, International Cricket Council
experts assessed the Sri Lankan's action and approved it. He has
not been no-balled for throwing since. (djp)

Japan sends up seventh rocket in scientific experiment series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan launched a small rocket 260 kilometers (161
miles) into space Thursday, the seventh such launch since 1991 in a
series of scientific experiments.
	   The TR-1A rocket lifted off at 8 a.m. (2300 GMT Wednesday) from
Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, the Japanese space
agency said.
	   The launch originally was scheduled for September, but was
postponed after dew condensation was found on an experimental
device that was to be sent up aboard the rocket.
	   As scheduled, the rocket splashed down in the Pacific 13 minutes
and 40 seconds after liftoff, agency spokesman Yasuyuki Fukumuro
said.
	   Among the experiments conducted during the flight was a study of
the growth of crystals from several metals by applying lasers to
them under near zero gravity conditions in a newly developed
``static floating furnace,'' Fukumuro said.
	   The TR-1A rockets used in the seven experimental flights cost
600 million yen (dlrs 5.0 million), are 13.44 meters (44 feet) long
and have a radius of 1.13 meters (4 feet).
	   The equipment carried this time cost 1.3 billion yen (dlrs 10.7
million), Fukumuro said.
	   Fukumuro said data obtained from the experiments using the TR-1A
rockets will be applied to further experiments planned aboard a
future space station.
	   Japan's space program has been plagued by a series of
embarrassments. Most recently, a small prototype of an unmanned
space shuttle sank after splashing down in the Pacific in February
1996.
	   Tanegashima Space Center is about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles)
southwest of Tokyo.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Terry Price and England's
David Howell will take a one-shot lead into Friday's second round
of the Australian PGA golf championship at Sydney's New South Wales
course.
	   The pair both birdied the last two holes Thursday to shoot
3-under-par 69s and lead by one stroke over Trinidad's Stephen
Ames, who shot a 70 in the worst of the fierce southeasterly wind
which lashed the course.
	   A shot further back are Australian Anthony Gaunt and Englishman
Anthony Wall.
	   Showing how tough it was on the wind-lashed links course, 42
players in the 150-man field failed to break 80 and among the many
to struggle were Scotland's Raymond Russell with a 77 and New
Zealander Michael Long with 81.
	   Tour veteran Rodger Davis of Australia launched a blast at
officials, claiming they'd made conditions too tough in the opening
round.
	   Davis played in the worst of the morning wind and rallied
strongly from five-over to finish at 74, level with playing partner
and pre-tournament favorite Peter Lonard.
	   But he may have risked a fine with some of his comments later,
still clearly upset at seeing staff rolling the greens before
players hit off.
	   He said the greens were too fast on a course where there is
often strong wind and several of the greens are exposed and
severely sloped and questioned why they should be made even harder.
	   ``The guys are idiots, they are going to cost us another
tournament here,'' said Davis, calling for the greens to be
``saturated'' with water. (djp)

occupation zone it has maintained in Lebanon since 1985.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israel carried out an air raid after
Hezbollah detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was
traveling near the Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   While Hezbollah claimed it caused casualties among the Israeli
troops, Lebanese security officials said they were unaware anyone
was wounded.
	   The repeated Israeli attacks come at a time of heightened
tension in the region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near
the Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   Hezbollah leads the campaign to oust about 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 of their Lebanese militia allies from the occupation zone
that Israel maintains is needed to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.

Indonesian president warns of more chaos if reforms fail

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Thursday that civil unrest could escalate and threaten national
unity if student protesters prevent his government from passing
promised political reforms.
	   ``We are running against time,'' Habibie said. ``Concrete
measures have to be taken immediately.''
	   The warning came after clashes last week between protesters who
want faster democratic change and military forces trying to stop
them from marching into the country's Parliament building. The
violence triggered riots elsewhere in Jakarta, and as many as 16
people died.
	   Angered by the fatal shooting of students by the military,
protesters staged more demonstrations Thursday.
	   About 500 students and others marched toward the home of former
President Suharto in the exclusive Jakarta suburb where he has
become a virtual recluse since his ouster in May.
	   ``Suharto has robbed Indonesia's rich economy for decades. Now
we have to take back the property for the people,'' said protest
organizer Aset.
	   The military has pledged to protect the former authoritarian
leader and has sealed off streets near his house since he quit.
	   Soldiers with riot shields and sticks formed a roadblock
Thursday near the U.S. ambassador's residence, which is near
Suharto's house, to halt the demonstrators.
	   On Wednesday, several thousand students streamed through the
capital and laid flowers outside the gates of the heavily guarded
Parliament. Students on Thursday did the same outside the Atma Jaya
university, the scene of most of last week's violence.
	   Habibie, who has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system
set up by Suharto, said it was vital for the government to
implement a dozen reforms passed by the nation's highest
legislative body.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, filled with holdovers from
Suharto's authoritarian era, approved the decrees Friday in a
session marred by violence on the streets. Students suspect the
assembly wants to stall democratic reform.
	   ``The stakes are very great,'' Habibie said in prepared remarks
distributed by his office. If reforms fail, he said, ``it will not
be an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark riots in May that led
to the ouster of Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Chief among Habibie's reforms is a plan to hold Parliamentary
elections in May or June 1999, which he has promised would be
conducted impartially. Still, suspicions abound that the ruling
Golkar party will try to dominate the electoral machinery as it has
in previous years.
	   ``We will be able to witness together which forces will win the
support of the people and which ones will not,'' Habibie said.
``The government has resolved to conduct a really honest, just and
democratic general election.''
	   The reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly that passed them and is now
sitting in its own right.
	   The assembly did not heed student demands that the military be
banned from politics. Instead, it chose to gradually reduce the
number of appointed Parliament seats held by the armed forces from
the current quota of 75.
	   Students also want Suharto tried on charges of corruption and
human rights abuses, but the assembly chose only to name Suharto in
an anti-corruption decree. The measure could bolster an
investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   The newspaper Republika reported Thursday that the government is
investigating whether it can seize a cattle ranch near Jakarta that
is owned by Suharto. Local villagers have laid claim to the land.
	   Police announced Wednesday they had charged 10 opposition
activists, including two retired generals, with orchestrating last
week's violence in a bid to topple Habibie's government. If
convicted, they could be imprisoned for life.
	   Opposition figures and students have demanded that military
chief Gen. Wiranto resign in the wake of the shootings. Hundreds of
people were injured.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said autopsies on the bodies of some of the eight students
who died showed some had been killed by live ammunition.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jorge Rodas' penalty kick helped Guatemala
defeat Mexico 3-2 Wednesday night to win the championship game of
Project Soccer Relief '98, a soccer tournament to benefit the
Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Rodas was among five Guatemalans to convert their penalty kicks
after the two teams tied, 2-2, in regulation. Mexico made four of
five penalty kicks, with Joel Sanchez missing wide left.
	   Mexico's Luis Hernandez began the scoring with a penalty kick in
the 75th minute, but Juan Carlos Plata tied the score two minutes
later with his own penalty kick.
	   Plata then gave Guatemala a 2-1 lead in the 79th minute when his
12-yard (10-meter) header bounced inside the left post.
	   Sanchez forced the tie in the 83rd minute with another penalty
kick.
	   Guatemala went on to secure the victory in front of 27,891 fans
at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
	   Before the final game, Honduras battled El Salvador to a 2-1
victory for third place in the tournament.
	   Pineda headed Cesar Obando's 23-yard (21-meter) free kick, and
redirected the ball into the upper left corner of the net in the
81st minute.
	   Obando scored the game's first goal on a penalty kick in the 4th
minute, but Israel Castro tied the score on a 20-yard (18-meter)
shot in the 49th minute.
	   Proceeds from the tournament will go to CARE, an international
relief agency.
	   Anne Moran, CARE's executive director for the Southwest United
States, said the agency expects to raise about dlrs 500,000 from
gate receipts, television revenues and contributions from the
tournament.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS UP with late dollar, bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reports that the ruling party had found a coalition
partner, considered good news for Japan's economy, pushed the U.S.
dollar down against the yen Thursday. Tokyo stocks fell in
lackluster trading.
	   The dollar bought 120.64 yen in late afternoon, down 0.58 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also lower than its late level of
121.65 yen overnight in New York.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 244.77 points,
or 1.68 percent, closing at 14,354.46. On Wednesday, it had gained
186.23 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   The dollar climbed for much of the day, but its gains were wiped
out in one hour on news that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
had reached a coalition deal with the opposition Liberal Party,
analysts said.
	   The LDP has a majority in Japan's powerful lower house of
Parliament, but needs some support from opposition members in the
upper house to ensure the approval of crucial economic revival
bills.
	   The agreement also raised hopes for a cut in Japan's unpopular
consumption tax, which the Liberal Party has been urging. Many
analysts see a consumption tax reduction as the most effective way
to boost domestic demand and jump start the economy.
	   As U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Japan to meet with
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, investors were also wary of heightened
pressure from Washington for Japan to get its economy in order.
	   Comments reflecting U.S. displeasure over Japan's trade surplus
would likely boost expectations of strong action by Tokyo to help
its economy, pushing up the yen, dealers said.
	   ``There is no doubt that Clinton will call for a recovery in
Japan's economy and warn against Japan's widening trade surplus,''
said Toru Okuni, vice president and chief dealer in the Tokyo
office of Toronto Dominion Bank.
	   The dollar had gained earlier on fresh trade data that boosted
confidence in the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department announced
Wednesday that the trade deficit for September was dlrs 14 billion,
down 11.7 percent from a revised record of dlrs 15.9 billion in
August.
	   That led many economists to upgrade their estimates for
third-quarter economic growth.
	   The dollar ranged between 120.42 yen and 122.24 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices dropped in thin trading as
investors awaited the outcome of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's efforts to form a coalition, and some took profits. The
reported coalition agreement was concluded after the stock market
closed.
	   ``The market was in a wait-and-see mode. Buy orders didn't come
in and the indexes moved on the slightest sell orders,'' said Yasuo
Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, at 1,104.00. It
had gained 5.77 points, or 0.52 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 515 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 477.90 million
Wednesday. Retreats outnumbered advances 659 to 492, while 142
issues were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.850 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.830
percent, driving its price down to 108.40 yen from 108.59 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world
rose for a 19th straight month in October, surging 23.9 percent
compared to a year ago, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a measure of goods which pass
customs, grew to a non-seasonally adjusted 1.37 trillion yen (dlrs
11.33 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus was slightly higher than the 1.32 trillion yen (dlrs
10.93 billion) average forecast of Tokyo-based economists surveyed
by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The growth in the trade surplus was expected to continue in the
coming months, said a Finance Ministry official who declined to be
named.
	   The steady climb in the surplus reflects consumers' reluctance
to spend amid Japan's worst recession in decades. That has cut
demand for imports and made Japanese manufacturers increasingly
reliant on sales overseas.
	   Despite the continued expansion in the trade surplus, the
ministry said exports fell 5.7 percent in October _ the first
year-on-year drop in five months.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ South Korean carmaker Hyundai has
agreed to repair as many as 46,000 of its Excel cars sold in
Australia which might have a faulty suspension.
	   The cars, which were made in South Korea between August 1994 and
March 1996, could have defects in underbody welds.
	   The Australian government took an interest in the case after
local auto clubs complained that the company was not prepared to
recall the cars. The company said last week it would not be
railroaded into taking inappropriate action.
	   However, Transport Minister John Anderson issued a statement
Thursday saying Hyundai has now agreed to fix any vehicle that
might have a problem.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Continued student protests in
Indonesia won't harm investor confidence if they are peaceful,
senior economic minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on
rebuilding Indonesia, Ginandjar said ``many countries are
undergoing the same transition to democracy.''
	   He added that this hasn't led to a loss of investor confidence
in those places.
	   Ginandjar was speaking days after deadly clashes between student
protesters and police left as many as 16 people dead, including
eight students.
	   The minister said student protests didn't have the same effect
on investors' perceptions of Indonesia as looting and rioting.
	   ``We have to separate students protesting with firm belief from
looting and rioting,'' he said. ``If (student protests) are
peaceful, I don't think it will affect confidence.''
	   Riots erupted briefly on Saturday in Jakarta.
	   The violence last week was the worst in the capital since May,
when much heavier rioting and looting helped unseat President
Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Foreign investment is seen as a key to Indonesia's efforts to
overcome the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   ``The recovery process has started but it will be long and
slow,'' Ginandjar said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Solid Group Inc., a consumer
electronics product manufacturer, said Thursday it will close an
audio products factory because of falling demand, particularly for
Sony Corp. brands.
	   The audio plant in Quezon City, which will be closed Nov. 30, is
a joint venture between Solid Group and Japan's Sony Corp.
	   Solid Group said another subsidiary, Solid Laguna Corp., will
take over the production shortfall that may result from the closure
of the audio products factory. The company also assembles Aiwa Co.
brands.
	   It did not say how many workers will be affected by the closure.
	   In 1997, Solid Group sold 65,000 units of Sony audio products.
This year, the company had reported that sales dropped by a third
mainly due to the economic crisis.
	   Sales of home appliances and electronic products in the
Philippines dropped 17 percent in the first half of this year to
2.14 million units from 2.58 million during the same period in 1997
primarily due to the 17-month-old Asian financial crisis.
	   Sales of colored television were hardest hit, falling 35 percent
from 304,900 units to 425,700 units during the same period, mainly
due to competition from cheap secondhand TVs from Japan, South
Korea, China, Taiwan and Singapore.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domestic auto production and sales at Japan's
leading automakers in October fell from year-earlier levels, hurt
by the economic recession at home and in Southeast Asia.
	   Japan's No. 1 automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. said domestic
production fell 12.1 percent to 285,576 vehicles, as sales slumped
17 percent to 141,897. At Nissan Motor Co., production fell 6.4
percent to 129,094, and sales tumbled 14 percent to 61,857.
	   Honda Motor Co. said its output fell 3.7 percent to 114,714, as
sales sank 20.4 percent to 55,794. And Mazda Motor Corp. said its
production declined 5.9 percent to 68,789, as sales skidded 7.1
percent to 22,631 vehicles.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was the one bright spot among the top
five automakers, reporting increases in both production and sales.
Mitsubishi's output rose 11.5 percent to 104,837 vehicles, as sales
also rose 11.5 percent to 45,348 vehicles.
	   Exports were not much better in October.
	   Toyota said exports declined 13 percent as shipments to Europe
and Asia fell. The company's overseas production, however, rose 20
percent thanks to steadily expanding output at its operations in
the United States, Canada and Britain.
	   Nissan said its exports were flat from a year earlier. Exports
to Oceania and the Middle East rose, while exports to Asia, Latin
America, Europe and North America fell.
	   Overseas production tumbled 16.8 percent because of inventory
adjustments in North America and Mexico, as well as weak sales in
Asia.
	   Honda said its exports rose 1.1 percent, helped by favorable
demand for the CR-V sports utility model and the Accord in North
America. Overseas output increased 9.1 percent.
	   Mazda exports tumbled 15.8 percent, dropping for the first time
in four months. A spokeswoman for Mazda attributed the drop to
falling exports to Asia and North America, where shipments were
held up because of shipping-related matters.
	   Mitsubishi's exports in October rose, climbing 1.3 percent.
Overseas production fell 23.7 percent as production in Asia and the
United States declined.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The Central Bank of Myanmar will put
1,000-kyat banknotes into circulation beginning Nov. 25, state-run
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The new notes will be the highest denomination banknotes in
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   The 1,000-kyat note _ worth about dlrs 160 at the official rate
of exchange, but only about dlrs 3.10 on the free market _ is green
with a lion as its main motif.
	   The existing banknotes and coins in denominations of one, five,
10, 20, 45, 50, 90, 100 and 500 kyat will continue to be legal
tender.
	   The 20-, 50-, 100- and 500-kyat notes issued in 1994 also have a
lion as their main motif, unlike earlier notes that have Myanmar's
independence hero, Gen. Aung San, and two other patriots pictured
on them.
	   Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a bitter critic
of the current military regime, is the late Aung San's daughter.

Leading opposition politician denies reports of extramarital
</HEADLINE>
affair &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's most popular opposition politician on
Thursday denied Japanese media reports of an extramarital affair
and threatened to take action against the magazines that carried
the reports.
	   Democratic Party head Naoto Kan said in a statement released by
his party that his relationship with a 32-year-old TV newscaster,
reported in some recent tabloid magazines, was purely business.
	   She has been advising him on media affairs, said Kan, 52,
considered the public's favorite for next prime minister. ``It is
nothing beyond that,'' he said.
	   Kan said he would announce next week what action he planned to
take against the magazines.
	   But he apologized for having hurt those around him by not being
more careful with his actions. He also said he talked about the
matter with his wife.
	   ``She told me I didn't have my guard up enough to start with,
and she called me an idiot,'' Kan said.
	   Kan has long boasted a cleaner, more grassroots image than the
old-style ruling party lawmakers.
	   His relatively new party, the Democrats, who also include former
ruling party lawmakers, made key advances in the last election,
held in the summer.
	   The fact that reports of an alleged affair are being viewed as
possibly damaging may be a sign that Japanese politics has slowly
become more responsive to public opinion.
	   For decades, it was assumed that politicians, or rich successful
men in general, had affairs and mistresses, and their wives were
supposed to accept that.

Hong Kong shares close higher on possible rates cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks ended higher Thursday amid
expectations that local interest rates are about to be cut.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 99.88 points, or 1 percent,
closing at 10,313.30. On Wednesday, it had climbed 64.73 points.
	   Turnover was worth 7.141 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
915 million), down from 8.40 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.1 billion) in the previous session.
	   Many investors were holding back to wait for Friday's meeting of
the Hong Kong Association of Banks, a group that sets the savings
deposit interest rate for Hong Kong.
	   The association is expected to cut the rate, following this
week's easing of rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority.
	   The market's biggest gainers were HSBC Holdings, which rose 1.50
Hong Kong dollars to 181.50; Hang Seng Bank, up 1.50 to 68.00; and
Sun Hung Kai Properties, up 1.75 to 57.25.
	   China Light lost 0.70 to 40.40, while conglomerate Swire Pacific
``A'' lost 0.20 to 35.50.
	   Hong Kong's big air carrier, Cathay Pacific, remained unchanged
at 7.30.

Two old foes meet in Chase Championship quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bad luck at the season-ending Chase
Championships is no stranger to Monica Seles.
	   ``I just had terrible luck here the last four years,'' she said.
``'95, I couldn't play. '96, I had to default in the match. Last
year it was one of the worst matches of my career.''
	   Thursday, Seles' quarterfinal opponent is Steffi Graf.
	   They are two veteran warriors, although Seles is only 24, four
years younger that Graf. Both have been ranked No. 1. Both have
dominated women's tennis at one time. Both have won numerous Grand
Slam tournaments.
	   And both are on the comeback trail.
	   ``We probably would have played each other a lot more often,''
Seles said of her matchup against Graf, leaving unsaid the fact
that both have been hampered the last few years by injuries and
personal problems. ``That is a tough one to say. What is in the
past, I don't think about.
	   ``I just hope I can show up tomorrow and give it my best shot.''
	   Seles set up the date with Graf by overcoming an upset stomach
and a stubborn but erratic Anna Kournikova 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday.
	   The first round was wrapped up Wednesday when top-seeded Lindsay
Davenport rallied to beat Sandrine Testud of France 4-6, 7-6 (7-4),
6-0 and No. 6 Mary Pierce of France crushed South African Amanda
Coetzer 6-1, 6-0.
	   Two unseeded players kick off the quarterfinals tonight when
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium takes on Romania's Irina Spirlea. In
their first-round matches, Van Roost knocked off seventh-seeded
Conchita Martinez of Spain and Spirlea upset No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario of Spain.
	   The other quarterfinals _ Davenport against No. 8 Nathalie
Tauziat of France and No. 2 Martina Hingis of Switzerland against
Pierce _ will be played on Friday, with the semifinals set for
Saturday afternoon and the unique best-of-5-sets final on Sunday.
	   Seles was able to concentrate on tennis again after her father
died earlier this year. Earlier this week, she was named the Corel
WTA Tour's ``Comeback Player of the Year.''
	   But misfortune again struck at the Championships.
	   ``I felt really good in Philadelphia,'' she said of the Advanta
Championships last week, where she reached the semis. ``I felt
really good coming in, and then it is just unfortunate that that
had to happen now. ... I have been really sick really since Sunday
afternoon.''
	   Against Kournikova, Seles was almost perfect for the first three
games, losing just one point, and that coming on a double-fault.
After that, the two were locked in a fault-filled contest that
neither player seemed able to win. It was an error _ a backhand
service return that sailed long _ that ended the match as Seles
held serve. In between, there were 10 breaks of service in the 19
games.
	   ``I was lucky to pull it out,'' Seles said. ``I wasn't sure how
I am going to play. I just said, give it my best shot.''
	   Kournikova hurt her cause with 17 double-faults, including five
in one game.
	   Davenport was two points from defeat when she rallied to beat
Testud.
	   ``Winning when you're not playing great. Thursday was a great
example of that,'' Davenport said.
	   With her right leg heavily bandaged, Testud showed no signs of
the injury that forced her to retire from a first-round match a
week ago in Philadelphia. She seemed to be in the right place at
the right time to return Davenport's shots. And Testud replied with
winners.
	   She captured the first set and led 5-4, 15-30 in the second, two
points from a quarterfinal meeting with her French Fed Cup
teammate. She never made it.
	   Davenport survived. She took the next three points with two
winners and an unreturnable serve. That made it 5-5, and after the
two traded service breaks, they went to the tiebreak.
	   ``It wasn't looking too good in the first two sets,'' Davenport
admitted. ``My game was pretty bad.''
	   Testud wasn't through, however, building a 3-1 lead in the
tiebreak. It was then that Davenport rediscovered the game that has
taken her to No. 1 in the world.
	   ``The whole match just turned after the tiebreaker,'' she said.
	   The top-seeded team of Hingis and Jana Novotna was upset
Wednesday by Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia and Caroline Vis of the
Netherlands 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Hingis and Novotna won the doubles in
three of the four Grand Slam tournaments this year, the only three
in which they played together.

President of scandal-tainted NEC vows to restore company image
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 3-4 to UPDATE with agency chief hinting he
will resign Friday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Struggling to restore its image after a defense
contract scandal, Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. announced
Thursday it will create a special inspection office to prevent
further abuses.
	   Thirteen officials at NEC and two affiliates have been arrested
on suspicion of overcharging Japan's Defense Agency in equipment
contracts. The company also has acknowledged overbilling Japan's
space agency.
	   At a separate news conference Thursday, the head of the Defense
Agency hinted he would resign Friday, an agency spokesman said.
	   In Japan, leaders are often expected to resign to take
responsibility for scandals, and agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga,
although not directly implicated in the scandal, has been under
pressure to resign.
	   NEC President Hisashi Kaneko told reporters that the new
``inspection headquarters'' will be under his direct control and
will be set up early next year.
	   ``It is our duty to embark on the difficult road of restoring
the company's reputation,'' Kaneko said.
	   Kaneko also said NEC will request that the Defense Agency and
the National Space Development Agency allow a neutral third party
to study how much NEC should reimburse them for the overbilling.
	   Kaneko warded off speculation that he would resign over the
scandal, saying that it was his responsibility to ensure the
company reforms itself and regains the trust of shareholders and
the public.
	   NEC Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto has stepped down to take
responsibility over the scandal, although he has said he was not
directly involved in it.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
the Defense Agency totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 13.9
million).
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested on
suspicion of allowing the inflated billings in exchange for cushy
jobs at NEC-linked companies for retiring agency officials.
	   NEC says it overbilled NASDA 2.3 billion yen (dlrs 19 million)
between late 1993 and early 1998.
	   NEC, Japan's largest PC maker, is the world's second-largest
computer chip maker after Intel Corp. It owns more than 50 percent
of California-based Packard Bell NEC, which controls about 10
percent of the world's computer market.

Aid to regional governor killed in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unknown gunmen shot and killed an aide to the
governor of Russia's Kemerovo region in Moscow, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Alexander Gontov, a coal industry adviser to Kemerovo Governor
Aman Tuleyev, was found by his wife in the entrance to his
apartment building Wednesday evening, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Gontov, who also sat on the board of directors of a bank, was
shot in the head several times with an AK-47 rifle, the report
said.
	   A number of government aides and prominent businessmen have been
killed in similar incidents in recent years. Police often say the
deaths are contract killings, an increasingly common way of
settling business disputes in Russia. The killers are rarely
caught.

Seven rescued but 10 missing after ship sinks off Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seven Burmese seamen were rescued after
their freighter sank in rough seas off western Taiwan, but 10 of
their colleagues remained missing Thursday as patrol boats searched
for a second day.
	   Hopes of finding more survivors were fading.
	   The 6,000-ton Miyahata sank off the fishing port of Hsinchu on
Wednesday, and a Taiwanese vessel that heard a radio report sailed
within hours to the site, where it found the seven survivors
clinging to a wooden board in the dark seas.
	   The Taiwanese tossed ropes to the seamen, then took them to the
port of Taichung, newspapers reported.
	   Other patrol boats joined the search for more survivors
Thursday, but as nightfall approached they had not yet found two
missing Taiwanese officers and eight more crewmen from Myanmar,
which formerly was called Burma.
	   The Panama-registered Miyahata, loaded with gravel, was sailing
from Hong Kong for the northern Taiwanese port of Keelung,
officials said.

Military and rebels suffer more casualties in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan military said Thursday
it killed 118 Tamil Tiger rebels in the past three weeks even
though fighting has ebbed since the guerrillas lost a key northern
town in September.
	   But the rebels continued to target the town of Mankulam, which
they lost after fierce fighting. At least 55 guerrillas and two
soldiers were killed in repeated clashes this month near the town,
250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital, said Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon, the military spokesman.
	   The rebels didn't immediately react to the military claim.
Independent confirmation was not possible since the government
doesn't allow reporters into the war zone.
	   Another 40 rebels who infiltrated the government-held northern
Jaffna Peninsula were killed during search operations during the
past three weeks, Tennekoon said at a press briefing. The military
lost five soldiers.
	   Twenty-three guerrillas were killed in ground fighting in the
northwestern Mannar district and the eastern Trincomalee district,
and during air strikes on two rebel bases in the northeastern
Mullaittivu district, said Tennekoon.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, who claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in
education and jobs. More than 56,000 people have been killed since
the ethnic conflict began in 1983.
	   In the last major battle in September, the rebels overran
Kilinochchi, a town controlled by government. At least 1,000
soldiers were killed.
	   The military retaliated by wresting control of Manukalam from
the guerrillas.

Russia's foreign trade down 10 percent in first nine months of

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign trade fell by just under 10
percent in the first nine months of the year to dlrs 103.5 billion,
but the country still has a positive balance of trade, a news
report said Thursday.
	   Trade was down by a total of 9.9 percent from January to
September, with exports of dlrs 54 billion down 14 percent, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the State Statistics Committee.
	   Imports were down 4.5 percent, at 49.5 billion, the report said.
	   Russia's trade balance was still positive, at dlrs 4.5 billion,
compared to a balance of dlrs 11.2 billion in 1997.
	   Imports dropped sharply after the government devalued the ruble
and defaulted on treasury debts in August.
	   In other figures released Thursday, a government official said
Russia's foreign weapons sales have totaled dlrs 2 billion since
the start of the year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Alexei Ogaryov, who runs a government committee on military and
technical cooperation, would not say what was sold or to whom.

Wakanohana hands Kotonishiki his first defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana
handed No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonishiki his first
defeat Thursday with three days left in the 15-day Kyushu Grand
Sumo Tournament.
	   With an 11-1 record, Kotonishiki still held the sole lead,
followed by yokozuna Takanohana and No. 9 maegashira Tosanoumi at
10-2 and Wakanohana and ozeki (champion) Musashimaru at 9-3.
	   Wakanohana dodged Kotonishiki's driving attempts and tossed him
down.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a
row, evaded komusubi (junior champion second class) Musoyama's
driving attempt and sent him out from behind. Musoyama is 7-5.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai charged Tosanoumi with
hand thrusts and quickly pulled him down for his eighth victory
against four defeats.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, pushed out ozeki
Takanonami in their third clash. Twice before that, the five judges
ruled that both wrestlers had gone out of the ring at the same
time.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
twisted down No. 13 maegashira Gojoro (5-7) for his sixth victory
against six defeats.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was thrown down by No. 1-ranked Mainoumi (3-9) for his seventh
defeat against five victories.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango (6-6), or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, was sent out by No. 7-ranked Yotsukasa (4-8).
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 56-ranked Kyokutenzan
(4-2), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, drove out No. 50-ranked
Seigoryu.
	   No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma (2-4), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
was crushed down by No. 6-ranked Tamanonada.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko (4-2), or Brazilian Luis go Ikemori, pushed out No. 17-ranked
Yoshio.
	   No. 47-ranked Azumakaze (3-3), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano
Kotinda, was thrown down by No. 44-ranked Wakasatsuma.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

China says reporter's expulsion should not hurt ties with Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's expulsion of a German reporter accused of
possessing state secrets was an isolated incident that should not
upset relations with Germany's new government, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The spokesman, however, refused to shed more light on what sort
of secrets Juergen Kremb of the news magazine Der Spiegel allegedly
had.
	   Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said state security officers
who searched the magazine's Beijing office Tuesday turned up ``a
large amount of evidence.''
	   ``The specifics cannot be told because they belong to state
secrecy,'' he told reporters at a twice-weekly briefing.
	   Kremb, who was ordered Wednesday to leave within 48 hours and
not come back for five years, tried to attend the briefing but was
turned away because his copy of the pass reporters need to enter
the ministry building had expired.
	   Kremb moved to Singapore in July and had come back to Beijing on
Tuesday for a reporting trip.
	   Speaking to reporters outside the Foreign Ministry building,
Kremb, 41, denied possessing state secrets and accused authorities
of planting the allegedly secret documents Tang said were found
during Tuesday's search.
	   Kremb said authorities singled him out because of his critical
reporting during 8 1/2 years in China and for his contacts with
dissidents.
	   ``It was a clear setup situation against a critical
journalist,'' he said. ``This country still is not open enough to
accept journalists who write the truth.''
	   Tang said Kremb's expulsion was an isolated incident and ``will
not undermine the existing, sound cooperative relations between the
two countries.''
	   ``It is not true to say that the foreign correspondents are not
safe in China,'' the spokesman added.
	   Kremb said he learned about six months ago that the Ministry of
State Security had established a special group to investigate him.
He also said he had been followed by Chinese agents for a long
time.
	   Kremb is the second foreign reporter to be ordered out in two
months. A Japanese reporter accused of stealing and buying state
secrets was expelled in October.
	   China's secrecy laws are vague. The government regards
practically all information that has not been published in the
tightly controlled state media as classified.
	   The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily called Thursday for
stepped up enforcement of secrecy laws. In an article that did not
mention Kremb's case, the newspaper said occasional leaks of state
secrets have ``caused serious harm to the country's security and
interests.''
	   Kremb's journalist's visa was due to expire next month. He said
that before the State Security Ministry decided to expel him, the
Foreign Ministry had been planning to invite him to a farewell
dinner.
	   When asked whether the two ministries were at odds over the
decision to expel Kremb, Tang said only: ``I have given a clear
answer already.''

France to introduce tough anti-doping law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers were to resume debate Thursday on
a bill that would give France one of the world's toughest
anti-doping laws if passed as expected.
	   Debate on the bill, which in the aftermath of the
scandal-plagued Tour de France is likely to be adopted easily by
the National Assembly, was suspended early Thursday.
	   Approved by the Senate in May, the law would create a strong
doping prevention committee, order federations to show they are
acting to eradicate the use of illegal drugs, and punish
individuals found prescribing, supplying, encouraging and using
such substances.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials would make up the nine-member committee,
which could impose penalties and stiffen sanctions where it
believes sports federations have failed to crack down on doping.
	   The credibility of the system rests not only on its ability to
test individual athletes but to control federations that are too
lax.
	   The Ministry of Sports will have the right to raid premises and
order athletes to undergo medical examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
The government will only issue sports licenses to authorities with
a certificate showing they are fighting doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her central policy since coming into office in June
1997, admits clamping down on doping will be tough.
	   In presenting the bill, Buffet also said she would give details
of the law to the next meeting of the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) in an attempt to promote a more coherent
international anti-doping policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for admitting to the use of the
performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO), gave new impetus
to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals and
officials worry about its use by very young athletes.
	   The French daily Liberation said Tuesday that an internal report
from France's National Center for Scientific Research called
``Doping and Sports,'' identified widespread doping in French
sports, particularly among adolescents and at small sports clubs.

Washington courts Iraq's opposition, but with little success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Its latest standoff with Saddam Hussein now
past, the United States is courting the Iraqi opposition with the
declared aim of toppling the Iraqi leader.
	   But standing between Washington and the emergence of a new Iraqi
regime are a fragmented opposition that often suffers from a lack
of credibility and Saddam himself, a man with a singular reputation
for survival.
	   ``(Saddam) immune to coups, and he is the best among
conspirators,'' said Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National
Congress, an opposition umbrella group considered a favorite to
receive nearly dlrs 100 million in U.S. military assistance.
Chalabi met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk on
Wednesday.
	   But Iraq experts in the West dismissed the U.S. aid _ approved
last month by Congress to oust Saddam _ as a futile gesture. Some
opposition groups even rejected the offer.
	   Many, in fact, fear that an Iraq without Saddam would splinter
into ethnic and religious enclaves _ perhaps tempting targets for
powerful neighbors such as Iran and Turkey.
	   ``While seeking to topple Saddam, the Americans don't want a
weak and a fragmented Iraq to follow,'' said Sean Boyne, an analyst
for Jane's Intelligence Review.
	   The United States itself, experts said, was far from decided on
the most effective way to topple Saddam, with all the obvious
options _ a coup or an insurrection _ either fraught with problems
or difficult to implement.
	   ``They'll have to get lucky,'' said Terry Taylor, a former U.N.
arms inspector in Iraq who lives in Britain.
	   ``He is running a pretty tight ship, and that is putting it
rather mildly,'' Taylor told The Associated Press. ``But the regime
is also insecure on account of the narrow base of support it enjoys
and that might at some point cause some destabilization.''
	   Saddam, 61, has wielded power for 30 years. Possibly the most
ruthless Arab leader in modern times, he has systematically
suppressed all dissent, jailing or executing tens of thousands.
	   Barely a month after his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War, he swiftly
crushed simultaneous revolts by Iraq's Shiite Muslims in the south
and Kurds in the north. Five years later, his army returned to the
north to smash a CIA-backed Iraqi opposition group.
	   Iraqi opposition groups, which range from Kurdish guerrillas to
communist activists, face just as grim a future.
	   Inside Iraq, they contend with an elaborate web of security
agencies led by fellow clansmen and a deep culture of fear that
leaves members of the same family unable to trust one another.
	   Outside the country, groups based mainly in London and Tehran
are preoccupied with infighting and ideological differences,
hampering a unified stand in opposing Saddam.
	   In a bid to unite Hussein's opponents, Britain said Wednesday it
will host a meeting of Iraqi opposition groups next week.
	   The Foreign Office said London-based representatives of more
than a dozen opposition groups have been asked to meet Derek
Fatchett, a minister at the Foreign Office, on Monday.
	   Chalabi, of the National Congress, said Washington's assistance
could yield results. He advocates an insurrection from inside Iraq
as the most feasible way of replacing Saddam.
	   Speaking from London, he said his group had put together a
military plan to operate from western or southern Iraq under aerial
protection provided by the United States and its allies.
	   ``What is needed is an area to assemble military forces and the
declaration there of a provisional government,'' he said.
	   Boyne, the analyst, said Washington appears to favor Chalabi's
insurrection scenario, as evidenced by its decision to provide
military aid to the Iraqi opposition.
	   But, he said, other factions within the U.S. administration
favor different courses of action. Some doubt groups like Chalabi's
Iraqi National Congress could hold the opposition together in the
event of sustained fighting. Already, the departure of several
groups since 1992 has considerably weakened his organization.
	   As a result, Boyne said, some in the CIA are believed to favor a
coup and remain behind the Iraqi National Accord, a shadowy
opposition group some exiles believe was infiltrated by Saddam.
	   That option, too, has its detractors.
	   Chalabi and others believe a coup is not possible since the army
has no sizable units in Baghdad. Those deployed elsewhere in Iraq
are poorly armed, have little ammunition and their movements are
severely restricted, they said.
	   ``Army units are secured against each other,'' said Andrew
Duncan, a military analyst based in Britain. ``No one can act
without someone else watching.''
	   A well-armed, special force independent from the army, led by
Saddam's son Qusai and believed to number about 16,000, is deployed
in Baghdad to protect Saddam and guard his palaces and vital
installations, Iraqi experts and opposition officials say.
	   ``It is not the efficiency of the security apparatus around
Saddam, but rather its ruthlessness,'' Duncan said.

Report: Hong Kong's move against Singapore futures contract
</HEADLINE>
circumvented &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Morgan Stanley Capital International has made
public the method for calculating an index at the center of a
bitter row between Singapore and Hong Kong over trading of a
futures contract, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The formula for the MSCI Hong Kong Stock Index, the basis of a
futures contract that will be relaunched Monday on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange, was posted on the company's web
site Wednesday.
	   The move effectively foils the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong from
blocking real-time market data required to calculate the rival
index, which is virtually the same as the benchmark Hang Seng
Index, said The Business Times.
	   The Hong Kong exchange has fought against the index and trading
of the futures contract in Singapore, arguing that it would lead to
manipulation of Hong Kong shares by overseas traders and less
trading business for the Chinese territory.
	   It has demanded that information venders withhold instantaneous
data on the Hong Kong market from SIMEX, as the Singapore exchange
is known.
	   SIMEX said that with Morgan Stanley's instructions and other
relevant daily data from its web site, anyone with access to Hong
Kong stock prices could now calculate the index, the newspaper
reported.
	   Futures traders in Singapore will not have to rely on SIMEX for
the index level, and can trade the MSCI Hong Kong Stock Index
contract at will.
	   While Hong Kong's stock exchange resolved to prevent the rival
futures contract, its futures counterpart has moved to outdo its
Singapore competitor by extending its trading hours to match those
on SIMEX.
	   The Hong Kong Futures Exchange may also lower margins on its
Hang Seng Index futures to meet the challenge, said The Straits
Times.
	   Morgan Stanley's web site address is
www.ms.com/mscidata/realtime/index.html, The Business Times said.

Fuji Heavy Industries raided in Japanese lawmaker scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors raided the headquarters of Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. on Thursday, reportedly looking for evidence
against a jailed lawmaker accused of trying to hide the misuse of
political funds.
	   Fuji announced in a statement that prosecutors searched the
offices, but did not release further details. The Tokyo District
Public Prosecutors Office refused to comment.
	   Yojiro Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
Parliament, was arrested last month on charges of violating the
political party subsidy law and the political fund control law. He
allegedly ordered false receipts made to account for missing party
money.
	   Investigators also suspect money Fuji Heavy Industries gave to
Nakajima was used to bribe other members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and his supporters in preparation for an election,
Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has said it
donated 4 million yen (dlrs 33,000) to Nakajima since 1993, and
bought 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,115) worth of tickets for fund-raising
parties for the lawmaker, Kyodo reported.
	   Nakajima served as an adviser to the company between March 1993
and January 1996.
	   The lawmaker, who represents a district in Gunma prefecture in
central Japan, has reportedly denied wrongdoing and said he was
unaware of the actions of his subordinates.
	   Japan's political world has been rocked by a series of
corruption scandals in recent years that have exposed cozy ties
between government officials and businesses.
	   Also Thursday, an assemblyman and a senior member of Nakajima's
support group were arrested on suspicion of receiving a total of
20.2 million yen (dlrs 166,940) to buy votes in October 1996, Kyodo
reported.

Abubakar's says tough detention law scrapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The ruling military government plans to
repeal an internal defense statute that gives the police the
authority to jail individuals for up to six months without charge,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
	   Head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, announced plans to
formally scrap the measure, known as Decree No. 2, and has ordered
its suspension in the interim.
	   Abubakar made the announcement while speaking Wednesday to
students from the University of Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria _
long the seat of civil unrest against Nigeria's successive military
governments.
	   Decree No. 2 was widely used by Abubakar's predecessor Gen. Sani
Abacha to jail opponents, critics and political dissidents.
	   Abacha died in June of an apparent heart attack and was replaced
by Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over to a civilian
government next year and has released large numbers of political
prisoners.
	   During Abacha's five years in power he wielded supreme power and
invoked harsh measures to curb dissent. Human rights groups
estimated thousands of political prisoners were jailed at various
times by Abacha and his secret police. Most were jailed using the
Decree No. 2 provision or were found guilty of trumped up charges.
	   Abubakar's decision to repeal the decree is the latest in a
series of moves by the military leader to instill trust and
confidence in his regime and improve Nigeria's troubled foreign
relations.
	   Under Abacha, Nigeria became increasingly isolated as more and
more countries cut ties or imposed sanctions on the West African
country for its dismal human rights record and institutional
corruption.

Philippine shares slightly lower on profit-taking, peso higher

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing average for peso &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares finished slightly
lower Thursday, with early gains trimmed by profit-taking, traders
said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell
1.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,819.01 after a three-day rally.
The index had climbed 41.54 points Wednesday.
	   The market had gained 108.79 points, or 6.4 percent, in the
previous three days, taking it within a few points of its 1997
closing level of 1,869.23. It surged as high as 1,856 Thursday
before falling back as investors began cashing in on the recent
gains.
	   The broader All Shares Index was unchanged at 582.96. It
finished 11.67 points higher Wednesday.
	   Losers outnumbered gainers 63 to 33, while 46 issues were
unchanged.
	   Among stocks that retreated in the profit-taking were Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co. and Metro Pacific Corp.
	   ``Clearly, it was a technical correction. Most issues were
already at, or near, their peak,'' said Erwin Balita, analyst for
Securities 2000 Inc.
	   Meanwhile, the Philippine peso traded slightly higher against
the U.S. dollar, largely due to slack demand for both currencies,
traders said.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 39.869 pesos, down from
Wednesday's average of 39.947 pesos. It traded in a thin range of
39.730 pesos to 39.960 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 125.5 million, compared with dlrs 173.0
million Wednesday.
	   Traders said most participants in the spot market are
maintaining their currency positions while waiting for fresh news
that could affect the movement of the peso.
	   There also are rumors that the central bank does not want the
peso to appreciate above 39.50 to the dollar, they said.
	   The central bank has not indicated a preferred level, saying it
wants the peso-dollar rate to be determined by the market.

Abubakar says tough detention law to be scrapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in overline. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The ruling military government plans to
repeal an internal defense statute that gives the police the
authority to jail individuals for up to six months without charge,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
	   Head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, announced plans to
formally scrap the measure, known as Decree No. 2, and has ordered
its suspension in the interim.
	   Abubakar made the announcement while speaking Wednesday to
students from the University of Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria _
long the seat of civil unrest against Nigeria's successive military
governments.
	   Decree No. 2 was widely used by Abubakar's predecessor Gen. Sani
Abacha to jail opponents, critics and political dissidents.
	   Abacha died in June of an apparent heart attack and was replaced
by Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over to a civilian
government next year and has released large numbers of political
prisoners.
	   During Abacha's five years in power he wielded supreme power and
invoked harsh measures to curb dissent. Human rights groups
estimated thousands of political prisoners were jailed at various
times by Abacha and his secret police. Most were jailed using the
Decree No. 2 provision or were found guilty of trumped up charges.
	   Abubakar's decision to repeal the decree is the latest in a
series of moves by the military leader to instill trust and
confidence in his regime and improve Nigeria's troubled foreign
relations.
	   Under Abacha, Nigeria became increasingly isolated as more and
more countries cut ties or imposed sanctions on the West African
country for its dismal human rights record and institutional
corruption.

TOKYO: Lewinsky affair.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``The United States views Japan as our friend, our ally for the
future,'' Clinton told an audience of students, merchants and other
workaday Japanese.
	   ``We regret that you have the present economic challenges that
you have but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' he said. ``Do not be discouraged by the present economic
difficulties. They can be overcome. So now you have the laws on the
books and I would urge you to support your government.''
	   Clinton is visiting Japan and South Korea, two of Asia's most
important economies and home to the only two permanent postings in
Asia of American troops.
	   A woman from Osaka bluntly asked Clinton how he had apologized
to his wife and daughter for his affair with the former White House
intern, and whether they had forgiven him.
	   ``I did it in a direct and straightforward manner,'' Clinton
replied. As for forgiving him, ``I believe they did, yes,'' he
said, quickly adding, ``That's really a question you could ask them
better than me.''
	   Sensing the awkwardness, the TV moderator quickly interjected:
``Let's change the topic now.''
	   Clinton acknowledged at the outsets efforts Japanese leaders
have undertaken to combat the nagging recession.

Indonesian president warns of more chaos if reforms fail

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Up to 2,000 angry students were
blocked from marching on the house of former Indonesian autocrat
Suharto Thursday, as his successor, President B.J. Habibie, warned
that further civil unrest could threaten national unity.
	   Demonstrators faced off with lines of soldiers holding riot
shields and sticks outside the U.S. ambassador's residence a few
blocks from Suharto's home, where the old leader has remained a
virtual recluse since his 32-year rule ended after deadly riots in
May.
	   Protesters shouted ``Hang Suharto'' and demanded he be put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses. They accused him of
plundering the nation's wealth and demanded that the state seize
his personal wealth.
	   ``Suharto has robbed Indonesia's rich economy for decades. Now
we have to take back the property for the people,'' said protest
organizer Aset.
	   Earlier, Habibie said civil unrest could escalate if student
protesters prevent his government from carrying out promised
political reforms.
	   The warning follows last week's clashes between military forces
and demonstrators seeking faster democratic change. As many as 16
people died in the unrest, including eight students.
	   Police rounded up suspects over the weekend for questioning
about the protests.
	   Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said 10 suspects had
been formally charged with trying to attack the government. They
could face life in prison if convicted.
	   Director General of Immigration Pranowo also said that 17 people
had been banned from traveling abroad following a police request.
	   Habibie, who has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system
set up by Suharto, said the government must implement a dozen
reforms passed by the People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's
highest legislative body.
	   If reforms fail, Habibie said in a statement, ``it will not be
an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark the bloody May riots
which helped forced Suharto out and in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, filled with holdovers from
Suharto's authoritarian era, approved the reform decrees Friday in
a session marred by violence on the streets.
	   ``The stakes are very great,'' Habibie said in prepared remarks
distributed by his office. If reforms fail, he said, ``it will not
be an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Chief among Habibie's reforms is a plan for parliamentary
elections next year, which he has promised would be conducted
impartially. Still, suspicions abound that the ruling Golkar Party
will try to dominate the electoral machinery as it has in previous
years.
	   Internal Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid predicted Thursday that
the elections will not be held until mid-June 1999, a month later
than originally promised by the government.
	   Syarwan said extra time would be needed for preparations.
	   The reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly that passed them and is now
sitting in its own right.
	   The assembly did not heed student demands that the military be
banned from politics. Instead, it chose to gradually reduce the
number of appointed Parliament seats held by the armed forces from
the current quota of 75.
	   The attorney general is conducting an investigation into
Suharto's wealth.
	   The newspaper Republika on Thursday reported that the government
is investigating whether it can seize a cattle ranch near Jakarta
that is owned by Suharto. Local villagers have laid claim to the
land.
	   Opposition figures and students have demanded that military
chief Gen. Wiranto resign in the wake of the shootings. Hundreds of
people were injured.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said autopsies on the bodies of some of the eight students
who died showed some had been killed by live ammunition.

TOKYO: recession.

<TEXT>
	   Prime Minister Keivo Obuchi announced earlier this week a dlrs
196 billion package of spending and tax cuts to spur Japan's
economy, the country's eighth recovery plan, and largest, in eight
years of economic distress. Obuchi said he expected it to put Japan
on a ``recovery orbit'' within two years, but the White House fears
the package will turn out to have less punch than advertised.
	   Yet, Clinton said, ``I think, to be fair to the present
leadership, they have not had enough time for people to make a fair
judgment. They just recently entered office. The problems that
Japan has today will not be solved overnight.''
	   ``The best days of Japan and the best days of America lie before
us in the 21st century if we determine to go there together,'' he
said.
	   Clinton skipped a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific rim
nations in Malaysia earlier this week to remain in Washington to
deal with the Iraq crisis. But he arrived in the Japanese capital
today intent on pressing Tokyo to take aggressive measures to
revive its economy.

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Thursday inspections, Butler comments.
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and their Iraqi
escorts exhibited a new level of cooperation Thursday on the third
day of the inspectors' renewed mission in Iraq. Apparently their
teamwork was meant to avoid news coverage.
	   Instead of the old pattern of the escorts going inside the U.N.
compound and shaking hands with inspectors to start the day _ as TV
cameras taped away _ on Thursday one escort hastily waved from
outside the compound's three-meter-high fence.
	   At this signal, two U.N. vehicles each with three monitors sped
past television camera crews and disappeared onto a congested
highway.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   An Iraqi escort waiting in a car outside the compound _ who did
not give his name _ praised the new arrangement. ``We like it this
way,'' he said.
	   The new rapport was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups. Several times Iraq has refused to send escorts required
under U.N.-Iraqi agreements, in effect canceling planned
inspections.
	   The inspectors _ the frequent focus of confrontations between
the United Nations and Iraq _ returned to Baghdad on Tuesday and
did their first field trips Wednesday after being blocked from
working under Iraqi government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   A U.N. official in New York reported the inspectors' first field
visits Wednesday came off without a hitch. ``They did a normal
day's work and came back _ no problems,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before punishing
trade sanctions on Iraq can be lifted. Iraq insists it already has
destroyed all its most dangerous weapons.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was not as
reticent as his employees about publicity. On Wednesday, he gave a
speech in Philadelphia and publicly accused Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, of lying.
	   Butler told the audience he had written Aziz asking to see a
copy of a previously withheld document on Iraqi weapons. Then
Butler added:
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth.''
	   It's not clear if the teamwork by weapons inspectors and their
escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of their
surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   Iraq wants the lifting of the U.N. Security Council sanctions,
which were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, because these
limit the country's export of oil and have devastated its economy.

Law office of jailed politician's attorney burglarized

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Burglars ransacked the law office
of one of Anwar Ibrahim's defense attorneys and ripped through a
steel safe containing documents related to the ousted deputy prime
minister's court case.
	   Pawancheek Marican, one of Anwar's nine defense attorneys, said
Thursday that he had not yet sorted through the file folders and
rubble strewn across his office to determine what was taken.
	   But it seemed clear the burglars had a mission.
	   ``They were looking for something in particular,'' Pawancheek
told reporters, who arrived before police. ``I have to make a
police report. Then I'll check and see what's missing.''
	   Anwar was sacked from his dual role of finance and deputy prime
minister on Sept. 2. He is now on trial for abuse of power and
sodomy, charges he denies and calls politically motivated.
	   The Malaysian government had recessed Anwar's trial so it would
not upstage the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of 21
Pacific Rim leaders, which ended Wednesday.
	   Pawancheek said his office was broken into sometime after 11
p.m. Wednesday, when a staffer triple-locked the office door and
padlocked a metal shutter gate outside.
	   What Pawancheek discovered at 8:30 a.m. Thursday, when he
arrived at his second-floor office in a strip mall of an upscale
Kuala Lumpur neighborhood, he described as professional.
	   ``If they know how to break that, they won't come with
fingerprints,'' Pawancheek said, pointing to his office floor,
where a three-foot (one-meter)-high concrete-reinforced steel safe
lay opened on its back. The safe's six-inch (15-centimeter)-thick
door hung in a tangle of metal from a single hinge.
	   The fireproofed door to his office had been wrenched open. Two
steel padlocks, clipped in half, lay on the carpeted floor of the
hallway beside a lighter. There was no sign of burn marks.
	   As reporters walked amid stacks of file folders and desk drawers
strewn across the office floor, Anwar's head lawyer, Raja Azziz
Addruse, telephoned to find out what the burglars had found.
	   ``Lots of documents in my safe. Nothing of value,'' Pawancheek
said into the phone, lowering his voice. ``Well, none of the
computer equipment.''
	   When asked by reporters if there were any likely suspects,
Pawancheek replied, ``I can't say.'' He added, ``It won't disturb
my work.''
	   Anwar's trial, which is expected to drag on well into next year,
resumes Monday. The prosecution's case suffered a stream of
apparent setbacks when its first seven witnesses took the stand
earlier this month.
	   The head of police intelligence, Mohamed Said Awang, testified
that he had forced police to arrest and coerce statements from two
witnesses that had accused Anwar of sexual misconduct. He also
testified that he would lie under oath if ordered to.
	   ``Things are getting interesting, aren't they,'' Pawancheek
said.

Indonesian minister says election can't be held before mid-June
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior Cabinet minister predicted
Thursday that Indonesia will not be able to hold a promised
parliamentary election until mid-June 1999, a news report said.
	   Earlier, the government had proposed that the ballot would be
held next May.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Internal Affairs Minister
Syarwan Hamid as saying a new law covering a reformed electoral
system would not be enacted by the Parliament until January.
	   ``It is estimated that it will need at least four months after
the sanctioning of the law on politics (before) a general election
can be undertaken,'' Syarwan said.
	   ``It will be difficult to hold an election earlier because there
are many preparations to do.''
	   The preparations include the forming of an election committee
and the registration of political parties that will be eligible to
contest the election under the new law, he said.
	   The new law will also determine how many seats are to allocated
to the politically powerful military in a new Parliament.
	   Under existing rules, 75 seats are reserved for the military in
the 500-seat legislature. Many have suggested that this be reduced
to 55 seats.
	   Last week, a special 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly
passed a decree a calling for a reduction in the number of military
lawmakers.
	   Students, who have staged big protests in recent weeks, have
demanded that the military be removed for politics altogether.
	   Opposition figures who suspect President B.J. Habibie is
maneuvering to stay in power have urged the government not to delay
the election.

Philippine president says he won't pardon rapist set to be
</HEADLINE>
executed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday he wanted the nation's first execution in 22 years, of a
child rapist, to go ahead to deter many similar offenders in the
Philippines.
	   ``No way,'' Estrada said when asked if there was a chance he
would reconsider an earlier decision not to pardon Leo Echegaray.
	   Echegaray, 38, a poor house painter, is set to be executed after
being convicted of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   His execution by lethal injection would be the first since
capital punishment was reimposed in the country in 1994. A debate
on the death penalty has divided Filipinos.
	   On Monday, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro
Sistoza to execute Echegaray. Ponferrada fixed an execution date
but ordered Sistoza not to reveal it publicly.
	   Echegaray's crime was not caused by poverty and the convict's
execution would serve as a strong warning to would-be rapists,
Estrada said in a radio interview from Malaysia. Estrada was in
Kuala Lumpur to attend a summit of Asia Pacific leaders.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 other death-row
inmates to be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on
death row were convicted of rape, and 159 of them abused their
children or other relatives.
	   On Thursday, Ponferrada rejected an appeal by Echegaray's
lawyers to reconsider the execution order. She also rejected a
request by the lawyers to inform Echegaray of the execution date in
advance so he could prepare for it.
	   Under government rules, Echegaray would only be informed of his
impending execution after sunrise on execution day.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty, but it
gave congress the option of restoring it for crimes such as murder,
kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option when
they brought back executions, by electric chair and gassing, in
1994.
	   Two years later, the law was changed to prescribe lethal
injections as the only method of execution.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crime by
frightening would-be criminals. They say crime remains rampant
because no one among the death-row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that, and that the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their
defense.

Students rally in support of hymn to Hindu goddess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Thousands of students burned effigies of
Muslim clerics and declared them traitors as Hindus and Muslims in
northern India clashed over government orders that students start
the day with a hymn to the Hindu goddess of learning and a song
praising the motherland.
	   The protests Wednesday and Thursday were organized by the Uttar
Pradesh student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party in
power at the federal level as well as in Uttar Pradesh's state
assembly have been accused of trying to spread Hindu nationalist
philosophy in India and increase tensions between Hindus, who make
up more than 80 percent of the population, and the Muslim minority.
	   The protests in several towns in Uttar Pradesh state followed
declarations from several Muslim leaders earlier this week that the
song orders were offensive. Mohammad Ishtiyaq Querishi, head of a
council of private Muslim religious schools, said the songs were
the equivalent of praying to a Hindu goddess and worshipping the
country.
	   ``Muslims love their country but cannot worship it,'' Querishi
told The Associated Press.
	   The state's minister for primary education, Ravindra Shukla,
said Muslims had nothing to fear in the orders he issued last
month. He said the orders did not affect students in Muslim
schools, and Muslims in public schools could remain silent while
their classmates sang.
	   He added Vande Mataram, ``Hail to the Motherland,'' was a
traditional song Muslims and Hindus alike during India's
independence movement.
	   ``Anyone opposing Vande Mataram now is an anti-nationalist,'' he
said.

Clinton urges Japanese: patience, more openness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous; CORRECTS spelling of Obuchi's first name,
ADDS additional detail. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Japanese
public Thursday not to be discouraged by their struggling economy,
but also called for more openness to American-made goods.
	   ``If Japan is very strong, that brings back Asia,'' Clinton said
at a ``town hall'' meeting broadcast nationally from Tokyo.
	   After meeting Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Residence, Clinton
faced an hour of questions ranging from the strained economic
relations between Tokyo and Washington to personal matters,
including the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   ``The United States views Japan as our friend, our ally for the
future,'' Clinton told an audience of students, merchants and other
workaday Japanese.
	   ``We regret that you have the present economic challenges that
you have but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' he said. ``Do not be discouraged by the present economic
difficulties. They can be overcome.''
	   Clinton is visiting Japan and South Korea, two of Asia's most
important economies and home to the only two permanent postings in
Asia of American troops. Clinton skipped a summit meeting of Asian
and Pacific rim nations in Malaysia earlier this week to remain in
Washington to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   He had cancelled a planned visit to Malaysia for the
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit which ended Wednesday.
	   A woman from Osaka bluntly asked Clinton how he had apologized
to his wife and daughter for his affair with the former White House
intern, and whether they had forgiven him.
	   ``I did it in a direct and straightforward manner,'' Clinton
replied. As for forgiving him, ``I believe they did, yes,'' he
said, quickly adding, ``That's really a question you could ask them
better than me.''
	   Sensing the awkwardness, the TV moderator quickly interjected:
``Let's change the topic now.''
	   Clinton acknowledged at the outset efforts Japanese leaders have
undertaken to combat the nagging recession.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced earlier this week a dlrs
196 billion package of spending and tax cuts to spur Japan's
economy, the country's eighth recovery plan, and largest, in eight
years of economic distress. Obuchi said he expected it to put Japan
on a ``recovery orbit'' within two years, but the White House fears
the package will turn out to have less punch than advertised.
	   Yet, Clinton said, ``I think, to be fair to the present
leadership, they have not had enough time for people to make a fair
judgment. They just recently entered office. The problems that
Japan has today will not be solved overnight.''
	   ``The best days of Japan and the best days of America lie before
us in the 21st century if we determine to go there together,'' he
said.
	   Obuchi was elected prime minister in July and first met Clinton
in New York in September.
	   ``The difficulties, the challenges Japan has will not be solved
overnight,'' Clinton said, noting that it took his own
administration a while to achieve a stable economic program.
	   ``Do not judge too harshly, too quickly,'' he said of Obuchi's
efforts.
	   American pressure on Obuchi _ and on his predecessors _ to lead
Asia's economic recovery has grated on the Japanese, who believe
they are doing what is necessary and politically possible to end
their country's worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   The summit agenda for Clinton and Obuchi also included the
problem of communist North Korea, which startled the world _
especially Japan _ by test-firing a missile over Japan on Aug. 31.
Tokyo and Washington are worried by North Korea's missile and
nuclear weapons ambitions.
	   After taping the TV appearance, for broadcast to the Japanese
people in the evening, Clinton was going to Akasaka Palace, the
French-style residence of Crown Prince Naruhito, for a dinner
hosted by Obuchi.

Cambodian parties hammer out details of coalition deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two political parties
began hammering out details Thursday in their agreement to form a
coalition government.
	   Separate working groups formed by strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC
party met at government offices to draft proposals on establishing
a senate, a joint political platform and protocol between the
parties.
	   Formerly bitter rivals, Hun Sen and Ranariddh ended more than
three months of political stalemate last week with an agreement
that will make Hun Sen prime minister of a coalition government.
	   Ranariddh, whose party finished a close second to Hun Sen's in a
July election, will become president of the National Assembly,
which will become the lower house of parliament.
	   The United States endorsed the deal Thursday in statement
released by its embassy in Phnom Penh, saying that Washington has
``long supported the formation of a representative government which
provides for genuine power sharing in a coalition.''
	   Key to the deal was an agreement to create a new senate as
parliament's upper house, to be led by Chea Sim, the president of
Hun Sen's party and outgoing head of the National Assembly.
	   FUNCINPEC working group member Ahmad Yahya said as many as 30
articles will have to be amended in the constitution and an entire
new chapter written to create the senate, but it is still unclear
how much power the upper house will hold.
	   Senates in previous Cambodian governments are being looked at as
potential models, along with the U.S. Senate and the British House
of Lords, Ahmad Yahya said.
	   More progress appears to have been made on a joint political
platform to be endorsed by the National Assembly, said working
group member Pok Than, also from FUNCINPEC.
	   The two sides brought very similar proposals for economic,
administrative and legal reforms to the table, Pok Than said, and
the working group hopes to have its draft ready by Friday.
	   ``I think we have incorporated each one's positions already, so
the discussion was not very difficult,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh are to meet next Monday to discuss the
three proposals, two days before the new National Assembly is
scheduled to hold it first session.
	   Both sides are eager for the quick formation of a new government
in time for the mid-December meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations in Hanoi.
	   Cambodia's entry into ASEAN was postponed last year following
Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent
coup. A resolution of the crisis and the formation of a viable
government were set as conditions for Cambodia to become the
grouping's 10th member.

Turkish Parliament to decide on no-confidence move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Vote not expected before 1700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament was scheduled to vote Thursday
on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring
down the government over an organized crime scandal.
	   Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an
indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said
to be extremely slim.
	   If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday
and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.
	   The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having
ties to organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a
state bank. He denies the charges.
	   Three separate no-confidence motions were presented to
Parliament by opposition parties.
	   On Wednesday, Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit accused the
opposition of an ``irresponsible act'' for seeking to bring down
the government at a time when Turkey is waging a diplomatic war
against Italy for the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome. Italy appears unlikely to grant
Turkey's request for extradition.
	   If the government falls, parties will have 45 days to try to set
up another coalition. If they fail, the president could appoint a
caretaker government to rule until the April 18 elections.
	   Ocalan has been leading a guerrilla war in Turkey's southeast
for autonomy since 1984. Some 37,000 have been killed in the
conflict since then.

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Thursday inspections, Butler comments.
No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and their Iraqi
escorts exhibited a new level of cooperation Thursday. Apparently
their teamwork was meant to avoid news coverage.
	   Instead of the old pattern of the escorts going inside the U.N.
compound and shaking hands with inspectors to start the day _ as TV
cameras taped away _ on Thursday one escort hastily waved from
outside the compound's three-meter-high fence.
	   At this signal, two U.N. vehicles each with three monitors sped
past television camera crews and disappeared onto a congested
highway.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   An Iraqi escort waiting in a car outside the compound _ who did
not give his name _ praised the new arrangement. ``We like it this
way,'' he said.
	   The new rapport was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups. Several times Iraq has refused to send escorts required
under U.N.-Iraqi agreements, in effect canceling planned
inspections.
	   The inspectors, often the focus of confrontations between the
United Nations and Iraq, returned to Baghdad on Tuesday and did
their first field trips Wednesday after being blocked from working
under Iraqi government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   A U.N. official in New York reported that the inspectors' first
field visits Wednesday were without incident. ``They did a normal
day's work and came back _ no problems,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before punishing
trade sanctions on Iraq can be lifted. Iraq insists it already has
destroyed all its most dangerous weapons.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was not as
reticent as his employees about publicity. On Wednesday, he gave a
speech in Philadelphia and publicly accused Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, of lying.
	   Butler told the audience he had written Aziz asking to see a
copy of a previously withheld document on Iraqi weapons. Then
Butler added:
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth.''
	   It's not clear if the teamwork by weapons inspectors and their
escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of their
surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   Iraq wants the lifting of the U.N. Security Council sanctions,
which were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, because these
limit the country's export of oil and have devastated its economy.

Lufthansa plane makes emergency landing at Singapore airport

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Lufthansa plane carrying 73 passengers and
crew members made an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi
Airport Thursday after damaging its landing gear on takeoff.
	   ``While it was taking off, it apparently hit the open cover of a
runway light, so this caused some damage to the landing gear,''
Lufthansa senior corporate communications executive Ian de Souza
told The Associated Press.
	   No one was hurt in the incident, he said.
	   Bound for Frankfurt, the Airbus A-340 plane left Singapore at
11:20 a.m. (0320 GMT), but flew for some time before the pilots
realized there was a problem, de Souza said.
	   After the pilots concluded that the landing gear was damaged,
they returned to Singapore and dumped their fuel over the sea
before the emergency landing at 1:35 p.m. (0535 GMT), he said.
	   All the passengers were evacuated immediately after the plane
touched down, said an official of the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore, who confirmed that there were no injuries.
	   Witnesses at the airport said four fire trucks surrounded the
plane as it sat about two-thirds of the way down one of Changi's
runways in the early afternoon.
	   De Souza said emergency personnel had to replace several tires
before moving the plane off the runway, which it had been blocking.
	   ``Lufthansa Airlines is investigating the cause of the
incident,'' said CAAS spokeswoman Huang Peiling.
	   She added that the pilots had detected a tire burst, but she
could not elaborate on the cause.
	   After the plane was safely moved to an adjoining area, emergency
personnel continued to gather near the plane's rear wheels.
	   Lufthansa's technical experts were still ``looking into the
damage and investigating what could be the possible cause,'' de
Souza added later.
	   The airline was making alternative travel arrangements for the
60 passengers, who were transported to hotels in downtown Singapore
after the accident, he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks.
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders
met to complete preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern
West Bank that is to be carried out by Friday.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent
of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   Israeli media reports said the United States is to give Israel
dlrs 1.2 billion to cover the cost of the troop pullback. The
grant, which would come in addition to the dlrs 3 billion in
military and economic aid Israel receives from the United States
every year, requires congressional approval, the reports said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has been deeply
divided over the Wye River peace accord under which Israel is to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Thursday's Cabinet session was expected to be stormy. Hawkish
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan told Israel radio he was
considering resigning if the pullback was approved Thursday.
	   However, it appeared the Cabinet would back the withdrawal.
	   ``It seems that the Palestinians have fulfilled all their
obligations,'' said Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel was still waiting for one clarification
concerning an anti-incitement law the Palestinians are to pass.
``We assume this will be cleared up during the day, and then we
will be ready to implement the pullback,'' he said.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel also expects confirmation of:
	   _A decree regarding illegal weapons and a plan to be submitted
to the Americans detailing how arms will be collected and stored;
	   _A list of 10 Palestinian fugitives who should be in jail by
Thursday.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the
Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more fugitives
than required, Israel radio said.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians had
kept their commitments. ``I hope that the Israeli Cabinet will not
come up with any excuses today,'' he said.
	   In addition to the first troop pullback, Israel is also to
release 250 Palestinian prisoners by Friday. The Palestinians
complained that most of those on Israel's list were either laborers
caught without a work permit in Israel or criminals, rather than
security prisoners. The dispute has not been settled yet.
	   In a possible new dispute, Israel has accelerated the legal
process of turning about one-10th of the West Bank, or 125,000
acres, into state lands that could be used for settlement
expansion, the Maariv daily and Israel radio said. The land at
issue is not privately owned by Palestinians and is not farmed.
	   A spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank, Lt. Peter Lerner, said the process of turning unclaimed lands
into state lands has been going on for years.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson is going to Israel to help with the
country's track program.
	   Johnson, banned from competitive track for drug use, was invited
by the Maccabi Sports Club of Tel Aviv to work with its track
athletes.
	   ``I've talked with a few athletes about Ben and they said some
unbelievable words about him,'' Lior Biderman, manager of the
Maccabi Tel Aviv athletics club, told the Toronto Sun. ``Our best
(sprinter) is 10.34 seconds and he is the only one.''
	   Biderman wasn't worried about Johnson's drug suspensions.
	   ``I know Ben is clean right now,'' he said. ``If he can help us
and we can help him, that's wonderful.''

France to introduce tough anti-doping law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with National Assembly adopting doping law, quotes
from sports minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers easily adopted a bill Thursday
that gives France one of the world's toughest anti-doping laws.
	   All parties in parliament voted in favor of the measure except
President Jacques Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic
party (RPR), which abstained, saying more time was needed to debate
the bill.
	   Doping became a national issue during the Tour de France, with
revelations of widespread doping by riders in the hugely popular
summer event.
	   The law, which was approved by the Senate in May, creates a
strong doping prevention committee. It requires sports federations
to show they are acting to eradicate the use of illegal drugs, and
punishes those found prescribing, supplying, encouraging or using
them.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials will make up the nine-member committee,
which can impose penalties and stiffen sanctions when it believes
sports federations have failed to crack down.
	   The Ministry of Sports will have the right to raid premises and
order athletes to undergo medical examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
The government will only issue sports licenses to authorities with
a certificate showing they are fighting doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her top priority since coming into office in June
1997, was pleased by the strong support for the bill.
	   ``It is a law for sports, which aims to preserve its ethics,''
Buffet said after the bill passed. ``It's really the human being
who is at the center of this text.''
	   In presenting the bill Wednesday, Buffet said she would give
details of the law to the next meeting of the International Olympic
Committee in an attempt to promote a more coherent international
policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for use of the performance-enhancing drug
EPO, gave new impetus to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals, and
officials worry about its use by very young athletes.
	   The French daily Liberation said Tuesday that an internal report
from France's National Center for Scientific Research had
identified widespread doping in many French sports, particularly
among adolescents and at small sports clubs.

Russia's parliament drafts new START-II treaty

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament drafted its own
version of the START-II nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday, a
top official said.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of Russia's lower house, the
State Duma, said hardliners initially opposed to the treaty are
likely to pass the new version because it ``stipulates several
conditions which would ensure Russia's national security,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Some deputies in the Duma, mostly hard-line Communists, have
stalled on ratifying START-II because they say Russia does not have
the money to replace nuclear stockpiles that would be destroyed
under the agreement.
	   But Seleznyov said the new document would guarantee financing
for nuclear arms after START-II is implemented.
	   Various Duma committees will now discuss the draft for 10 days.
Deputies say they want President Boris Yeltsin to study it, and
then they will begin discussions in December on finally ratifying
it, said Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's committee for
international affairs.
	   The United States Senate has already ratified the treaty.

APEC ends but bitter American aftertaste remains

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore bolted
for the airport only minutes after the end of a disastrous Pacific
Rim trade summit.
	   Not a minute too soon for many Malaysians.
	   The day after his hasty departure, Gore continued to ruffle many
Malaysian feathers Thursday. Those feathers also belong to several
prominent opposition figures for whom Gore may have thought he was
lending support.
	   On Monday night, Gore praised Malaysia's anti-government
protesters, calling them ``brave'' for their struggle to demand
democracy. Problem is, those same protesters want an end to the
17-year leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Making matters worse, Gore made his speech in front of Mahathir
and several other prominent Asian leaders, then walked out of a
banquet in his honor.
	   ``Ill-bred'' and ``ignorant'' were among the latest slaps in the
headlines of the government-backed dailies Thursday.
	   ``Gore may be totally ignorant or he just does not care,'' wrote
Abdul Kadir Jasin, editor of the New Straits Times. ``He shot from
the hip, hit us us below the belt and bolted after attacking us in
what he later called a `message of democracy.'''
	   Small Malaysian flags have been distributed by ruling party
activists who are calling on citizens to put them on their cars as
a sign of solidarity with Mahathir.
	   Gore had been filling in for President Bill Clinton, who missed
the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the
Malaysian capital because of the U.S.-Iraqi showdown.
	   The Star daily carried a three-column article with comments by
ordinary Malaysians _ all of them ripping the man who hopes to
succeed Clinton.
	   ``America should not throw its weight around because it has
money,'' said C.H. Chew, a Malaysian businessman.
	   Karpal Singh, national deputy chairman of the opposition
Democratic Action Party, expressed regret over Gore's speech.
	   ``No doubt the country needed reforms, but for the U.S. vice
president to have said so at the function was not the right place
and time,'' he said.
	   In Kota Baharu, the chief minister of the opposition-led
Kelantan state, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, told the national news
agency Bernama that Gore's support for the reform movement was
disrespectful.
	   ``Visitors should respect the host. If there are bad things they
should at least just keep quiet but the United States does not know
how to respect other people,'' Nik Abdul Aziz said.
	   Those bad things _ depending on which side you're on _ include
the firing, jailing and criminal charges against Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the string of anti-government protests
that his arrest has provoked.
	   Several Asian governments have accused Gore of meddling in
internal matters.
	   ``The Chinese people and the Chinese government would never,
ever make irresponsible remarks on other countries' internal
affairs,'' Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told a news
conference Wednesday.
	   Though Mahathir has stayed above the fray, not making any
significant comment on the flap, his Cabinet ministers have
denounced the American vice president.
	   Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, host of the negotiations leading up
the APEC summit Tuesday and Wednesday, called Gore disgusting and
rude.
	   The summit had offered APEC leaders the chance to produce their
first comprehensive plan to pull the region out of the prolonged
financial crisis.
	   But the leaders' final statement offered no new programs, apart
from a dlrs 10 billion support plan announced separately by the
United States and Japan.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bus plunged into a ravine off an icy road in
southern Russia on Thursday, killing three people, a news report
said.
	   The accident occurred when a bus traveling out of the southern
Russian city of Rostov-on-Don skidded on a patch of ice, collided
with a small car in front of it, and plunged 30 meters (100 feet)
down a ravine, the state television station ORT reported.
	   Two men and a woman died in the crash, while twelve passengers
and the driver were taken to a hospital. Several of the
hospitalized passengers are in critical condition, the report said.
	   The bus was traveling east along the Moscow-Baku highway, about
1100 kilometers (680 miles) south of Moscow.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks.
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders
met to complete preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern
West Bank that is to be carried out by Friday.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent
of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45

uncertainty &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended higher Thursday on
speculation of interest rate cuts or positive local news, but the
big Tokyo market fell amid political uncertainty.
	   Reports that Japan's ruling party had found a coalition partner
_ considered good news for the economy _ pushed the U.S. dollar
down against the Japanese yen late Thursday in Tokyo, while share
prices fell as traders waited for a better explanation.
	   The dollar bought 120.64 yen in late afternoon, down 0.58 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also lower than 121.65 yen
overnight in New York.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 244.77 points,
or 1.68 percent, closing at 14,354.46.
	   The dollar rose in early trading, but its gains were wiped out
on news that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had reached a
coalition deal with the opposition Liberal Party.
	   But share prices dropped in thin trading as investors awaited
more definite news on the outcome of the political maneuvering.
	   The LDP has a majority in Japan's powerful lower house of
Parliament, but needs some support from opposition members in the
upper house to ensure approval of crucial economic revival bills.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks ended higher amid expectations that local
interest rates are about to be cut.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 99.88 points, or 1 percent,
closing at 10,313.30. On Wednesday, it had climbed 64.73 points.
	   Many investors were holding back to wait for Friday's meeting of
the Hong Kong Association of Banks, a group that sets the savings
deposit interest rate for Hong Kong.
	   The association is expected to cut the rate, following this
week's easing of rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Hong

Singapore arrests 77 illegal immigrants in 22nd raid this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Authorities arrested 77 illegal immigrants in a
nationwide raid that ended early Thursday, police said.
	   Singapore's 22nd raid this year also netted four Singaporeans
accused of employing or harboring the illegal foreigners.
	   The tiny city-state has been acutely concerned over rising
illegal immigration and associated crime since the start of the
regional economic crisis, and officials have feared a flood from
poorer neighboring countries.
	   Figures on the total number of illegal immigrants and visa
over-stayers arrested this year were not immediately available, but
the number is thought to have reached record levels.
	   Illegal immigrants face a maximum punishment of six months in
jail and caning, while those who employ or house them can be jailed
up to two years and fined.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and a
destroyer were sailing through Thursday the Suez Canal on their way
to the Gulf to join U.S. forces there.
	   The two warships are expected to reach the Gulf of Suez on
Thursday afternoon. The crossing comes one day after a submarine
and two other ships crossed.
	   The ships were ordered to move to the Gulf to join the U.S.
naval force that was preparing to launch military strikes on Iraq.
The strikes were averted Saturday when Iraq agreed to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Enterprise is to replace the carrier Eisenhower in the Gulf.
There are about 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to 174
aircraft and 21 ships, including nine armed with cruise missiles,
according to the Pentagon.

Kawagishi takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Ryoken Kawagishi shot an eagle en route
to a 5-under-par 66 Thursday and took a one-stroke first-round lead
in the 250 million yen (dlrs 2 million) Dunlop Phoenix tournament.
	   The 31-year-old Kawagishi, seeking his sixth Japan PGA Tour
victory overall and his first since 1995, shot his eagle on the
par-5 seventh hole. He also had five birdies _ one on the last hole
_ and two bogeys on the 6,846-yard, par-71 Phoenix Country Club
course.
	   ``I am confident with my shotmaking at the moment,'' Kawagishi
said.
	   Yoshinori Kaneko of Japan, also seeking his sixth tour victory,
shot a 67 with six birdies and two bogeys.
	   Two strokes off the lead at 68 were Lee Westwood of England, who
won the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters last week in Japan, Ernie
Els of South Africa and three Japanese _ Tsuneyuki ``Tommy''
Nakajima, Toru Taniguchi and Kaname Yokoo.
	   Defending champion Tom Watson shot a 75 and was tied for 75th
with fellow American Todd Hamilton and five Japanese, including
Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki.
	   ``I believe I need a good sleep tonight,'' said the jet-lagged
Watson, who arrived from the United States Sunday.
	   A total of 84 players, including 32 non-Japanese, teed off in
cloudy weather.
	   The winner will receive 45 million yen (dlrs 375,000).

Russia set to launch first segment of international space station
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space experts were making final
preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the
first component of a multibillion dollar international space
station after a year of delay.
	   Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian
booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module
is a U.S.-funded component of the station. It will serve as a space
tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion,
power and communications.
	   The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday
from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, has been delayed for one year mainly
because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure to
complete another part of the station.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate
administrator for the new station, said at a news conference
earlier this week.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently.''
	   Russian officials added their traditional note of superstition.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... some advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which
is rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander
Krasnov, a deputy chief of Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department.
	   The station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and
is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United
States planning to pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve as an orbital
home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach
the two modules together in three space walks, using the Endeavors
robot arm.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya holds more than 6 tons of fuel
in its 16 tanks and is capable of flying independently for 430
days. Its control system consists of 36 thrusters and two large
engines for major orbital changes.
	   It will be launched by a three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster
rocket that would put Zarya into orbit in less than 10 minutes
after the blastoff. In the ensuing days, the ground controllers
will gradually adjust its orbit in preparation for the meeting with
Endeavor.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until early 2000,
following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast
off next July or August.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting the promised government funds, the Russian
space agency has sold its early research time on the station to
NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new
station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space
industry, whose funding has collapsed since the Soviet collapse.
The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the
next 15 years.
	   Koptev assailed some Russian space engineers who continue to
insist that more money should be put into Russia's own battered
12-year old Mir space station to extend its lifetime instead of
committing more funds to the new space outpost.
	   ``The choice mustn't be determined by emotions. Some people are
glued to one thing (Mir) and don't care about the rest,'' Koptev
said at a recent news conference. ``We must proceed from the
understanding of what would take us into the future, allow us to
preserve our industry.''
	   The Russian Khrunichev company has earned over dlrs 200 million
for building Zarya, whose design was based on earlier Soviet
spacecraft, including some of the Mir's six modules.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Accompanied by an entourage of 70 trade officials
and executives, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien arrived
Thursday for a visit expected to highlight closer ties with China.
	   After a formal welcoming ceremony, Chretien met with his Chinese
counterpart, Zhu Rongji, for talks that focused on bilateral issues
as well as broader concerns, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The two leaders were expected to preside over the signing of
accords that Canadian officials said would include agreements on
economic cooperation, the environment and anti-drug efforts.
	   Chretien was to deliver a speech at Tsinghua University, one of
China's top schools, and to inaugurate a fast-food venture at a
local bus station on Friday.
	   On Saturday, he was to make a quick trip to the western city of
Lanzhou, in Gansu province, to inspect joint development projects
there, before returning home late in the day.

Yeltsin meets with interior minister at country residence Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin met Thursday with
his interior minister to discuss ways to combat ethnic hatred in
Russia, the presidential press service said.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin briefed Yeltsin at the
president's Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow about efforts by
Russian police to combat extremism and attempts to instigate ethnic
enmity, a presidential spokesman said.
	   The talks come after a Communist lawmaker who made anti-Semitic
remarks was not censured by the mostly hard-line parliament, which
was then accused of being too tolerant of ethnic hatred.
	   Yeltsin met with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday,
and will welcome Chinese President Jiang Zemin next week, but has
canceled a trip to India, his press center said.
	   Plagued by health problems for the last few years, Yeltsin has
kept travel to a minimum recently, calling off trips to Malaysia
and Austria. He has handed over much of the daily workings of
government to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Still, the president and his doctors insist he will serve out
his presidential term, which ends in mid-2000.

North Korea to send 317-member delegation to Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Despite catastrophic hunger at home,
North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next
month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials said
Thursday.
	   It will be the largest sports delegation the communist country
has sent abroad in recent years.
	   North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from
his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win
medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis,
weightlifting and boxing.
	   Chang made the remarks in an interview published recently by the
Chosun Shinbo, a newspaper run by pro-North Korean residents in
Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained the report.
	   Chang said North Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok
to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, in Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1994. It sent only 18 athletes and officials to the
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February.
	   Naewoe is run by South Korea's main government intelligence
agency and specializes in monitoring communist news media.
	   Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995
devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy,
forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed its 23 million
people.

President Clinton, speaking personally

 &UR; With Clinton-Asia

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thursday's ``town hall'' meeting in Tokyo gave U.S.
President Bill Clinton a chance to talk about his personal life and
feelings:
	   On whether he got good grades as a child:
	   ``Mostly.''
	   On his fatherly involvement with daughter Chelsea:
	   ``I was very involved with her from the time she was a very
small baby, always going to her events and always working with her
on her homework until it became too difficult for me. My wife and I
both tried to be very involved in her life, although she has
reached an age where I don't think she always thinks it's a good
idea.''
	   His tips on avoiding the jitters when speaking before a crowd:
	   ``Imagine, no matter how many people are in your audience ...
that you're speaking in front of a few of your friends. If you're
in a big crowd, the microphone is your friend. You can speak
normally because the sound will carry.''
	   On the pressures of his job:
	   ``Of course sometimes you want to get away from it. But the
important thing is to not get overwhelmed by the work. ... I
exercise every day and I play a lot of golf _ certainly not as much
as I wish. ... I do the things that remind me I am a normal person
and I need a balanced life.''
	   On his dining habits:
	   ``My wife and I have dinner together every night when we're both
home. About four times a week we have dinner together, and about 3
times a week one or the two of us is out. My favorite dish is a
Mexican dish, chicken enchiladas.''
	   On his apology to the first lady and Chelsea for his affair with
Monica Lewinsky and whether they've forgiven him:
	   ``I did it in a direct and straighforward manner, and I believe
they did, yes. But that's really a question you could ask them
better than me.''

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some 90 U.S. Army special forces soldiers made
parachute jumps from two Blackhawk helicopters Thursday as part of
an exercise aimed at maintaining their combat skills.
	   The jumps, conducted in the desert near Ali al-Salem Air Base,
went without a hitch, Maj. John Bullion, company commander, told
reporters.
	   He said the exercise Iris Gold, by soldiers of the 5th Special
Forces Group (Airborne) from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, had nothing
to do with the latest tension between Iraq and the United Nations.
	   Iris Gold started a month ago and was scheduled to continue for
two more months, Bullion said.
	   The exercise also is aimed at improving the fighting
capabilities of Kuwaiti forces in the use of light and heavy
weapons, desert navigation, medical training, air support, mounted
operations and communication.
	   ``There is nothing like training in the area where you might get
involved in combat,'' he said.
	   Kuwaiti and U.S. forces have been training together since
shortly after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated this small oil-rich
state from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
	   Kuwait and Washington signed a 10-year defense pact after the
war. The agreement calls for weapons purchases and continuous
maneuvers.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks.
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders
met to complete preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern
West Bank that is to be carried out by Friday.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent
of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   Israeli media reports said the United States is to give Israel
dlrs 1.2 billion to cover the cost of the troop pullback. The
grant, which would come in addition to the dlrs 3 billion in
military and economic aid Israel receives from the United States
every year, requires congressional approval, the reports said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has been deeply
divided over the Wye River peace accord under which Israel is to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Thursday's Cabinet session was expected to be stormy. Hawkish
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan told Israel radio he was
considering resigning if the pullback was approved Thursday.
	   However, it appeared the Cabinet would back the withdrawal.
	   ``It seems that the Palestinians have fulfilled all their
obligations,'' said Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel was still waiting for one clarification
concerning an anti-incitement law the Palestinians are to pass.
	   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority, announced later Thursday that the decree had been
issued. Palestinian officials said it would be published Saturday
in the Palestinian media.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a dramatic about-face, a rebel lawmaker signed
an agreement Thursday with the Japanese prime minister to work
toward a coalition government.
	   The wooing of Liberal Party head Ichiro Ozawa _ a charismatic
proponent of widespread reforms _ is a victory for Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and his ruling party.
	   Anticipating that the alliance could bring more tax cuts,
currency traders bought yen Thursday, pushing the dollar down to
120.64 in late Tokyo trading from its 121.22 a day earlier. On
overseas markets later, the dollar declined further against the
yen, dropping below 119.
	   The signing came after the Tokyo stock market had closed.
	   Obuchi's administration continues to be unpopular with many
Japanese increasingly impatient with the unabating recession, the
worst in decades, which has sent unemployment and bankruptcies
soaring.
	   The Liberal Party's 93 seats in the more powerful 500-seat lower
house of Parliament, added to the ruling Liberal Democrats' 262
seats, would greatly ease the passage of ruling party bills,
policies and the government budget.
	   Other opposition party leaders were shown on the nationally
televised evening news criticizing Ozawa for joining hands with his
former enemy.
	   Ozawa left the ruling party in 1993, vowing to offer a real
opposition alternative and end the Liberal Democrats' four decades
of political dominance.
	   Although Ozawa was a key backer of reform-oriented
administrations in 1993-94, he was viewed as too closely linked
with the old-style ruling party kingpins to gain much popularity
among voters.
	   In elections this summer, it was the newer, more liberal-leaning
Democratic Party that made key advances. Ozawa's party has also
suffered numerous defections over the years.
	   Ozawa called his decision to rejoin the rulers a step forward,
noting that Obuchi agreed to work toward smaller government,
stronger national defense, tax cuts and other changes that Ozawa
has long pushed for.
	   ``This is good for us as a party that has worked to realize
politics for the people,'' Ozawa said after signing a document with
Obuchi before the cameras.
	   The ruling party said the two sides agreed to a ``radical
revision'' of the 5 percent sales tax _ a chief issue of contention
between the two parties. It was unclear what the revision would be.
	   Ozawa, although initially a supporter of the sales tax, has
shifted his position, saying that a sales tax cut was needed to
turn around the economy. The tax raise from 3 percent to 5 percent
in April last year has been blamed for hurting consumer spending.
	   The two sides also agreed on income and corporate tax cuts
totaling 10 trillion yen (dlrs 83 billion), higher than the some 6
trillion yen (dlrs 50 billion) in tax cuts Obuchi has already
promised.
	   ``I welcome the strong commitment for cooperation from the
Liberal Party,'' Obuchi said in a nationally televised interview.
	   The two sides agreed on a plan to cut the number of government
employees by a fourth over the next 10 years, and to reduce the
number of lawmakers by 100 and the number of Cabinet posts to 17
from 20. The parties will also work together in elections.
	   The coalition government is expected to be set up before the
next regular session of Parliament begins early next year.

	   BLEVINS, Texas (AP) _ Some folks still want Wild West outlaw
Jesse James, alive or dead.
	   The smart money's on dead. Then again, exactly when the
notorious gunslinger died and where he rests in peace are questions
that haven't been entirely resolved.
	   Texas now has two sets of families in two towns claiming that
James staged his own death as a hoax, took an alias and lived to a
ripe old age in their midst.
	   The families are adamant, despite DNA evidence to the contrary.
	   Historians say James died rather unromantically in April 1882 at
the age of 34, shot in the back by a member of his own gang while
straightening a picture his wall.
	   James was one of the most famous criminals of the Old West. He
and his gang of former Confederate soldiers ripped off banks and
trains, thrilling 19th-century America with their exploits in dime
novels and news stories.
	   He was apparently buried on the family homestead near Kearney,
Missouri. The remains were moved in 1902 and reburied next to his
wife at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Kearney, 20 miles (32 kilometers)
northeast of Kansas City, Missouri.
	   The latest to dissent from this historical record is Betty
Dorsett Duke of Liberty Hill, about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
northwest of Austin. Ms. Duke insists the outlaw was her
great-grandfather, buried beneath the tombstone of a man named J.L.
Courtney.
	   In conjunction with her new book on the subject, Ms. Duke
organized a memorial service Wednesday at her great-grandfather's
grave, complete with Confederate honor guard.
	   Ms. Duke asked relatives to turn out in period costumes. None
did. Some descendants of Courtney did attend, saying they don't
know why Ms. Duke would dishonor the man in the grave by saying he
was the bank-robbing James.
	   ``Frankly, I'm so disgusted I could cry right now,'' said H.C.
Shelton of Junction City, Arkansas, a grandson of Courtney. Shelton
said he has documentation that his grandfather served in the Union
Army, settled peacefully in Texas and received a pension for his
wartime service.
	   ``I don't know why Betty came up with this,'' Shelton said. ``I
don't even want to talk to her.''
	   Then there is the Dalton family, which has long claimed that
James changed his name to J. Frank Dalton and settled in Granbury,
near Fort Worth. In 1951, Dalton announced on his 100th birthday
that he was, in fact, James.
	   Confused? Don't forget about the long line of folks who have
claimed to be the famed gunman. In sideshows across the country in
the 1920s and 1930s, there was a whole succession of James
pretenders.
	   In 1933, an Illinois man, John James, announced he was really
Jesse James and made the circuit of fairs and carnivals. His sister
finally signed an affidavit, verifying that her brother was
perpetuating a hoax.
	   There were other fakes and even a skeleton that was displayed in
the front window of a Kentucky store with a sign that said the
remains were those of the infamous Missourian.
	   More than a century after the reported death of James, modern
science stepped in. A team of crime-lab specialists conducted a
study and concluded that the remains in the Missouri grave marked
``Jess W. James'' do belong to the outlaw.
	   Also, DNA evidence taken from the grave site was compared in
1996 to two descendants of James' sister Susan, and found to match
_ genetic proof that the James family line extended from the
outlaw's mother, Zerelda James, to living descendants.
	   Still, Ms. Duke has an explanation. She contends the DNA could
match because the person occupying the grave is James' cousin, Wood
Hite. She alleges another man, Robert Ford, conspired with James
and killed Hite to throw people off the outlaw's trail.
	   There hasn't been much response to the new allegations at the
two museums devoted to James in Missouri.
	   ``Oh, a lot of people come in and think they're related
somehow,'' said museum worker Lucinda Teaford. ``We don't usually
believe it. The ones who are, know they are.''

New Zealand prime minister talks trade with Singapore officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
discussed the regional and local economic situation with Singapore
officials Thursday on her first state visit to the Southeast Asian
city-state.
	   Arriving from neighboring Malaysia, where she attended the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Shipley met for about 40
minutes with her Singapore counterpart, Goh Chok Tong.
	   Their discussions focused on how to implement the trade and
financial resolutions from this year's APEC gathering, said
Shipley's spokeswoman.
	   Shipley expressed her country's perspectives on the summit as it
prepares to assume the APEC chair ahead of next year's meeting in
Auckland, the spokeswoman added.
	   Under a blazing tropical sun, Shipley reviewed an honor guard
outside the colonial-style presidential palace before her meeting
with Goh.
	   She later attended a joint briefing by two of Singapore's key
planning agencies, the Economic Development Board and the Trade
Development Board, on the economic outlook for this affluent but
recession-struck island republic.
	   ``She was impressed by the vitality of their approach to lifting
Singapore's trade and investment performance,'' the prime
minister's spokeswoman, Anna Kominik, told The Associated Press.
	   Shipley was also briefed on Singapore's competitiveness report,
``which she found innovative,'' said the spokeswoman.
	   The government-linked report prescribes bitter pills to combat
the economic slowdown in Singapore by reducing business costs,
mainly through slashed wages and pensions, and charts strategies to
steer the city-state into the next millennium.
	   Singapore is New Zealand's fourth largest foreign investor, and
the two countries enjoy strong growth in their two-way trade, said
the spokeswoman.
	   Shipley was to attend an official dinner given by Goh Thursday
night. On Friday, she was to address the New Zealand business
community and witness Singapore Airlines operations.

Gambian president visits Taiwan

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Gambian President Yahya Jammeh arrived
Thursday for a state visit that offers Taiwan a chance to boost
ties with one of its few remaining allies.
	   President Lee Teng-hui and other officials greeted Jammeh at the
Chiang Kai-shek memorial in downtown Taipei. A 32-year-old retired
colonel, Jammeh is the third African head of state to visit Taiwan
in 1998, a year that has brought Taiwan a series of setbacks in its
rivalry with China for diplomatic recognition.
	   Gambia, the smallest country in Africa, is one of just 26
nations that recognize Taiwan, the island stronghold of Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists, who fled here in a 1949 civil war.
	   China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
international relations, and refuses to recognize countries that
have diplomatic links with the island.
	   Intensifying efforts to isolate Taiwan, China has poached away
four of Taiwan's diplomatic allies this year alone, most recently
Tonga on Nov. 2. Switches in relations are usually precipitated by
lavish Chinese offers of aid, loans and investment.
	   During his eight-day visit, Jammeh's second since winning power
in the former British colony in a bloodless 1994 coup, the Gambian
will hold talks with officials and visit agricultural stations,
fisheries and small business workshops.
	   Offers of such aid were considered important in Gambia's
decision to switch ties from China to Taiwan in July 1995.

Britain, Slovakia sign military cooperation pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Britain signed a military
cooperation agreement with Slovakia on Thursday and endorsed the
new Slovak government's efforts to gain NATO membership.
	   British Armed Forces Minister Douglas Henderson, the first
high-level official to visit since Slovakia's leadership changed
hands last month, signed the memorandum of understanding with
Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis.
	   It calls for cooperation between the two armed forces, including
a sharing of know-how and experience in strategic planning, Kanis
said.
	   Henderson said Britain is looking forward to the ``near future
when Slovakia will be a full member of NATO.''
	   ``I believe Slovakia is well placed to be at the head of any
expansion,'' he told reporters.
	   Kanis said Slovakia aims to gain NATO membership in the next
four years.
	   Neighboring Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland were accepted
in the first round, while Slovakia was bypassed amid Western
criticism of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
anti-democratic rule.
	   Henderson met with new Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda and went
for a morning run with him. He was to conclude his two-day official
visit after more meetings later Thursday.

Norwegians provide emergency aid to neighbors in Russia's Arctic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norwegians are engaged in nationwide
campaigns to help their desperate neighbors on the impoverished
Kola Peninsula of northwestern Russia's Arctic by providing food,
warm clothing and medicines.
	   More than a million people live on the peninsula, which in the
only place where Russia borders a NATO member. The economic crisis
crippling Russia has left thousands of Kola residents facing the
bitter cold of Arctic winter without heat or basic necessities such
as warm clothing.
	   On Thursday, the Norwegian Red Cross began a fund-raising drive
called ``Neighbors in Need'' in which 2,000 volunteers will seek
donations to help the Kola region.
	   ``We hope the Norwegian people will reach out a helping hand to
their Russian neighbors,'' said Sven Molleklein, secretary-general
of the Norwegian Red Cross. ``The situation is extremely critical
and we have to act now.''
	   He said more than 11,000 children and 33,000 elderly people in
the region lack essential medicines and that food supplies are
running dangerously low.
	   The Red Cross aims to provide shoes and clothing to 600,000
people on the Kola, as well as nearly 500,000 boxes of food to
158,000 needy families over the next six months. Much of it will be
distributed in Murmansk, the capital city of the region.
	   Norwegian aid groups, companies and individuals have been
sending assistance to the Kola region since the border opened up in
the early 1990s. However, an appeal from Murmansk Governor Yuri
Yevdokimo in September on behalf of the Kola's elderly and children
resulted in Norway increasing its efforts.
	   Another group, Norwegian People's Aid, last month began a drive
urging Norwegians to pay 100 kroner (dlrs 13) at more than 1,300
stores for a ``Russia Package'' of food and other necessities to be
sent to the Kola.
	   The Kola Peninsular is the base of the once-powerful Russian
North fleet. During the Soviet era, population swelled from a few
thousand to more than one million when thousands of minors,
soldiers and others were send to the region.

Resistance general rejects previous Cambodian army position
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The top general of Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's former resistance army confirmed Thursday that he would
not retake his previous position as second-in-command of the
Cambodian army.
	   Gen. Nhek Bunchhay remained loyal to Ranariddh during a bloody
coup orchestrated by strongman Hun Sen last year, but the prince
and Hun Sen sought last week to end more than a year of political
instability by forming a new coalition government.
	   A key condition for Ranariddh was a pardon for Nhek Bunchhay and
four other Hun Sen opponents who had been threatened with arrest if
they returned to Cambodia from exile.
	   The pardons were granted, but Ranariddh said Nhek Bunchhay could
no longer be the army's first deputy chief of the general staff.
	   ``I accept it,'' Nhek Bunchhay said by telephone from Bangkok,
Thailand. ``I'm not disappointed, nor am I demanding any
position.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay commanded pro-Ranariddh forces that were expelled
from Phnom Penh by Hun Sen's stronger army faction during the coup,
which saw Ranariddh toppled as co-prime minister.
	   The general led a controlled retreat to the mountainous
Thai-Cambodian border, where his troops dug in and fought his
stronger foes to a stalemate.
	   Under last week's agreement, Hun Sen will be sole prime minister
of a coalition government and Ranariddh will become president of
the National Assembly.
	   Nhek Bunchhay's forces, still wedged along Cambodia's northern
border, will be reintegrated into the national army. Nhek Bunchhay
said he would await the final formation of the government before
returning to Cambodia.

Researchers: China faces growing epidemic of smoking deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China is experiencing an epidemic of
smoking-related deaths that will kill a third of its young men if
current smoking patterns continue, a new study says.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of the British Medical
Journal, is the first to examine smoking trends in a developing
nation and involved 1.25 million Chinese, making it the world's
largest investigation of smoking deaths.
	   The survey found that not only was the rate of deaths from
smoking higher than expected, but that the types of diseases caused
by smoking also varied widely from the West.
	   If current smoking patterns persist in China _ where two-thirds
of the men become smokers before the age of 25 _ tobacco will kill
about 100 million of the 300 million males now under 30, according
to the researchers.
	   Surprisingly, smoking was found to be decreasing among Chinese
women, having dropped from 10 percent before 1950 to 1 percent
today, say the researchers, affiliated with England's Oxford
University, Cornell University in the United States, and the
Chinese Academies of Preventive Medicine and of Medical Sciences.
	   China now logs the highest number of deaths from smoking of any
country, having recently overtaken the United States.
	   And the trends seem to be mirroring what occurred in the West
years ago as smoking spread across the globe, with deaths
increasing several decades after the main rise in smoking.
	   ``If we don't have action right now, we will suffer after 20 or
30 years. Then it's too late. So we have to let all of society know
these results,'' said one of the researchers, Wang Kean, president
of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
	   Smoking already is causing about 750,000 deaths a year in China,
and that will rise to 3 million people a year by the middle of the
next century, when the young smokers of today reach middle and old
age, the study said.
	   Worldwide, cigarettes will cause about 4 million deaths a year
by 2000, split between rich and poor countries, it said.
	   But if current smoking trends persist, the total will be 10
million deaths a year by 2030, with 70 percent of them coming from
developing nations, said Dr. Alan Lopez, chief of the World Health
Organization's Division of Epidemiology and Burden of Disease,
writing in a separate editorial published in the same journal.
	   ``The hazards are already substantial and they cannot be limited
to China,'' Lopez said.
	   While the Chinese make up 20 percent of the world's population,
they smoke 30 percent of the world's cigarettes, said Richard Peto,
who led the research team from Oxford.
	   Chinese adults severely underestimate smoking risks, he said.
	   ``A 1996 nationwide survey showed that two-thirds believe
smoking does little or no harm,'' he said. ``The truth is that half
of all persistent smokers get killed by tobacco. As two out of
every three young men in China smoke, tobacco will eventually kill
about a third of all the young men in China.''
	   And although the overall risk of death may become about as big
for Chinese as for Western smokers, the way in which smoking kills
in China is surprisingly different, the researchers found.
	   In China, smoking causes many more deaths from chronic lung
disease than lung cancer, the reverse of what happens in the West.
Smoking also was not strongly linked to heart disease in China, as
it is in the West, but instead was linked to tuberculosis.
	   The researchers attributed the differences to the fact that
smoking exacerbates diseases already common in a country, and noted
that Chinese and Western disease patterns differ.

Poll: Natanyahu not trusted to implement latest peace agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eighty-five percent of Egyptians doubt that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would implement the
latest Middle East peace pact with the Palestinians, according to
poll results published Thursday.
	   The poll also showed that 45 percent of the 800 persons polled
expected more violence between the Israelis and Palestinians.
	   The survey was conducted by Egypt's state-owned daily
al-Gomhuria. No margin of error was given, but the newspaper said
those polled answered questionnaires that included four questions
on the expectations and future of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process.
	   The Wye River Accord, signed in Washington on Oct. 23,
stipulates an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
in exchange for Palestinian security guarantees.
	   Israel's Parliament met on Thursday to review the Palestinians'
compliance with security issues and debate whether to allow the
first of three troop pullbacks over the next 10 weeks.
	   Answering the question ``What do you think of the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed at the White House?'' 50
percent said they did not agree with it while 40 percent said they
did. Ten percent were undecided.
	   Asked to give reasons for dismissing the agreement, 85 per cent
said they did not ``trust the Israeli side to carry out the
agreement under Natanyahu's government.'' Fifty-five percent said
it gave the Palestinian little control over the land because they
would share control with the Israelis.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent is to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   The poll results also showed that 20 per cent of those
questioned believed that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's
monitoring of the agreement's implementation would create an
``uncomfortable'' atmosphere that could complicate the situation.
	   Asked on how they saw the future of Palestinians-Israeli
relations, 45 per cent said there would be more ``tension and
terror operations'' and 40 per cent said relations ``would reach a
dead end.'' Twenty per cent said there would be internal
Palestinian divisions.
	   Only 15 per cent of those polled said the two sides would reach
a fair solution and a similar percentage said they expected the
declaration of a Palestinian state.

Indonesian president warns of more chaos if reforms fail

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Up to 3,000 students were blocked from
marching on the house of former Indonesian autocrat Suharto
Thursday, as his successor, President B.J. Habibie, warned that
further civil unrest could threaten national unity.
	   Demonstrators faced off with about 500 soldiers holding riot
shields and sticks outside the U.S. ambassador's residence a few
blocks away from Suharto's home, where the old leader has remained
a virtual recluse since his 32-year rule ended after deadly riots
in May.
	   The ambassador's residence was not the target of the protest.
Instead, demonstrators taunted the soldiers. They sang and danced,
and shouted: ``Hang Suharto from the national monument,'' a tall
spire of marble topped by a gold-leaf sculpture in the shape of a
flame.
	   They demanded that Suharto be put on trial for corruption and
human rights abuses. They accused him of plundering the nation's
wealth and demanded that the state seize his personal wealth.
	   ``Suharto has robbed Indonesia's rich economy for decades. Now
we have to take back the property for the people,'' said protest
organizer Aset.
	   The protest ended peacefully.
	   Earlier, Habibie said civil unrest could escalate if student
protesters prevent his government from carrying out promised
political reforms.
	   The warning follows last week's clashes between military forces
and demonstrators seeking faster democratic change. As many as 16
people died in the unrest, including eight students.
	   Police rounded up suspects over the weekend for questioning
about the protests.
	   Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said 10 suspects had
been formally charged with trying to attack the government. They
could face life in prison if convicted.
	   Director General of Immigration Pranowo also said that 17 people
had been banned from traveling abroad following a police request.
	   Habibie, who has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system
set up by Suharto, said the government must implement a dozen
reforms passed by the People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's
highest legislative body.
	   If reforms fail, Habibie said in a statement, ``it will not be
an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark the bloody May riots
that helped force Suharto out and in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, filled with holdovers from
Suharto's authoritarian era, approved the reform decrees Friday in
a session marred by violence on the streets.
	   Chief among Habibie's reforms is a plan for parliamentary
elections next year, which he has promised would be conducted
impartially. Still, suspicions abound that the ruling Golkar Party
will try to dominate the electoral machinery as it has in previous
years.
	   Habibie said international observers from the United Nations,
the United States, Germany, France, Japan and Australia would be
free to monitor the elections.
	   ``They want to help Indonesia make the next election a free and
fair election,'' Habibie said.
	   Internal Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid predicted Thursday that
the elections will not be held until mid-June 1999, a month later
than originally promised by the government.
	   Syarwan said extra time would be needed for preparations.
	   The reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly that passed them and is now
sitting in its own right.
	   The assembly did not heed student demands that the military be
banned from politics. Instead, it chose to gradually reduce the
number of appointed Parliament seats held by the armed forces from
the current quota of 75.
	   The attorney general is conducting an investigation into
Suharto's wealth.
	   The newspaper Republika reported Thursday that the government is
investigating whether it can seize a cattle ranch near Jakarta that
is owned by Suharto. Local villagers have laid claim to the land.
	   Opposition figures and students have demanded that military
chief Gen. Wiranto resign in the wake of the shootings. Hundreds of
people were injured.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said autopsies on the bodies of some of the eight students
who died showed some had been killed by live ammunition.

Three thousand workers protest poverty and possible job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of angry workers demanded
the government resign on Thursday as they marched through the
capital to protest falling living standards and feared job cuts.
	   Some 3,000 workers from machine-tool industry protested against
government policies of restructuring their sector, saying mass
unemployment would result.
	   ``The leaders deceived us, we want new leaders,'' the workers
chanted as they made their way to government headquarters.
	   Wages in the sector are less than the average, which amounts to
about dlrs 120 a month, but still not paid on time, said Alexandru
Paduraru, a spokesman of the 100,000-member union. Workers demanded
wages on time and job stability.
	   Thursday's protests are of a series over the past two weeks
against falling living standards and government failure to reform
the economy.

Indonesian minister says election can't be held before mid-June

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ United Nations and other international
observers will be allowed to monitor a promised election in
strife-torn Indonesia, President B.J Habibie said Thursday.
	   The announcement came as a senior Cabinet minister predicted the
election will not be held until mid-June 1999, not in May as
earlier promised by the government.
	   Habibie said the United Nations, the United States, Germany,
France, Japan and Australia had requested observer status.
	   ``They want to make the next election a free and fair
election,'' Habibie told about 350 local and foreign participants
at a conference at the State Palace.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Internal Affairs Minister
Syarwan Hamid as saying a new law covering a reformed electoral
system would not be enacted by the Parliament until January.
	   ``It is estimated that it will need at least four months after
the sanctioning of the law on politics (before) a general election
can be undertaken,'' Syarwan said.
	   ``It will be difficult to hold an election earlier because there
are many preparations to do.''
	   The preparations include the forming of an election committee
and the registration of political parties that will be eligible to
contest the election under the new law, he said.
	   The new law also will determine how many seats are to allocated
to the politically powerful military in a new Parliament.
	   Under existing rules, 75 seats are reserved for the military in
the 500-seat legislature. Many have suggested that this be reduced
to 55 seats.
	   Last week, a special 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly
passed a decree calling for a reduction in the number of military
lawmakers.
	   Students, who have staged big protests in recent weeks, have
demanded that the military be removed from politics altogether.
	   Opposition figures who suspect Habibie is maneuvering to stay in
power have urged the government not to delay the election.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unknown gunmen shot and killed an aide to the
governor of Russia's Kemerovo region in Moscow, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Alexander Gontov, a coal industry adviser to Kemerovo Governor
Aman Tuleyev, was found by his wife in the entrance to his
apartment building Wednesday evening, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Gontov, who also sat on the board of directors of a bank, was
shot in the head several times with an AK-47 rifle, the report
said.
	   A number of government aides and prominent businessmen have been
killed in similar incidents in recent years. Police often say the
deaths are contract killings, an increasingly common way of
settling business disputes in Russia. The killers are rarely
caught.

Ukraine's president proposes printing money, more control over
</HEADLINE>
central bank &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma called for printing
money and stripping the central bank of independence in a new
economic program intended to help Ukraine avoid the ``unpredictable
consequences'' of its collapsing finances.
	   Kuchma outlined these and other measures Thursday in a special
address to parliament, which he said was prompted by ``significant
worsening of the economic situation.''
	   He said Ukraine's continuing economic decline since the 1991
Soviet collapse has ``exhausted all our resources,'' reducing the
country's economy by 2.4 times, and added that a new wave of crisis
may come of economic collapse.
	   Kuchma blamed monetary policies of Ukraine's National Bank,
which he said tried to profit from operations with government bonds
instead of providing loans to enterprises.
	   Such policies, as well as the lack of tax and economic reforms,
have virtually deprived the economy of cash, leading to an
overwhelming increase in barter operations, he said.
	   ``We need to inject more payment tools into the economy, where
money has stopped to serve its primary goal,'' the president said,
urging lawmakers to print more money.
	   Top government officials, as well as deputies in Ukraine's
largely leftist legislature and their speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko,
have spoken in favor of emissions.
	   However, the International Monetary Fund, which approved a dlrs
2.2 billion loan for Ukraine this fall, has criticized such plans
as violating Ukraine's loan obligations.
	   The government has made ends meet by not paying wages, pensions
and social spending debts, which Kuchma said currently total 8.5
billion hryvna (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 40 percent of next year's
projected budget revenues.
	   Kuchma also urged parliament to approve a special bill on the
National Bank and its supervisory council to allow more control
over its spending.
	   He blamed the bank for keeping interest rates too high, and said
its ``artificial support'' of the national hryvna currency has hurt
exporters.
	   He also said the government should instead return to its earlier
practice of direct borrowing from the National Bank, which amounts
to money emission, and is bitterly opposed by the IMF.

Philippines, Asian countries urged to tighten controls on tobacco
</HEADLINE>
use &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Experts urged Asian countries
Thursday to strengthen controls against tobacco use as giant
cigarette makers turn to the region because of strong restrictions
in the United States and elsewhere.
	   Asian countries should follow strong anti-tobacco controls
enforced in Singapore, which has one of the lowest smoking rates in
the world, said Judith Mackay, a World Health Organization
consultant.
	   Mackay said the Philippines has no law that significantly limits
cigarette smoking and the few anti-smoking regulations are largely
ignored.
	   ``You have to have government action, you have to have
legislation,'' Mackay told a news conference.
	   Tobacco growing is a major industry in the northern Philippines,
and the country produces about 70 billion cigarettes a year. It
also is a major market for foreign cigarette brands.
	   Other Asian areas like China and Hong Kong have become smokers'
havens and need restrictions to cut down on deaths due to
smoking-related sickness, huge government expenditures on health,
accidental fires and deforestation, Mackay said.
	   Mackay and more than 200 anti-smoking advocates and government
health officials from Pacific Rim nations will participate in the
5th Asia-Pacific conference on tobacco use control next week at the
Subic Bay Freeport, west of Manila.
	   Harley Stanton, another delegate to the conference, said large
U.S. cigarette makers are shifting their aggressive marketing
strategies to Asian countries due to restrictions on tobacco use
and business in the United States and other developed countries.
	   Nevertheless, some Asian countries like Singapore have
successfully combated smoking, Mackay said.
	   Chng Chee Yeong of Singapore's Ministry of Health, who is also
attending the conference, said the island state was able to
effectively fight tobacco use through legislation and strict law
enforcement.
	   Singapore started imposing controls against tobacco use in the
1970s and launched a comprehensive plan in 1986 to discourage
people from lighting up, Chng said.
	   The plan included raising taxes on cigarettes and cigars,
banning smoking in many areas, banning sponsorship by cigarette
companies of cultural and sports events, and restricting the amount
of nicotine in cigarettes to make them less appealing to smokers.
	   Only 17 percent of people in Singapore smoke, Chng said.
	   In the Philippines, about 46 percent of adult Filipinos and 22
percent of minors are smokers, according to Ruth Gamaro of the
Department of Health.
	   She said widespread use of tobacco products in the country has
resulted in alarming numbers of deaths from diseases like lung
cancer.
	   She said fighting smoking would ultimately benefit the economy
by reducing medical costs and productivity losses. It has been
conservatively estimated that about 16.2 billion pesos (dlrs 405
million) are spent each year by people and the government due to
deaths and treatment of smoking-related illnesses.
	   Productivity losses, including wage losses due to sickness
caused by smoking, have been estimated by the government at 27.9
billion pesos (dlrs 697 million) a year, Gamaro said.
	   Although smoking has been banned in public areas and enclosed
places in some cities, including Manila, such regulations are
largely ignored.
	   Efforts by some lawmakers to legislate comprehensive tobacco use
controls also have failed, partly because of opposition from
lawmakers from tobacco-producing areas who fear such controls would
displace tobacco farmers and industry workers.
	   ``We have a long way to go,'' Gamaro said.

Phone giant names new chief executive from ENI
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Seeking to resolve long-standing management
problems, the board of Telecom Italia SpA, the world's fifth
largest phone company, named Franco Bernabe, the head of energy
giant ENI, as its chief executive.
	   It was the fourth top management change in the
telecommunications company in the past two years.
	   Telecom said that Bernabe will be given ``broad management
powers'' and will also join the company's board of directors.
	   Telecom Italia is reinstating the CEO post following the
embarrassing ouster of Gian Mario Rossignolo as chairman Oct. 23.
	   The company replaced Rossignolo with Berardino Libonati, but
opted not to give Libonati the strong executive powers enjoyed by
Rossignolo.
	   Politicians and market participants have cheered the prospect of
Bernabe's candidancy. The consensus is that his top-notch
management skills and track record at ENI will compensate a lack of
telecoms experience.
	   Analysts have also noted that Bernabe has faced similar
challenges at ENI - once a troubled, politically linked energy
monopoly - as those that greet him at the helm of Telecom.
	   Bernabe, 50, has been CEO of ENI since 1992 and participated in
its restructuring and privatization in 1995. ENI is currently
Italy's largest company in terms of stock market capitalization.
Telecom is second.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended higher Thursday on
speculation of interest rate cuts or positive local news, but the
big Tokyo market fell amid political uncertainty. The benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent,
closing at 14,354.46. Reports that Japan's ruling party had found a
coalition partner _ considered good news for the economy _ pushed
the U.S. dollar down against the Japanese yen late Thursday in
Tokyo. The dollar bought 120.64 yen in late afternoon, down 0.58
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also lower than 121.65 yen
overnight in New York. In Hong Kong, stocks ended higher amid
expectations of imminent interest rates cuts. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index rose 99.88 points, or 1 percent, closing at 10,313.30.

	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ A cruise ship docked in this North
Korean port Thursday carrying 780 South Korean tourists, the first
southern sightseers to set foot in the communist country since
1950. Changjon is the gateway to Diamond Mountain, a remote expanse
of high crags and deep, narrow valleys that is being developed by a
South Korean conglomerate in a joint venture with the North.
Hyundai plans to build a hotel, golf course, restaurants and other
facilities at Diamond Mountain over the next several years, but for
now there is almost nothing. The tourists will sleep on the ship
each night. Most of the tourists were born in North Korea, and many
said they were fulfilling dreams to simply stand once again on
their native soil. (KOREAS-TOURISM)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world
rose for a 19th straight month in October, surging 23.9 percent
compared to a year ago, the government said Thursday. The
merchandise trade surplus, a measure of goods which pass customs,
grew to a non-seasonally adjusted 1.37 trillion yen (dlrs 11.33
billion) last month, the Finance Ministry said. The steady climb in
the surplus reflects consumers' reluctance to spend amid Japan's
worst recession in decades. That has cut demand for imports and
made Japanese manufacturers increasingly reliant on sales overseas.
(JAPAN-TRADE)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Japanese
public Thursday not to be discouraged by their struggling economy,
but also called for more openness to American-made goods. ``If
Japan is very strong, that brings back Asia,'' Clinton said at a
``town hall'' meeting broadcast nationally from Tokyo. ``Do not be
discouraged by the present economic difficulties. They can be
overcome,'' he said. Clinton is visiting Japan and South Korea, two
of Asia's most important economies and home to the only two
permanent postings in Asia of American troops. (CLINTON-ASIA)

Report: former Italy coach has Perugia job lined up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Cesare Maldini, fired as Italy's national team coach
after a disappointing World Cup, has signed a deal with a Serie A
club, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Maldini, 65, agreed in recent days to a three-year contract with
Perugia, according to the Corriere dello Sport.
	   The deal reportedly guarantees Maldini a post as the club's
coach next season _ but would also give him the job if current
coach Ilario Castagner is fired during the current campaign.
	   Volatile Perugia owner Luciano Gaucci has shown a propensity for
discarding coaches.
	   Perugia, which features star Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi
Nakata, is tied for 10th place in the 18-team Italian League with a
3-2-4 record.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Thursday to review
Palestinian compliance with the Mideast peace accord and vote on
whether to give the green light for the first of three troop
pullbacks in the West Bank over the next 10 weeks. On Wednesday
evening, Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders met to complete
preparations for an Israeli pullout in the northern West Bank that
is to be carried out by Friday. In the first stage, 2 percent of
the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44 square miles), will be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint Palestinian
jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400 square
kilometers (160 square miles), will be moved from joint
jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Its latest standoff with Saddam Hussein now
past, the United States is courting the Iraqi opposition with the
declared aim of toppling him. But standing between Washington and
the emergence of a new Iraqi regime are a fragmented opposition
that often suffers from a lack of credibility and Saddam himself, a
man with a singular reputation for survival. Saddam is ``immune to
coups, and he is the best among conspirators,'' said Ahmed Chalabi,
head of the Iraqi National Congress, an opposition umbrella group
considered a favorite to receive nearly dlrs 100 million in U.S.
military assistance. But Iraq experts in the West dismissed the
U.S. aid _ approved last month by Congress to oust Saddam _ as a
futile gesture. Some opposition groups even rejected the offer.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Up to 2,000 angry students were
blocked Thursday from marching on the house of former Indonesian
autocrat Suharto, and his successor, President B.J. Habibie, warned
that further civil unrest could threaten national unity.
Demonstrators faced off with lines of soldiers holding riot shields
and sticks outside the U.S. ambassador's residence a few blocks
from Suharto's home, where the old leader has remained a virtual
recluse since his 32-year rule ended after deadly riots in May.
Protesters shouted ``Hang Suharto'' and demanded he be put on trial
for corruption and human rights abuses. (INDONESIA)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish parliament was scheduled to
vote Thursday on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that
could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.
Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an
indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said
to be extremely slim. If approved, the legislature will debate the
motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday. The
opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to
organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state
bank. He denies the charges. (TURKEY-POLITICS)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Burundi's Tutsi-controlled military has
killed hundreds of innocent civilians, and Hutu rebel groups have
wrongly killed dozens more in a fifth year of civil strife, a human
rights group said Thursday. Amnesty International called on both
sides to stop killing people not involved in the hostilities and to
respect international law. Hutu rebels have been fighting to topple
the government of President Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi and retired army
officer, who took power in a coup in 1996. More than 200,000 people
have been killed in ethnic violence since Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president,
Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu, in 1993. (BURUNDI-VIOLENCE)

first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement, Israel radio said.
	   It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister

Clinton urges Japanese: patience, more openness

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Japanese
public Thursday not to be discouraged by their struggling economy,
but also called for more openness to American-made goods.
	   ``If Japan is very strong, that brings back Asia,'' Clinton said
at a ``town hall'' meeting broadcast nationally from Tokyo.
	   After meeting Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Residence, Clinton
faced an hour of questions ranging from the strained economic
relations between Tokyo and Washington to personal matters,
including the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   ``The United States views Japan as our friend, our ally for the
future,'' Clinton told an audience of students, merchants and other
workaday Japanese.
	   ``We regret that you have the present economic challenges that
you have but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' he said. ``Do not be discouraged by the present economic
difficulties. They can be overcome.''
	   Clinton is visiting Japan and South Korea, two of Asia's most
important economies and home to the only two permanent postings in
Asia of American troops. Clinton skipped a summit meeting of Asian
and Pacific rim nations in Malaysia earlier this week to remain in
Washington to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   He had cancelled a planned visit to Malaysia for the
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit which ended Wednesday.
	   A woman from Osaka bluntly asked Clinton how he had apologized
to his wife and daughter for his affair with the former White House
intern, and whether they had forgiven him. The woman said she
wouldn't be able to forgive her husband for such behavior.

	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the northern West Bank, or 110
square kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1
percent of the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles),
will be moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the sums with
the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. The aid
would require congressional approval, and the United States might
impose some restrictions to make sure the money does not go toward
roads for Jewish settlers or fortifications of Jewish settlements.
	   Israeli media said Israel is seeking dlrs 1.2 billion for the
redeployment.
	   The Israeli Cabinet is divided over the Wye River peace accord
under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians complained that Israel
breached its promises by offering to free mostly criminals rather
than security prisoners, and it was not immediately clear whether
the dispute was resolved.
	   Ahead of the Cabinet vote, the Palestinians met three
obligations under the peace accord. The published a decree against
incitement and a decree regarding illegal weapons, and also
provided a list of 10 Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by
Thursday. The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
told the Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more
fugitives than required, Israel radio said.
	   In a possible new dispute, Israel has accelerated the legal
process of turning about one-10th of the West Bank, or 125,000
acres, into state lands that could be used for settlement
expansion, the Maariv daily and Israel radio said. The land at
issue is not privately owned by Palestinians and is not farmed.
	   A spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank, Lt. Peter Lerner, said the process of turning unclaimed lands
into state lands has been going on for years.

Lebanon pays tribute to Christian leader who helped end war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The government on Thursday paid tribute
to George Saade, leader of Lebanon's largest Christian political
party, as a man of peace who stood up to militants to preserve
religious coexistence and end the civil war.
	   Saade, head of the right-wing Phalange Party since 1986, died
Tuesday at 67 after a long struggle with colon cancer.
	   Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and political friends
and foes were among several thousand people at Saade's funeral in
St. Maroun's Church in downtown Beirut. President Hafez Assad of
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, also sent representatives.
	   A Maronite Catholic who served in Parliament from 1968 to 1992
and several times in the Cabinet, Saade's political life was marked
a radical shift in his stance toward Lebanon's Christian-Muslim
conflict.
	   Saade fight Muslims at the onset of civil war in 1975 but was
instrumental in negotiating with Muslim politicians in 1989 on a
power-sharing accord to end the conflict, which killed 150,000
people over 15 years.
	   Representatives of President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday eulogized
Saade as a man who helped end Lebanon's ordeal despite opposition
within his religious community.
	   In negotiating the Taif peace accord in Saudi Arabia, Saade was
criticized by militant Christians for surrendering too much power
to Muslims, ending the Christians' dominant role in the country.
	   President Hrawi, a Muslim, on Thursday bestowed on Saade the
National Order of the Cedar, Lebanon's top decoration. A statement
on his behalf described Saade as ``a true Lebanese ... who put
Lebanon's interest before the party.''
	   Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir's eulogy, also read on his
behalf, said Saade was disappointed about the peace deal because
``he saw that the fruits were not of the size of the promises.''
	   Christians have complained that the peace accord was not fully
implemented, leading to greater Muslim power instead of the equal
status for both sects laid out in the accord.
	   Saade's casket, draped by the Phalange Cedar flag, was driven
north to the Batroun region in a long motorcade that made several
stops before burial in his hometown of Shibtin.

Asian anti-crime school to respect human rights, U.S. official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL;

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A U.S. government-funded academy in
Southeast Asia will observe basic human rights principles while
training the region's law enforcement personnel, a high-ranking
U.S. State Department official said Thursday.
	   The International Law Enforcement Academy, due to open here
early next year, will have to follow the constitutional values of
all member countries while tackling such sensitive issues as
wiretapping, said Jonathan Winer, U.S. deputy secretary of state
for international narcotics affairs.
	   ``We have to be acutely sensitive to all of those political
issues, not only for our country but for every other country,'' he
told The Associated Press when asked if the training might be used
for political repression.
	   Three of the countries belonging to the academy _ Laos, Vietnam
and China _ have single-party authoritarian governments.
	   Winer spoke at a preparatory meeting for the academy, attended
by about 120 representatives from 10 countries. The three-day
meeting is meant as an introduction of the topics and methods of
the new venture, to be jointly run by Thailand and the United
States.
	   The ILEA will provide basic courses for senior officials focused
on management and principles of fighting multinational crime, and
specialized courses dealing with topics such as smuggling,
forensics and computer crime.
	   ``The timing could not be more appropriate in the present era of
globalization, when it is becoming more and more evident that
sophisticated crimes that transcend boundaries are effectively
threatening national and human security,'' said Pow Sarasin, a
former Thai police chief who is on the academy's steering board.
	   A similar law enforcement academy has already been established
in Budapest, Hungary, and officials from there spoke at the
meeting.
	   The participating nations have ``so much commonality of purpose
and interest'' that the academy will be able to avoid dealing with
methods that could lead to human rights violations, Winer said.
	   ``We don't have the time, we don't have the money, nor do we
have the need to go into the edges where there could be things that
raise controversy,'' he said. ``We cannot be in a situation where,
like at the School of the Americas, we end up training somebody who
turns out to be a human rights violator.''
	   In the 1970s, the U.S.-backed School of the Americas in Panama
trained Latin American security personnel, but was criticized
because many of its alumni used their skills for political
repression. Critics described it as a `school for torture.''
	   As if to underline Winer's concerns, the draft curriculum for
the new academy begins with classes on ``Human Dignity,''
``Conflict Resolution'' and ``Principles of Democratic Policing.''

Rwanda to start resettling thousands into new villages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo KIG101 &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite a cold response from foreign
donors, Rwandan officials said Thursday they will start moving the
first 130,000 war-displaced people into villages where they will be
protected from Hutu rebels.
	   The first settlements will be built in northwestern Rwanda,
where 650,000 people, most of them Hutus, have abandoned their
homes and sought protection from the soldiers in dozens of
makeshift camps, said James Kimonyo, the Interior Ministry's
resettlement director.
	   ``The first villages will be test cases. We'll address problems
as we move along,'' Kimonyo said. ``But we need foreign assistance.
We cannot do it ourselves.''
	   So far, foreign donors have been reluctant to finance the
resettlement _ which the government estimates will cost dlrs 52
million _ for fear it will be forced rather than voluntary.
	   But Kimonyo said pressure to build the villages came from local
communities exhausted by rebels who demand scarce food, money or
shelter, and kill those who refuse.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus four years ago. The killing ended when
Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994, and promised a national
reconciliation.
	   Diplomats in Kigali, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
donor countries were unwilling to finance the village projects
without careful planning.
	   They say the government appears to be in a hurry to move people
out of the makeshift camps, where they have little water or food.
	   Kimonyo said his ministry has proposed a two-week consultation
period, after which the first three communes at Cyeru, Kinigi and
Rwerere, all about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Kigali,
would be resettled within eight weeks.
	   Under the plan, those willing to move to new villages will be
given a plot for a new house which they must build themselves.
	   For more efficient land use, each sector _ which traditionally
was made up of houses surrounded by plots and scattered on hills _
will be replaced by 20 to 30 new homes at a central location,
usually with a school and a health clinic.
	   The village would be surrounded by its original agricultural
plots.
	   The government has long considered the idea of centrally located
houses surrounded by fields as the only solution to ease the
pressure of a rapidly growing population _ 7.4 million with
projected 16 million in 2022 _ on the scarce land.
	   The plan, officially adopted by the government in 1996, was at
first rejected by Rwandans, who have strong cultural and social
ties to their land. However, recently, security concerns have made
people change their minds, Kimonyo said.
	   Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in the
world. In the northwest, the country's breadbasket, the population
density is twice the national average at 600 people per square
kilometer (900 people per square mile). Every patch of land is
occupied, and family plots have been slowly divided with each new
generation.

Ukrainian authorities detain two mass murder suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Police in southern Ukraine detained a
16-year-old boy who later confessed to killing at least five
villagers and stealing their meager belongings, a newspaper said
Thursday.
	   The boy was detained along with another youth following the
murder of a 60-year-old woman in the village of Zeleny Hai, who was
thrown to her death into a well after being tortured, the report
said.
	   The two allegedly took 6 hryvna (dlrs 1.75), an old bicycle and
two worn fur collars from the woman's house, Kievskiye Vedomosti
reported.
	   During the interrogation, the 16-year-old, whose name was not
released, confessed to killing four villagers in other settlements
in the area and to stealing their belongings, it said.
	   The youth allegedly killed his first victim with an axe at the
age of 13 after hearing that the man possessed some dollars, the
newspaper said.
	   In the southeastern town of Mariupol, meanwhile, police were
questioning a man identified only as Ihor K. who allegedly had
confessed to killing three women for refusing to have sex with him.
	   The suspect showed police officers the bodies of his victims,
hidden in a cellar, the daily Fakty reported.
	   The news came just a day after the government said it would
allocate money to a court in central Ukraine for an unprecedented
trial against an accused mass killer, Anatoliy Onoprienko.
	   Onoprienko and his accomplice Serhiy Rogozin are accused of
murdering 52 people in a killing spree in the Zhytomyr and the
western Lviv region that stunned the whole country. The victims
included entire families and at least 10 children.
	   The suspects' trial has been delayed for lack of money because
the underfunded Zhytomyr court needed to cover travel and living
expenses for some 400 witnesses.

Unable to get subsidies, Brussels' saddest-looking landmark taps

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Unable to get subsidies, the Atomium _
the monument of nine silver spheres that has become Brussels'
saddest landmark _ has reluctantly tapped corporate funding for a
long overdue facelift.
	   Next June, the nine balls of the Atomium will sport the
red-and-silver colors and logo of the Virgin Express airline.
	   Brussels has offered half a dozen other firms advertising
opportunities to help finance the Atomium's refurbishing, due to be
completed in 2001.
	   ``We are not very happy with this, but had no alternative,''
Freddy Thielemans, head of the Atomium's management board chief,
told the daily De Morgen Thursday.
	   The Atomium _ an ouitsided iron molecule _ stands 334 feet (102
meters) tall in a park on the northern edges of Brussels.
	   Built for the 1958 World Fair, it has fallen into disrepair.
Elevators and escalators don't all work. Nor do all the lights
inside the aluminum spheres or the connecting tubes. Where
scientific exhibits once wowed visitors, today's tourist is bound
to find nothing more exciting than displays of cartoons.
	   Only 400,000 visitors a year visit the Atomium, insufficient to
fund repairs of 650 million francs (dlrs 17.6 million).
	   In recent years, a money squabble between federal and Brussels
authorities torpedoed efforts to get the Atomium fixed up in time
for the 2000 European soccer championships.
	   Tractebel SA, a Belgian utilities company, wants to invest in
the Atomium. But its proposal for a 10th, subterranean ball to be
used as a conference center has received a lukewarm reception at
city hall.
	   Architect Francois Metzger does not understand why. ``The
Atomium now is something people visit once in their lifetime. With
a convention center in a 10th sphere people will come back all the
time.''

Philippines to push for regional anti-crime center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Asia-Law Enforcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government said
Thursday it is willing to serve as host for a regional center to
combat cross-border crimes in Southeast Asia.
	   The feasibility of establishing an ASEAN Center on Transnational
Crime will be discussed next week in a meeting in Manila of police
officials and law enforcement experts from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The meeting aims to develop a regional plan of action and
formulate an ASEAN institutional framework for cooperation on
fighting cross-border crimes like terrorism, arms smuggling, drug
trafficking, credit card fraud, money laundering, illegal migration
and piracy.
	   The proposed anti-crime center would facilitate cooperation and
sharing of resources among law enforcement and intelligence
agencies of ASEAN members _ Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   The center also would help find wanted persons; detect,
apprehend and prosecute members of crime syndicates; and enhance
legal and administrative assistance among member nations.
	   Next week's experts group meeting follows the first ASEAN
ministerial meeting on transnational crime, held in Manila last
December.
	   Addressing that meeting, then President Fidel Ramos said
cross-border crimes threaten regional security.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A commuter plane made an
emergency landing at Johannesburg International Airport Thursday
when its front landing wheel jammed.
	   The 16-seat South African Airlink plane was approaching the
airport on a flight from Mmabatho, a town west of Johannesburg on
the Botswana border, when the crew realized the landing gear had
jammed, the airline said.
	   They circled for an hour, unsuccessfully trying to release the
wheel manually.
	   Emergency services were alerted at the airport and the runway
was sprayed with foam. The plane landed safely, and none of the
nine passenger and crew aboard the Dornier 228 aircraft was
injured, Airlink said.

	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ Djibouti on Thursday confirmed that it had
broken diplomatic relations with neighboring Eritrea over claims by
Asmara that Djibouti favors Ethiopia in the six-month border
conflict between the two Horn of Africa nations.
	   On Wednesday, authorities in Asmara said Djibouti had closed its
embassy there without informing them of the reason.
	   Observers say Djibouti may also have been moved to break ties
with Eritrea because of an increase in attacks by Afar rebels
against government soldiers and Ethiopian trucks headed for
Djibouti port. The rebels have attacked from bases along the
Eritrean border.
	   --
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
government and rebels met Thursday to discuss implementation of a
Nov. 2 peace deal, amid heightening tension along their military
front lines, news reports said.
	   Although the November cease-fire _ which ended a five-month-old
civil war in the former Portuguese colony _ has not been broken,
reports say both sides have strenghthened their positions on the
ground.
	   Most residents on Wednesday fled the western side of the capital
Bissau _ where both sides were entrenched _ fearing a breakout of
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, officials representing the government and the rebels
were expected to discuss increasing the distance between each
side's front, in addition to the peace terms, Lusa reported.
	   The agreement stipulated the deployment of a Nigerian-led
regional peacekeeping force, and the withdrawal of troops from
neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, which were backing
the government.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A leading black empowerment campaigner
wanted for questioning over the alleged fraud of dlrs 21 million
returned to Zimbabwe from self-imposed exile in the United States,
news reports said Thursday.
	   Roger Boka, who fled to a family-owned property near Atlanta,
Georgia, in June, arrived in Harare aboard a chartered aircraft on
Wednesday, his family said, according to the independent Financial
Gazette.
	   Boka, aged in his 60s, was ``very, very sick'' and wanted only
to be with his family, his daughter Rudo told the newspaper.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper said police were eager to
interview him on his alleged transfer abroad of dlrs 21 million
drawn from his collapsing business empire.
	   In April, the state central bank shut down his private bank and
tobacco and trading companies to investigate alleged
irregularities, a move that shook confidence in the nation's
banking and financial services sector.
	   Boka's bank was one of several ``indigenous'' finance houses
hailed as breaking the traditional domination of the financial
sector by mostly white-managed foreign banks.

Opera star cannot sue over article, court says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An appeals court ruled Thursday that opera star
Jessye Norman cannot sue a magazine for libel over a remark about
her size that she called ``vulgar and undignified.''
	   In a flattering 1994 profile of Miss Norman, Classic CD magazine
said that when she became trapped in some swinging doors on the way
to a concert and was advised to turn sideways to free herself, she
replied: ``Honey, I ain't got no sideways.''
	   The singer contended she never uttered the remark, which she
said held her up to ridicule, mockery and contempt because it
conformed to a ``degrading racist stereotype of a person of
African-American heritage''.
	   But Lord Justice Peter Gibson ruled that the remark could never
convey the defamatory meanings she suggested.
	   ``I could have wished that Miss Norman had told the hoary old
joke contained in the anecdote _ the subject of this libel action _
as it would have shown that, in addition to possessing the
remarkable vocal and dramatic talents which have made her
world-famous as a distinguished opera singer, she had an engaging
sense of humour,'' he said.
	   Miss Norman, 53, already had tried unsuccessfully to sue the
magazine in the United States.
	   She claimed that Future Publishing, which produces the monthly
magazine _ also distributed in Britain _ had been guilty of
``patronizing mockery of the modes of speech stereotypically
attributed to certain groups or classes of black Americans.''

Israeli Cabinet approves first West Bank troop pullback

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clearing the final hurdle to a West Bank troop
pullback, Israel's Cabinet on Thursday narrowly gave the go-ahead
for the first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government handed over territory to
Palestinian control. Approval came after a series of delays and
disputes with the Palestinians. The pullback, expected to be
completed by Friday, is five days behind the original schedule.
	   Seven of 17 ministers voted in favor, five against and three
abstained, officials in the prime minister's office said.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the northern West Bank, or 110
square kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of
the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be
moved from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the sums with
the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. The aid
would require congressional approval, and the United States might
impose some restrictions to make sure the money does not go toward
roads for Jewish settlers or fortifications of Jewish settlements.
	   Israeli media said Israel is seeking dlrs 1.2 billion for the
redeployment.
	   The Israeli Cabinet is divided over the Wye River peace accord
under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians complained that Israel
breached its promises by offering to free mostly criminals rather
than security prisoners, and it was not immediately clear whether
the dispute was resolved.
	   Ahead of the Cabinet vote, the Palestinians met three
obligations under the peace accord. The published a decree against
incitement and a decree regarding illegal weapons, and also
provided a list of 10 Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by
Thursday. The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
told the Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more
fugitives than required, Israel radio said.
	   In a possible new dispute, Israel has accelerated the legal
process of turning about one-10th of the West Bank, or 125,000
acres, into state lands that could be used for settlement
expansion, the Maariv daily and Israel radio said. The land at
issue is not privately owned by Palestinians and is not farmed.
	   A spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank, Lt. Peter Lerner, said the process of turning unclaimed lands
into state lands has been going on for years.

Plans reported for pan-European stock exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The chairman of the Milan stock exchange
said in an interview published Thursday that Italy's bourse is
seeking to reach an agreement with the stock exchanges of London
and Frankfurt by the end of the year.
	   ``By the end of this month, there will be a multilateral
meeting, after many bilateral meetings, which have intensified
recently,'' Stefano Preda, chairman of Borsa Italiana SpA, told the
newspaper La Repubblica.
	   ``Our intention is to reach an accord in a brief time.''
	   Madrid's stock exchange said Wednesday that it's joining London
and Frankfurt in creating a pan-European stock exchange.
	   ``In addition to London, Frankfurt and Madrid, there may be two
or three other partners at the multilateral meeting,'' Preda said.
``In the end there will likely be six partners in all.''
	   Preda acknowledged it would be some time before a single
European bourse could be established, but that the alliance is a
step in that direction.

Ukrainian customer loses eye over 58-cent mayonnaise jar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A shopping trip cost a woman her eye after
she dropped a jar of mayonnaise and was attacked by an enraged
saleswoman, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The violence began when the 42-year-old woman accidentally
dropped the mayonnaise and refused to pay the saleswoman its price
of 2 hryvna (58 cents) in the market of the Ukrainian town of Nova
Kakhovka.
	   The angry saleswoman grabbed a piece of glass from the broken
jar and stabbed the customer in the eye, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
Emergency medics took the victim to a hospital, but could not save
her eye, it said.
	   The newspaper did not say when the incident occurred or if the
saleswoman was arrested.

Jospin encourages EU enlargement as well as EU reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ French Premier Lionel Jospin spoke
in favor of EU enlargement Thursday, but warned there was work to
be done on both sides before expansion becomes a fact.
	   Jospin arrived in Prague late Wednesday to meet with his Czech
counterpart, Milos Zeman, as well as President Vaclav Havel. He is
accompanied by Foreign minister Hubert Vedrine, Defense minister
Alain Richard and a group of prominent businessmen.
	   Enlargement of the European Union was expectably the focus of
his brief meeting with Havel Thursday.
	   Accession negotiations for new EU members which include the
Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia, started on November
10 initiating a period of nuts and bolts discussions and reform.
	   ``There are technical and legal problems which must be settled
to make enlargement a positive thing for the Czech Republic which
will dictate the (enlargement's) rhythm,'' Jospin said without
elaboration. ``We are naturally warmly in favor of early admission
of the Czech Republic in the EU.''
	   Pronouncements on enlargement have, however, turned more
cautious in recent years.
	   Speaking in Prague in April 1997, French President Jacques
Chirac said it was reasonable to believe Czechs could become EU
members by the year 2000.
	   ''I am not sure that can be done,'' Havel said Thursday. ''But I
would be happy if it could happen shortly after that, maybe in the
year 2003.''
	   Jospin called Havel's words ''wise and realistic'', adding pace
of reform and adaptation to EU requirements was crucial for each
candidate.
	   Jospin also acknowledged the need for EU to reform its
institutions before new members are admitted.
	   ``I am convinced we will move in that direction fast enough so
it doesn't interfere with enlargement which should be based solely
on economic matters,'' Jospin said. ``We have to clean up the house
to be able to welcome you properly.''
	   Before leaving for Paris later Thursday, Jospin was to meet with
Zeman, the Czech premier, and deliver a lecture on European
integration to the students of Prague's Charles University.

JERUSALEM: Palestinian-controlled areas.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At the Psagot settlement
near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement
trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the sums with
the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. The aid
would require congressional approval, and the United States might
impose some restrictions to make sure the money does not go toward
roads for Jewish settlers or fortifications of Jewish settlements.
	   Israeli media said Israel is seeking dlrs 1.2 billion for the
redeployment.
	   The Israeli Cabinet is divided over the Wye River peace accord
under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians complained that Israel
breached its promises by offering to free mostly criminals rather
than security prisoners, and it was not immediately clear whether
the dispute was resolved.
	   Before the Cabinet vote, the Palestinians met three obligations
under the peace accord. The published a decree against incitement
and a decree regarding illegal weapons, and also provided a list of
10 Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by Thursday. The armed forces
chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the Cabinet that the
Palestinians had already arrested more fugitives than required,
Israel radio said.
	   In a possible new dispute, Israel has accelerated the legal
process of turning about 10 percent of the West Bank, or 125,000
acres (50,000 hectares), into state lands that could be used for
settlement expansion, the Maariv daily and Israel radio said. The
land at issue is not privately owned by Palestinians and is not
farmed.
	   A spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank, Lt. Peter Lerner, said the process of turning unclaimed lands
into state lands has been going on for years.

Dutch fans dies of heart attack before Germany-Netherlands game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ A Dutch soccer fan died of a heart
attack on the way to the stadium to see the exhibition game between
Germany and the Netherlands, police reported Thursday.
	   The game, which ended in a 1-1 draw Wednesday evening, was held
among tight security because authorities had feared clashed between
German and Dutch fans, who are both notorious for occasional
violence-prone groups.
	   But police reported only 33 detentions and no major incidents.
	   The Dutchman died on the way to the stadium of a heart attack
was not identified.
	   Police arrested 27 Germans, five Dutch fans and a Croat who
lives in Germany.
	   ``It was an evening with virtually no disturbances,'' said
police chief Ulrich Grzella. ``We often have more to do at
Bundesliga games.''
	   ``The fans from both countries were very calm,'' he said.
	   More than 1,000 policemen from both countries were responsible
for security, including experts on soccer violence.
	   Seven Germans and three Dutchmen were arrested at the stadium,
for fighting and drunkenness, and 23 outside the ground, including
seven Germans with hooligan records. Seven Dutchmen were turned
away from the nearby border.

Italian goods ransacked at Istanbul market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Bags full of Italian food stuffs were
thrown to the ground and trampled on Thursday as a group entered an
Istanbul food market to protest Italy's reluctance to extradite a
Kurdish rebel leader to Turkey.
	   The action followed widespread calls for the boycott of Italian
products.
	   ``In just 24 hours we have seen a total interruption of trade
between our companies,'' Flavio Pasotti, vice president of Italy's
federation of small and medium industries, said in Italy.
	   Pasotti said about 120 companies had reported the cancellation
of orders or contracts by their Turkish partners.
	   Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner, with trade
volume between the two countries estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion.
Pasotti said it was difficult to quantify the losses from canceled
contracts to date.
	   He said he has advised the approximately 60,000 companies in the
federation not to sign new deals with Turkish companies because it
was too risky.
	   Italy's foreign trade minister has called for an emergency
meeting with Italian businesses to evaluate the extent of the
boycott.
	   Television footage in Istanbul showed people shouting
anti-Italian slogans while they stamped and crushed fruit.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, was detained last
week when he landed in Rome on a flight from Moscow. He has asked
Italy for political asylum but Turkey is pushing hard for his
extradition.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insists he won't give in to
pressure and pledged to stick to Italian law which prohibits
extradition to a country with the death penalty, which is in vigor
in Turkey.
	   Ocalan's Italian lawyer asked that the Kurd leader be released
from detention and placed under house arrest. A decision by the
prosecutor's office was expected Friday, the Italian news agency
ANSA said.

Indian magician defies fire but not fever

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ An Indian magician who awed audiences of
thousands by escaping unscathed from a burning haystack was not so
luck in eluding germs, the Gulf Daily News reported Thursday.
	   Gopinath Muthukad canceled weekend performances because of a
fever and throat infection, the English-language newspaper said.
	   Muthukad, from the southern Indian state of Kerala, is expected
to perform the trick again next week in which a crane lowers him
handcuffed and chained into the blazing haystack, and he emerges
unharmed _ and unchained.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Delivering pizzas while they're
still hot is a constant battle for couriers in the traffic-clogged
Dutch capital. But this pizza boy really blazed a trail.
	   Officers had to jump to the rescue of a pizza courier when they
saw that the heated box on the back of his moped was in flames and
billowing smoke, police reported Thursday.
	   The delivery boy, unaware of the fire, was riding through a
western suburb when he was stopped Wednesday by police who put out
the blaze, caused by a faulty heating element.
	   ``The pizzas survived, but had an extra-crunchy base,''
according to a police statement.

Regional officials to sign Japanese-Russian agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido
plan to sign a cooperation agreement with their counterparts in
Russia's Sakhalin region, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   The agreement comes at a time of thawing relations between
Russia and Japan, whose leaders are trying to resolve a
half-century-old dispute over the Kuril Islands, part of the
Sakhalin region just north of Hokkaido.
	   Russia claimed the islands after World War II. Japan has
consistently maintained that the seizure was illegal.
	   A delegation of Hokkaido officials arrived at the regional
capital of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Thursday, in advance of Hokkaido
Gov. Tatsuya Hori, who is scheduled to arrive Saturday, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   He and Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov are scheduled to sign an
agreement of friendship and economic cooperation that makes no
mention of the Kurils dispute, the news agency said.

Concern expressed over sale of performance-boosting supplement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leading British sports psychologists have
expressed concern over a performance-enhancing nutritional
supplement set to go on sale here.
	   NeuroGain, which works on the brain and is said to help athletes
focus better by improving mind and muscle coordination, will be
sold over the counter in Britain starting next year.
	   In a front-page report Thursday, the Guardian newspaper said
NeuroGain is banned in the Netherlands and contains some products
restricted in other European countries.
	   The paper quoted NeuroGain's manufacturers as saying the product
can help golfers, soccer players and runners by enhancing
concentration, allowing the brain to send clearer and stronger
signals to muscles.
	   The product was designed in the United States and is billed as a
``neurotransmitter support system.'' It will retail in Britain for
39.99 pounds (dlrs 64).
	   The Guardian quoted psychologists as warning that not enough is
known about the product and that athletes should be cautious.
	   ``There is not enough data,'' said professor David Collins of
the British Olympic Association's psychology steering group. ``We
know the mind can be prepared using illegal substances, but not
enough is known about what impact nutritional supplements can
have.''
	   ``My other concern is if you use a supplement like this to
improve concentration, then what happens when you can't get it?''
Collins said.

Lebanon pays tribute to Christian leader who helped end war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 8th graf that Hrawi a Muslim by deleting reference
to his religion; he is a Christian. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The government on Thursday paid tribute
to George Saade, leader of Lebanon's largest Christian political
party, as a man of peace who stood up to militants to preserve
religious coexistence and end the civil war.
	   Saade, head of the right-wing Phalange Party since 1986, died
Tuesday at 67 after a long struggle with colon cancer.
	   Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and political friends
and foes were among several thousand people at Saade's funeral in
St. Maroun's Church in downtown Beirut. President Hafez Assad of
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, also sent representatives.
	   A Maronite Catholic who served in Parliament from 1968 to 1992
and several times in the Cabinet, Saade's political life was marked
a radical shift in his stance toward Lebanon's Christian-Muslim
conflict.
	   Saade fought Muslims at the onset of civil war in 1975 but was
instrumental in negotiating with Muslim politicians in 1989 on a
power-sharing accord to end the conflict, which killed 150,000
people over 15 years.
	   Representatives of President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday eulogized
Saade as a man who helped end Lebanon's ordeal despite opposition
within his religious community.
	   In negotiating the Taif peace accord in Saudi Arabia, Saade was
criticized by militant Christians for surrendering too much power
to Muslims, ending the Christians' dominant role in the country.
	   Hrawi on Thursday bestowed on Saade the National Order of the
Cedar, Lebanon's top decoration. A statement on his behalf
described Saade as ``a true Lebanese ... who put Lebanon's interest
before the party.''

Philippines to conduct new mapping of its ocean floors
</HEADLINE>

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Trying to stay ahead of navigational
hazards, the Philippines will conduct a new mapping of its ocean
floors, including areas claimed by the Manila in the disputed
Spratly Islands, officials said Thursday.
	   ``This is entirely a scientific undertaking,'' said Ricardo
Bina, deputy administrator of the National Mapping and Resource
Information Authority. ``We need to update our knowledge of our
ocean floors every five years for maritime safety. A lot of things
can change in five years.''
	   Bina said the 1,177-ton hydrographic ship Presbitero,
commissioned in October, will begin with the Manila Bay area, the
country's busiest port, and finish there before the year ends.
	   He said new charting will include locations of sunken ships and
other navigational hazards.
	   From Manila Bay, Bina said the ship will proceed to the Sulu Sea
to begin charting waters around Mindanao, the main southern
Philippine island and the largest of 7,100 islands in the
archipelago.
	   He said its twin ship, Ventura, which will arrive later this
year, will begin mapping the country's coast line in the Pacific
Ocean and the South China Sea, including the disputed Spratlys.
	   ``But we will only do so if we can be assured of our safety,''
he said. If problems arise in the Spratlys, the Ventura will move
somewhere else in the Philippines and return to the South China Sea
when the situation improves.
	   The Philippines recently protested to China over the
construction of new structures on Mischief Reef, an area claimed by
both Manila and Beijing.
	   President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
agreed in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur early this week to resolve the
dispute peacefully.
	   The entire Spratlys are claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.
The Philippines and Malaysia claim only some areas and Brunei
claims one reef.
	   Bina said that aside from coastal and offshore topography, the
two ships will also monitor pollution and conduct seismic and
geological surveys. He said the ships were also capable of doing
submarine cable and pipe laying surveys.
	   He said each ship will have a crew of 40, including about 20
scientists.
	   He said the mapping of the country's ocean floor, a total of
about 2 million square kilometers (769,230 square miles), will
require at least five years.
	   The two ships were built by the Factorias Vulcano in the
shipping town of Vigo in Spain under a dlrs 50.3 million credit
facility from the Spanish government. It is payable over 30 years,
including a 10-year grace period.

Israeli Cabinet approves first West Bank troop pullback

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet removed the final obstacle to
a West Bank troop withdrawal on Thursday by giving the go-ahead to
the first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government handed over territory to
Palestinian control. Approval came after a series of delays and
disputes with the Palestinians that put the pullback five days
behind the original schedule.
	   Seven of 17 ministers voted in favor, five against and three
abstained.
	   The pullback was expected to be completed by Friday.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying settlements Thursday,
unloading rolls of barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At
the Psagot settlement near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops
built cement trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The Israeli government has set aside dlrs 45 million for
reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   Israeli and Palestinian commanders met Wednesday night to
complete preparations for the Israeli pullout. Israeli media
reports said the United States is to give Israel dlrs 1.2 billion
to cover the cost of the troop pullback. The grant, which would be
in addition to the dlrs 3 billion in military and economic aid
Israel receives from the United States every year, requires
congressional approval, the reports said.
	   In the first stage of the pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank,
110 square kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from
sole Israeli control to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In
addition, 7.1 percent of the land, 400 square kilometers (160
square miles), will be moved from joint jurisdiction to sole
Palestinian control.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler said that isolation will prompt some Israelis to
move.
	   Avner Sinwani said he would leave Ganim, a settlement of 51
families, if the community turned into a fortified enclave with
watch towers and barbed wire. ``If we have to stay inside a
fortress, I don't think anyone will want to stay and raise children
here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians have complained Israel
is offering to free mostly criminals rather than security
prisoners, and it was not clear whether the dispute has been
resolved.
	   The Palestinians met three obligations under the peace accord
before the Cabinet vote. They published a decree against incitement
and a decree regarding illegal weapons, and they provided a list of
10 Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by Thursday.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the
Cabinet that the Palestinians already had arrested more fugitives
than required, Israel radio reported.
	   In a possible new dispute, Israel has accelerated the legal
process of turning about 10 percent of the West Bank, or 125,000
acres (50,600 hectares), into state lands that could be used for
settlement expansion, the Maariv daily and Israel radio said. The
land at issue is not privately owned by Palestinians and is not
farmed.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Australia on Thursday announced the
appointment of an honorary consul to run its new consulate in the
northern port city of Salonica.
	   An announcement from the Australian embassy here said Christos
Gandas, a Greek-Australian businessman, would take the post in the
country's second largest city. Gandas is from the town of
Woollongong, 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Sydney.
	   Home to about 25,000 Australians, Salonica is considered a

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said
Thursday he is optimistic about Asia's chances to recover from its
economic crisis, and he praised China for helping out by refusing
to devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   Drawing from the words of one of China's most respected dynastic
historians, Ssu-ma Ch'ien, Kim said he was confident that Asia can
bounce back by finding ``fortune in misfortune.''
	   ``The future of the Asian economy is bright,'' Kim told South
Korean and Hong Kong business leaders after he arrived for the
first-ever trip to Hong Kong by an incumbent South Korean
president.
	   In a stopover on his way back from a summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia, Kim stressed the importance
of jointly developing democracy and free market economies.
	   He said discussions with Asia-Pacific leaders as well as recent
trips to Japan and China have given him confidence in the economic
future.
	   ``More than anything else, I was able to gain hope for the Asian
economy and strong confidence in the future of the Korean economy
because of the structural reform and openness that is being
pushed,'' he said.
	   South Korea itself has been a big casualty of the Asian crisis,
but now is trying to rebuild its economy under a dlrs 58 billion
bailout package led by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The South Korean leader blamed his country's economic crisis on
collusion between politicians and business leaders.
	   ``The cause of the crisis was, in a nutshell, the inability to
develop democracy and a free market economy at the same time,'' he
said.
	   He referred to his 40-year struggle for democracy, saying: ``I
am firmly convinced that the pain the Republic of Korea and other
nations are experiencing today will bring prosperity in the future
without fail.''
	   Kim spent 16 years in prison or house arrest under military
governments in the 1970s and 1980s but eventually became the first
opposition figure to lead South Korea.
	   Reforms in South Korea have removed obstacles that previously
hampered foreign and domestic business, he said.
	   Kim also lauded China's reforms of its government, financial
institutions and public corporations.
	   He praised China for contributing to the stability of the Asian
economies by maintaining the value of the yuan. A devaluation by
China, while potentially improving the short-term prospects of
troubled Chinese exporters, could set off another round of currency
devaluations in Asia, analysts have warned.
	   The latest crisis began in July 1997 when Thailand had to
devalue the baht.
	   Kim called Hong Kong important to the development of economic
cooperation between South Korea and China and cited the territory
as an example from which all Asian countries could learn.
	   ``Hong Kong's economy is a successful and exemplary case of the
best possible development of a market economy created amid great
political upheavals in modern times,'' he said.
	   South Korea's trade with Hong Kong totaled U.S. dlrs 12.6
billion last year, making Hong Kong the country's fifth largest
trade partner.

Lebanon pays tribute to Christian leader who helped end war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Lebanese government paid tribute
Thursday to the late George Saade, leader of Lebanon's largest
Christian political party, as a man of peace who stood up to
militants to preserve religious coexistence and end the civil war.
	   Saade, head of the right-wing Phalange Party since 1986, died
Tuesday at 67 of colon cancer.
	   Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and political friends
and foes were among several thousand people at Saade's funeral in
St. Maroun's Church in downtown Beirut. President Hafez Assad of
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, also sent representatives.
	   A Maronite Catholic who served in Parliament from 1968 to 1992
and several times in the Cabinet, Saade's political life was marked
a radical shift in his stance toward Lebanon's Christian-Muslim
conflict.
	   Saade fought Muslims at the onset of civil war in 1975 but was
instrumental in negotiating with Muslim politicians in 1989 on a
power-sharing accord to end the conflict, which killed 150,000
people over 15 years.
	   Representatives of President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday eulogized
Saade as a man who helped end Lebanon's ordeal despite opposition
within his religious community.
	   In negotiating the Taif peace accord in Saudi Arabia, Saade was
criticized by militant Christians for surrendering too much power
to Muslims, ending the Christians' dominant role in the country.
	   Hrawi on Thursday bestowed on Saade the National Order of the
Cedar, Lebanon's top decoration. A statement on his behalf
described Saade as ``a true Lebanese ... who put Lebanon's interest
before the party.''
	   Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir's eulogy, also read on his
behalf, said Saade was disappointed about the peace deal because
``he saw that the fruits were not of the size of the promises.''
	   Christians have complained that the peace accord was not fully
implemented, leading to greater Muslim power instead of the equal
status for both sects laid out in the accord.
	   Saade's casket, draped by the Phalange Cedar flag, was driven
north to the Batroun region in a long motorcade that made several
stops before burial in his hometown of Shibtin.

Fifteen killed by floods in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Devastating floods in western Ukraine have
claimed 15 lives and left more than 16,000 people infected with
various diseases, officials said Thursday.
	   The floods have largely receded from the Zakarpattia region,
leaving just nine of 118 settlements still inundated, the Emergency
Situations Ministry reported.
	   However, doctors were checking some 300,000 residents to block
the spread of infection from polluted drinking water. Many people
also required medical treatment for exposure after they were
trapped in the open by the floods.
	   About 6,000 emergency workers have restored electricity and gas
supplies and telephone communications, the ministry said. But
workers still have to repair several thousand buildings, as well as
numerous bridges, dams, roads and railway lines in the area.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort, and numerous organizations and
individual citizens across Ukraine have sent aid to Zakarpattia.
	   International organizations, including the Red Cross and United
Nations and countries such as China, France, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland and Slovakia have also provided assistance, according
to the Foreign Ministry.

Globus weekly: An intelligence service taps reporters' phones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The independent weekly Globus published
Thursday what it said was proof that one of the intelligence
services was tapping phones of its _ and likely other _ reporters.
	   Editor-in-chief Djurdjica Klancir said in the paper's latest
edition that a former close aide to President Franjo Tudjman showed
he files on Globus staffers, including her own file _ a compilation
of transcripts of her phone conversations as well as a resume of
her private life.
	   Hrvoje Sarinic had been Tudjman's closest aide since 1991 and
until recently a member of another intelligence service, so it can
be assumed that the information he gave Klancir was reliable.
	   The implicated Service for Protection of the Constitutional
Order and the Interior Minister _ who can authorize phone tapping
in cases when state security is jeopardized _ has declined to
comment on the Globus report.
	   Reporters, particularly those working for independent papers or
foreign agencies, have long suspected that their phones are being
tapped. Privately, they even joked about ``clicks'' they hear while
talking on the phone.
	   Klancir said that the intelligence service's files give a
detailed professional biography of each of Globus' journalists. It
also listed the instances when the paper criticized Tudjman and his
government.
	   ``I was additionally shocked to see that the intelligence
workers also had a deep analysis of my private life,'' Klancir
wrote.
	   ``What I gathered is that our office phones, and most likely our
private phones, are being tapped, that we are being `watched,'''
she said.
	   ``The tax payer's money is being used for financing the
monstrous interference in the private lives of those who are
critical of the government.''
	   Sarinic quit as Tudjman's adviser last month after he accused
another of Tudjman's close aides, Ivic Pasalic, of using military
counter-intelligence in a media campaign against his opponents.
	   A parliamentary commission rejected Sarinic's claims, but
opposition deputies walked out, claiming that members of
	   Tudjman's party actually only wantged to cover up the affair.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ An Indian magician who awed audiences of
thousands by escaping unscathed from a burning haystack was not so
lucky in eluding germs, the Gulf Daily News reported Thursday.
	   Gopinath Muthukad canceled weekend performances because of a
fever and throat infection, the English-language newspaper said.
	   Muthukad, from the southern Indian state of Kerala, is expected
to perform the trick again next week. In his performance, a crane
lowers him handcuffed and chained into the blazing haystack and he
emerges unharmed _ and unchained.

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ World Cup of Golf veteran
Seymour Rose, 58, said the slowed greens of the seaside Gulf Harbor
course made it a difficult first day for him _ 31 years after he
first played his first cup tournament in Mexico City.
	   After practice and pro-am days of criticism for the fast-running
greens, keepers cut them longer, causing Rose problems with his
short game.
	   Seymour fired a first round 80, which tied him third-last on the
64-player field. With playing partner Delroy Cambridge adding a
respectable even 72 to lie 27th in individual standings, the team
made a slow first day start to the tourney, ending tied for
third-last at 152 with Mexico.
	   Tail-enders are Luxembourg (159) and Netherlands (163).
	   A self-taught golfer who turned pro in 1960, Rose said at age 16
he was shooting par rounds on the local nine-hole course, learning
``as you go along. You sort of make sure you copy the guys who are
doing well.''
	   Living in the cricket-mad West Indies meant ``golf was not big
in Jamaica, it never took on among the local people.''
	   But living beside the local course as a kid made its impression.
	   ``I'm straight out of the old school,'' he said when asked why
he responded to the applause of gallery crowds.
	   ``Some of these (other) guys make a nice shot and they never
hear (the applause), y'know. They're there for something
different.''
	   Rose said he was pleased to have gone around with Welsh veteran
Ian Woosnam and teammate Phillip Price.
	   ``It sure helps to play along with these guys,'' Rose said.
	   Being a club superintendant at the Super Club golf club in
Jamaica's Runaway Bay meant he didn't see much international
competition each year.
	   ``I still maintain my (golf) professionalship and I'm still a
pro there. I play on my own course every day _ but it's not
(international) competition.''
	   But Rose remains fiercely proud of representing his country at
what he calls the Olympics of golf.
	   ``You're playing for the country and you want to make yourself s
proud as you can out there,'' he said as stood with sweat
glistening on his face after a tough round.
	   His best performance at a World Cup was a tie for 25th in teams
and a 37th in individual play. He will try again for the Jamaican
team at next year's World Cup in Malaysia. rl-tjh

Small explosion reported at Ukrainian nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A minor explosion occurred at an idle
reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant and output was
reduced at an adjoining reactor, officials said Thursday.
	   The small blast Wednesday involved a system that gathers water
that might escape from the main reactor coolant system, the Nuclear
Regulation Administration said.
	   The explosion deformed a tank at plant reactor No. 1, which has
been stopped for lengthy repairs until Jan. 21, 1999, and left a 15
centimeter (6 inch) crack along a welding joint, it said.
	   No radiation leaks were reported, the regulatory administration
said, according to the independent UNIAN news agency.
	   Also Wednesday, output at the plant's reactor No. 6 was briefly
reduced because the chemical composition of its cooling water
deteriorated, said the state Energoatom company, which runs
Ukraine's nuclear plants.
	   Energoatom said the reactor was brought to nearly full capacity
Thursday and that plant personnel were investigating the incident.
	   Earlier this month, Zaporizhia's reactor No. 5 was stopped and
restarted in an unscheduled systems check, even though government
officials have warned against the practice.
	   Zaporizhia, the largest nuclear plant in Europe located in
southeastern Ukraine some 630 kilometers (390 miles) from the
capital of Kiev, has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants have 14 reactors, which
account for more than 40 percent of the country's electricity
production. Six reactors were undergoing scheduled repairs as of
Wednesday, officials said.

	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Nick Faldo and John Daly, two
multi major winners looking for a way back into form, were happy
enough with their cautious sub-par starts at the World Cup of Golf
on Thursday.
	   But the Englishman and American were upstaged by a young
Japanese player without even a minor victory to his name.
	   Yasuharu Imano hit off in the first group and had the
outstanding score with an 8-under 64 on a Gulf Harbor course
playing better than expectations.
	   His round was enough to lead his two-man outfit to the front of
the 32-nation field in the 43rd edition of the teams event.
	   Imano, yet to win in two seasons as a professional, is ranked
31st on the Japanese tour and was making his first appearance at
the World Cup. Teammate Mitsutaka Kusakabe, also on debut, was less
spectacular with a 70 on the new 6,288-meter (6,850-yard) course as
Japan ended at 10-under 134, three ahead of nearest rival South
Africa.
	   Both players capped their rounds in the strokeplay format with
birdies at the 18th as good approaches left them within 10 feet.
	   ``My putting was very good today and I hit every green but
one,'' Imano said through an interpreter. ``It's my first time in a
team match and my leader (Kusakabe) helped me read the line.''
	   Scores were low despite several players tipping trouble from the
winds swirling around the ocean-front course. Tournament officials
appeared to heed the warnings on pin placements, giving the players
plenty of birdie chances. Imano said the greens were ``perfect''
compared to a day earlier.
	   The 479-meter (517-yard) par-5 2nd gave up five eagles and 33
birdies from the 64 players.
	   Several teams made a run at Japan but were unable to maintain
momentum as the wind picked up through the day.
	   Faldo, playing here in a bid to kick-start his form after a
difficult season, made a great start and was 5-under through the
opening nine. He dropped a shot at 10, got it back at 11 and
dropped it again at the spectacular par-4 16th, a hole which slopes
wickedly towards the Hauraki Gulf seas.
	   ``That's the highest I could have shot,'' said Faldo. ``There
were faults _ it was a case of looking, looking and looking,
identifying them and then working on one drill.''
	   England was at 3-under after David Carter's 1-over. Carter took
painkillers for a shoulder injury and struggled to read the break
on the greens.
	   Daly, who relished his previous U.S. team experience at the
Dunhill Cup this year, shot a 2-under 70 including an eagle at the
par-5 6th and a bizarre bogey at the 12th.
	   The bogey came when he was forced to hit a second ball from the
tee after his first was ignored by stewards and could not be found
in the rough. He had another bogey at the 14th.
	   ``That was the two holes that cost me a good four or five
shots,'' said Daly. ``But we hung in there and we're right in the
tournament and that's all we wanted today.''
	   Daly's teammate Scott Verplank also had 2-under as the pair were
placed seven shots behind the leaders.
	   Costantino Rocca, playing his ninth World Cup for Italy, had the
second best individual score with a 7-under 65. His partner,
Massimo Florioli, was 2-over, leaving Italy in a three-way tie for
fifth.
	   South Africa was second in the team's event, three behind Japan
at 7-under after David Frost shot a 66 and Nic Henning had a 71.
	   Sweden's Patrik Sjoland (68) and Mathias Gronberg (70) were tied
for third at 6-under with Australia's Peter O'Malley and Richard
Green, who both had 69s.
	   Pre-tournament favorite Scotland was 2-under after a
disappointing round from Europe's top player Colin Montgomerie.
	   He started well enough, with three birdies in the opening six
holes, but then gave the shots back to finish level. Andrew Coltart
also had three birdies from the opening six but dropped one.
	   Large galleries watched New Zealand's first hosting of the event
and Daly was clearly the biggest draw. Germany's Sven Struver got
the loudest reception however. He relieved himself in the trees on
16 and after finishing was sent on his way with a burst of cheers
and applause.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ An Indian magician who awed audiences of
thousands by escaping unscathed from a burning haystack was not so
lucky in eluding germs, the Gulf Daily News reported Thursday.
	   Gopinath Muthukad canceled weekend performances because of a
fever and throat infection, the English-language newspaper said.

Beckenbauer voted Germany's 'Player of Century'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer, who won the World
Cup as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990, has been voted
Germany's ``Player of the Century'' in a poll by soccer writers and
historians of the game.
	   Beckenbauer, a longtime captain of the German national team and
Bayern Munich, received 282 points in a poll conducted by the
German-based International Federation of Football History and
Statistics (IFFHS).
	   Gerd Mueller, Germany's leading scorer of all time and
Beckenbauer's colleague on the 1974 World Cup champion team and
Bayern Munich, finished second with 249 points in the poll released
Thursday.
	   Fritz Walter, captain of the team that won Germany's first World
Cup title in 1954, got 105 points and forward Uwe Seeler 72. Lothar
Matthaeus, the only active player on the list and who has played in
five World Cups in 130 national team appearances, a German record,
got 43 points.
	   Beckenbauer joins six other European stars who are candidates
for the title of ``European Player of the Century'' to be declared
at a ceremony Jan. 11.
	   They are Bobby Charlton of England, Johan Cruyff of the
Netherlands, Alfredo di Stefano of Spain, Eusebio of Portugal,
Ferenc Puskas of Hungary and Michel Platini of France.

Italian premier hints soccer diplomacy possible in dispute with
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday he
would accept an invitation to watch a soccer game in Istanbul if
the Turkish government agrees to peaceful dialogue on the sharp
dispute surrounding a Kurdish rebel leader held in Rome.
	   Turkey has been pressuring Italy to extradite the leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year-old
war for Kurdish autonomy. But D'Alema insists he won't be
intimidated and appears determined to refuse extradition.
	   Turkey's deputy premier has invited D'Alema to watch Italian
soccer champion Juventus of Turin play Istanbul's Galatasaray in a
Champions League game Wednesday.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport after he stepped
off a flight from Russia, which denied him asylum. Italy is now
weighing his asylum request.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000.
	   D'Alema's possible arrival worries Turkish authorities already
dealing with growing anti-Italian sentiment. Thousands of people
have taken to the streets across the country to protest over the
past week. Daily demonstrations take place in front of the Italian
embassy in Ankara.
	   Many Turks see the match as an opportunity to express their
anger with Italy over Ocalan. An ultranationalist paper, Ortadogu,
called on fans on Wednesday to prepare huge banners in Italian
denouncing Rome's attitude.
	   Juventus reportedly demanded tightened security for the game.

Philippines to conduct new mapping of its ocean floors

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Trying to stay ahead of navigational
hazards, the Philippines will conduct a new mapping of its ocean
floors, including areas claimed by Manila in the disputed Spratly
Islands, officials said Thursday.
	   ``This is entirely a scientific undertaking,'' said Ricardo
Bina, deputy administrator of the National Mapping and Resource
Information Authority. ``We need to update our knowledge of our
ocean floors every five years for maritime safety. A lot of things
can change in five years.''
	   Bina said the 1,177-ton hydrographic ship Presbitero,
commissioned in October, will begin with the Manila Bay area, the
country's busiest port, and finish there before the year ends.
	   He said new charting will include locations of sunken ships and
other navigational hazards.
	   From Manila Bay, Bina said the ship will proceed to the Sulu Sea
to begin charting waters around Mindanao, the main southern
Philippine island and the largest of 7,100 islands in the
archipelago.
	   He said its twin ship, Ventura, which will arrive later this
year, will begin mapping the country's coast line in the Pacific
Ocean and the South China Sea, including the disputed Spratlys.
	   ``But we will only do so if we can be assured of our safety,''
he said. If problems arise in the Spratlys, the Ventura will move
somewhere else in the Philippines and return to the South China Sea
when the situation improves.
	   The Philippines recently protested to China over the
construction of new structures on Mischief Reef, an area claimed by
both Manila and Beijing.
	   President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
agreed in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur early this week to resolve the
dispute peacefully.
	   The entire Spratlys are claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.
The Philippines and Malaysia claim only some areas and Brunei
claims one reef.
	   Bina said that aside from coastal and offshore topography, the
two ships will also monitor pollution and conduct seismic and
geological surveys. He said the ships were also capable of doing
submarine cable and pipe laying surveys.
	   He said each ship will have a crew of 40, including about 20
scientists.
	   He said the mapping of the country's ocean floor, a total of
about 2 million square kilometers (769,230 square miles), will
require at least five years.
	   The two ships were built by the Factorias Vulcano in the
shipping town of Vigo in Spain under a dlrs 50.3 million credit
facility from the Spanish government. It is payable over 30 years,
including a 10-year grace period.

Niger to send peacekeepers to Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ Niger is to send a contingent to join a
west African peacekeeping operation in war-ravaged Guinea-Bissau,
the government announced Thursday.
	   Five hundreds troops will be sent for a six month tour of duty
in the troubled West African country under a mandate to maintain
peace and to ensure the application of a peace accord signed
between the country's president and rebel fighters, the government
announced.
	   The decision followed a parliamentary debate on the issue
Wednesday in the capital Niamey, during which legislators raised
financial and political objections to the government proposal.
	   The announcement did not say when the deployment would take
place.
	   The conflict pitting Guinea-Bissau president Joao Bernardo
Vieira against former defense chief Ansumane Mane began in June
when disgruntled military veterans seized the main army garrison
and international airport in the capital, Bissau.
	   A cease-fire signed in August held for six weeks, but fighting
again erupted last month.
	   A peace agreement between the parties brokered by Gambia and
Nigeria was signed in Abuja Nov. 2.
	   The agreement calls for both sides to abide by the cease-fire,
the withdrawal of all foreign forces, and the introduction of a
buffer zone controlled by a West African peacekeeping force.

Philippines authorities intercept cyanide-stunned fish shipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine authorities on Thursday
intercepted 40 boxes of expensive live fish bound for trendy
restaurants in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan after being caught
illegally with cyanide.
	   ``This fish can kill you,'' said Benito Marcelo, chief of the
monitoring group Baywatch. ``We want to warm the people of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Tokyo to be very careful. If they think that because
the fish is alive and swimming in a tank, it is safe from chemical
fishing, they are wrong.''
	   To keep it alive before cooking, the fish is stunned with
cyanide so that it can be caught.
	   Marcelo said the shipment was found to contain .87 parts per
million of cyanide, which is poisonous to humans.
	   He said authorities had acted on a tip in seizing the shipment
of grouper fish at the Puerto Princesa airport bound for Manila en
route to the foreign destinations.
	   Groupers, which are caught in reefs, have a reputation for fine
meat. Marcelo said the fish is also believed to be an aphrodisiac
and a bringer of good luck and longevity.
	   Vonham Pratt of the U.S.-based International Marinelife
Alliance, which tested the shipment, said cyanide ingested by the
fish can accumulate in the human body and kill a person later.
	   Pratt, who manages a testing center in Puerto Princesa, said
cyanide not absorbed by the fish is left in the reefs, where it can
kill other fish.
	   Marcelo said the shipment will be burned because the fish also
would be fatal for animals.
	   He said the shippers of the fish would be charged in court.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan said
Thursday his country is using Poland's experience in transformation
from a communist to market economy and wants to develop bilateral
economic ties.
	   Akayev is the first president of the central Asian republic,
formerly a part of the Soviet Union, to visit Poland.
	   He discussed ways of increasing the volume of Poland's
investment in Kyrgyzstan with his host, President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Poland will cooperate closely with Kyrgyzstan within the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which it
presides over this year and in the United Nations, Kwasniewski said
at a news briefing following the meeting.
	   The presidents signed an agreement on developing friendly
relations and cooperation, while government officials signed
agreements on increasing tourist exchange and on avoiding double
taxation.
	   On Friday morning Akayev flies to Budapest, Hungary.

Clinton urges Japanese: patience, more openness

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Japanese
public Thursday not to be discouraged by their struggling economy,
but he also called for more openness to American-made goods.
	   ``Don't be discouraged, but do be determined. That would be the
advice of a friend,'' Clinton said at a ``town hall'' meeting
broadcast nationally from Tokyo.
	   After meeting Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Residence, the
American leader faced an hour of questions ranging from the
strained economic relations between Tokyo and Washington to
personal matters, including the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   ``The United States views Japan as our friend, our ally for the
future,'' Clinton told an audience of students, merchants and other
workaday Japanese.
	   ``We regret that you have the present economic challenges that
you have but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' he said.
	   ``If Japan is very strong, that brings back Asia,'' Clinton
said.
	   Clinton is visiting Japan and South Korea, two of Asia's most
important economies and home to the only two permanent postings in
Asia of American troops. Clinton skipped a summit meeting of Asian
and Pacific rim nations in Malaysia earlier this week to remain in
Washington to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   In a dinner toast, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi hailed
``the further development of U.S-Japanese relations.'' Clinton
responded that ``the relationship between our two countries has
always been important, but never more important than now.''
	   At the televised session earlier, a woman from Osaka bluntly
asked Clinton how he had apologized to his wife and daughter for
his affair with the former White House intern, and whether they had
forgiven him. The woman said she wouldn't be able to forgive her
husband for such behavior.
	   ``I did it in a direct and straightforward manner,'' Clinton
replied. As for forgiving him, ``I believe they did, yes,'' he
said, quickly adding, ``That's really a question you could ask them
better than me.''
	   Sensing the awkwardness, the TV moderator quickly interjected:
``Let's change the topic now.''
	   Clinton acknowledged at the outset efforts Japanese leaders have
undertaken to combat the nagging recession.
	   Obuchi announced earlier this week a dlrs 196 billion package of
spending and tax cuts to spur Japan's economy, the country's eighth
recovery plan, and largest, in eight years of economic distress.
Obuchi said he expected it to put Japan on a ``recovery orbit''
within two years, but the White House fears the package will turn
out to have less punch than advertised.
	   Yet, Clinton said, ``I think, to be fair to the present
leadership, they have not had enough time for people to make a fair
judgment. They just recently entered office. The problems that
Japan has today will not be solved overnight.''
	   ``The best days of Japan and the best days of America lie before
us in the 21st century if we determine to go there together,'' he
said.
	   Obuchi was elected prime minister in July and first met Clinton
in New York in September.
	   ``The difficulties, the challenges Japan has will not be solved
overnight,'' Clinton said, noting that it took his own
administration a while to achieve a stable economic program.
	   ``Do not judge too harshly, too quickly,'' he said of Obuchi's
efforts.
	   American pressure on Obuchi _ and on his predecessors _ to lead
Asia's economic recovery has grated on the Japanese, who believe
they are doing what is necessary and politically possible to end
their country's worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   The summit agenda for Clinton and Obuchi also included the
problem of communist North Korea, which startled the world _
especially Japan _ by test-firing a missile over Japan on Aug. 31.
Tokyo and Washington are worried by North Korea's missile and
nuclear weapons ambitions.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
described Singapore as a model economic manager Thursday on her
first official visit to the Southeast Asian island republic.
	   Arriving from neighboring Malaysia, where she attended the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Shipley met for about 40
minutes with her Singapore counterpart, Goh Chok Tong.
	   Their discussions focused on how to implement the trade and
financial resolutions from this year's APEC gathering, said
Shipley's spokeswoman.
	   ``As New Zealand moves to assume the chair of APEC, we look
forward to working closely with Singapore in 1999,'' Shipley said
later in a dinner speech.
	   She said the meetings in Kuala Lumpur ``achieved a credible
result, both in the focus on restoring growth in the region, and in
the agreement to take new market opening measures across into the
the World Trade Organization.''
	   But ``now the onus is on us to deliver results,'' she added.
	   Under a blazing tropical sun earlier Thursday, Shipley reviewed
an honor guard outside the colonial-style presidential palace
before her meeting with Goh.
	   She later attended a joint briefing by two of Singapore's key
planning agencies, the Economic Development Board and the Trade
Development Board, on the economic outlook for this affluent but
recession-struck island republic.
	   ``New Zealanders have long admired the way Singapore manages its
economy,'' Shipley said at the dinner. ``You are, for us, a model
of a small smart nation.''
	   Shipley was also briefed on Singapore's competitiveness report,
``which she found innovative,'' said her spokeswoman Anna Kominik.
	   The government-linked report prescribes bitter pills to combat
the economic slowdown in Singapore by reducing business costs,
mainly through slashed wages and pensions, and charts strategies to
steer the city-state into the next millennium.
	   Singapore is New Zealand's fourth largest foreign investor, and
the two countries enjoy strong growth in two-way trade.
	   ``Much of our commerce with Asia flows through Singapore,''
Shipley said in her dinner speech. ``Against the regional trend,
our exports to Singapore have grown strongly in the last year.''
	   She praised a recent open skies agreement between the two
countries, and their close military cooperation and joint training.
	   Shipley added that she and Goh had agreed on an initiative for
working exchanges by students from the two nations.
	   On Friday, she was to address the New Zealand business
community, witness Singapore Airlines operations, and lay a wreath
for New Zealand soldiers from World War II buried in Singapore.

Turkey sends warplanes to northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey sent six F-16 warplanes Thursday to
northern Cyprus in response to a similar move by Greece last month,
the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The jets landed at Gecitkale airbase, or Lefkoniko in Greek,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the port town of
Famagusta.
	   They flew in a month after Greek fighter jets took part in an
exercise in the southern Greek Cypriot sector of Cyprus. Turkish
jets will also join a Turkish exercise in the north of the island
Friday.
	   Tension has been running high on the island following Turkish
threats to take military action to prevent the planned deployment
by Greek Cypriots of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey considers the missiles a threat to its security.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish troops took control of the
northern third in 1974 to protect the Turkish minority in the wake
of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Since then, Turkey has maintained some 30,000 troops on Cyprus.

Israeli Cabinet approves first West Bank troop pullback

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clearing the final hurdle to a West Bank troop
pullback, Israel's Cabinet on Thursday narrowly gave the go-ahead
to the first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government handed over territory to
Palestinian control. Approval came after a series of delays and
disputes with the Palestinians. The pullback, expected to be
completed by Friday, was five days behind the original schedule.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the two sides have been
cooperating closely in recent days, after the initial acrimony.
``We hope the relationship can now improve,'' he said.
	   While the Cabinet debated, Israeli officers showed redeployment
maps to their Palestinian counterparts. Together, the group toured
the areas of the northern West Bank from which Israeli will
withdraw.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the
land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be moved
from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   In Qabatiyeh, a town of 17,000, many residents appeared
indifferent to the prospect of coming under full Palestinian rule.
No Palestinian flags or posters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
decorated the streets, as was customary in previous handovers.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Fayez Arafat, commander of Palestinian forces in the West Bank,
said his officers would take control of Qabatiyeh and the villages
of Tubas, Tamoun and Al-Fara over the next three days.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from flatbed trucks. At the Psagot
settlement near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built
cement trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the exact
amount with the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz.
	   The aid would require congressional approval, and the United
States might impose restrictions to make sure the money does not go
toward roads for settlers or fortifications of settlements.
	   Israeli media said Israel is seeking dlrs 1.2 billion for the
redeployment.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet is deeply divided over the Wye River
peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers voted in favor Thursday,
while five voted against and three abstained. Two Cabinet members
were abroad.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians said Israel breached
its promises by offering to free mostly criminals rather than
security prisoners.
	   A senior Israeli official said the Palestinians would have to
accept the Israeli decision, and that those whom the Palestinians
did not want would remain in jail.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh confirmed after the
Cabinet vote that the Palestinians have met their obligations so
far. They published a decree against incitement and a decree
regarding illegal weapons, and also provided a list of 10
Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by Thursday.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the
Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more fugitives
than required, Israel radio said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Joao Soares, the mayor of Portugal's
capital Lisbon, met jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in
a prison Thursday.
	   Details of the talks were not known as Soares declined to answer
reporters' questions in English after the one-hour meeting with
Gusmao at the Cipinang penitentiary in Jakarta's eastern outskirts.
	   Gusmao was arrested in 1991 and is serving a 20-year term for
fighting Indonesian troops in the former Portuguese colony. In
recent months, he has been granted greater access to foreign
visitors.
	   Soares also met Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and opposition
leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno.
	   The future of East Timor dominated the talks, officials said.
	   ``He wanted to know the latest developments in East Timor,''
said Supriyanto, a foreign office spokesman.
	   The spokesman said Alatas briefed Soares on recent changes in
the Indonesian government that have paved the way for a proposal to
grant autonomy to East Timor.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after its troops invaded in
a civil war a year earlier.
	   The United Nations, however, still consider Portugal the
administering power of the half-island territory.
	   The world body is sponsoring talks between Jakarta and Lisbon on
the territory's future.
	   Some Portuguese politicians and East Timorese exile groups in
Lisbon severely criticized Soares for his visit, saying he was
cooperating with a malevolent regime and accusing him of seeking
political gain.
	   Soares is the son of former President Mario Soares and is an
influential member of the Portuguese Socialist Party.
	   However, some groups praised his trip as an effort to thaw
relations with Jakarta and ease the way for a solution to East
Timor.

Philippines authorities intercept cyanide-stunned fish shipment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX SLUG &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine authorities on Thursday
intercepted 40 boxes of expensive live fish bound for trendy
restaurants in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan after being caught
illegally with cyanide.
	   ``This fish can kill you,'' said Benito Marcelo, chief of the
monitoring group Baywatch. ``We want to warm the people of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Tokyo to be very careful. If they think that because
the fish is alive and swimming in a tank, it is safe from chemical
fishing, they are wrong.''
	   To keep it alive before cooking, the fish is stunned with
cyanide so that it can be caught.
	   Marcelo said the shipment was found to contain .87 parts per
million of cyanide, which is poisonous to humans.
	   He said authorities had acted on a tip in seizing the shipment
of grouper fish at the Puerto Princesa airport bound for Manila en
route to the foreign destinations.
	   Groupers, which are caught in reefs, have a reputation for fine
meat. Marcelo said the fish is also believed to be an aphrodisiac
and a bringer of good luck and longevity.
	   Vonham Pratt of the U.S.-based International Marinelife
Alliance, which tested the shipment, said cyanide ingested by the
fish can accumulate in the human body and kill a person later.
	   Pratt, who manages a testing center in Puerto Princesa, said
cyanide not absorbed by the fish is left in the reefs, where it can
kill other fish.
	   Marcelo said the shipment will be burned because the fish also
would be fatal for animals.
	   He said the shippers of the fish would be charged in court.

	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ A quiet suburb of the Swiss city of
Basel is being transformed into a bustling cultural mecca, with up
to 500,000 visitors expected to view the latest works of art by
Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
	   Fulfilling a long-held dream, the husband-and-wife artists are
in the process of wrapping 163 trees in a museum park.
	   Although less grandiose than previous projects like the 1995
wrapping of Germany's Reichstag, Christo said Thursday he was
enjoying the latest challenge.
	   ``It was impossible to shape the forms in advance. That's the
exciting thing about this project,'' he said. ``Each tree has its
own personality.''
	   The project involves 55,000 square meters (461,000 square feet)
of woven polyester fabric and 23 kilometers (14 miles) of rope.
	   It opens to the public Saturday. Weather permitting, the
``wrapped trees'' will be on display until January.
	   The artists waited until the leaves dropped to start the
wrapping. The material used lets air pass through and is used in
Japan to protect trees in winter.
	   The display coincides with a ``Magic of Trees'' exhibition
inside the Beyeler museum featuring works of art from Picasso,
Chagall, Cezanne and Giacometti _ to name but a few.
	   Beat Privat, head of administration at the museum, said
organizers were expecting up to half a million people to visit the
exhibition.
	   With up to 20,000 people expected on a typical weekend, local
authorities have put in place stringent traffic regulations to
ensure that the village of Riehen is not overwhelmed.
	   Special rail and air packages are being offered to encourage
people to use public transport.
	   Authorities are also launching an advertising campaign to deter
parking offenders.
	   ``This is not a Christo,'' reads the advert featuring a parking
ticket for 120 Swiss francs (dlrs 88).

India sets up national security council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's Hindu nationalist government set
up a national security council Thursday where politicians would
work with military generals to plan the country's defense policy.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who will head the council,
named his chief aide Brajesh Mishra as national security adviser,
United News of India news agency reported. Mishra will hold both
positions.
	   The council will include the federal Interior Minister, the
Defense Minister, the External Affairs Minister, the Finance
Minister and the chief of the Planning Commission, UNI reported.
The chiefs of army, air force and navy and civilian officials will
be part of the council's strategic policy group.
	   Military leaders see a council as a way to have more input on
spending to defend India against China in the north and Pakistan in
the west. India has fought three wars against Pakistan and one
against China in the past 50 years over territorial disputes.
	   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party promised to
establish the council after it came to power in March, leading a
19-party coalition. In less than two months, Prime Minister
Vajpayee ordered five nuclear tests, saying it had become necessary
to acquire a nuclear deterrent against its powerful regional
neighbors.
	   A proposal first surfaced in the late 1980s to create an Indian
body similar to the U.S. National Security Council, where
politicians, bureaucrats and military leaders could sit together to
make defense policy.
	   On Tuesday, nearly 10,000 Indian soldiers carried out a mock
land-and-sea assault on an island on India's western stretch close
to Pakistan. The annual exercises were the biggest Indian military
maneuvers since 1987, which brought the two countries to the brink
of a fourth confrontation.
	   Two of the three past conflagrations between India and Pakistan
were over the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, divided between
the two countries when the British gave South Asia its
independence.

Britain to sign war crimes tribunal treaty Nov. 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain confirmed Thursday that it will sign a
treaty to set up an international war crimes tribunal as a sign of
commitment to the project, which is opposed by the United States.
	   Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said Britain will sign at a
Nov. 30 ceremony at the United Nations in New York.
	   Britain was among 120 nations that agreed at a Rome conference
in July to set up the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal.
The United States strongly opposed the project because it failed to
get exemption for American citizens from the court's reach.
	   The court will be empowered only to try cases of heinous crimes
committed after it is set up.
	   Lloyd, addressing a parliamentary group, said the court was an
important advance in international justice, human rights and
preventing future conflicts.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A commuter plane made an
emergency landing at Johannesburg International Airport Thursday
when its front landing wheel jammed.
	   The 16-seat South African Airlink plane was approaching the
airport on a flight from Mmabatho, a town west of Johannesburg on
the Botswana border, when the crew realized the landing gear had
jammed, the airline said.
	   They circled for an hour, unsuccessfully trying to release the
wheel manually.
	   Emergency services were alerted at the airport and the runway
was sprayed with foam. The plane landed safely, and none of the
nine passenger and crew aboard the Dornier 228 aircraft was
injured, Airlink said.

	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ Djibouti on Thursday confirmed that it had
broken diplomatic relations with neighboring Eritrea over claims by
Asmara that Djibouti favors Ethiopia in the six-month border
conflict between the two Horn of Africa nations.
	   On Wednesday, authorities in Asmara said Djibouti had closed its
embassy there without informing them of the reason.
	   Observers say Djibouti may also have been moved to break ties
with Eritrea because of an increase in attacks by Afar rebels
against government soldiers and Ethiopian trucks headed for
Djibouti port. The rebels have attacked from bases along the
Eritrean border.
	   --
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
government and rebels met Thursday to discuss implementation of a
Nov. 2 peace deal, amid heightening tension along their military
front lines, news reports said.
	   Although the November cease-fire _ which ended a five-month-old
civil war in the former Portuguese colony _ has not been broken,
reports say both sides have strenghthened their positions on the
ground.
	   Most residents on Wednesday fled the western side of the capital
Bissau _ where both sides were entrenched _ fearing a breakout of
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, officials representing the government and the rebels
were expected to discuss increasing the distance between each
side's front, in addition to the peace terms, Lusa reported.
	   The agreement stipulated the deployment of a Nigerian-led
regional peacekeeping force, and the withdrawal of troops from
neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, which were backing
the government.

Georgia, in June, arrived in Harare aboard a chartered aircraft on
Wednesday, his family said, according to the independent Financial
Gazette.
	   Boka, aged in his 60s, was ``very, very sick'' and wanted only
to be with his family, his daughter Rudo told the newspaper.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper said police were eager to
interview him on his alleged transfer abroad of dlrs 21 million
drawn from his collapsing business empire.
	   In April, the state central bank shut down his private bank and
tobacco and trading companies to investigate alleged
irregularities, a move that shook confidence in the nation's
banking and financial services sector.
	   Boka's bank was one of several ``indigenous'' finance houses
hailed as breaking the traditional domination of the financial
sector by mostly white-managed foreign banks.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A widow testifying at the first hearing
of Uganda's Human Rights Court accused a former police commander of
killing her husband while he was in custody.
	   Sarah Nakirya on Wednesday charged that Martin Abilu killed her
husband Joseph Sentoogo and two other people, who also were in
police custody, on Jan. 10, state-run New Vision newspaper
reported.
	   Abilu, currently No. 3 in the police patrol unit, was implicated
along with the Police Detective Inspector Archangel Okello,
Detective Sgt. John Buyinza and Cpl. Junenan, whose first name was
not provided.
	   Sentoogo, Abdu Ssali and Robert Ssekadde were killed at the
Lubenge swamp, 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Kampala.
	   Police say all three were killed while trying to escape custody.
	   Buyinza and Junena pleaded innocent, and asked for an
adjournment to allow them to find lawyers. Okello was at his
mother's funeral, and did not enter a plea.

	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) _ Marijuana growers, working deep in a
national forest, are using children as laborers and traffickers, a
legislator said.
	   The growers have abandoned plantations at the fringes of Mount
Kenya National Park, 140 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of
Nairobi, where police earlier this year destroyed hectares (acres)
of marijuana, and now are in more remote sections of the park,
journalists were told during a tour Wednesday.
	   During the tour, the rangers said the growers are using children
to farm and deliver their crops because they are cheap and seldom
suspected. The children are supervised by adults armed with bow and
arrows, the rangers said.
	   Forest rangers said although they knew where the illegal farming
was being done, they didn't dare destroy the plots because the
growers and traffickers were protected by influential people.
	   The rangers said they didn't have enough staff or equipment to
counter the marijuana growers. Five rangers, armed with whips and
clubs, cover a radius of 30 kilometers (25 miles).

Wife of Philips boss was beaten, strangled, left for dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ She was beaten, nearly blinded,
handcuffed, strangled and left for dead in a deserted parking lot.
	   Nearly a week later, police say they still don't know why the
estranged wife of Royal Philips Electronics president Cor Boonstra
was the victim of an attack so vicious it almost took her life.
	   The affair has gripped the Netherlands. With justice officials
divulging few details of the investigation, newspapers have been
dedicating entire pages to speculation about a motive.
	   Lying severely injured in a hospital bed Thursday, the
jet-setting socialite at the center of the storm knows little about
it.
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, was found last Friday by a passing
motorist in the seaside town of Hoek van Holland, handcuffed,
chilled from exposure, bloodied and bruised _ and fighting for her
life.
	   She still has not been able to tell investigators what happened.
	   Citing unnamed sources, the Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported
details of Boonstra-Raatjes' injuries Thursday next to a picture of
her elegantly dressed and coiffed.
	   She suffered a serious head wound, a broken arm, a number of
broken fingers and may lose the sight in one eye, De Telegraaf
reported. Her attacker or attackers also tried to strangle her.
	   Doctors have upgraded her condition from critical to stable.
Dutch media reported that Cor Boonstra, who is separated from his
wife, has kept up a bedside vigil for most of the week.
	   Police, who have 20 detectives investigating the case, say they
have ruled out the possibility that Boonstra-Raatjes had been
kidnapped. There was never a ransom demand, and nobody claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   They have not ruled out the possibility that she may have been
attacked by a disgruntled former employee of Philips, Europe's
biggest consumer electronics company.
	   ``I can't say why, but there are indications that this was a
deliberate payback,'' said Carola de Kimpe of the Rotterdam Public
Prosecutor's office.
	   Many Dutch still assume her wealth made her the target of an
aborted kidnap attempt. According to newspaper accounts, when she
wasn't at her exclusive villa just over the Dutch border in
Belgium, she was often on the golf course or in the Bahamas soaking
up the sun.
	   Yet although she remains wed to one of the nation's top
managers, Boonstra-Raatjes rarely made the headlines in the
Netherlands, where the rich and famous jealously guard their
private lives.
	   The first time Boonstra-Raatjes made the news was earlier this
year, when her husband of 20 years left her and moved in with
Sylvia Toth, a former Dutch businesswoman of the year.
	   Philips has declined to comment on the case beyond describing
Boonstra-Raatjes' ordeal as ``deeply tragic.''
	   If it was a kidnapping gone awry, it would not be the first time
a prominent member of Dutch society has been abducted:
	   _ In 1982, Toos van der Valk, the wife of a motel magnate, was
kidnapped. She was released after payment of a 12 million guilder
(dlrs 6.4 million) ransom.
	   _ In 1983, brewing tycoon Freddy Heineken and his chauffeur were
kidnapped by a gang who released them only after receiving a 35
million guilder (dlrs 18.6 million) ransom. The kidnappers were
later arrested and most of the money was recovered.
	   _ In 1987, grocery multi-millionaire Gerrit-Jan Heijn was
kidnapped and murdered. Not knowing he had been killed, his
company, Ahold, paid 7 million guilders (dlrs 3.7 million) and
1,000 cut diamonds in ransom. Heijn's murderer was later arrested
and jailed for 20 years.
	   _ In 1987, Valerie Jelgersma, the daughter of a supermarket
chain owner, was released by kidnappers after her family handed
over a 1.5 million guilder (dlrs 798,000) ransom.

Italian premier hints soccer diplomacy possible in dispute with

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday he
would accept an invitation to watch a Champions League match in
Istanbul if the Turkish government agrees to peaceful dialogue on
the sharp dispute surrounding a Kurdish rebel leader held in Rome.
	   Turkey has been pressuring Italy to extradite the leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year-old
war for Kurdish autonomy. But D'Alema insists he won't be
intimidated and appears determined to refuse extradition.
	   Turkey's deputy premier has invited D'Alema to watch reigning
Serie A titlist Juventus of Turin face Istanbul's Galatasaray in a
Champions League game Wednesday. Juventus, which has drawn all four
of its games in this year's competition, needs a victory if it
hopes to reach a fourth consecutive cup final.
	   Many Turks see the match as an opportunity to express their
anger with Italy over Ocalan. An ultranationalist paper, Ortadogu,
has called on fans to prepare huge banners in Italian denouncing
Rome's attitude.
	   Juventus reportedly demanded tightened security for the game.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport after he stepped
off a flight from Russia, which denied him asylum. Italy is now
weighing his asylum request.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000.
	   D'Alema's possible arrival worries Turkish authorities already
dealing with growing anti-Italian sentiment. Thousands of people
have taken to the streets across the country to protest over the
past week. Daily demonstrations take place in front of the Italian
embassy in Ankara.

Nepalese king leaves for London for treatment

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's King Birendra, suffering from
heart trouble, flew Thursday to London for medical treatment.
	   The king experienced cardiac ischemia, or a block in the flow of
blood, on Wednesday night, said government officials who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity. It was the second reported
episode this month.
	   The 52-year-old king was accompanied by Queen Aishworya and his
physicians on his trip to London, but officials did not say where
he would be treated.
	   Before leaving for Britain, King Birendra set up a council of
royal representatives, headed by his son, Crown Prince Dipendra, to
look after his duties as a constitutional monarch.
	   The Harvard-educated king ascended to the throne in 1972 after
the death of his father King Mahendra.
	   He was an absolute monarch until 1990, when a pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that made a figurehead of
the throne. Nepal has been politically unstable since then, with
parties and factions _ including a royalist group _ undermining
each other in a constant power struggle. The country has had five
prime ministers in the last four years.

Defending champion Italy beats United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Italy beat the United States
15-6, 15-2, 15-12 Thursday for its second victory against no
defeats in the second round of the Men's World Volleyball
Championships.
	   Italy, also the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, needed only one
hour, 12 minutes to beat the Americans, who are winless in the
16-team second round.
	   ``We played at a very high pace today. I believe the Americans
were tired after their very long match against Russia yesterday,''
said Italian captain Andrea Gardini.
	   The U.S. team played nearly three hours in losing to Russia on
Wednesday.
	   ``We made a lot of mistakes and I'm not afraid to say we played
terribly ...,'' said American captain Lloyd Ball.
	   In another Group H match, the Netherlands, the 1996 Olympic
champion and 1994 world silver medalist, also scored its second
victory of the round, beating Ukraine 14-16, 15-11, 15-8, 16-14 at
Chiba-Makuhari Messe Hall near Tokyo.
	   Russia beat China 15-8, 16-17, 17-16, 15-9, and Yugoslavia beat
Greece 11-15, 15-3, 15-9, 15-5, with both winners remaining
undefeated in the second round.
	   In Group G matches in Hiroshima, western Japan, Cuba, whose
women's team defended its world title last Thursday, beat Canada
15-10, 10-15, 15-12, 15-5 in 2 hours, 12 minutes.
	   The Canadians were obviously hoping to repeat their upset
victory over the Cubans in the North American qualifying stages in
Havana nine months ago.
	   Brazil beat South Korea 15-13, 15-5, 15-9, and Bulgaria edged
Argentina 15-8, 16-17, 15-7, 10-15, 15-9.
	   Spain edged Japan 15-5, 13-15, 15-8, 11-15, 15-12.
	   Brazil, Spain and Cuba are 2-0 in the second round. Argentina
and Bulgaria are 1-1.
	   The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
advanced to the current round robin, which lasts until Nov. 26.
	   The semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Nov. 28-29.

Burkina Faso president reelected by large majority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Incumbent president, Blaise
Compaore won a resounding electoral victory, extending his mandate
by another seven years, Burkina Faso's elections commission said
Thursday.
	   Compaore received 88 percent of the vote in last weekend's
election, while the next closest candidate, Green Party contender
Ram Ouedraogo, got only 7 percent. The remaining 5 percent of the
votes went to a third candidate or were spoiled ballots.
	   The victory, however, came against little real competition. Most
opposition candidates had opted to boycott the vote and the two
candidates who did run were seen as political outsiders who were
actually Compaore supporters.
	   For Burkina Faso, however, the peaceful election was an overall
victory for democracy, Compaore said.
	   ``My concern today is that the population choose to vote and
participate in these elections,'' he said.
	   About 56 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in Sunday's
polls, up by more than 30 percent from the last presidential
election in 1991.
	   Opposition leaders had been campaigning for a widespread boycott
of the election, saying it was flawed and that Compaore had
manipulated the registration process in his favor.
	   Independent election monitors from the European Union and
Burkina Faso earlier this week declared the election free and open.
	   The 47-year-old Compaore, a former army captain, first came to
power in 1987 after he led a military mutiny that ended in the
shooting death of then dictator Capt. Thomas Sankara.
	   Compaore resigned his army commission to participate in 1991's
elections and has since been trying to establish the groundwork for
a multi-party democracy in Burkina Faso.
	   ``I would like to pay homage to the political action of our
people, who by mobilizing for this election have strengthened the
state and the rule of law,'' Compaore told reporters.

Dutch fan dies of heart attack after Germany-Netherlands game

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ A 61-year-old Dutch soccer fan
died of a heart attack after watching the exhibition game between
Germany and the Netherlands, police reported Thursday.
	   The game, which ended in a 1-1 draw Wednesday evening, was held
among tight security because authorities had feared clashed between
German and Dutch fans, who are both notorious for occasional
violence-prone groups.
	   But police reported only 33 detentions and no major incidents.
	   The Dutchman who died of a heart attack was not identified.
	   Police arrested 27 Germans, five Dutch fans and a Croat who
lives in Germany.
	   ``It was an evening with virtually no disturbances,'' said
police chief Ulrich Grzella. ``We often have more to do at
Bundesliga games.''
	   ``The fans from both countries were very calm,'' he said.
	   More than 1,000 policemen from both countries were responsible
for security, including experts on soccer violence.
	   Seven Germans and three Dutchmen were arrested at the stadium,
for fighting and drunkenness, and 23 outside the ground, including
seven Germans with hooligan records. Seven Dutchmen were turned
away from the nearby border.

Thailand preparing to seek extradition of fugitive financier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand is preparing to request the
extradition from the United States of a former finance company
chief wanted for alleged unlawful loan practices, a senior police
officer said Thursday.
	   Police are collecting evidence against Pin Chakkapak, former
head of Finance One, to submit to the Thai Attorney-General's
Office, police Maj. Gen. Somwong Lipipun, chief of the Economic
Crime Investigation Division, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The central bank has filed criminal charges accusing Pin and two
other executives of Finance One of failing to adequately scrutinize
loans to two affiliated companies.
	   The bank's charges, filed with Somwong's office, accuse them of
lending a total of 2.13 billion baht (dlrs 59.2 million) to two
holding companies without collateral.
	   Somwong said the attorney-general must decide whether the
evidence collected by police is sufficient to prosecute Pin in a
Thai court before a request can be made to U.S. authorities for
Pin's extradition.
	   He said the procedures on the Thai side alone can take as long
as one year.
	   Somwong said Pin was in the United States while the other two
executives have already reported to his office and have been set
free on bail. He was not more specific about Pin's whereabouts.
	   He identified the other two as Samran Kanokwatanawan and
Termchai Pinyawat.
	   The Bank of Thailand had previously said it plans to file other
charges against Finance One, which before its collapse was the
country's largest non-bank lender.
	   Published reports last month said Pin was offering to surrender
and cooperate in regaining the money from the bad loans he was
allegedly responsible for, in return for an agreement that no new
charges would be filed against him.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul, however,
rejected any deal, saying it was a matter of principle.
	   ``The Bank of Thailand believes that this is a matter that has
far greater implications then just in the courtroom. It would send
a wrong message to the public if there were any deal made,'' said a
bank spokesman.
	   Reckless lending, sometimes to business cronies and politicians,
contributed to a crisis in Thailand's financial sector that led to
the closing of 56 of the country's 93 finance companies by the
government.
	   The crumbling of Thailand's financial sector helped trigger the
regional economic meltdown that began in 1997.

Israeli Cabinet approves first West Bank troop pullback

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clearing the final hurdle to a West Bank troop
pullback, Israel's Cabinet on Thursday narrowly gave the go-ahead
to the first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government handed over territory to
Palestinian control. Approval came after a series of delays and
disputes with the Palestinians. The pullback, expected to be
completed by Friday, was five days behind the original schedule.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the two sides have been
cooperating closely in recent days, after the initial acrimony.
``We hope the relationship can now improve,'' he said.
	   While the Cabinet debated, Israeli officers showed redeployment
maps to their Palestinian counterparts. Together, the group toured
the areas of the northern West Bank from which Israeli will
withdraw.
	   In the first stage, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), will be transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the
land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), will be moved
from joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   In Qabatiyeh, a town of 17,000, many residents appeared
indifferent to the prospect of coming under full Palestinian rule.
No Palestinian flags or posters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
decorated the streets, as was customary in previous handovers.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Fayez Arafat, commander of Palestinian forces in the West Bank,
said his officers would take control of Qabatiyeh and the villages
of Tubas, Tamoun and Al-Fara over the next three days.
	   No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division.
	   The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   One settler, Avner Sinwani, said he moved to Ganim, a settlement
of 51 families, for a peaceful, rural life and would leave if the
community turned into a fortified enclave with watch towers. ``If
we have to stay inside a fortress, I don't think anyone will want
to stay and raise children here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying settlements, unloading rolls of
barbed wire and cement blocks from flatbed trucks. At the Psagot
settlement near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built
cement trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions.
	   The government has set aside 190 million shekels (dlrs 45
million) for reinforcing 18 settlements.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the exact
amount with the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz. Such aid would require congressional approval.
	   Israeli media said Israel is seeking dlrs 1.2 billion for the
redeployment.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet is deeply divided over the Wye River
peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers voted in favor Thursday,
while five voted against and three abstained. Two Cabinet members
were abroad.
	   In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians said Israel breached
its promises by offering to free mostly criminals rather than
security prisoners.
	   A senior Israeli official said the Palestinians would have to
accept the Israeli decision, and that those whom the Palestinians
did not want would remain in jail.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh confirmed after the
Cabinet vote that the Palestinians have met their obligations so
far. They published a decree against incitement and a decree
regarding illegal weapons, and also provided a list of 10
Palestinian fugitives to be jailed by Thursday.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the
Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more fugitives
than required, Israel radio said.

Rwanda denies involvement in Congo's 1996-97 massacres
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Responding to Congolese accusations, the
government on Thursday said it was not responsible for the killing
of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Congo's 1996 war, instead blaming
President Laurent Kabila for covering up the massacres.
	   Last week, Congo's ambassador to Kenya, Gabriel Kyungu
Wa-Ku-Mwanza, said Rwandan-backed Tutsi rebels massacred thousands
of Hutu refugees in a 1996-97 war that toppled longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko and installed Kabila in power.
	   Wa-Ku-Mwanza invited a new U.N. investigation into the
allegations.
	   A statement from the office of Rwandan Vice President Maj. Gen.
Paul Kagame said anti-Mobutu forces were under the command of
Kabila, and also included members of former Zairian army and
hastily trained youth with no military experience.
	   ``Rwanda believes that this is merely an attempt by Kabila to
hide the crimes of his own government, by sidetracking the
international community into focusing on past incidents and not
those presently being committed as part of Congolese government
policy,'' the statement said.
	   The United Nations withdrew its investigators from Congo in
April, citing a lack of cooperation from the government, which
harassed and intimidated witnesses who spoke with the experts.
	   But Wa-Ku-Mwanza blamed the roadblocks on Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi
who was Kabila's foreign minister until he defected to the rebels
who have been trying to topple Kabila since Aug. 2.
	   Rwanda and neighboring Uganda have backed the rebels with troops
and arms, accusing Kabila of failing to rid the common border of
Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   ``The international community will recall that Mr. Kabila and
his government deliberately and repeatedly frustrated a U.N. team
which was sent by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to investigate the
killing in eastern Congo of the refugees,'' the government said in
a statement.
	   ``What Mr. Wa-Ku-Mwanza is attempting to do now is to shift the
blame to Rwanda in the vain hope that this will win Mr. Kabila
friends in the international community and the U.N.,'' the Rwandan
statement said.
	   Kabila's Tutsi-backed rebellion forces have been accused of
targeting Rwandan Hutus to avenge the genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.
	   There have been persistent reports that Kabila's forces killed
Rwandan refugees in sites stretching from Uvira, an eastern border
town where the rebellion began in September 1996, to Mbandaka,
1,250 kilometers (780 miles) to the west.
	   Some U.N. officials have asserted that up to 200,000 people were
massacred, but those who worked with refugees in Congo itself put
the figure much lower, in the tens of thousands.

Top Chinese legislative official calls for market rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's top legislative official has
called for speedy passage of a securities law to ensure future
healthy growth of the country's stock markets, state media said
Thursday.
	   Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, said stock markets are an integral part of the Chinese
economy that have seen rapid growth since they were introduced
eight years ago.
	   But Li said regulatory problems have cropped up due to the lack
of a complete body of rules to regulate trade.
	   ``We must use the rule of law to bring about standardization of
the markets,'' Li said, in remarks published by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
	   China's stock markets have grown from just a handful of listed
companies worth some dlrs 200 million to more than 800 companies
now traded on the two markets in Shanghai and the southern city of
Shenzhen. Those companies now have a total market capitalization of
some dlrs 240 billion.
	   But regulatory problems abound. Despite multiple efforts, the
People's Congress has failed to pass a national securities law. The
latest attempt was in late October, when the NPC again considered
the law for passage.
	   Li visited Shenzhen, home to many of the most intractable
regulatory problems, to collect opinions of industry officials. He
called for the speedy passage of the law during the next NPC
meeting.

West urges them on, but Albanians doubt constitution means

democracy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ From TV appearances to public utterances,
Western officials are campaigning for a ``yes'' vote for this
Balkan nation's first post-communist constitution, calling Sunday's
referendum critical for its future democracy.
	   Worn down by years of unrest and political chaos in Europe's
poorest country, Albanians are likely to approve it. But they are
skeptical it will do anything to end chronic instability.
	   ``All the foreigners are saying that it is a good
constitution,'' says a doubtful Bajram Muharremi, a 57-year-old
retired mechanic, at a downtown stand where he sells roasted corn
to make ends meet. ``They know better than we do ... so I will vote
for it.''
	   Drafted by the ruling Socialists and approved last month by the
parliament they dominate, the constitution sets out civil,
democratic and human rights based on Western and European
standards.
	   But coming only weeks after rioting rocked the capital, the
campaign has been less a debate about constitutional principles
than a fierce fight between two long-feuding parties locked in a
struggle for power.
	   Words like ``death,'' ``terror'' and ``murderer'' boom
frequently from loudspeakers at rallies of the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha, which is urging
a voter boycott.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, practically engineered their own
victory by tinkering with voting laws, abolishing the requirement
that turnout must exceed 50 percent for the measure to be valid.
	   Into the fray have stepped a leading European official and a
host of other visiting diplomats, unabashedly taking sides in the
name of democracy.
	   The ambassador of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, Daan Everts, appears almost nightly on one Albanian
television or another, explaining or lauding the Socialists' draft
constitution or talking about human rights.
	   Officials from Austria and elsewhere have joined in the
campaign, telling Albanians there can be no democracy, no secure
future, without such a charter.
	   Albania and Belarus are the only two countries in Europe without
constitutions.
	   ``This constitution is important for the political, social and
economic stability of Albania,'' says Everts. ``Albania needs a
legal system. ... This is a necessity.''
	   But few Albanians believe legislation of any kind can resolve
the political hostilities that have paralyzed their country.
	   ``Laws are not a problem here,'' says Remzi Lani, a political
analyst and director of the Albanian Media Institute. ``In the past
six years we have had many laws of European standards, which have
later been implemented according to Balkan standards.''
	   Politics in Albania have historically been primitive and
violent.
	   From 1944 until 1991, Albania was ruled by fanatic communists
who isolated the country from the rest of the world. The
dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle replaced the
rule of law.
	   When the country opened up in 1991, Albanians were eager to make
up for lost time. But wiping out the communist mentality and
embracing modern political ways have proven much harder than
throwing away portraits of former dictator Enver Hoxha.
	   Today Albanian politics is still based on the ``with me or
against me'' principle, and the two biggest parties are like rival
armed camps. Sunday's vote is perceived as largely a referendum not
on the constitution but on those parties.
	   Berisha assails the document as anti-Albanian and anti-human
rights, saying it doesn't guarantee private property and would
weaken Albanian traditions by allowing people to change their
religion and declared nationality.
	   ``This constitution is like an egg which was broken a long time
ago, and it stinks,'' he said at a news conference. ``Albanians
should stay away from it.''
	   But many observers suspect his call for a boycott hinges on
hopes of returning to power if support for the government's charter
is low, just as his departure from the presidency was foretold by
the rejection of his party's draft constitution in a November 1994
referendum.
	   The government, while citing voter registration problems as the
reason for eliminating the turnout requirement, obviously was
worried that its poor record would keep disgruntled Albanians away
from the polls in a mass show of discontent.
	   Even if the document gets a majority of votes, a low turnout
seems certain to keep political disputes as strong as ever.
	   ``If the turnout is lower than 50 percent, legally the
constitution has passed but morally and politically the government
has lost,'' analyst Lani says.

Newspaper: Junior trader in training blunder loses firm millions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A junior trader cost his employers an estimated 10
million pounds (dlrs 16 million) when a training blunder led him to
launch a deal worth billions, The Daily Telegraph reported in
Thursday's editions.
	   The trader pressed the wrong button on his computer, indicating
that someone wanted to sell 130,000 German bond futures contracts,
worth more than 11.5 billion pounds (dlrs 19 billion), the
newspaper said.
	   The offer was the largest single trade in German futures, which
are usually traded in 10,000 lots, the paper said.
	   The Daily Telegraph did not name the trader or the firm
involved, but said it was believed to be a German finance house.
	   The trader's employers are now contractually obliged to carry
out the transaction, the newspaper said.
	   German bond futures used to be traded on the floor, where
traders on the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange bought and sold them using hand signals.
	   However, now German bond futures are predominantly traded on
Eurex, a German-based electronic exchange. Traders told the
newspaper that it was easy to accidentally enter the dealing
program instead of the training simulation software.

Report: Tokyo offers best ride on public transport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A ride on the London underground beats out Paris
and New York, but a new report Thursday showed that the best ride
in the four major cities studied is on the Tokyo subway.
	   The Four World Cities Transport Study report by the London
Research Centre which was released in Paris compared the public
transport systems in Tokyo, New York, London and Paris.
	   The report's compound index of service quality that assesses
frequency and punctuality found Tokyo on top, followed by London,
New York and Paris.
	   The report showed that Tokyo was the only system to offer
consistently excellent service on all trains, with a perfect 100
percent record for punctuality during peak hours.
	   But Tokyo passengers must put up with terrible overcrowding
during peak hours and are sometimes physically shoved into their
train by rail staff.
	   The incentive to use public transport in Tokyo is great because
86 percent of Japanese companies pay the full travel costs of their
employees, the report said.
	   Measures have been taken recently to lengthen trains and
platforms as well as open doors.
	   Residents in London have good access to public transport, and
buses and trains run frequently with good off-peak service.
	   The majority of Greater London residents live or work within
five minutes of an underground stop. But London is second to New
York in poor punctuality and the worst waits for bus service.
	   London recently has taken measures to improve bus service, but
still just like Paris 65 percent of all journeys in Greater London
are by car or motorcyle.
	   The report noted, however, that the London system is in need of
renovation and modernization because of its age and ought to work
on improving Sunday bus service.
	   Paris has the densest metro network but even though trains run
frequently at rush hour, the system is often hit by strikes. Even
though it offers the cheapest travel, 65 percent of all journeys in
Paris are by car or motorcycle.
	   The New York subway system is the commuter's virtual dream,
operating 24 hours a day in addition to bus routes. Metropolitan
New York has an even greater density than Paris and the most number
of journeys per day.
	   But New Yorkers have to wait, and the city has the worst
punctuality record of the four cities surveyed. And the cost of
using the system surpasses even Tokyo, making New York the most
expensive city for public transport travel.

Defeated Blair says no new voting system for European elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, defeated by the
unelected House of Lords, said Thursday that his government will
not be able to introduce a new voting system in time for European
Parliament elections in June.
	   The bill to introduce a system used in five other European
countries, including France and Germany, was rejected by the Lords
on Wednesday for the fifth successive time.
	   The Labor Party government could, under parliamentary laws, get
the measure passed by the end of the year without reference to the
Lords, but it would need the agreement of the opposition
Conservative Party not to delay the bill in the House of Commons.
	   However, Conservative leader William Hague said Thursday that
the party will not cooperate with a measure it considers
undemocratic.
	   The bill provides that instead of voting for a candidate, voters
choose a party which allocates seats to its nominees. Critics say
the measure deprives voters of the right to choose a candidate and
gives party officials power to decide who gets elected.

	   ROME (AP) _ A U.S. military helicopter crashed into the sea
Thursday off Sicily, the U.S. Navy said.
	   Two crew members were rescued with no injuries while the Navy
was searching for two missing crewmen, the 6th Fleet said.
	   The CH-46 helicopter, deployed aboard the USNS Sirius, went down
about 30 miles northeast of Augusta Bay, on Sicily's eastern coast.
It had been bringing supplies to the USS Stump in the central
Mediterranean.
	   The NAVY said the cause of the incident was under investigation
and that the names of crew members involved were being withheld
pending notification of family members.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament convened Thursday to vote on
whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down
the government over an organized crime scandal.
	   Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an
indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said
to be extremely slim.
	   If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday
and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.
	   The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having
ties to organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a
state bank. He denies the charges.
	   ``Ousting the government from power will open the way for the
struggle against gangs,'' said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the
Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three
no-confidence motions to Parliament.

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Hisashi Teraji defended his
Orient-Pacific light heavyweight boxing title with a 12-round split
decision over Jamie Wallace of Australia Thursday.
	   Teraji knocked down Wallace, the Orient-Pacific ninth-ranked

knocked Teraji down in the 12th and final round.

Coalition split over bill to cut subsidies to anti-democratic
</HEADLINE>
parties &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The center-left coalition was split
Thursday over a bill that aims to cut subsidies to anti-democratic
parties, with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's Christian Democrat
party warning the current proposal would never hold up in
international law.
	   The extreme right-wing Vlaams Blok party, the main target of the
proposed legislation, has tabled some 3,000 amendments in a
filibustering move to stave off a parliamentary vote this week.
	   The Dutch-speaking Flemish Christian Democrats want to send the
bill to the Council of State, the nation's supreme court, so it can
investigate the legality of the proposal. They believe the bill is
far too general in its present form to get a legal stamp of
approval.
	   The three other government parties, the French-speaking Walloon
Christian Democrats and both Socialist parties want to push the
measure through parliament as quickly as possible to make a clear
stand against right-wing extremism.
	   It was unlikely at this stage that the issue would affect the
stability of the government.
	   If the Vlaams Blok would challenge it ``it would likely be that
the European Court would back their reasoning. I do not wish to
grant them such a present,'' Paul Tant, House speaker for the
Dutch-speaking Christian Democrats said.
	   ``It's too bad we cannot face this standing shoulder to
shoulder,'' said Tant's Socialist counterpart Louis Vanvelthoven.
	   In parliament, his view is back by the Dutch-speaking
Conservatives, the Flemish nationalist Volksunie and the Vlaams
Blok, which should be enough to garner the required one-third of
votes to refer the bill to the Council of State.
	   The Dutch-speaking Conservatives argue any decision on whether a
party is racist or anti-democratic should be left up to the courts,
not parties.
	   ``Under the rule of law, it cannot be that politics will decide
whether a party is racist or not,'' said the party's parliamentary
leader Patrick Dewael.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
Flanders during the 1990s. It won 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote
in 1995 with an anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program and is
a hot issue of debate again ahead of next June's elections.
	   The traditional parties were hoping to cut off some of the
Vlaams Blok's financial aid with the new proposal, which bans
subsidies to any party that discriminates ``on basis of sex, race,
color, language, religion, opinion, national or social origin,
minorities, wealth, birth or other status.''

Russia will go without budget in first quarter of 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government will have to live without a
budget in the first quarter of 1999, and must not resort to
uncontrolled monetary printing to cover its gaping deficit, top
officials said Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government still doesn't know
when it will submit a draft budget to the lower house of Russia's
parliament, the State Duma, said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov.
	   Regardless of when the budget is submitted, the Duma will need
three months to review it, said Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov.
	   The government's delays are ``trying the nerves of the
deputies,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia's parliament often drags out the budget debate, and
didn't pass the 1998 budget until March.
	   Government officials have said they can't draft a budget until
they know whether foreign lenders will release more of a dlrs 22.6
billion loan they put on hold last August when the government
defaulted on its treasury debt and devalued the ruble.
	   They also say drafting a budget will be futile until they know
whether western lenders will agree to restructure dlrs 17 billion
in Russia's foreign debt that the government says it can't pay.
	   Still, Primakov cautioned that even if the government does not
get its wishes on its debts and loans, it must not resort to
printing too much money.
	   ``We can't go for uncontrolled emission, since all payments ...
would be made valueless,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The government has pledged to pay off wage and pension arrears
quickly, in part by printing more money. It has also warned that if
it didn't get help from abroad, it would be forced to print massive
amounts of rubles.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that Russia has
printed 8 billion rubles (dlrs 470 million) since Oct. 1.

Norwegians provide emergency aid to neighbors in Russia's Arctic

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norwegians are engaged in nationwide
campaigns to help their desperate neighbors on the impoverished
Kola Peninsula of northwestern Russia's Arctic by providing food,
warm clothing and medicines.
	   More than a million people live on the peninsula, which in the
only place where Russia borders a NATO member. The economic crisis
crippling Russia has left thousands of Kola residents facing the
bitter cold of Arctic winter without heat or basic necessities such
as warm clothing.
	   On Thursday, the Norwegian Red Cross began a fund-raising drive
called ``Neighbors in Need'' in which 2,000 volunteers will seek
donations for the Kola region.
	   ``We hope the Norwegian people will reach out a helping hand to
their Russian neighbors,'' said Sven Molleklein, secretary-general
of the Norwegian Red Cross. ``The situation is extremely critical
and we have to act now.''
	   He said more than 11,000 children and 33,000 elderly people in
the region lack essential medicines and that food supplies are
running dangerously low.
	   The Red Cross aims to provide shoes and clothing to 600,000
people on the Kola, as well as nearly 500,000 boxes of food to
158,000 needy families over the next six months. Much of it will be
distributed in Murmansk, the capital city of the region.
	   Another group, Norwegian People's Aid, last month began a drive
urging Norwegians to pay 100 kroner (dlrs 13) at more than 1,300
stores for a ``Russia Package'' of food and other necessities.
	   The Kola Peninsula is the base of the once-powerful Russian
North fleet. During the Soviet era, the population swelled from a
few thousand to more than one million when thousands of miners,
soldiers and others were sent to the region.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police cracked a counterfeiting ring
Thursday, arresting two brothers and seizing bogus bills with a
face value of U.S. dlrs 17.3 million in what officials called the
biggest such raid in Taiwan's history.
	   Officers swooped down on a house in an industrial section of
Tainan County, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Taipei,
following a four-month surveillance operation.
	   They seized fake U.S. dlrs 100 bills with a face value of dlrs
10 million, and counterfeit Chinese yuan bills with a face value
equal to U.S. dlrs 7.3 million, along with printing presses and
plates.
	   Peng Tah-hung and Peng Tah-hsuan were arrested on the scene, and
after questioning, they admitted to printing the forged bills,
police said.
	   The Pengs planned to convert the fake bills into real currency
by buying contraband in China for resale in Taiwan, said Lin
Kuo-tung, deputy director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau.
	   ``They would take them to the mainland, buy drugs and guns to
smuggle back to Taiwan and by selling these, convert the
counterfeits into real currency,'' Lin told reporters. Lin said the
dollar amount of the bust was the largest ever by Taiwanese police.
	   Police were unable to provide numbers for the previous record
raid, but they said Thursday's seizure far exceeded anything they
had seen before.
	   Officials in the Criminal Investigation Bureau's counterfeit
division said no previous raid had ever netted as much as U.S. dlrs
10 million in fake greenbacks, while all previous seizures of fake
Chinese yuan had been U.S. dlrs 5 million or less.
	   Police said the forged currency appeared to be of poor quality.
They were investigating whether any was being circulated in Taiwan.
	   Chinese police had also been alerted to the Pengs' activities,
Lin said.

U.S. says China making progress on beetle problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is making progress on complying with new
U.S. regulations that will require treatment of solid wood packing
materials to prevent the spread of the Asian long-horned beetle, a
U.S. official said Thursday.
	   Chinese officials have accused Washington of using the ban on
untreated wooden crates as a form of trade protectionism,
particularly given the growing U.S. trade deficit with China.
	   But Isi Siddiqui, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Marketing and Regulatory Programs, said
China has begun to realize the seriousness of the issue, especially
following an October visit by a delegation of Chinese officials to
beetle-infested sites.
	   ``They were impressed with the necessity of why the U.S. is
doing this,'' Siddiqui told reporters in Beijing. The officials saw
``a visual, graphic display of what we are facing.''
	   China has already notified shippers, exporters and state-owned
enterprises of the regulations, Siddiqui said. Non-compliance with
the rules could delay shipments, he added.
	   Under the rules, wooden packaging for goods leaving China on or
after Dec. 17 must be treated with chemicals, heat or fumigation to
get rid of the tree-destroying beetles. Shipments must have
official certificates guaranteeing they were treated, while exports
without wooden packaging must have documents declaring the contents
wood-free.
	   China estimates that goods worth dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion, or 50 to 60 percent of China's annual exports to the
United States, would be affected by the ban.
	   U.S. officials say that unchecked, the long-horned beetle could
cause as much as dlrs 138 billion in damage to the U.S. economy. No
known pesticides or predators can kill the beetle, which preys on
maples and fruit trees. Once infested with the bug, a tree must be
removed, chipped and burned, Siddiqui said.

Italian premier hints soccer diplomacy possible in dispute with
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with reaction from Yilmaz, EU saying it has no clear
stance on extradition vs asylum debate; D'Alema upset at US &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday he
would accept an invitation to watch a soccer game in Istanbul if
the Turkish government agrees to a dialogue on the sharp dispute
surrounding a Kurdish rebel leader held in Rome.
	   Turkey has been pressuring Italy to extradite the leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year-old
war for Kurdish autonomy. But D'Alema insists he won't be
intimidated and appears determined to refuse extradition.
	   The invitation was extended by Turkey's deputy premier for the
match between Italian soccer champion Juventus of Turin against
Istanbul's Galatasaray in a Champions League game Wednesday.
	   But questioned on whether he would meet D'Alema in Istanbul,
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said ``if he wants to see me, let him
come to Ankara,'' the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   D'Alema has urged the European Union to back his efforts at
maintaining friendly relations with Turkey while respecting Italian
law, which prohibits extradition to a country with the death
penalty.
	   But EU countries are at odds over whether Ocalan's Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, is a terrorist organization and have yet to
weigh in on the dispute.
	   Italy has played a role in trying to convince the EU to accept
Turkey's appliciation for membership _ which was turned down last
year after it was decided Turkey needed to improve its human rights
record.
	   According to Italian news reports, D'Alema is also upset at the
United States, which is pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan. The U.S.
State Department on Wednesday said it was deeply skeptical Ocalan
would stick to his pledge to renounce terrorism.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport after he stepped
off a flight from Russia, which denied him asylum. Italy is now
weighing his asylum request.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000.
	   D'Alema's possible arrival worries Turkish authorities already
dealing with growing anti-Italian sentiment. Thousands of people
have taken to the streets across the country to protest over the
past week. Daily demonstrations take place in front of the Italian
embassy in Ankara.
	   Many Turks see the match as an opportunity to express their
anger with Italy over Ocalan. An ultranationalist paper, Ortadogu,
called on fans on Wednesday to prepare huge banners in Italian
denouncing Rome's attitude.
	   Juventus reportedly demanded tightened security for the game.

Land mine kills body guard, injures relative of former federal

Cabinet minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A jeep carrying relatives of a former
federal Cabinet minister hit a land mine in Kashmir Thursday,
killing a body guard and seriously injuring a son and a daughter of
the politician.
	   Police said the family of Mohammed Maqbool Dar, junior home
minister until his government was toppled in March elections, was
traveling near their home village of Shangus, 55 kilometers (34
miles) south of Srinagar, the state capital when the jeep hit a
mine believed planted by separatists.
	   Dar was not in the jeep. The guard was killed on the spot and
Dar's 25-year-old son Muzafar and 30-year-old daughter Shamina were
taken to a Srinagar hospital. No other details were immediately
available.
	   Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 in Kashmir,
saying predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state
should be independent or part of neighboring, officially Islamic
Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency, but
Pakistan says it lends the militants only moral support.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. Both claim all
of the Himalayan territory, which is divided between them.

Two journalists arrested for promoting Islamic movement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police arrested two journalists and
charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to
stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model
in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday.
	   Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid''
or ``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the
Bangladeshi capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their
arrest on Wednesday.
	   They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain
any one for offenses related to national security, the officer said
on condition of anonymity. Those arrested need not be taken to
court for trial for up to three months.
	   Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign
newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama
Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United States of
masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in August.
	   Under Taliban rules women may not study or work outside their
houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including music are
banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals are
subjected to amputations and public executions
	   Even though Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim country, it is
governed by secular laws.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't
recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan.

Ro-Ro Show to take center stage in Florence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ This could be the week The Ro-Ro Show _ Roberto
Baggio and Ronaldo, together in the starting lineup _ takes center
stage for Internazionale of Milan.
	   The two highly-paid strikers have been battling knee injuries
all season, but both are on the verge of being given the green
light when their struggling club plays at Fiorentina on Sunday in
the prime matchup of the Italian League's 10th round.
	   It would be a much-needed boost.
	   When Inter signed the 31-year-old Baggio this summer, the team
figured it had a veteran playmaker to suit up alongside Ronaldo,
the exciting Brazilian wunderkind. But the pair have been on the
field together a total of 70 minutes in league action this season,
and Inter's dreams of its first title in a decade have been
dissipating.
	   The club is a mediocre 4-2-3 and just recently went through a
three-game losing slide.
	   Fiorentina, meanwhile, is enjoying its first run atop the
standings since 1982. With Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta leading
the way with a league-high 10 goals, Fiorentina has 18 points, one
more than both AS Roma and two-time defending titlist Juventus of
Turin.
	   AC Parma is next with 16 points, followed by AC Milan with 15
and Inter with 14.
	   Sunday's other games are Juventus vs. Empoli, Milan vs. Lazio of
Rome at night, Salernitana vs. Venezia, Sampdoria of Genoa vs.
Vicenza, and Udinese vs. Piacenza.
	   Three games have been moved up to Saturday because of UEFA Cup
outings Tuesday: Roma vs. Bari, Cagliari vs. Parma, and Bologna vs.
Perugia.
	   Ronaldo ``has a 51 percent chance of playing at Florence,''
Inter coach Luigi Simoni said Wednesday. ``That extra one percent
represents hope.''
	   Hampered by tendinitis in both knees, the two-time FIFA Player
of the Year has appeared in just three league games so far _ but
has scored one goal in each outing. The rest of the squad clearly
revolves around Ronaldo and plays better when he is on the field,
even at less than 100 percent.
	   ``We have done everything we could,'' Inter club doctor Piero
Volpi said. ``At this point, it is only up to him to decide whether
he feels like playing or not.''
	   Baggio has looked generally rusty but shown sparks of brilliance
in his limited appearances the last two weeks. With rising star
Nicola Ventola (five goals) sidelined about a month with his own
knee injury, and France's Youri Djorkaeff inconsistent, Inter needs
Baggio up front.
	   It also doesn't help that two players who help create offense up
the flanks, Francesco Moriero and Dutchman Aron Winter, are out
with injuries.
	   Regardless of who plays in attack for Inter, the game could be a
high-scoring affair. Neither Inter (14 goals allowed) nor
Fiorentina (11 allowed) inspires much confidence on defense,
although both club's 'keepers (Inter's Gianluca Pagliuca started,
Fiorentina's Francesco Toldo was the reserve) were on Italy's World
Cup roster this summer.
	   Only four of the league's 18 clubs have given up more goals than
Inter, which also will have to do without suspended defender
Francesco Colonnese.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Share prices continued to slide this week, with
the official index closing at 1,853 points, down 44.1 points, or
2.32 percent, from the previous week.
	   If long-term solutions for economic problems are not found and
implemented, it might soon be too late to save the market, warned
the weekly market report of the National Investments Co.
	   A liquidity crunch, the need for economic reform and the latest
tension between Iraq and the United Nations have pushed the index
down to a series of record lows in the past several weeks.
	   Economists have been calling on authorities to encourage foreign
investments and strengthen the role of the private sector in an
economy that is highly dependent on oil revenues and government
spending.
	   Some 71.30 million shares changed hands this week, down 2.36
percent from last week, according to the National Investments Co.
report.
	   The market was closed Monday because of a Muslim holiday.
	   The value of shares traded this week fell by 19.53 percent,
reaching 12.65 million dinars (dlrs 41.88 million).
	   Of the 63 companies whose stocks were traded, only nine closed
higher, while 45 ended lower. The rest remained unchanged.
	   A total of 76 companies are listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange,
where trading is restricted to Kuwaitis and nationals of its five
partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
 &UR; ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices hit an 18-month low and
turnover declined this week because of regional tension over
neighboring Iraq, brokers said Thursday.
	   They said a three-day national holiday to mark King Hussein's
63rd birthday and a Muslim holiday also contributed to the week's
slump.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for two business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 0.71 percent down to 159.46 points _ its lowest in 18
months.
	   Shares of industrial firms dropped by 1.88 percent, commercial
banks by 0.44 percent, insurance firms by 0.14 percent. But shares
of services companies closed up 0.24 percent.
	   Turnover also declined by 23.8 percent to 3.53 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 4.9 million), the report said.
	   Stocks of 70 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading levels surged at the Baghdad Stock
Exchange this week following Iraq's decision to grant unfettered
access to U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The market's bulletin released Thursday said the number of
shares and their value rose at the Monday and Wednesday sessions
when it became clear that the United States and Britain had shelved
plans to use military force against Iraq.
	   Trading on Saturday, when Iraq reversed its Oct. 31 decision to
end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, was sluggish, the
bulletin added.
	   The number of shares traded rose by 11 percent from 28 million
the previous week to 31.5 million.
	   The value of these shares climbed 12 percent from 348.2 million
Iraqi dinars (dlrs 204,000) last week to 392.4 million (dlrs
231,000).
	   The bulletin, reflecting activity for the three business days
ending Wednesday, said investors concentrated mostly on industrial
stocks.
	   However, Iraq's dinar started losing most of the ground it
gained over the weekend when Baghdad pledged to resume full
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   At one point this week the dinar improved to 1,664 against the
dollar but it started depreciating as business returned to normal
and demand for the greenback picked up. On Thursday it was trading
at 1,774 to the dollar.
	   Some 112 government bonds worth 2.9 million Iraqi dinars were
traded this week, compared with 67 ones last week.

Germany commits soldiers to NATO force for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament cleared the way Friday for 250
German soldiers to take part in a NATO standby force being set up
to protect unarmed observers in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo
province.
	   Lawmakers from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left
coalition joined the opposition in passing the measure by 555 votes
to 36, with seven abstentions. Only the former East German
communists voted against the plan.
	   Schroeder's Cabinet approved the plans Wednesday.
	   NATO's aim is to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international observers
following an October peace deal between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The French-led 1,700-strong ``extraction force,'' intended to
rescue the observers if they run into trouble, is to be based in
neighboring Macedonia.
	   Last week, parliament approved sending 350 German soldiers and
16 unmanned spy planes to take part in NATO air surveillance over
Kosovo.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Officials preparing for next year's

might be hard-pressed to make the gathering seem relevant after its
initials got a reworking Thursday.
	   Some Australian media facetiously dubbed the APEC meeting in

Report: village feuding erupts in southern Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Fighting between rival villages in
southern Nigeria's Delta State has left at least 10 people dead and
several communities scorched by arson, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Fighting between the Benekuku and Utagbaogbe communities
reportedly began as a dispute over the use of development aid
donated to the area from a foreign oil company, the Times newspaper
reported.
	   About 20 homes in the area were either razed or torched in the
clashes that have been continuing for much of the week, the
newspaper report said.
	   Longstanding ethnic tensions in the Niger River delta region has
been exacerbated by the influx of oil firms.
	   Although Nigeria is one of world's largest oil producing
countries, the communities that live in the oil-rich delta area
still subsist in desperate poverty, often with basic amenities like
clean water, electricity and paved roads.
	   Oil companies often donate large sums of money to communities
for development projects, health clinics and schools.
	   Depending on how it is distributed or how it is used, the money
can also be a source of competition or resentment between rival
ethnic groups.
	   Money donated by French oil company Agip triggered was
reportedly the cause of the latest dispute. Officials from Agip in
Nigeria's commercial capital were unavailable to comment.

Vatican urges debt relief for countries hit by Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican urged creditor nations Thursday
to provide debt relief to the countries devastated by Hurricane
Mitch last month.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated 10,000
people _ 6,000 of them in Honduras.
	   Last week France canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras,
while other creditor nations, including the United States, said
they would likely grant debt relief when they meet next month.
	   The Vatican's appeal was issued by the Pontifical Council on
Justice and Peace, which frequently speaks out on the need for debt
relief for developing countries.

Celta looking up this season _ literally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Celta president Horacio Gomez is thanking
God for his team's good fortune.
	   With Celta unbeaten and leading the Spanish first division
soccer league, Gomez has donned athletic shoes and the garb of a
medieval pilgrim to trek a 100-mile stretch of the St. James Road,
a rural path to Santiago de Compostela, one of Roman Catholicism's
holiest cities. He's to arrive Friday after a six-day hike.
	   Gomez had promised as much if his team beat English league
leader Aston Villa away in a UEFA Cup match on Nov. 3, after losing
at home 1-0 in the home leg.
	   Celta prevailed by a score of 3-1, one of a string of stunning
successes this season for a little-known team from the port city of
Vigo in northwest Spain.
	   Players from powerhouses like FC Barcelona are already saying
Celta can't take the heat and will fall soon enough. But coach
Victor Fernandez likes the pressure.
	   ``In my opinion this pressure is a good thing,'' he said. ``I
think Celta has an advantage in that it has several players with
enough maturity and emotional stability to withstand this kind of
pressure. Of course we will lose some day, but it will not be
because of the pressure of being league leader.''
	   In any case, that pressure will ease a bit on Saturday in the
11th round of play as Celta plays away at Alaves, a Basque team
currently parked in second-to-last place.
	   Still, with 20 points Celta is only a point ahead of Barcelona
and Mallorca, which are squaring off Saturday for what should be
the best game of the weekend.
	   Officials at 25,000-seat Luis Sitjar Stadium in Palma are
expecting their first sellout this year among fans of the season's
other big surprise. Until last week's loss against Valladolid,
Mallorca was the only unbeaten team other than Celta.
	   Barcelona goes into the game breathing a sigh of relief from a
4-1 win over lowly Tenerife after three straight losses in league
and European play. A chorus of calls for coach Louis van Gaal's
resignation quieted down. But fans are fickle.
	   ``If we have the misfortune of losing, there will be talk again
of a crisis,'' said defender Abelardo Fernandez, who will be out
for the next four weeks because of a torn leg muscle.
	   His absence and that of fellow defensemen Miguel Angel Nadal and
Winston Bogarde, also because of injury, will force a redrawing of
the Barcelona defense lines.
	   The other perennial titan of Spanish soccer, fourth-placed Real
Madrid, is riven by internal squabbling as it prepares to take on
fifth-placed Valencia away on Saturday.
	   Midfielder Clarence Seedorf and defender Christian Panucci face
possible sanctions from coach Guus Hiddink for complaining about
being yanked from the game Madrid lost last weekend to Celta. And
defender Ivan Campo and midfielder Jose Emilio Amavisca are
speaking out publicly about seeing little playing time.
	   In other matches Saturday, Atletico de Madrid hosts sixth-place
Valladolid, Real Sociedad takes on Zaragoza and Oviedo hosts Betis.
	   On Sunday Deportivo La Coruna plays Villareal, Salamanca hosts
Extremadura and Espanyol takes on Racing de Santander.
	   In a rare Friday match, Tenerife hosts Athletic de Bilbao.

Two white extremists seek amnesty for SAfrican bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELKOM, South Africa (AP) _ Two white extremists appeared before
a human rights panel Thursday and sought amnesty for a wave of
bombings designed to sabotage the 1994 elections which ended
apartheid.
	   ``I am very sorry for what I have done,'' Johan Strydom told the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission panel. ``I can now say that
things can happen if people negotiate. As long as a live, I will
not do a thing like that again.''
	   Strydom and Pieter Breytenbach belonged to the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi band that advocated race war in the
early 1990s and was blamed for bombs that killed 21 people before
the elections.
	   The group, known by its Afrikaans-language acronym of AWB,
sought an autonomous state for Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
white settlers who ruled during apartheid but has since kept a low
profile.
	   Strydom and Breytenbach admitted setting off four bombs in the
Free State in 1994, targeting stores, a taxi rank in which a
civilian was killed and a state broadcasting tower. Bombs left at
two primary schools were defused by police.
	   The two were charged with the attacks, but their trial was
postponed pending the outcome of the amnesty requests.
	   Strydom said his aim was to cause enough chaos to block the
nation's first democratic election.
	   ``Anyone who was in favour of the African National Congress and
National Party alliance had to be targeted -- more specifically,
their property and business,'' he said. ``It was thought that this
would prevent the election.''
	   The then-ruling National Party, architects of apartheid, had
negotiated the transition to non-racial democracy with the ANC.
	   AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche ordered the pair to buy or steal
the explosives, Strydom said, but also said he and Breytenbach
chose the targets themselves.
	   The Truth Commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess their crimes and can demonstrate a political motive.
	   The hearing was held in this town 275 kilometers (170 miles)
southwest of Johannesburg.

Regional meeting vows to refocus activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ National Red Cross groups from around the
Asia-Pacific area vowed Thursday to use the region's problems to
refocus their activities to aid those hardest hit.
	   ``As we met in Hanoi, it seemed that the elements had conspired
with mankind's worst instincts to create turmoil in our region on
an unprecedented scale,'' said a declaration signed by 37 national
Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and four societies under
development.
	   ``Economic collapse threatened not only our regional countries
but the global economic order. Wars or threats of conflicts cast a
cloud over a number of our lands. Floods, earthquakes, drought,
fires and cyclones hit us with unexpected and devastating ferocity.
	   ``The challenge for us is not to be overwhelmed by the immensity
of these problems, but to see them as a spur to refocus our
activities and to strengthen our organizational structures and
capacities ....''
	   The Red Cross and Red Crescent groups, meeting for the first
time since Beijing in 1993, mapped out over four days a joint
course for the next four years.
	   ``We will identify and strengthen the core response and
preparedness skills we need in the face of the increasing scale and
complexity of disasters,'' they said.
	   In particular, they said they would tackle new and re-emerging
disease patterns, specifically AIDS, while targeting ``the most
vulnerable living in urban slums.''
	   They also said they will give ``special recognition'' to youths
and the elderly, both as aid recipients and volunteers. There will
be a special focus on programs that allow the aged to remain
independent, promoting home-based care that would allow them to
maintain close contact with their families.

Serbian court fines independent Montenegrin daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serbian court has fined an
independent Montenegrin weekly the maximum 1.2 million dinars (dlrs
120,000) for breaking Serbia's restrictive information law, and
police impounded its copies Thursday.
	   This was the first case that a Serbian court ruled against a
Montenegrin newspaper since the new law banning criticism of state
officials was adopted in Serbia last month. Dominant Serbia and
small Montenegro form what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   The Monitor weekly, known for its criticism of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, was fined because of publishing a
picture of a clenched fist, the symbol of a Belgrade University
student group that has called for the abolishment of his regime.
	   The move is certain to cause controversy and deepen the
political rift between the two Yugoslav republics because a Serbian
court fined a Montenegrin newspaper for allegedly breaching Serbian
law. The pro-Western Montenegrin leadership has been trying to
distance itself from Milosevic's rule.
	   The Montenegrin Montena-fax news agency reported that Serbian
police on Tuesday impounded all copies of the current edition of
Monitor that were to go on sale in Serbia on Friday.
	   Monitor's chief editor Drasko Djuranovic said he found out about
the verdict only from other media, and that the weekly's officials
were never summoned to the Belgrade court or informed about the
charges.
	   ``In this country of miracles everything is possible,''
Djuranovic told Montena-fax. ``Even that you are tried and
sentenced while knowing nothing about it.''
	   Three independent Belgrade newspapers were briefly banned last
month when Serbia's government passed a decree demanding strictly
``patriotic'' coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
imposed hefty fines on media for articles authorities deem
anti-state. Most of the fledgling independent Yugoslav media barely
stay afloat. Such fines are enough to close down some newspapers.
	   The largest state-run daily, Politika, was also fined this month
the equivalent of dlrs 15,000, the lowest penalty required by the
media law. But opposition officials have said the verdict was only
intended to show that the Serbian courts are unbiased, and that
there was no proof that Politika ever paid the fine to the state.

Hariri lists achievements on eve of Cabinet's resignation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Days before he resigns, Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri hailed the achievements of his Cabinet
Thursday, saying its impact on the war-ravaged country has been
``almost a miracle.''
	   Speaking at the final Cabinet meeting under the presidency of
Elias Hrawi, Hariri said he and his ministers did not claim to have
achieved a miracle.
	   ``But the fact is that what Lebanon is today, after what it
suffered, is almost a miracle,'' the prime minister said, referring
to the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war and the multibillion
dollar reconstruction program.
	   Hrawi, who suffered a heart attack earlier this month, is
scheduled to hand over to President-elect Emile Lahoud, the army
commander, on Tuesday. Hariri's Cabinet will automatically resign.
The new president is expected to ask Hariri, who has been in office
since 1992, to form another government.
	   The prime minister said that under Hrawi's nine-year presidency,
the civil war ended, the government regained its authority and
launched ``the biggest reconstruction project in the Orient.''
	   Hrawi, who exercised his right to chair Tuesday's Cabinet
session, said he was sad to be leaving while Israel continued to
occupy 10 percent of Lebanon _ a zone along the southern border
that Israeli forces have maintained as a buffer against guerrilla
attacks.
	   ``The greatest distress is that I wanted to crown the end of my
term with seeing Lebanon liberated ... regretfully, nothing could
be done,'' Hrawi said.
	   Government opponents have accused the Hariri administration of
rampant corruption, squandering public funds and shackling the
country in debt.
	   Hardline members of the Christian minority have charged Hariri
with turning Lebanon into a satellite of Syria, the main power
broker in the country, and of failing to bring about a genuine
postwar reconciliation between Christians and Muslims.

Armenian military intelligence officers sentenced for bribery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Two Armenian military intelligence
officers were convicted Thursday of eliciting bribes from parents
whose children evaded the draft.
	   Col. Sergei Ambartsumov, 44, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison, and Capt. Eduard Amirdzhnian, 35, was sentenced to five
years. The sentences were handed down in a court in the Armavir
region of this former Soviet republic.
	   It was the first such conviction in Armenia for demanding or
taking bribes for draft evasion, though the practice is widespread.
	   The officers used friends in the police department to find
families whose draft-age sons had dodged military service,
prosecutors said. Ambartsumov and Amirdzhnian then approached the
parents and demanded up to dlrs 1,500 to keep their secret.

New Slovak leaders cite rights, integration as top priorities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Determined to reverse Slovakia's
course, the new government pledged Thursday to make human and
minority rights top priorities and push harder for membership in
NATO and the European Union.
	   Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda outlined his vision for Slovakia
in a nearly two-hour speech to Parliament in which he presented his
Cabinet's program for the next four years.
	   ``We intend to make Slovakia a stable country,'' Dzurinda said.
``The new government is prepared to make a great change in public
life.''
	   Parliament, which is dominated by Dzurinda's coalition, is
expected to adopt the program after debating it next Wednesday.
	   Under the previous government, led by the authoritarian Vladimir
Meciar, Slovakia grew isolated from the West and was criticized for
anti-democratic practices. It was left behind as NATO welcomed
three neighboring nations _ the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
_ into NATO, and was not considered a strong candidate for EU
expansion.
	   Dzurinda promises to try to change all that. His government took
power Oct. 30 after assembling a majority coalition from opposition
groups that finished just behind Meciar's ruling party in September
parliamentary elections.
	   Despite facing an economic crunch, he said the new government
wants to balance the budget, maintain economic growth and reduce
unemployment to 10 percent from the current 14 percent by the end
of its term in 2002.
	   Dzurinda said his Cabinet will do everything it can to attract
direct foreign investment into the country.
	   Fighting corruption also is a priority, he said.
	   Blaming Meciar, he said the state of Slovakia is a lot worse
than four years ago because of his virtual one-man rule.
	   Some of Meciar's deputies walked out during the speech.
	   Earlier Thursday, Britain signed a military cooperation
agreement with Slovakia and endorsed the new government's efforts
to gain NATO membership.
	   British Armed Forces Minister Douglas Henderson, the first
high-level official to visit since September elections, signed the
memorandum of understanding with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol
Kanis.
	   ``I believe Slovakia is well placed to be at the head of any
(NATO) expansion,'' Henderson told reporters.

France tries to lessen Yugoslav resistance to NATO deployment in
</HEADLINE>
Macedonia
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As preparations broadened to set up
a well-armed NATO force for possible intervention in Kosovo, a
senior French diplomat sought Thursday to soften Yugoslav
resistance to the idea.
	   Special envoy Jacques Huntzinger, the French ambassador to
Macedonia, talked with Serbian president Milan Milutinovic Thursday
after meeting Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic the previous
day.
	   Yugoslavia _ and Serbia, its dominant republic _ rejects the
deployment of NATO combat troops in Macedonia. The troops are meant
to come to the aid of unarmed observers in neighboring Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province, should they be menaced.
But Yugoslav and Serbian officials say the troops threaten their
territory.
	   Huntzinger told reporters that high on the agenda in his talks
was resistance to the NATO deployments.
	   He said he was not in Serbia to mediate the crisis but stressed
his country would play an increasing role in the region with the
deployment of the French-commanded, NATO rapid reaction force.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo
following nearly eight months of bloodshed between government
forces and separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas, Milosevic agreed
to allow 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo. They are to ensure
Milosevic abides by the agreement.
	   ``The French government is concerned with the slow developments
in the (Kosovo) peace process,'' Huntzinger said, apparently
alluding to lasting sporadic bloodshed and the lack of
Serb-Albanian agreement on the basics of a U.S.-sponsored political
agreement.
	   ``There is still a lot of bread on the table,'' Huntzinger said,
using a Serb idiom to reflect the slowness of the peace process.
	   The French diplomat planned to return to Skopje, Macedonia,
Thursday and travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina Saturday to meet
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   On Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that its consent to serve as a base for ``any
military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to long-term
interests of the two countries.''
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia _ a former Yugoslav republic _handed a
counter-protest to Yugoslavia, saying the deployment of foreign
troops is the country's internal matter.
	   Also Wednesday, two senior NATO officials, U.S. Admiral James O.
Ellis and French Gen. Marcel Valentin, traveled to Skopje and met
Macedonian officials. Macedonian authorities are expected to give
the green light for NATO deployment within 10 days.
	   Local reports said that the first of the 1,800-strong
all-European extraction force, including tanks and helicopters,
would start arriving in Macedonia on Dec. 1.
	   Reflecting Serbian reluctance to relinquish tight control of
Kosovo, Serbia's president on Wednesday rejected a U.S. blueprint
for Kosovo's future, saying it gives too much power to ethnic
Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian province.
	   Milutinovic said Kosovo Albanians could have self-rule but must
remain part of Serbia.
	   A draft version of the plan proposed by the top U.S. mediator in
Kosovo, Christopher Hill, envisages almost no Serbian control in
the province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. The proposal was published in an Albanian-language
paper Wednesday,
	   Milutinovic rejected the plan as a violation of Serbia's
``territorial integrity.''

This ``Dracula'' kills cattle and deer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLUJ, Romania (AP) _ A giant black bear, whom peasants have
nicknamed ``Dracula,'' is creating anxiety in western Romania
because of his taste for cattle and sheep, an official said
Thursday.
	   Peasants whose livestock has been devoured by the hungry bear
have lodged seven complaints in the past six weeks, said Nicolae
Onetiu, head of the state hunting and fishing reserves in western
Romania.
	   Dracula was named after the Transylvanian vampire count of
legend because of his bloody appetite, said Onetiu. The male bruin
weighs at least 300 kilograms (660 pounds) and has moved closer to
inhabited areas from forested regions with the onset of cold
weather, but is apparently not yet ready to hibernate.
	   Dracula has killed at least six cows and seven sheep over the
past six weeks.
	   Most bears are omnivorous, but in Romania, many bears were
weaned on meat, said Onetiu. Nicolae Ceausescu, the communist
dictator toppled and executed almost a decade ago, was an avid
hunter, and hunting reserve cubs were fed meat to make them grow
bigger quicker, leaving generations partial to meat.
	   State rangers count 135 bears living in the Apuseni Mountains in
western Romania, all of them protected by law.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A year late, Russian space officials prepared
Thursday for the launch of the first component of the international
space station, the U.S.-led successor to Russia's much-maligned
Mir.
	   The 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module was
scheduled to lift off from the Baikonur rocket base in Kazakstan at
9:40 a.m. Moscow time Friday, ushering in a new era in
international space cooperation.
	   The international space station, involving 16 nations, will
consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly
flights to complete. It is due to be completed by 2004.
	   The United States and Russia are playing the biggest roles, but
Russian participation has been hampered by the country's financial
problems. The launch of the Zarya module has been delayed for one
year, mainly because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency's
failure to complete another part of the station.
	   Zarya, to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, is designed
to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project,
providing propulsion, power and communications.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate
administrator for the new station, said at a news conference
earlier this week.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently.''
	   Russian officials added their traditional note of superstition.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... some advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which
is rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander
Krasnov, a deputy chief of the Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until early 2000,
following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast
off next July or August.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold its early research time on the station to NASA for
dlrs 60 million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new
station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space
industry, whose funding has disintegrated since the Soviet
collapse. The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs
over the next 15 years.
	   Russia is expected to retire the Mir sometime next year,
although some officials have talked about trying to keep it aloft
longer.
	   The international space station is expected to cost at least
dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24
billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts
and cosmonauts for up to 20 years.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach
the two modules together in three space walks, using Endeavour's
robot arm.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya will be launched by a
three-stage Proton booster rocket that would put the module into
orbit less than 10 minutes after blastoff. In the ensuing days,
ground controllers will gradually adjust its orbit in preparation
for the meeting with Endeavour.

Atomium to become Virgin ad; similar plans for Euro 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Virgin Airlines will be wrapping
Belgium's most famous monument, the Atomium, in its trademark
scarlet colors bearing the company's name next June.
	   The British airline company is the first to close a deal with
the managers of this major tourist attraction, a 334 foot (102
meters) high model of an iron molecule. Virgin will be paying 50
million francs (1.75 million dollars) for the publicity.
	   The dilapidated landmark, built for the 1958 World Fair, is in
dire need of money to save it from ruin. The pillars linking the
balls are rusted and some of the aluminum exterior is coming loose,
letting the rain in. The elevator up the central shaft is
unreliable, as are the escalators that connect the spherical rooms.
	   The managers delayed plans in February for renovation work due
to lack of funds. Instead they called on private investors to
suggest ways in which they might advertise their products on the
Atomium's nine silver-colored spheres. They hope to spend the
proceeds on a full and lasting renovation project.
	   Euro 2000, the company managing the European soccer
championships in the year 2000 to be co-hosted by Belgium and the
Netherlands, also have plans for the Atomium. They are in
negotiations to transform the spheres into footballs bearing
company logos during the event.
	   There are even rumors of a plan to build a tenth sphere to be
used as a conference room. Andre Waterkijn, the aging designer of
the structure, does not like this idea. ``Where would they put it?
Underground?'' he said Wednesday.

Opponents vent anger at Murdoch purchase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Angry fans got their chance Thursday
to vent their opposition to the proposed takeover of Manchester
United by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television network.
	   At a stormy shareholders meeting at Old Trafford, some fans
called for the resignation of soccer chairman Martin Edwards and
Sir Roland Smith, chairman of the company which owns the club.
	   While the takeover was not officially on the agenda of the
annual assembly, it dominated the proceedings as opponents voiced
their anger at selling out to the Australian-born media magnate.
	   ``This club was built by the people of Manchester,'' one
shareholder said. ``This will be the last meeting of Manchester
United Football Club if this deal goes through. The money Sky will
make will not be given to Manchester United, it will be used to
support the weak areas of that company.''
	   The 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid _ a world record for
a sports franchise _ has already been accepted by the board of
directors. But the purchase was put on hold after the government
referred the deal to its Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
	   The MMC, which will investigate whether the deal breaks the
rules of fair trading, is due to issue its findings by March 12.
	   Opponents say BSkyB's takeover of Europe's richest club would
increase Murdoch's already huge stake in TV coverage of soccer in
Britain and create a monopoly.
	   The English Football Association has also come out against the
deal, saying it would make one club far too powerful.
	   ``If we sell out, will Manchester United be synonymous with
football in the future or will it be synonymous with television?''
one shareholder asked. ``We are not interested in making money. We
are interested in football _ without the supporters you have
nothing.''
	   Michael Crick, one of the shareholders opposed to the bid, said
Smith was ``not fit to hold office in this company.''
	   Smith defended the proposed takeover as ``a vision of the
future.''
	   ``To make profits of around 30 million pounds (dlrs 50 million)
out of a 90 million pound (dlrs 150 million) turnover is a great
reflection on the management,'' he said. ``It is an exceptional
performance but 90 million (dlrs 150 million) is not big business.
We have to look at the next 10 years. We have to have the resources
and to get in with a large communications business would be
advantageous.''
	   Smith said he wanted to take United, which has won the English
Premier League four of the past six seasons, beyond its present-day
success.
	   ``I was born in the roughest part of Manchester and I want
United to be in the top four clubs in Europe consistently and that
requires money,'' he said. ``If you haven't got money you are
bracketed with the clubs who look at this takeover as a bad thing.
	   ``It's no good looking back at the days of Sir Matt Busby. We
have to move on. But I can assure you that there is no way this
club will lose its identity if the takeover goes through. Nobody is
going to pay 623 million pounds then destroy it.''

Makinen after third-straight rally title; Sainz chases his third
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tommi Makinen is chasing a record third straight
World Rally Championship. Carlos Sainz is bidding for his third
title in six years.
	   Makinen, the 34-year-old Finn driving for Mitsubishi, leads
Sainz's Toyota by two points entering the season's final event,
Britain's Network Q Rally starting Sunday.
	   Another Makinen title would arguably make Finland _ with Mika
Hakkinen having taken the Formula One title _ the world's top motor
sports country.
	   The three-day rally begins and ends in Cheltenham in western
England and covers almost 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) through
Wales and central England in wet, fall weather conditions.
	   ``This rally is always difficult,'' Makinen said. ``If it is
held in bad weather like last year, anything can happen.''
	   Makinen, winner of five of the 12 rallies this season _
including the last one in Australia _ leads with 58 points and
doesn't need to win the rally. Just finishing ahead of Sainz will
be good enough.
	   The Spaniard, probably the sentimental choice of many in racing,
knows his task.
	   ``For me it is quite clear,'' he said. ``My tactic is to go out
and beat Tommi by two points. I cannot do any more.''
	   Sainz termed the British rally ``one of the most difficult in
the championship series because the conditions _ ice, fog, rain,
sometimes snow _ make it so difficult to contest.''
	   Sainz suffered a crucial setback in Australia when stewards
reversed a one-minute penalty against Makinen for jumping the start
of a stage.
	   Makinen protested and won, arguing the starting system for the
stage had not been approved by FIA, the world governing body of the
sport.
	   Makinen went on to win the rally by 16.5 seconds over Sainz.
	   Sainz, 36, last won the world title in 1992 after taking his
first in 1990. Since then he's been tantalizingly close with two
second and two thirds in the overall standings.
	   Former world champion Colin McRae (Subaru) of Scotland is out of
the title chase with 45 points after blowing a turbocharger in
Australia.
	   ``I think it helps us a lot that Colin cannot win the title
anymore,'' Sainz admitted. ``I am sure that he will be very strong
for victory, but the challenge I have to think about is Tommi.''
	   The other local interest will be focused on Makinen's Mitsubishi
teammate Richard Burns, who is sixth in the overall standings (23
points) and could be among the favorites _ and a spoiler _ after
extensive testing on his home roads.
	   ``Clearly, we want to give Richard his head and let him go for a
victory,'' said Mitsubishi team manager Phil Short. ``That improves
our chances in the manufacturers' championship and makes it more
difficult for Carlos to be the championship driver.''
	   In the manufacturers' standings, Toyota leads with 85 points
followed by Mitsubishi (81), Subaru (65) and Ford (43).

France tries to lessen Yugoslav resistance to NATO deployment in
</HEADLINE>
Macedonia
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Serbia's premier.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As preparations broadened to set up
a well-armed NATO force for possible intervention in Kosovo, a
senior French diplomat sought Thursday to soften Yugoslav
resistance to the idea.
	   Special envoy Jacques Huntzinger, the French ambassador to
Macedonia, talked with Serbian president Milan Milutinovic Thursday
after meeting Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic the previous
day.
	   Yugoslavia _ and Serbia, its dominant republic _ reject the
deployment of NATO combat troops in Macedonia. The troops are meant
to come to the aid of unarmed observers in neighboring Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province, should they be menaced.
But Yugoslav and Serbian officials say the troops threaten their
territory.
	   Huntzinger told reporters that high on the agenda in his talks
was resistance to the NATO deployments.
	   He said he was not in Serbia to mediate the crisis but stressed
his country would play an increasing role in the region with the
deployment of the French-commanded, NATO rapid reaction force.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo
following nearly eight months of bloodshed between government
forces and separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas, Milosevic agreed
to allow 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo. They are to ensure
Milosevic abides by the agreement.
	   ``The French government is concerned with the slow developments
in the (Kosovo) peace process,'' Huntzinger said, apparently
alluding to lasting sporadic bloodshed and the lack of
Serb-Albanian agreement on the basics of a U.S.-sponsored political
agreement.
	   ``There is still a lot of bread on the table,'' Huntzinger said,
using a Serb idiom to reflect the slowness of the peace process.
	   The French diplomat planned to return to Skopje, Macedonia,
Thursday and travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina Saturday to meet
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   On Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that its consent to serve as a base for ``any
military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to long-term
interests of the two countries.''
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia _ a former Yugoslav republic _handed a
counter-protest to Yugoslavia, saying the deployment of foreign
troops is the country's internal matter.
	   Also Wednesday, two senior NATO officials, U.S. Admiral James O.
Ellis and French Gen. Marcel Valentin, traveled to Skopje and met
Macedonian officials. Macedonian authorities are expected to give
the green light for NATO deployment within 10 days.
	   Local reports said that the first of the 1,800-strong
all-European extraction force, including tanks and helicopters,
would start arriving in Macedonia on Dec. 1.
	   Reflecting Serbian reluctance to relinquish tight control of
Kosovo, Serbia's president on Wednesday rejected a U.S. blueprint
for Kosovo's future, saying it gives too much power to ethnic
Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian province.
	   Milutinovic said Kosovo Albanians could have self-rule but must
remain part of Serbia.
	   A draft version of the plan proposed by the top U.S. mediator in
Kosovo, Christopher Hill, envisages almost no Serbian control in
the province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. The proposal was published in an Albanian-language
paper Wednesday,
	   Milutinovic rejected the plan as a violation of Serbia's
``territorial integrity.''
	   In Pristina on Thursday, Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic
accused ethnic Albanian politicians of stalling the peace process
by refusing to meet Milutinovic on Wednesday.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders have refused 17 Serbian invitations to
negotiate on Kosovo, insisting on foreign mediation. The Serbs, in
turn, reject such foreign involvement, saying Kosovo is Serbia's
internal matter.

U.S. Embassy in Thailand to close for three days for security
</HEADLINE>
reasons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital
will be closed for three days because of security concerns, an
embassy spokesman said Thursday.
	   The spokesman declined to discuss whether there was a specific
threat against the embassy, but said the closing starting Friday
was related to matters discussed in a ``Worldwide Caution'' issued
by the U.S. State Department Nov. 12.
	   That public warning said ``the potential for retaliatory acts
against Americans and American interests overseas continues to
exist,'' in light of tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections, the August bombings of U.S embassies in East Africa
and the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, and the arrests
of suspects in the embassy bombings.
	   It also warned of continuing threats by ``terrorists,''
including Usama bin Ladin, who was indicted for the embassy
bombings.
	   ``We take these threats seriously and the U.S. has increased
security at United States government facilities worldwide,'' it
said, adding that some posts had temporarily suspended or limited
services to the public.
	   The decision to close the Bangkok embassy was a local initiative
in response to the security threat and not a worldwide directive,
said the spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
He said he did not know if other U.S. missions were planning to
close.
	   A political gossip column in Thursday's edition of the Bangkok
Post claimed that U.S. authorities had alerted their Thai
counterparts to the presence of three known Arab terrorists,
operating separately in Thailand for the past three months.
	   In August, Thailand's intelligence agencies were put on alert
against possible reprisals against American-owned businesses after
the U.S. raids in Afghanistan and Sudan, a senior Thai police
officer said.
	   ``The level of the alert will not be as high as during the Gulf
War but it's better to take preventive measures now,'' Maj. Gen.
Sawek Wattanakit, commander of the second division of the Special
Branch Police Bureau, said at the time. ``The threat of possible
attacks is very real and we suggest that those who may targeted
take extra precautions as well.''
	   During the Gulf War, Thai soldiers were called out to guard the
U.S. Embassy and other Western diplomatic facilities.
	   In July, six Pakistanis suspected of terrorist links were
arrested in Bangkok in a joint operation by Thai police and the
FBI. They were not charged with any crimes, and were deported.
	   In 1994, a truck carrying a large explosive device was abandoned
near the Israeli Embassy after becoming involved in a traffic
accident. An Iranian man was found guilty of the murder of the
truck's driver, intended sabotage, membership in a criminal gang
and possession of bomb-making material in 1996. But Thailand's
supreme court threw out the conviction earlier this year, ruling
there was not sufficient evidence.

	   ROME (AP) _ A U.S. military helicopter crashed into the sea
Thursday off Sicily, the U.S. Navy said.
	   Two crew members were rescued with no injuries while the Navy
was searching for two missing crewmen, the 6th Fleet said.
	   The CH-46 helicopter, deployed aboard the USNS Sirius, went down
about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Augusta Bay, on
Sicily's eastern coast. It had been bringing supplies to the USS
Stump in the central Mediterranean.
	   The NAVY said the cause of the incident was under investigation
and that the names of crew members involved were being withheld
pending notification of family members.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ From TV appearances to public utterances,
Western officials are campaigning for this Balkan nation's first
post-communist constitution, calling Sunday's referendum critical
for its future democracy.
	   Worn down by years of unrest and political chaos in Europe's
poorest country, Albanians are likely to approve it. But they are
skeptical it will do anything to end chronic instability.
	   ``All the foreigners are saying that it is a good
constitution,'' says a doubtful Bajram Muharremi, a 57-year-old
retired mechanic, at a downtown stand where he sells roasted corn
to make ends meet. ``They know better than we do ... so I will vote
for it.''
	   Drafted by the ruling Socialists and approved last month by the
parliament they dominate, the constitution sets out civil,
democratic and human rights based on Western and European
standards.
	   But coming only weeks after rioting rocked the capital, the
campaign has been less a debate about constitutional principles
than a fierce fight between two long-feuding parties locked in a
struggle for power.
	   Words like ``death,'' ``terror'' and ``murderer'' boom
frequently from loudspeakers at rallies of the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha, which is urging
a voter boycott.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, practically engineered their own
victory by tinkering with voting laws, abolishing the requirement
that turnout must exceed 50 percent for the measure to be valid.
	   Into the fray have stepped a leading European official and a
host of other visiting diplomats, unabashedly taking sides in the
name of democracy.
	   The ambassador of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, Daan Everts, appears almost nightly on one Albanian
television or another, explaining or lauding the Socialists' draft
constitution or talking about human rights.
	   Officials from Austria and elsewhere have joined in the
campaign, telling Albanians there can be no democracy, no secure
future, without such a charter.
	   The opposition has accused the OSCE of a propaganda campaign.
Everts denies he or the other officials are urging a ``yes'' vote,
although their continual public praise of the document make their
position clear.

SAfrican mine company in talks with Iran over gold deposit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An arm of industrial giant
Anglo-American said Thursday it is negotiating with the Iranian
government to develop a gold deposit in the northwest of the
country.
	   The company's Minorco subsidiary has been investigating mining
ventures in Iran since at least 1994, and has asked Teheran for
permission to do a feasibility study on what it calls the Zarshuran
gold prospect.
	   ``There has been a lot of red tape and bureaucracy which has
been an impediment to our efforts,'' Glen Finnegan, a Minorco
spokesperson in Johannesburg, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Minorco said it is hopeful that a deal can be struck that would
give the company exclusive rights to the property.
	   Minorco's discussions with Teheran come at a time when Iran is
showing signs of opening up to the west, both diplomatically and
commercially.
	   A driving force of the tentative efforts are plans to diversify
Iran's revenue base from its overwhelming dependence on oil.
	   Minorco declined to say how large the deposit is or what sort of
contribution it would make to its current gold asset base.
	   Anglo American owns 46 percent of Minorco, which is expected to
be swallowed up when the larger company lists next year on the
London stock exchange.
	   Minorco's efforts to establish a foothold in Iran will likely
receive a boost after this week's a visit to South Africa by Iran's
mines minister Eshaq Jahangiri.

Parliament approves minimum wage, poverty level increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Despite government objections, Ukraine's
parliament gave final approval Thursday to a bill raising the
minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) a month to 148 hryvna (dlrs
43) a month.
	   Parliament also voted 270-1 to set the official poverty level at
118.6 hryvna (dlrs 35) a month.
	   The figures are used as a base to calculate various payments
throughout the country. Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the
minimum wage. The average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs
50) in the first half of 1998.
	   The cash-strapped government has argued against the bill, saying
it would cost the state an additional 8 million hryvna (dlrs 2.33
million) by the end of 1998.
	   But the leftist-dominated Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, long
has favored extra spending for social needs and gave initial
approval to the raise last month.
	   Members of the opposition Progressive Socialist Party, who
proposed the raise, even declared a hunger strike in parliament
earlier this week to push the legislation through, putting white
bands around their heads as a sign of the strike.
	   President Leonid Kuchma has the right to veto the bill within 15
days or sign it into law.
	   In another development Thursday, news reports said Kuchma's
government is finding it hard to fulfill its obligations under a
1997 law providing for a pension and wage raise to compensate for
inflation.
	   The government is obliged to give compensatory payments once the
annual inflation level exceeds 5 percent. Inflation so far in 1998
has reached nearly 13 percent.
	   However, Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov said Cabinet is facing a
``very complex problem'' and does not have the required 108 million
hryvna (dlrs 31.5 million) to provide the compensation, the
independent Ukrainian News service said.
	   ``We will have to return to the issue of compensation and
envisage its provision only for the least protected part of the
population,'' Mitiukov said.

Armenians demonstrate against U.S. intervention in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ About 300 people demonstrated outside
the United States' embassy Thursday, protesting U.S. threats to
attack Iraq.
	   The demonstrators, mostly students, were members of the Armenian
Conservative Party. They demonstrated outside new concrete walls
still under construction as part of a worldwide effort to improve
U.S. embassy security.
	   ``We came here to defend Iraqi children from American bombings
and protest against a military solution to the crisis. America must
not play the role of the world gendarme,'' said Mikael Airapetian,
the leader of the party.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air strikes against
Iraq if it did not allow United Nations' weapon inspectors to carry
out their work. Iraq relented earlier this week and the inspections
resumed Wednesday.
	   The demonstrators delivered a petition for U.S. Ambassador to
Armenia Michael Lemmon.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Japanese get personal with Clinton, solidarity
</HEADLINE>
for sleepless leaders &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Asia
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Osaka housewife with two children spoke the two
dreaded words: Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``How did you apologize to Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea?'' the woman
asked President Bill Clinton through a translator. ``I'd never be
able to forgive my husband for doing that. But did they really
forgive you, Mr. President?''
	   Clinton's reply was clipped. ``Well I did in a direct and
straightforward manner and I believe they did, yes.'' After a burst
of self-conscious laughter from his audience, Clinton added. ``But
that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
	   Hours before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee gaveled its
impeachment hearings to order _ and a hemisphere away _ the
president spoke generically of the presidency's pressures. ``Of
course, sometimes you want to get away from it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The town-hall meeting, taped for broadcast in Japan Thursday
night, launched the president's five-day Asia trip on a ticklishly
personal note. The TV moderator invited questions on ``leadership
and personality.'' And so it went:
	   Out of the dishes that your wife cooks, what do you like best?
``Chicken enchiladas.''
	   Did you have good grades in school when you were a kid?
``Mostly.''
	   How involved was he in ``baby raising'' after Chelsea was born?
``I was very involved with her from the time she was a very small
baby, always going to her events and always working with her on her
homework until it became too difficult for me.''
	   To a junior-high school student in search of tips on public
speaking, Clinton advised, ``If you're in a big crowd, the
microphone is your friend.''
	   Then the Lewinsky question. ``Let's change the topic now,'' the
moderator instructed.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Accused by one Japanese man of going ``over our heads'' to
pursue U.S. relations with China, Clinton dodged a direct appeal
for support of Osaka _ and not Beijing _ in the site selection for
the 2008 Olympic games. ``Thank goodness I will no longer be
president. I won't have to make that opinion,'' Clinton said. As if
to offer Osaka a consolation prize, Clinton noted that he often
traveled there when he was Arkansas governor. ``I even remember the
last restuarant I ate in in Osaka _ Steakhouse Ron,'' Clinton said,
spelling out the name. ``If it's still there may be I got them some
business tonight.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   If Clinton's 19-hour flight to Japan left him sleepy, Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi could sympathize. Obuchi acknowledged at the
opening of Thursday's state dinner at the Akasaka Palace that, on
the heels of a trip to Russia, he hadn't returned from an economic
summit in Malaysia until 2:00 that morning.
	   ``I've come to realize clearly it is not only liberalism and
democracy that Japan and the United States share,'' Obuchi said,
offering a toast to Clinton, who came to Japan after several days
of late-hour deliberations on the standoff with Iraq.
	   ``Short sleeping hours and hard schedules have become the sort
of bond tying you Mr. President and me.''
	   Replied Clinton, ``Since you mentioned, it perhaps we can make
sure that we both stay awake.''

Jockey great to auction off trophies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former champion jockey Lester Piggott is putting
some of his most prized possessions up for sale.
	   The collection, including paintings and six of his champion
jockey trophies, is expected to raise an estimated 100,000 pounds
(dlrs 167,000) when it goes under the hammer at Sotheby's next
Wednesday.
	   Piggott, 63, who was once jailed for tax evasion, said he was
selling the items because they had been sitting around in boxes at
his home.
	   ``I had a lot of stuff and I haven't the room,'' he said. ``It's
always sad when you lose something but when you can't put it up ...
there's no point (in keeping it). I am attached to all of (the
items) but it had to be done sometime.'' ''
	   Part of the proceeds are expected to go to the Injured Jockeys'
Fund.
	   Piggott rode 5,300 winners in more than 30 countries in his
47-year career. He rode nine English Derby winners and a record
total of 30 British Classics.
	   A spokesman for Sotheby's said all the champion jockey trophies
would be extremely sought after, but the most valuable piece was a
bronze sculpture of two horses by the French artist Mene _ thought
to be worth 8,000 to 12,000 pounds (dlrs 13,300 to dlrs 20,000).

Heroin shipment seized in southern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Security agents in the southern Ukrainian
city of Mykolaiv seized a shipment of 500 grams (17.35 ounces) of
heroin worth about dlrs 125,000, officials said Thursday.
	   The heroin was carried by two Mykolaiv women on a train from
Moscow, Tetiana Malysheva, spokeswoman for the regional branch of
the Ukrainian Security Service, told the Interfax news agency.
	   The shipment, intercepted with the help of Russian security
services, was the largest seized in the region in recent years, she
said.
	   Drug smuggling throughout Ukraine has increased dramatically
since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and its rigid border
controls. Officials say international criminal gangs are using
Ukraine to bring drugs to Europe.

Butler says he will resign if it makes Iraq reveal banned weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
said in remarks published Thursday that he was ready to quit his
job if it meant Iraq would reveal all its banned weapons.
	   ``If it becomes clear that Iraq will fully cooperate and reveal
all the banned weapons ... then the lifting of sanctions will be
achieved,'' Butler said in an interview with the London-based
Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.
	   ``If the only obstacle is Richard Butler ... I am ready to
resign.'' he said. ``I took this job to carry out the mission and
it is logical for me to resign if I am the real obstacle,'' he
added.
	   Iraq has over the past months called for Butler's resignation
and accused him of working on behalf of the Americans, charges that
he denies.
	   A U.S. military attack on Iraq was averted when Iraq announced
Saturday that it was ready to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors who are charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq froze all kinds of cooperation with the inspectors on Oct.
31.
	   ``When Iraq prevents us from doing our job, it is violating
(international) law. They say we are provoking them where as in
fact they are doing that,'' Butler was quoted as saying.
	   Weapons inspectors should confirm that Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction before the economic sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, are lifted.
	   Butler's comments were published in Arabic and translated into
English by The Associated Press.

Liverpool in poor shape to face up to rampant Villa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It's not a pretty sight for Liverpool fans _ 11
places behind leader Aston Villa with 12 points to make up when the
two sides meet Saturday.
	   The fans are used to it being the other way around.
	   It hurts, too, that Liverpool had just one player on the field
when England beat the Czech Republic on Wednesday and Villa had
three. The Merseysiders are used to having three or four.
	   Aston Villa's emergence as a title contender coincides with
Liverpool's decline. While the buoyant Midlands club is three
points clear atop the Premier League standings after its best ever
start of 12 games undefeated, the Merseyside giant is sliding down
the standings with its stars fading.
	   Last week Liverpool finally severed its unique management chain
by saying farewell to co-manager Roy Evans, who had been with the
club as a player or coach for 33 years. Evans was the last of a
series of managers, starting with Bill Shankly in the early 1960s,
to be appointed from within the club.
	   With Steve McManaman sidelined for six weeks with an injury and
reportedly on the brink of moving abroad and Paul Ince building up
suspensions at club and international levels, Liverpool is in poor
shape to mount a challenge to Villa's leadership.
	   At Villa Park on Saturday, John Gregory's team will be confident
of beating an ailing Liverpool, which now has French coach Gerard
Houllier in sole charge.
	   The Frenchman hopes that Michael Owen, who missed last weekend's
home 3-1 loss to Leeds and England's game against the Czechs, will
be back to take on Villa.
	   But Liverpool's shaky defense will face an in-form Villa
strikeforce in which new signing Dion Dublin has scored five goals
in his two outings since moving from Coventry. Paul Merson, who
scored for England against the Czechs on Wednesday, will play
behind Dublin and the talented but erratic Stan Collymore.
	   Lee Hendrie, who almost scored on his England debut Wednesday at
age 21, will be in midfield while regular international center-back
Gareth Southgate will be in defense along with 17-year-old Gareth
Barry, a certain England player of the future who has already
played in national Under-21 colors.
	   If Liverpool can overturn the formbook and win at Villa Park,
Manchester United has the chance to go top for the first time this
season by winning at Sheffield Wednesday. United has a superior
goal difference.
	   Defending titlist Arsenal, in third place and four points behind
Villa, hopes for a win at mid-standings Wimbledon. Fourth place
Chelsea, boosted by high-scoring wins over Arsenal (5-0 in the
League Cup) and Wimbledon (3-0 in the Premier League), hopes to
continue that streak by winning at Leicester.
	   Leeds, beaten only once at home and in fifth place, should gain
three points from an Elland Road game against a Charlton team which
has won only once on the road in seven outings.
	   Southampton has its best chance yet of climbing away from last
place when it goes to next to last Blackburn with two points to
make up.
	   The Saints lost 4-1 at home to Villa last week but meet a
Blackburn team missing its star striker Chris Sutton, who is in the
middle of a four-game ban.
	   Other games Saturday are Middlesbrough-Coventry and
Tottenham-Nottingham Forest, while West Ham goes to Derby on Sunday
and Newcastle visits Everton on Monday.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, unbeaten in its first 18 games
and five points clear of its rivals, should gain three points from
a home game against surprise struggler Barnsley, which was a
Premier League team last season.
	   Second place Ipswich, which also looks a strong candidate for
the second automatic promotion spot even at this early stage, hosts
mid-standings Bolton.
	   The first Celtic-Rangers confrontation of the season takes place
in Scotland with defending titlist Celtic already 10 points behind
its Glasgow rival in third place with only 14 matches gone.
	   Rangers, chasing its 10th title in 11 seasons, holds a six-point
advantage over second place Kilmarnock, which hosts
rapidly-improving Motherwell.

Investigators raid offices of India's largest private company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Federal sleuths Thursday raided offices
of Reliance Industries, India's largest private sector company,
looking for evidence against a top executive allegedly involved in
a political bribery scandal, officials said.
	   An officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation said the raids
were ordered to investigate alleged violations of the Official
Secrets Act by the company official, but gave few other details.
	   The CBI officer said on condition of anonymity that searches
were carried out in the Reliance offices in New Delhi, Bombay and
some other cities but investigators were yet to report back on the
seizures.
	   The CBI was looking for evidence against the conglomerate's
Group President V. Balasubramanian, who allegedly got some top
secret government documents even before they were presented in
Parliament. Details were not immediately known.
	   Reliance Industries, a multiproducts giant, refused comment on
the CBI raids. Balasubramanian has been absconding since
investigators charged him last month.
	   The New Delhi police, which registered a case against
Balasubramanian before federal investigators took over the
investigation, alleged that the Reliance official gained access to
government papers through Anand Sharma, described as a master
swindler with close links with powerful politicians, bureaucrats
and mafia gangs, some based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
	   Sharma was arrested last month and charged with bribing top
Indian politicians from various political parties in return for
business deals over years.
	   On Thursday, reports of the CBI raids on Reliance offices
created unease in Bombay's stock market, Dow Jones Newswires
reported.
	   Shares ended lower on a lack of institutional buying and selling
by local operators, and Reliance stock closed at 119.60 rupees
(dlrs 2.8), down 1.7 rupees (less than a cent) or 1.4 percent from
its previous finish.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Police Thursday identified 23 soccer
hooligans responsible for violence before and after an Italian
League game in Bologna earlier this month and banned them from
attending their clubs' games for one year.
	   About a dozen people were injured in clashes Nov. 8 involving
police and rival supporters of first-division teams Bologna and AS
Roma.
	   The 23 _ five from Bologna, 18 from Rome _ were identified in
photographs and television footage. They must report to police
headquarters each time their team plays a game during the next

Ultranationalist senator fined in civil libel case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's supreme court ordered an
ultranationalist senator to pay more than dlrs 2,000 in damages for
slandering Romanian writers.
	   Corneliu Vadim Tudor, 48, and head of the ultranationalist
Greater Romania party confirmed Thursday he had lost the first of
hundreds of libel cases brought against him. Tudor escaped
punishment in the previous criminal cases because of his
parliamentary immunity.
	   In 1995, the Romanian writers' union sued Tudor for libel and
slander after he publicly accused them during a news program of
extravagant spending at a writers' conference to which he was not
invited.
	   The writers lost the case previously in two lower courts, but on
Wednesday Romania's Supreme Court overturned the rulings in a civil
case and fined Tudor 20 million lei (dlrs 2,000) for moral damages
and three million lei (dlrs 300) for legal expenses. The decision
is final.
	   Tudor said he would take the case to an international court.
	   The senator claimed he lost the case because ``Romania's general
prosecutor is just a puppet of President (Emil) Constantinescu,''
he said by telephone.
	   During communism, Tudor was known for writing fawning verses to
former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who created a personality cult.
	   After communism ended in 1989, Tudor published the Greater
Romania weekly, which labels government and public officials Jews,
Hungarians, homosexuals and thieves.

Greece ratifies U.N. decision to establish war crimes tribunals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's parliament on Thursday grudgingly
ratified a 1993 U.N. Security Council decision establishing the war
crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia.
	   ``We vote in favor with a heavy heart,'' said Yiannis
Papadimopoulos, a deputy with the main opposition conservative New
Democracy party.
	   Although Greece has distanced itself from the Bosnian Serbs in
the past four years, it was one of Serbia's few Western allies
during the Bosnian war as the two countries are bound by a common
Orthodox Christian heritage and traditional ties of friendship.
	   But some deputies argued that ratification will allow Greece to
use the court as a possible precedent to put Turkey on trial for
alleged crimes committed during its 1974 invasion of Cyprus.
	   In a voice vote, the 300-member unicameral house ratified the
decision which established the court in The Hague, Netherlands, to
try individuals charged with war crimes allegedly committed in the
former Yugoslavia since 1991. It has so far indicted 58 people.
	   It also ratified a 1994 decision establishing a similar court
for Rwanda. Only the small Communist party, with 11 seats, did not
participate in the vote.
	   Following ratification, Greece will be obliged to arrest anyone
indicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, including Bosnian
Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic. In some
circles here, both men are seen as popular heroes.
	   Greece is bound by international law to make such arrests, but
ratification serves to close any possible loopholes.
	   Trying to find a silver lining in the decision, New Democracy
parliamentary speaker Prokopis Pavlopoulos said it could be applied
to Turkey.
	   ``Voting in favor on the part of Greece allows our country to
refer to the courts as an international precedent so that it can
impose its expansion to other similar cases, for example the crimes
of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus,'' Pavlopoulos told the
house.
	   Turkey ostensibly invaded the eastern Mediterranean island in
1974 to protect the Turkish minority there after an Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriots declared independence in the northern third 15
years ago, but only Turkey recognizes the mini-state.
U.N.-sponsored reunification talks between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots remain deadlocked.

	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ World Cup of Golf veteran
Seymour Rose, 58, said the slowed greens of the seaside Gulf Harbor
course made it a difficult first day for him _ 31 years after he
first played his first cup tournament in Mexico City.
	   After practice and pro-am days of criticism for the fast-running
greens, keepers cut them longer, causing Rose problems with his
short game.
	   Seymour fired a first round 80, which tied him third-last on the
64-player field. With playing partner Delroy Cambridge adding a
respectable even 72 to lie 27th in individual standings, the team
made a slow first day start to the tourney, ending tied for
third-last at 152 with Mexico.
	   Tail-enders are Luxembourg (159) and Netherlands (163).
	   A self-taught golfer who turned pro in 1960, Rose said at age 16
he was shooting par rounds on the local nine-hole course, learning
``as you go along. You sort of make sure you copy the guys who are
doing well.''
	   Living in the cricket-mad West Indies meant ``golf was not big
in Jamaica, it never took on among the local people.''
	   But living beside the local course as a kid made its impression.
	   ``I'm straight out of the old school,'' he said when asked why
he responded to the applause of gallery crowds.
	   ``Some of these (other) guys make a nice shot and they never
hear (the applause), y'know. They're there for something
different.''
	   Rose said he was pleased to have gone around with Welsh veteran
Ian Woosnam and teammate Phillip Price.
	   ``It sure helps to play along with these guys,'' Rose said.
	   Being a club superintendant at the Super Club golf club in
Jamaica's Runaway Bay meant he didn't see much international
competition each year.
	   ``I still maintain my (golf) professionalship and I'm still a
pro there. I play on my own course every day _ but it's not
(international) competition.''
	   But Rose remains fiercely proud of representing his country at
what he calls the Olympics of golf.
	   ``You're playing for the country and you want to make yourself s
proud as you can out there,'' he said as stood with sweat
glistening on his face after a tough round.
	   His best performance at a World Cup was a tie for 25th in teams
and a 37th in individual play. He will try again for the Jamaican
team at next year's World Cup in Malaysia.

Former ETA leader asks government for first step with prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A former leader of the Basque separatist
group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners
to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace
talks.
	   ``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region,
this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as
Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose
Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
	   Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving
time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group. He was let
out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he
won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct. 25.
	   Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members
held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the
Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
	   One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be
moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
	   ETA declared an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 16. The government
has responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is
prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
	   But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the
government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way
for talks.
	   In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry
last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in
hospitals of their choice.

Former ETA leader asks government for first step with prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct category

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A former leader of the Basque separatist
group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners
to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace
talks.
	   ``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region,
this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as
Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose
Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
	   Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving
time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group. He was let
out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he
won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct. 25.
	   Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members
held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the
Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
	   One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be
moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
	   ETA declared an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 16. The government
has responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is
prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
	   But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the
government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way
for talks.
	   In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry
last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in
hospitals of their choice.

Jospin encourages EU enlargement as well as EU reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zeman quotes.
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ French Premier Lionel Jospin spoke
in favor of EU enlargement Thursday, but warned there was work to
be done on both sides before expansion becomes a fact.
	   Jospin arrived in Prague late Wednesday to meet with his Czech
counterpart, Milos Zeman, as well as President Vaclav Havel. He is
accompanied by Foreign minister Hubert Vedrine, Defense minister
Alain Richard and a group of prominent businessmen.
	   Enlargement of the European Union was expectably the focus of
his brief meeting with Havel Thursday.
	   Accession negotiations for new EU members which include the
Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia, started on November
10 initiating a period of nuts and bolts discussions and reform.
	   ``There are technical and legal problems which must be settled
to make enlargement a positive thing for the Czech Republic which
will dictate the (enlargement's) rhythm,'' Jospin said without
elaboration. ``We are naturally warmly in favor of early admission
of the Czech Republic in the EU.''
	   Pronouncements on enlargement have, however, turned more
cautious in recent years.
	   Speaking in Prague in April 1997, French President Jacques
Chirac said it was reasonable to believe Czechs could become EU
members by the year 2000.
	   ``I am not sure that can be done,'' Havel said Thursday. ``But I
would be happy if it could happen shortly after that, maybe in the
year 2003.''
	   Jospin called Havel's words ``wise and realistic'', adding pace
of reform and adaptation to EU requirements was crucial for each
candidate.
	   Jospin also acknowledged the need for EU to reform its
institutions before new members are admitted.
	   ``I am convinced we will move in that direction fast enough so
it doesn't interfere with enlargement which should be based solely
on economic matters,'' Jospin said. ``We have to clean up the house
to be able to welcome you properly.''
	   After meeting with Zeman later Thursday, Jospin said he was
hopeful economic relations between the two countries could improve.
	   France's commercial exchange with the Czech Republic has tripled
over the past five years to dlrs 2 billion, but Germany dominates
Czech foreign trade.
	   Zeman said his center-left cabinet would ``open new space'' for
French investors in the ongoing process of privatization, namely of
state-owned banks.
	   His government would also seek counsel in the production of
nuclear energy, Zeman said.
	   ``The new Czech government places substantial emphasis on the
importance of France as a world power and a pillar of the European
Union,'' Zeman said.
	   Zeman's center-left one-party minority government came to power
after the country's early elections in June.
	   Later Thursday, Jospin is to deliver a lecture on European
integration to students of Prague's Charles University.

Moscow Mayor launches own political movement
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Accusing the government of ``servility to foreign
advisers,'' Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov launched his own political
movement Thursday, apparently to support his likely presidential
bid in 2000.
	   Luzhkov, who often exploits Russians' nationalist feelings, was
particularly outspoken Thursday about the country's alleged
subjection to the West.
	   ``Foreigners have infiltrated the management of the country, up
to the highest levels,'' Luzhkov said as he addressed 200 allies at
his party's founding meeting at the mayor's office.
	   ``The country is losing its state sovereignty,'' he stated.
``(Foreigners) try to dictate economic and managerial decisions to
our country, taking advantage of the huge foreign debt.'' Russia
owes at least dlrs 200 billion in foreign debt, including debt
inherited from the Soviet Union.
	   So far, Luzhkov has remained non-committal about running for
president in the 2000 election, though he is widely expected to
join the race.
	   With characteristic secretiveness, Luzhkov aides decided at the
last minute to keep the Thursday meeting closed to the press, and
only a few opening remarks could be overheard.
	   Luzhkov noted the progress Russia has made toward democracy and
free market in the past few years, but then proceeded to an
emotional outline of the government's ``irresponsible shock
therapy'' and ``reforms unsupported by resources.''
	   Russia's ``achievements have a superficial nature, because the
majority of the people, having grown poor, have lost access to
them,'' he said.
	   ``The lack of professionalism in the government has led to
serious deformations and destructive results in the economy,'' he
said. ``There is an excess of corruption and cupidity, servility to
foreign advisers, a deficit of patriotism.''
	   Statements like these appeal to many Russians and may win over
some voters who earlier supported the Communists.
	   Luzhkov also took a jab at radical hard-line leaders _ ``those
hysterical doomsayers and irresponsible hooligans who, while
cursing and criticizing the situation, have themselves nothing to
offer.''
	   Under Luzhkov's administration, Moscow has been transformed into
Russia's only boomtown _ at least until the current economic crisis
hit. Unlike most nationalists and Communists, he enjoys a
reputation of a good manager.
	   But it is unclear how much support Luzhkov can muster in the
impoverished hinterlands, which often resent Moscow's relative
prosperity and special status.
	   Luzhkov has repeatedly called for a social-democratic party,
similar to those led by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   He has said that his movement, called Fatherland, would advocate
free-market principles yet preserve a strong state sector in the
economy.
	   Others expected to run in the 2000 election are Alexander Lebed,
a former general who is now governor of a vast region in Siberia;
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov; liberal lawmaker Grigory
Yavlinsky; and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov could also become a top choice,
but he has so far denied presidential ambitions. Boris Yeltsin
cannot run for a third term.

Group says Bosnian Serbs may have used nerve gas at Srebrenica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Human rights investigators
Thursday called for an international investigation into claims that
Bosnian Serb forces may have fired nerve gas at Muslims fleeing
Srebrenica in 1995.
	   After speaking to about 35 survivors of the attack on the
Bosnian enclave, Washington-based Human Rights Watch said their
accounts suggest Bosnian Serbs fired the BZ nerve agent at the
refugees.
	   Officially called 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, BZ is a nerve agent
similar to the drug LSD which produces hallucinations in victims.
	   Witnesses said Serb mortar shells released a low-hanging cloud
of colored smoke. Shortly after the shelling, refugees began
hallucinating; some killed friends, others committed suicide, Human
Rights Watch said in a press release.
	   However, the group conceded that its two-year investigation had
failed to turn up any physical evidence of a gas attack such as
chemical traces in shells or on the clothes of victims.
	   It handed its findings to the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in
The Hague which is investigating alleged atrocities in Srebrenica.
	   In a press release, Human Rights Watch said it wanted an
international investigation ``to bring justice to the victims,
strengthen international controls over the proliferation of
chemical weapons and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former
Yugoslavia.''
	   Tribunal spokesman Jim Landale confirmed investigators would
check the claims.
	   The U.N. court has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, for
genocide for allegedly masterminding the mass murder of Muslims
following the July 1995 takeover of Srebrenica, a U.N.-designated
``safe haven'' in eastern Bosnia.
	   The detailed indictment against Karadzic and Mladic makes no
mention of the use of nerve gas. Neither man is in custody.
	   Human Rights Watch claimed that the former Yugoslav People's
Army, known as the JNA, had BZ gas in its arsenals before the 1991
breakup of Yugoslavia.
	   Although the Serb-dominated JNA officially pulled out of the war
in Bosnia in early 1992, it left much of its military hardware in
the hands of the Bosnian Serb Army, which was responsible for the
takeover of Srebrenica.
	   Human Rights Watch also claimed that U.S. authorities
investigated the nerve gas allegations but never published their
findings.
	   Thousands of Muslims are believed to have been massacred in the
aftermath of the Bosnian Serb takeover of Srebrenica. A tribunal
judge who read a summary of evidence of the killings said it
contained ``scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human
history.''

France tries to lessen Yugoslav resistance to NATO deployment in
</HEADLINE>
Macedonia
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Serbia's premier.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As preparations broadened to set up
a well-armed NATO force for possible intervention in Kosovo, a
senior French diplomat sought Thursday to soften Yugoslav
resistance to the idea.
	   Jacques Huntzinger, the French ambassador to Macedonia, talked
with Serbian president Milan Milutinovic on Thursday, the day after
he met with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Huntzinger told reporters that high on the agenda in his talks
was resistance to the NATO deployments.
	   Yugoslavia _ and its dominant republic, Serbia _ both reject the
deployment of NATO combat troops in Macedonia. The troops are meant
to aid unarmed observers in neighboring Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanian-majority Serbian province, should they be menaced. But
Yugoslav and Serbian officials say the troops threaten their
territory.
	   Huntzinger said he was not in Serbia to mediate the crisis but
stressed his country would play an increasing role in the region
with the deployment of the French-commanded, NATO rapid reaction
force.
	   A U.S.-brokered peace agreement for Kosovo on Oct. 12 ended
nearly eight months of bloodshed between government forces and
separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. As part of the deal,
Milosevic agreed to let 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo.
	   ``The French government is concerned with the slow developments
in the (Kosovo) peace process,'' Huntzinger said, apparently
alluding to lasting sporadic bloodshed and the lack of
Serb-Albanian agreement on the basics of a U.S.-sponsored political
agreement.
	   ``There is still a lot of bread on the table,'' Huntzinger said,
using a Frence idiom to reflect the slowness of the peace process.
	   The French diplomat planned to return to Skopje, Macedonia, on
Thursday and was to travel Saturday to Kosovo's capital, Pristina,
to meet ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   On Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that its consent to serve as a base for ``any
military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to long-term
interests of the two countries.''
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia _ a former Yugoslav republic _ handed a
counterprotest to Yugoslavia, saying the deployment of foreign
troops is the country's internal matter.
	   Macedonian authorities are expected to give the green light for
NATO deployment within 10 days.
	   The first of the 1,800-member European extraction force will
start arriving in Macedonia on Dec. 1, local media reported.
	   Reflecting Serbian reluctance to relinquish tight control of
Kosovo, Serbia's president on Wednesday rejected a U.S. blueprint
for Kosovo's future, saying it gives too much power to ethnic
Albanians, the 90-percent majority in the Serbian province.
	   Milutinovic said Kosovo Albanians could have self-rule but must
remain part of Serbia.
	   A draft version of the plan proposed by the top U.S. mediator in
Kosovo, Christopher Hill, envisages almost no Serbian control in
the province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. The proposal was published in an Albanian-language
paper Wednesday,
	   Milutinovic rejected the plan as a violation of Serbia's
``territorial integrity.''

Jockey Club bans American rider for 10 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Puerto Rican-born jockey Angel Monserrate, who
rode 21 times in Britain under an assumed name, was given a 10-year
ban Thursday from riding in Britain.
	   Riding as an amateur under the pseudonym ``Angel Jacobs,''
Monserrate rode five winners in 21 races this year in Britain.
	   Monserrate, 29, was banned in the United States in 1995 for
failing a drug test. In 1996, he was also caught posing as an
amateur in the United States and was charged with criminal
trespass.
	   The American jockey told the Jockey Club disciplinary committee
Thursday he was ``very, very sorry'' and that he did it ``for the
love of racing.''
	   ``Of course I regret what I did,'' he said. ``I don't know if
the punishment is harsh. I will not appeal.''
	   The jockey came to the attention of British officials in August,
largely because of his highly polished style _ unusual among young
amateurs.

France to introduce tough anti-doping law

 &UR; EDS: ADDS fines and prison sentences prescribed by new law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers easily adopted a bill Thursday
that gives France one of the world's toughest anti-doping laws.
	   All parties in parliament voted in favor of the measure except
President Jacques Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic
party (RPR), which abstained, saying more time was needed to debate
the bill.
	   Doping became a national issue during the Tour de France, with
revelations of widespread doping by riders in the hugely popular
summer event.
	   The law, which was approved by the Senate in May, creates a
strong doping prevention committee. It requires sports federations
to show they are acting to eradicate the use of illegal drugs, and
punishes those found prescribing, supplying, encouraging or using
them.
	   The law orders a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine
of up to 50,000 francs (dlrs 8,700) for anyone not co-operating
with authorities in the control of drugs.
	   Those found guilty of prescribing, offering, administering or
using banned substances will face up to five years in prison and a
fine of 500,000 francs (dlrs 87,000).
	   Those punishments rise to seven years in prison and fines of up
to one million francs (dlrs 174,000) in cases where the drug supply
is organized by a group or is targeted at minors.

Jamaica, Botafogo in 1-1 tie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A magnificent curling free kick from
star player Bebeto earned top Brazilian team Botafogo a 1-1 draw
with Jamaica in a friendly international.
	   Bebeto's strike came one minute from full-time and cancelled
striker Deon Burton's equally superb goal for the home team in the
76th minute.
	   Wednesday's match was the first for the Reggae Boyz since their
win over Japan in June in the World Cup and extended their unbeaten
streak at home to 36 matches.
	   The fast-paced game saw the Brazilians having the better of the
early play by making inroads in the Jamaican defense. Their best
chance of the first half came in the third minute when Junior's
header from close range was parried by goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence.
	   The home team came into their own in the second half with the
introduction of Burton, one of the heroes of Jamaica's pre-World
Cup campaign.
	   Burton came close to scoring in the 50th minute but was denied
when his firm shot was saved low down by goalkeeper Silva.
	   Bebeto was also denied by substitute goalkeeper Warren Barrett
in the 63rd minute. His goalbound shot was parried by a sprawling
Barrett after the Brazilian World Cup star was sent clear by a
through pass from midfield.
	   Burton broke the deadlock in the 76th minute after a superb run
by substitute Walter Boyd resulted in a cross that found the Derby
County player unmarked in the penalty area. Burton's acrobatic kick
gave Silva no chance.

Group says Bosnian Serbs may have used nerve gas at Srebrenica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Human rights investigators
Thursday urged an international investigation into claims that
Bosnian Serb forces may have fired nerve gas at Muslims fleeing
Srebrenica in 1995.
	   After speaking to about 35 survivors of the attack on the
Bosnian enclave, Washington-based Human Rights Watch said their
accounts suggest Bosnian Serbs fired the BZ nerve agent at the
refugees.
	   Officially called 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, BZ is a nerve agent
similar to the drug LSD which produces hallucinations in victims.
	   Witnesses said Serb mortar shells released a low-hanging cloud
of colored smoke. Shortly after the shelling, refugees began
hallucinating; some killed friends, others committed suicide, Human
Rights Watch said in a press release.
	   However, the group conceded that its two-year investigation had
failed to turn up any physical evidence of a gas attack such as
chemical traces in shells or on the clothes of victims.
	   It handed its findings to the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in
The Hague which is investigating alleged atrocities in Srebrenica.
	   In a press release, Human Rights Watch said it wanted an
international investigation ``to bring justice to the victims,
strengthen international controls over the proliferation of
chemical weapons and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former
Yugoslavia.''
	   Tribunal spokesman Jim Landale confirmed investigators would
check the claims.
	   The U.N. court has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, for
genocide for allegedly masterminding the mass murder of Muslims
following the July 1995 takeover of Srebrenica, a U.N.-designated
``safe haven'' in eastern Bosnia.
	   The detailed indictment against Karadzic and Mladic makes no
mention of the use of nerve gas. Neither man is in custody.
	   Human Rights Watch claimed that the former Yugoslav People's
Army, known as the JNA, had BZ gas in its arsenals before the 1991
breakup of Yugoslavia.
	   Although the Serb-dominated JNA officially pulled out of the war
in Bosnia in early 1992, it left much of its military hardware in
the hands of the Bosnian Serb Army, which was responsible for the
takeover of Srebrenica.
	   Human Rights Watch also claimed that U.S. authorities
investigated the nerve gas allegations but never published their
findings.
	   Thousands of Muslims are believed to have been massacred in the
aftermath of the Bosnian Serb takeover of Srebrenica. A tribunal
judge who read a summary of evidence of the killings said it
contained ``scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human
history.''

Ukraine's president calls for free-floating hryvna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Ukraine-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma said
Thursday that the national hryvna currency should no longer be kept
within a government-set trading band and should instead be allowed
to float freely.
	   ``We need to study proposals for abandoning the trading band,''
Kuchma said. He said that while the hryvna has been ``artificially
supported'' for the past two years, Ukraine's main trade partners
have devalued their currencies, hurting Ukrainian exporters.
	   Kuchma was speaking in a special address to parliament, which he
said was necessitated by the need for radical measures to combat
looming economic collapse.
	   Ukraine's government and the central bank introduced a trading
band for the hryvna last year to attract foreign investors and
assure stability in the financial market.
	   The move followed several years of tight monetary policies,
which helped to sharply reduce inflation from 10,000 percent in
1993 to 10 percent last year and increase stability in the banking
sector.
	   The hryvna has been trading at around 3.43 to the U.S. dollar
for several weeks, staying within the latest trading band of 2.5 to
3.5 to the dollar.
	   The currency had remained largely stable at 2.1 to the dollar
until August, when the economic crisis in neighboring Russia
sharply devalued the hryvna, forcing the government to widen the
old trading band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar.
	   The National Bank stopped the hryvna's fall last month after
introducing restrictions on currency trading, while the government
delayed payments on its mounting foreign debt.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which recently approved a dlrs
2.2 billion loan for Ukraine, has praised the National Bank's
anti-crisis steps.
	   However, Kuchma blasted the bank for its recent decisions, and
said the time has come ``to cancel all the restrictions on the
currency market.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Federal sleuths Thursday raided offices
of Reliance Industries, India's largest private sector company,
looking for evidence against a top executive allegedly involved in
a sensational political scandal, officials said.
	   S.M. Khan, spokesman for the Central Bureau of Investigation,
said the raids were ordered to investigate alleged violations of
the Official Secrets Act by the conglomerate's Group President V.
Balasubramanian, but gave few other details.
	   Another CBI officer said on condition of anonymity that searches
were carried out in the Reliance offices in New Delhi, Bombay and
some other cities but investigators were yet to report back on the
seizures.
	   The CBI was looking for evidence against Balasubramanian, who
allegedly possessed some top secret government documents even
before they were presented in Parliament. The agency has not given
details on the nature of the documents.
	   Reliance Industries, a multiproducts giant, refused comment on
the CBI raids. The Bombay-based company's companies range from oil
and gas production to petrochemicals, textiles and weaving.
	   Balasubramanian has been absconding since investigators charged
him last month.
	   The New Delhi police, which registered a case against
Balasubramanian before federal investigators took over the
investigation, alleged that the Reliance official gained access to
government papers through Romesh Sharma, described as a master
swindler with close links with powerful politicians, bureaucrats
and mafia gangs, some based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
	   Sharma was arrested last month and charged with bribing top
Indian politicians from various political parties in return for
business deals over years.
	   Investigators' accounts of Sharma's alleged wrongdoings read
like a racy thriller _ a mix of political rackets, sexual scandals,
underhand deals and extortion of large sums of money from
influential people threatened by the mob.
	   On Thursday, reports of the CBI raids on Reliance offices
created unease in Bombay's stock market, Dow Jones Newswires
reported.
	   Shares ended lower on a lack of institutional buying and selling
by local operators, and Reliance stock closed at 119.60 rupees
(dlrs 2.8), down 1.7 rupees (less than a cent) or 1.4 percent from
its previous finish.

Magistrate orders three suspects to stand trial for Sendashonga
</HEADLINE>
murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Thursday referred three
suspects to the high court to stand trial for the murder of a
Rwandan opposition leader six months ago.
	   ``After considering the evidence in the committal documents, I
am satisfied that there is sufficient ground for committing the
accused persons to high court for trial,'' said Jesse Lesiit, a
senior resident magistrate in Nairobi.
	   Rwandan Okiki Kiwanuka, Kenyan Charles Muhanji Wamuthoni and
Ugandan Christopher Lubanga Mlondo are charged with the shooting
death of Seth Sendashonga a former Rwandan interior minister.
	   Sendashonga and his driver John Bosco Nkiruyubukeye were shot
dead May 16 at a road junction in a Nairobi suburb.
	   Lesiit said the accused will also be charged separately for the
murder of Sendashonga's driver.
	   She ordered the accused to remain in custody until they appear
before the high court when the judge sets a trial date.
	   They have been denied bail.
	   Sendashonga, a Hutu, was a member of the predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in
Rwanda in July 1994 after it carried out a three-month slaughter of
at least 500,000 people, mostly of them minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in August 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Kenya after his
dismissal.

Chief U.N. inspector would resign to make Iraq reveal banned
</HEADLINE>
weapons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
said in remarks published Thursday that he was ready to quit his
job if it meant Iraq would reveal all its banned weapons.
	   ``If it becomes clear that Iraq will fully cooperate and reveal
all the banned weapons ... then the lifting of sanctions will be
achieved,'' Butler said in an interview with the London-based
Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.
	   ``If the only obstacle is Richard Butler ... I am ready to
resign,'' he said. ``I took this job to carry out the mission and
it is logical for me to resign if I am the real obstacle,'' he
added.
	   Iraq has over the past months called for the Australian's
resignation and accused him of working on behalf of the Americans,
charges that he denies.
	   A U.S. military attack on Iraq was averted when Iraq announced
Saturday that it was ready to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors who are charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq froze all kinds of cooperation with the inspectors on Oct.
31.
	   ``When Iraq prevents us from doing our job, it is violating
(international) law. They say we are provoking them whereas in fact
they are doing that,'' Butler was quoted as saying.
	   Weapons inspectors should confirm that Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction before the economic sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, are lifted.
	   Butler's comments were published in Arabic and translated into
English by The Associated Press.

Illegal property transactions continue despite warnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials
threaten to prosecute some local officials for continuing illegal
transactions of state or private property despite warnings to stop
the practice.
	   A recent probe revealed involvement of Muslim religious leaders,
army and police officers in the illegal purchase or sale of
property owned by the state and of other scams, mainly in the
central Bosnia town of Bugojno, 70 kilometers (43,8 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   Bosnia is awaiting a new law on privatization and restitution,
which would return property taken away by the Communist regime or
through previous nationalization to the real owners or their
families.
	   In the meantime, such property cannot be subject to any
transaction until the law is passed.
	   ``In Bugojno however there is total disregard of this
provision,'' Rida Attarashany, the spokesman for the office of top
international official in Bosnia Carlos Westendorp said Thursday.
	   Not only such property transactions have occurred, but buildings
belonging to currently displaced non_Muslims have been demolished
and the land illegally sold to Muslims _ in many cases local
religious, army or police officials. Those, then, have started
building on the newly obtained property.
	   Three weeks ago, Westendorp's deputy Hanns Schumacher wrote a
letter to the mayor of Bugojno, Dzevad Mlaco, asking him to suspend
all construction work mentioned in the investigation.
	   ``We have learned, however, that construction work on these
properties has accelerated instead,'' Attarashany said.
	   ``The new illegal buildings will, if necessary, be destroyed
without any compensation,'' he said, adding that the new owners
must be aware that they have obtained the land illegally and will
not be protected in any way once the transactions are annulled.
	   Westendorp's office will make sure that officials responsible
are prosecuted and will compensate the real owners for all
inflicted damage, Attarashany said.
	   Similar illegal dealings were discovered in the southern city of
Mostar by the deputy head of a Bosnian Croat-run municipality.
	   Ibrahim Rahimic wrote a letter to the regional head of
Westendorp's office, saying local Croats had started clearing a
site in Gubavica, a suburb of Mostar run by Bosnian Croats, with
the intention to start building homes for Croats from central
Bosnia.
	   Rahimic asked Westendorp's office to urgently stop such
activities also further south, where, he said, Croats are illegally
building on someone else's land.
	   ``We do have reliable information that the investor of those
projects is Croatia,'' he wrote.

Former ETA leader asks government for first step with prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A former leader of the Basque separatist
group ETA urged Spain's government Thursday to transfer ETA
prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step
towards peace talks.
	   ``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region,
this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as
Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose
Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
	   Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving
time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group. He was let
out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he
won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct. 25.
	   Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members
held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the
Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
	   One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be
moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
	   ETA declared a cease-fire on Sept. 16. The government has
responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is
prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
	   But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the
government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way
for talks.
	   In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry
last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in
hospitals of their choice.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish business groups all the way down
to small travel agencies intensified their boycott of Italian
products Thursday and threatened to implement a full-scale embargo
unless Italy hands over a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   At an Istanbul food market, an angry mob trampled Italian food
stuffs while protesters in Ankara burnt the Italian flag outside
the embassy.
	   Several travel agencies said they would stop offering tours to
Italy and Turkey's federation of shoe companies said it had stopped
importing from Italy.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted criminal, was detained
last week when he landed in Rome on a flight from Moscow. He has
asked Italy for political asylum but Turkey is pushing hard for his
extradition.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insists he won't give in to
pressure and pledged to stick to Italian law which prohibits
extradition to a country with the death penalty, which is in force
in Turkey.
	   Ocalan led a 14-year-old war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast
that has killed close to 37,000 people.
	   ``In just 24 hours we have seen a total interruption of trade
between our companies,'' Flavio Pasotti, vice president of Italy's
federation of small and medium industries, said in Italy.
	   Pasotti said about 120 companies had reported the cancellation
of orders or contracts by their Turkish partners.
	   Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner, with trade
volume between the two countries estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion.
Italy also has major joint venture operations employing thousands
of people in Turkey, including car-maker FIAT SpA, tire-maker
Pirelli SpA, pasta producer Barilla Alimentari, and the Benetton
Group.
	   Pasotti said it was difficult to quantify how much Italian
companies had lost from canceled contracts to date.
	   In a letter to its Italian counterpart, Turkey's association of
businesses said it would be ``distressed to see our ties with Italy
impaired as a consequence of Italy's unfortunate disposition to
back Abdullah Ocalan.''
	   Pasotti said he had advised the approximately 60,000 companies
in the Italian federation not to sign new deals with Turkish
companies because it was too risky.
	   Italy's foreign trade minister has called for an emergency
meeting with Italian businesses to evaluate the extent of the
boycott.
	   Turkish businesses have not escaped unscathed from the boycott.
	   Clothes shop owner Aylin Altay said she may have to change the
name of her Ankara clothes shop _ Garibaldi _ if the crisis
continues.
	   ``Some people ask whether the goods are made in Italy,'' said
Altay. ``The only thing made in Italy is the socks, and when people
find out they refuse to buy them.''

Rail strike in six nations to protest EU liberalization plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Railway workers plan to paralyze train
traffic in six European Union nations Monday to protest
liberalization plans, but trade union differences stand in the way
of an EU-wide rail strike.
	   Train traffic is expected to come to a halt in France, Spain,
Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions will hand out
leaflets to commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the
Netherlands in a bid to stop plans to further privatize the sector.
	   The EU's executive Commission already has a blueprint to
increase liberalization in the freight sector from 5 percent to 25
percent to try and increase the efficiency of Europe's dense
railway network.
	   ``We fear this will only be a first step,'' said Sabine Trier of
the Federation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union.
	   For the unions, further liberalization will threaten the jobs of
the current 965,000 railway workers in the EU and attack the
guarantee that minimum rail services will continue to be delivered.
	   Train strikes are often the most effective way to make
politicians notice, unsettling the lives of millions as they end up
stranded miles away from work or home.
	   The EU transport ministers will meet in Brussels on Nov. 30 to
assess the future of Europe's railway system and consider plans for
further liberalization. EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock
wants to push through more liberalization to reverse the sector's
long-term decline.
	   The trade unions have found it tough to join hands in such
trans-national action, Trier said. ``Trade unions have different
traditions, laws and cultures,'' she noted.
	   Unions in Britain and the Netherlands are reluctant to cooperate
in a strike since their systems have been partly liberalized
already, she said. Other countries, like Sweden, consider strikes
only as a last resort, while in nations like France a warning
strike is a common occurrence.
	   Still, Monday's action will be the first to involve so many EU
nations in a concerted action.

Former Dinamo chief to surrender himself in embezzlement case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Military prosecutors have issued an
arrest warrant for the former chairman of Bucharest's Dinamo soccer
club, who is accused of embezzling dlrs 2 million from the club's
coffers.
	   Vasile Ianul acknowledged Thursday he had taken the money, but
said he gave it to the club's players and didn't pocket anything
for himself.
	   ``I am no more Dalmatian (blemished) than others in the club.
The money .... was given to the soccer players,'' he told daily
Libertatea.
	   Ianul said he'll voluntarily go into police custody on Friday.
	   Ianul ran Dinamo between 1990 and 1993, during which time he
personally sold 30 Dinamo players to foreign soccer teams which
brought the club millions of dollars.
	   The soccer stars that left included Ionut Lupescu, who was sold
to Germany's Bayer Leverkusen, Dorinel Munteanu, who joined FC
Colognue, Tibor Selymes, who is now with Anderlecht, and Mircea
Rednic went to Standard Liege.
	   Ianul is now chairman of Politehnica Iasi, northeast Romania.
	   In 1997, prosecutors charged Ianul with embezzling dlrs 2
million. They decided to issue the arrest warrant because Ianul's
trial was delayed for one year, allegedly because he was ill with
pneumonia.
	   Dinamo is currently second in the Romanian first division. The
club belongs to the Interior Ministry, which is why military
prosecutors are involved.
	   It was the second time members of the club allegedly have been
involved in financial wrongdoings in the past year.
	   Last month, Dinamo's chairman Petre Buduru resigned after
allegations that he was involved in a huge cigarette smuggling
case.

Government extends cease-fire with rebels in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government on Thursday
extended beyond Christmas a 16-month cease-fire with a major rebel
group in the remote northeast, Press Trust of India news agency
said.
	   Rebels have been fighting since 1950 for a homeland for the Naga
tribespeople in the remote mountains joined to mainland India by a
narrow strip of land north of Bangladesh. They claim the Naga
chieftains who ruled the region were forced to join India when
British colonialism ended in 1947.
	   ``(The) cease-fire is essential for the creation of a peaceful
atmosphere in the (Nagaland) state especially during Christmas and
the festive season and for fostering unity among the people of
Nagaland,'' said a statement by the Defense Ministry.
	   While the 16-month truce has largely held, there has been little
progress toward formal peace talks with the National Socialist
Council of Nagaland, led by Isac Suu and T. Muivah.
	   The government and one rebel faction, the NSCN-IM, held
preliminary discussions last year in Bangkok and Zurich _ the first
in decades to try to end the insurgency that has claimed more than
2,000 lives.
	   India's government made similar peace offers to two other rebel
groups, but they have demanded an extension of the cease-fire and
talks with them as well. Their reaction to the government's
decision is not immediately available.
	   The NSCN-Khaplang faction ended a six-month cease-fire in April
this year when it attacked and killed 11 government soldiers in an
ambush in Nagaland state.
	   The third rebel group, the Naga National Council, has been lying
low for several years.

Jockey Club bans rider for 10 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Puerto Rican-born jockey Angel Monserrate, who
rode 21 times in Britain under an assumed name, was given a 10-year
ban Thursday from riding in Britain.
	   Riding as an amateur under the pseudonym ``Angel Jacobs,''
Monserrate rode five winners in 21 races this year in Britain.
	   Monserrate, 29, was banned in the United States in 1995 for
failing a drug test. In 1996, he was also caught posing as an
amateur in the United States and was charged with criminal
trespass.
	   The American jockey told the Jockey Club disciplinary committee
Thursday he was ``very, very sorry'' and that he did it ``for the
love of racing.''
	   ``Of course I regret what I did,'' he said. ``I don't know if
the punishment is harsh. I will not appeal.''
	   The jockey came to the attention of British officials in August,
largely because of his highly polished style _ unusual among young
amateurs.

Saudi prince sees young gaining power in succession process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Younger princes in the Saudi royal family
will be given more power in the oil-rich kingdom when the long
decided succession from the rule of King Fahd occurs, a brother to
the ailing king says.
	   Prince Talal Bin Abdel Aziz, in a rare interview touching on the
Saudi succession process, confirmed reports that Fahd already has
delegated his duties to his half brother and designated successor,
Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   ``The transfer of power from his majesty King Fahd to Crown
Prince Abdullah has already been made peacefully, and he (Abdullah)
is now in charge of everything,'' he told the Associated Press in
an interview Wednesday.
	   ``But of course, he consults with the king,'' Talal added.
	   Talal said as part of the succession process, more power will be
given to the sons of Fahd and his brothers, who are mostly in their
70s.
	   ``Naturally, the young (princes) should have an effective role,
he said.
	   Prince Talal has not position in the Saudi government but has
influence. He was nicknamed the ``free prince'' after he called for
democratic changes in the kingdom in the early 1960s, which led to
a feud in the family.
	   King Fahd has been hospitalized four times this year, fueling
speculations in the kingdom and abroad about who will rule in the
21st century.
	   While Crown Prince Abdullah was named successor years ago, the
question of who will be the second-in-line to the ailing king is
believed to be a source of disagreement in the ruling family.
	   Speculation recently focused on two men, Prince Sultan, 70, the
influential defense minister, and Prince Abdul-Aziz bin Fahd, 26,
the king's youngest, and reputedly favorite, son.
	   Sultan is believed to have the edge, and some people believe he
has been secretly named already. Talal said the successor to
Abdullah has not officially been decided, but an agreement has been
reached to avoid strife over the issue.
	   ``I am sure the succession will pass peacefully and smoothly as
it did in the past,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital
will be closed for three days because of security concerns, an
embassy spokesman said Thursday.
	   The spokesman declined to discuss whether there was a specific
threat against the embassy, but said the closing starting Friday
was related to matters discussed in a ``Worldwide Caution'' issued
by the U.S. State Department Nov. 12.
	   That public warning said ``the potential for retaliatory acts
against Americans and American interests overseas continues to
exist,'' in light of tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections, the August bombings of U.S embassies in East Africa
and the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, and the arrests
of suspects in the embassy bombings.
	   It also warned of continuing threats by ``terrorists,''
including Osama Bin Laden, who was indicted for the embassy
bombings.

<SLUG> Bayern Munich bids for Woerns, paper says </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bayern Munich wants to buy German international
centerback Christian Woerns from Paris Saint-Germain, French sports
daily L'Equipe reported Thursday.
	   The German giant has contacted PSG and would have to pay at
least 42 million francs (dlrs 7.5 million) to secure the player's
services, L'Equipe said.
	   Woerns, 26, moved to Paris on a free transfer last summer after
his contract with Bayer Leverkusen expired.
	   But PSG has been in crisis in recent months.
	   The club was eliminated from the European Cup Winners' Cup by
lowly Maccabi Haifa, is already effectively out of the French
championship race and last month fired coach Alain Giresse.
	   ``I am not satisfied with the sporting situation at the club,''
Woerns told L'Equipe. ``I don't know if I will stay at PSG or not.
I haven't had discussions with Bayern, but I am ready to listen to
them.''

New Macedonian parliament convenes, chooses speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonia's new parliament was
inaugurated Thursday, with the country set to accept deployment of
NATO troops to assist international peace monitors in neighboring
Kosovo.
	   The parliament's first session reflected the victory of a
center-right coalition, which secured 62 of the 120 assembly seats
in last month's elections and toppled the ruling government of
ex-Communists.
	   A total of 112 deputies assembled Thursday, with seven remaining
legislators waiting to have their seats officially confirmed and a
repeat ballot due in one municipality.
	   The assembly elected a new speaker, 51-year old law professor
Savo Klimovski from the Democratic Alternative, a member of the
winning coalition.
	   Within ten days, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov is expected
to name the future premier _ a post almost certain to go to
coalition leader Ljubco Georgijevski.
	   Earlier in the week, NATO had officially requested Macedonia's
permission to deploy a 1,800-strong rapid reaction force on its
territory.
	   During the election campaign, Georgijevski's coalition opposed
deployment of the force on Macedonian soil but later changed its
stance, saying it supported a constructive attitude to the Kosovo
crisis and would welcome closer ties with NATO.
	   Macedonia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace Program in 1995
and has aspirations for full membership.
	   The deployment of what is also called extraction force in
Macedonia is to assist Kosovo's 2,000 international peace verifiers
and come to their rescue should they be in any danger in Serbia's
Albanian-majority Kosovo province which borders Macedonia to the
north.
	   Macedonia's outgoing government said Wednesday it could not give
the formal go-ahead to NATO before a new government is formed.
	   Georgijevski, the future premier, was expected to name his
Cabinet by the end of the month and likely will include some ethnic
Albanians in it as well.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise nearly a quarter of Macedonia's 2.2
million population, and one of their political parties said
Thursday it was ready to join Georgijevski's coalition.

Mixed fortunes at multi-million-dollar auctions

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Millions of dollars have been spent, the world's
wealthy have left with a few more jewels than before, but one of
the key pieces failed to sell by the end of a week of auctions
Thursday.
	   Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses both stressed fabulous
jewels in their annual autumn sales in Geneva.
	   Christie's was disappointed that the ruby and diamond Imperial
Necklace given by Czar Alexander II to his daughter on her marriage
in 1874 to Queen Victoria's son Alfred, failed to reach its reserve
price of dlrs 2 million.
	   ``It is a big disappointment, but that is the law of the
market,'' said Elisabeth Perroud, a Christie's spokeswoman, adding
that it would be up to the owner to decide whether to put it up for
sale again.
	   But Christie's said it was thrilled that its total sales for the
week reached 47 million francs (dlrs 34.8 million).
	   The highlight of Sotheby's sales was its Bird of Paradise
Collection, which made more than 13.9 million Swiss francs (dlrs
9.5 million). Sotheby's said its quality was on a par with jewels
of the Duchess of Windsor, sold in 1987, and Helene Beaumont in
1994.
	   ``All three collections featured sumptuous ruby and diamond
necklaces and bracelets of very similar importance and style,''
said David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland.
	   The collection sold Tuesday was named for the main brooch made
by Van Cleef and Arpels in 1942, a fabulous golden bird in flight,
with ruby wings, sapphire tail and diamond-studded beak.
	   The brooch itself made well over twice its estimate, selling for
487,500 francs (dlrs 354,800).
	   The most expensive pieces in the collection were three diamond
rings, each of which sold for more than a million dollars.
	   Top price was for a ring with a pear-shaped diamond weighing
40.72 carats. It went to an anonymous buyer for 3.3 million francs
(dlrs 2.4 million).
	   ``The Bird of Paradise Collection was one of the most important
to appear at auction since the war,'' said Bennett.
	   He declined to name the seller, saying only that it came from a
``European estate,'' but said the collection was assembled from the
1930s to the 1970s by a person who mixed in the same social circles
as the Duchess of Windsor and Mrs. Beaumont.
	   Mrs. Beaumont, who died in 1988, was one of the great society
figures of the Cote d'Azur in the first half of this century.
	   Another Christie's sale was its first devoted entirely to art
deco jewelry, bringing in a total 4.7 million francs (dlrs 3.5
million). It featured a 1939 diamond brooch in the shape of a palm
tree by Cartier and a 1924 Egyptian-style pendant by Van Cleef and
Arpels.
	   ``The successful result of the first sale devoted to art deco
emphasized the market's need for more focused sales,'' said
Francois Curiel, head of Christie's international jewelry
department. ``This auction leads the way for a different approach
to jewelry sales around the world in 1999.''

Maximum sentences in the murder of a student
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Warsaw provincial court on Thursday
handed down two life sentences and five other prison terms to a
group found guilty of abducting, torturing and murdering a
19-year-old student last summer.
	   In a trial that riveted Poles since May, a five-judge panel
convicted the two main perpetrators, identified only as Monika Sz.
and Tomasz K. of murder and gave both the maximum sentence of life
in prison.
	   The court said Monika Sz. was the ringleader of the group who
ordered the abduction and murder and Tomasz K. carried out the
stabbing that led to the death of the student, Tomek Jaworski.
	   Another leader of the 19 to 34-year-old group, Marek S. was also
charged with murder but got 15-years in prison because he
cooperated with investigators and told them were to find Jaworski's
body.
	   Robert W. got 12 years in prison for helping abduct and torture
the victim, Rafal B., also charged as an accessory in the
abduction, got a seven-year term. Two participants in a scuffle
that preceded the abduction, Maciej K. and Robert J. got five- and
two-year suspended sentences respectively.
	   They were all arrested within days of the murder.
	   ``No crime has justification, but in this case we met with such
accumulation of suffering that it bordered on bestiality,''
presiding judge Malgorzata Mojkowska said in reading the verdict.
	   Jaworski was abducted from an end-of-school party last June,
locked in an apartment for five days, and tortured and stabbed to
death.
	   Jaworski's parents have said they cannot forgive the murderers
of their only child and that life imprisonment was not sufficient
punishment.
	   Poland's new penal code, introduced in September, abolished the
death penalty, in line with most codes in Western Europe. Poland, a
former communist-governed country aspiring to join the European
Union, replaced it's communist-era code with one that applies to
its new political and economic situation.
	   People across the nation were shocked by the crime. Groups of
relatives and friend's of Jaworski's family carrying black flags
and pictures of the victim, attended every court session in the
case and the media reported on the trial in detail. Some cried when
the verdict was announced.

Council votes to return sacred Sioux shirt to United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The Glasgow City Council decided
Thursday that a Sioux warrior shirt believed to be recovered from
the 1890 Wounded Knee battlefield should be returned to the United
States.
	   The ``ghost'' shirt, which Sioux American Indian fighters
believed would protect them in battle, has been on exhibit at the
city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery since Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West
traveling show left them here in 1891.
	   The shirt, displayed with other American Indian artifacts, is
said to be stained with the blood of a slain warrior.
	   Thursday's decision, was which accepted by councilors
unanimously without a vote after a committee recommendation,
followed a plea by Sioux leaders last week that the shirt be
returned to them.
	   ``Its like a great thanksgiving,'' said Marcella Le Beau,
secretary of the Wounded Knee Association. ``We appreciate the
friendliness and the overwhelming support from the city of Glasgow
and its surrounding areas.''
	   Wounded Knee, located in southwestern South Dakota, was the last
major armed conflict between Indians and U.S. troops.
	   Accounts differ as to who fired first and how many died. The
federal government says about 150 Indians and 30 soldiers died; the
Sioux say the troops massacred as many as 400 Indians.
	   The effort to have the shirt repatriated to the Lakota Sioux
began in 1991, when the tribe discovered it was at the museum.
	   ``This has been a long journey which has finally come to a
conclusion and we are thankful for the decision,'' said John Earl,
the American who first discovered the shirt in the museum.

3,000 Russian nuclear workers go on one-day strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 3,000 nuclear workers in a closed Ural
Mountains city held a one-day strike Thursday to demand unpaid
wages and pay raises to help them cope with inflation, a news
report said.
	   ``We provided for necessary measures to ensure the reliable
safety of our facilities. The most dangerous of them were either
stopped beforehand or continue operating in the normal regime,''
said union chairman Yuri Bersenev, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   About 100 of the striking workers picketed outside the
headquarters of the administrative center of the Ural Mountains
city of Snezhinsk, about 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) east of
Moscow, and collected signatures for an appeal to Russian Nuclear
Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov.
	   ``Constant undernourishment, insufficient medical service,
inability to buy clothing and footwear for children or to pay for
their education ... have created grave permanent psychological
stress, which is the cause of our protests,'' the appeal said.
	   The workers are demanding at least three months of back pay, and
200 percent wage increases to help deal with rising inflation,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Many nuclear towns across Russia, built during the Soviet era,
are still closed off for security reasons.
	   The Russian government owes the nuclear industry nearly 3
billion rubles (dlrs 170 million at the current exchange rate) for
unpaid state orders. Nuclear workers in several cities held a
three-day strike in September.

Subway consortium warns that Athens threatened with gridlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's capital may be in danger of
permanent gridlock unless its transit system is radically expanded,
the multinational consortium building its new metro warned
Thursday.
	   ``If serious measures are not taken, an impasse is
unavoidable,'' Leonidas Kykiras, chairman of the multinational
consortium, told a local radio station.
	   Known as Attiko Metro, the consortium is building the capital's
new dlrs 2.2 billion subway. It played a key role in the
International Olympic Committee's decision to grant Athens the 2004
Summer Games. It is to be finished by 2000.
	   According to Kykiras, a new 18-kilometer (11-mile) extension to
Athens' existing metro system must be made six-times bigger. Attiko
metro proposed adding another 105 kilometers (65 miles) to the
subway.
	   It also suggested the network should be complemented with
extensive tram and light railway systems. The total cost of the
improvement was estimated at nearly dlrs nine billion
	   Public Works Minister Costas Laliotis reserved judgment on the
proposal, but said it would be examined.
	   Kykiras based his claim on a three-year study led by the
consortium which predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens
will almost double from their current number of about 1.5 million.
	   Funded by the European Union, the study predicted that the
population in greater Athens' will swell to nearly five million. It
is now home to just over four million people, or nearly half the
country's population of 10.2 million.
	   The Attiko Metro consortium is made up of of 23 companies,
including Greek, French and German ones. Bechtel International Inc.
of California is acting as consultant.
	   Premier Costas Simitis has committed his government to improving
the capital's cheap, but notoriously tiresome transit system.
Efforts to streamline and improve public transport have so far been
stymied met by a strike campaign waged by employees at state-owned
transit companies.

Celta looking up this season _ literally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Celta president Horacio Gomez is thanking
God for his team's good fortune _ and with more than mere words.
	   With Celta unbeaten and leading the Spanish first division
soccer league, Gomez has donned athletic shoes and the garb of a
medieval pilgrim to trek 160 kilometers (100 mile) up St. James
Road, a rural path to Santiago de Compostela, one of Roman
Catholicism's holiest cities. He's to arrive Friday after a six-day
hike.
	   Its the fulfillment of a promise Gomez made if his team beat
English league leader Aston Villa in Birmingham in a UEFA Cup match
on Nov. 3.
	   After having lost the home leg 1-0, Celta prevailed 3-1, one of
a string of stunning successes this season for a little-known team
from the port city of Vigo in northwest Spain.
	   Players from powerhouses like FC Barcelona already are
predicting Celta's downfall. But coach Victor Fernandez likes the
attention.
	   ``In my opinion this pressure is a good thing,'' he said. ``I
think Celta has an advantage in that it has several players with
enough maturity and emotional stability to withstand this kind of
pressure. Of course we will lose some day, but it will not be
because of the pressure of being league leader.''
	   In any case, that pressure will ease a bit on Saturday in the
11th round of Spanish league play when Celta plays at Alaves, a
Basque team sitting in second-to-last place.
	   Still, with 20 points Celta is only a point ahead of Barcelona
and Mallorca, which clash Saturday for what should be the best game
of the weekend.
	   Officials at 25,000-seat Luis Sitjar Stadium in Palma are
expecting their first sellout this year for Mallorca _ the season's
other big surprise besides Celta. Until last week's loss against
Valladolid, Mallorca and Celta were the league's only unbeaten
teams.
	   Barcelona goes into the game a little more at ease coming off a
4-1 victory over lowly Tenerife. It had lost three straight in
league and European play and calls for coach Louis van Gaal's
resignation had reached a full chorus.
	   ``If we have the misfortune of losing, there will be talk again
of a crisis,'' said Barcelona defender Abelardo Fernandez, who will
be out for the next four weeks because of a torn leg muscle.
	   His absence and that of fellow defender Miguel Angel Nadal and
Winston Bogarde, also because of injury, will shuffle Barcelona's
back line.
	   The other perennial titan of Spanish soccer, fourth-placed Real
Madrid, is torn by internal squabbling as it prepares to travel to
fifth-placed Valencia on Saturday.
	   Midfielder Clarence Seedorf and defender Christian Panucci face
possible sanctions from coach Guus Hiddink for complaining about
being substituted from the last Saturday's loss to Celta. And
defender Ivan Campo and midfielder Jose Emilio Amavisca are
speaking out publicly about seeing little playing time.
	   In other matches Saturday, Atletico Madrid hosts sixth-place
Valladolid, Real Sociedad takes on Zaragoza and Oviedo hosts Betis.
	   On Sunday Deportivo La Coruna plays Villareal, Salamanca hosts
Extremadura and Espanyol takes on Racing Santander.
	   In a rare Friday match, Tenerife hosts Athletic Bilbao.

Bayern Munich bids for Paris' Woerns, paper says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING with slug

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bayern Munich wants to buy German international
centerback Christian Woerns from Paris Saint-Germain, French sports
daily L'Equipe reported Thursday.
	   The German giant has contacted PSG and would have to pay at
least 42 million francs (dlrs 7.5 million) to secure the player's
services, L'Equipe said.
	   Woerns, 26, moved to Paris on a free transfer last summer after
his contract with Bayer Leverkusen expired.
	   But PSG has been in crisis in recent months.
	   The club was eliminated from the European Cup Winners' Cup by
lowly Maccabi Haifa, is already effectively out of the French
championship race and last month fired coach Alain Giresse.
	   ``I am not satisfied with the sporting situation at the club,''
Woerns told L'Equipe. ``I don't know if I will stay at PSG or not.
I haven't had discussions with Bayern, but I am ready to listen to
them.''

White extremists seek amnesty for SAfrican bombings

continue after major report released last month; NO PICKUP &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELKOM, South Africa (AP) _ White extremists who tried to
destabilize the 1994 elections with a series of bombs on Thursday
sought amnesty from a human rights panel, saying they prayed that
no one would die in the incidents.
	   ``Before any operation we usually prayed that nobody should be
injured,'' Jan Labuschagne told the amnesty panel of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   Labuschagne and five others seeking amnesty in Welkom belonged
to the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi band that
advocated race war in the early 1990s and was blamed for bombs that
killed 21 people before the elections that ended apartheid.
	   Last month, the Truth Commission released a five-volume report
on testimony from victims of apartheid-era political violence and
assigned major blame for human rights violations to the National
Party, apartheid's architect. It also cited the AWB and black
anti-apartheid struggle groups for excesses.
	   But the commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess their crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _ a
process expected to last well into next year as decisions are made
on over 7,000 amnesty applications.
	   The white extremist group, known by its Afrikaans-language
acronym of AWB, sought an autonomous state for Afrikaners, the
Dutch-descended white settlers who ruled during apartheid but has
since kept a low profile.
	   The six applicants have admitted to setting off more than a
dozen bombs in the Free State in 1994. The acts targeted stores,
railway lines, electrical installations and a taxi rank in which a
civilian was killed. Bombs left at two primary schools were defused
by police.
	   All six were arrested for various attacks, but trials were
postponed pending the outcome of the amnesty requests, said panel
spokesman Vuyani Green.
	   AWB activist Johan Strydom said his aim was to cause enough
chaos to block the nation's first democratic election.
	   ``Anyone who was in favor of the African National Congress and
National Party alliance had to be targeted _ more specifically,
their property and business,'' he said.
	   The then-ruling National Party, architects of apartheid, had
negotiated the transition to non-racial democracy with the ANC.
	   Strydom apologized for his actions, saying he could now see that
``things can happen if people negotiate. As long as I live, I will
not do a thing like that again.''
	   AWB leader Eugene TerreBlanche ordered Strydom and Pieter
Breytenbach, another amnesty applicant, to buy or steal the
explosives, Strydom said.
	   Andries Kriel, who commanded Labuschagne, Johannes Botes and
Daniel van der Watt, who are also seeking amnesty, lashed out at
the AWB leader for not accepting responsibility for the actions of
his men.
	   ``TerreBlanche is a coward ... You have to accept responsibility
for the actions of your men and he did not,'' Kriel said.
	   TerreBlanche, who has not applied for amnesty, has said he had
no regrets about AWB actions that were justified by a ``state of
war.''
	   The hearing was held in this town 275 kilometers (170 miles)
southwest of Johannesburg.

Rail strike in six nations to protest EU liberalization plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Railway workers plan to paralyze train
traffic in six European Union nations Monday to protest
liberalization plans, but trade union differences stand in the way
of an EU-wide rail strike.
	   Train traffic is expected to come to a halt in France, Spain,
Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions will hand out
leaflets to commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the
Netherlands in a bid to stop plans to further privatize the sector.
	   The EU's executive Commission already has a blueprint to
increase liberalization in the freight sector from 5 percent to 25
percent to try and increase the efficiency of Europe's dense
railway network.
	   ``We fear this will only be a first step,'' said Sabine Trier of
the Federation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union.
	   For the unions, further liberalization will threaten the jobs of
the current 965,000 railway workers in the EU and attack the
guarantee that minimum rail services will continue to be delivered.
	   Train strikes are often the most effective way to make
politicians notice, unsettling the lives of millions as they end up
stranded miles away from work or home.
	   The EU transport ministers will meet in Brussels on Nov. 30 to
assess the future of Europe's railway system and consider plans for
further liberalization. EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock
wants to push through more liberalization to reverse the sector's
long-term decline.
	   The trade unions have found it tough to join hands in such
transnational action, Trier said. ``Trade unions have different
traditions, laws and cultures,'' she noted.
	   Unions in Britain and the Netherlands are reluctant to cooperate
in a strike since their systems have been partly liberalized
already, she said. Other countries, like Sweden, consider strikes
only as a last resort, while in nations like France a warning
strike is a common occurrence.
	   Still, Monday's action will be the first to involve so many EU
nations in a concerted action.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Spain's King Juan Carlos and Dutch
Queen Beatrix walked down the aisle of Amsterdam's New Church
together Thursday to open an exhibit of the cultural splendors of
17th century Spain.
	   Their short stroll was lauded as a royal symbol of ``friendship
and cooperation'' because the exhibit covers a time period when
relations between the two countries weren't so cordial.
	   During the Eighty Years War, which ended in 1648, the two
countries battled over Dutch independence from the Spanish empire.
	   Consequently, Spanish art and culture from that troubled era
isn't widely known in the Netherlands. Organizers said they hope
the exhibit will help change that.
	   ``It's as if an old story has ended and a new age can begin,''
said Ernst Veen, director of the New Church Foundation, which
collaborated with the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture to
create the exhibit.
	   ``The Splendor of Spain, 1598-1648, from Cervantes to
Velazquez'' is part of the 350th anniversary celebration of the
Peace of Munster, when Spain recognized the sovereignty of the
Netherlands.
	   The exhibit, which contains 300 paintings, tapestries, furniture
and works of literature from Spain's Golden Age, chronicles a time
of cultural prosperity but political decline as Spain's empire fell
apart.
	   To keep up the image of a powerful nation, the Spanish court and
Catholic church commissioned artists such as Velazquez and El Greco
to paint works of art for palaces and churches.
	   Their masterpieces are on display, along with one of the most
enduring works to come out of the period, Miguel de Cervantes'
literary masterpiece ``Don Quixote.'' Both Spanish and Dutch
versions are on display.
	   The exhibit will be displayed until March 1999.

German court to pursue Pinochet cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A top federal court ordered German
prosecutors Thursday to determine whether former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet might be charged with human rights abuses
during his rule.
	   The ruling followed criminal complaints by three alleged victims
who charge they were wrongfully imprisoned and tortured in Chile as
Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup.
	   The Federal Court of Justice said it doubted that Pinochet could
claim immunity from prosecution as a former president, but it
refused to issue a ruling and assigned the cases to a lower court
in Duesseldorf.
	   The court said it the complaints deserve investigation even
though the alleged crimes happened abroad, because they were
punishable also under Chilean law and the plaintiffs were now
German citizens.
	   The Duesseldorf prosecutor's office will now investigate whether
the complaints warrant opening formal proceedings that could lead
to charges, spokesman Johannes Mocken said.
	   Formal charges are a condition for any German extradition
request for Pinochet.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in England on a Spanish warrant
seeking his extradition to face charges of genocide, murder and
torture during his 1973-1990 rule. He was in England for back
surgery.
	   On Tuesday, a judge ordered him to appear before a London court
on Dec. 2, unless he wins a legal battle for immunity from arrest.
	   Spanish prosecutors, who are seeking Pinochet's extradition,
want a British High Court ruling that Pinochet has immunity from
arrest overturned.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police after Pinochet ousted
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish business groups all the way down
to small travel agencies intensified their boycott of Italian
products Thursday and threatened to implement a full-scale embargo
unless Italy hands over a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In a sign that Turkey would not tolerate any display of support
for the leader, police detained over 700 members of the pro-Kurdish
People's Democracy Party, including its leader Murat Bozlak in a
nationwide operation, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Most of those detained had begun a hunger strike in support of
Abdullah Ocalan, the rebel leader detained in Rome.
	   The headquarters of the party, which already faces numerous
court causes for allegedly supporting Ocalan's rebels, were raided
in five southeastern cities.
	   Authorities also detained the three family members of Ocalan's
companion, who is currently in Rome.
	   Bozlak and one of his aides were charged with belonging to the
rebel organization, Anatolia said.
	   At an Istanbul food market, an angry mob trampled Italian food
stuffs while protesters in Ankara burnt Italian ties outside the
embassy.
	   Several travel agencies said they would stop offering tours to
Italy and Turkey's federation of shoe companies said it had stopped
importing from Italy.
	   Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted criminal, was detained last week
when he landed in Rome on a flight from Moscow. He has asked Italy
for political asylum but Turkey is pushing hard for his
extradition.

`economic blackmail,' custody hearing set, other new material

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will not bow to ``economic blackmail,''
Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday, facing a Turkish boycott
aimed at forcing Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader jailed
in Rome.
	   But D'Alema also offered an olive branch, saying he might accept
an invitation to a soccer game in Turkey if Ankara agrees to a
dialogue over the fate of Abdullah Ocalan.
	   The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to extradite Ocalan,
whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year war for Kurdish
autonomy. Turkish businesses are now boycotting Italian products
and a mob on Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a market.
	   Italian law forbids extraditing someone to a country where they
could face execution, as is the case with Ocalan, and D'Alema
appears determined to resist the pressure.
	   At a Cabinet meeting Thursday, the premier said ``economic
blackmail'' is unacceptable and that Italy would abide by its laws,
the ANSA news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, he weighed an invitation from Turkey's deputy premier
to attend a soccer match between Italian champion Juventus of Turin
against Istanbul's Galatasaray in a Champions League game next
Wednesday.
	   D'Alema said he might go. But his Turkish counterpart, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, didn't offer to meet him in Istanbul. ``If
he wants to see me, let him come to Ankara,'' Yilmaz said,
according to the Anatolia news agency.
	   D'Alema has asked the European Union to back his efforts to
maintain friendly relations with Turkey while respecting Italian
law. But EU countries can't agree on whether Ocalan's Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, is a terrorist organization and have yet to
weigh in. The United States is pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan,
whom it considers a terrorist.
	   Ocalan, arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport after he stepped off
a flight from Moscow, has asked for political asylum. His lawyers
have asked that he be put under house arrest pending a decision on
extradition or asylum; a hearing on their petition is scheduled for
Friday.

West urges them on, but Albanians doubt constitution means

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ From TV appearances to public utterances,
Western officials are campaigning for a ``yes'' vote for Albania's
first post-communist constitution, calling Sunday's referendum
critical for future democracy.
	   Worn down by years of unrest and political chaos in Europe's
poorest country, Albanians are likely to approve it. But they are
skeptical it will do anything to end chronic instability.
	   ``All the foreigners are saying that it is a good
constitution,'' says a doubtful Bajram Muharremi, a 57-year-old
retired mechanic, at a downtown stand where he sells roasted corn.
``They know better than we do ... so I will vote for it.''
	   Drafted by the governing Socialists and approved last month by
the parliament they dominate, the constitution sets out civil,
democratic and human rights based on Western and European
standards.
	   But coming only weeks after rioting rocked the capital, the
campaign has been less a debate about constitutional principles
than a fierce fight between two long-feuding parties.
	   Words like ``death,'' ``terror'' and ``murderer'' boom
frequently from loudspeakers at rallies of the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha, which is urging
a boycott.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, practically engineered their own
victory by tinkering with voting laws, abolishing the requirement
that turnout must exceed 50 percent for the measure to be valid.
	   Into the fray have stepped a leading European official and a
host of other visiting diplomats, unabashedly taking sides in the
name of democracy.
	   The ambassador of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, Daan Everts, appears almost nightly on Albanian
television, explaining or lauding the Socialists' draft
constitution or talking about human rights.
	   Officials from Austria and elsewhere have joined in the
campaign, telling Albanians there can be no democracy, no secure
future, without such a charter.
	   Albania and Belarus are the only two European countries without
constitutions.
	   But few Albanians believe legislation of any kind can resolve
the political hostilities that have paralyzed their country.
	   ``Laws are not a problem here,'' says Remzi Lani, a political
analyst and director of the Albanian Media Institute. ``In the past
six years we have had many laws of European standards, which have
later been implemented according to Balkan standards.''
	   Politics in Albania have historically been primitive and
violent.
	   From 1944 until 1991, Albania was ruled by communists who
isolated the country. The dictatorship of the proletariat and class
struggle replaced the rule of law.
	   When the country opened up in 1991, Albanians were eager to make
up for lost time. But wiping out the communist mentality and
embracing modern political ways have proven much harder than
throwing away portraits of former dictator Enver Hoxha.
	   Today Albanian politics is still based on the ``with me or
against me'' principle, and the two biggest parties are like rival
armed camps. Sunday's vote is perceived as largely a referendum not
on the constitution but on those parties.
	   Berisha assails the document as anti-Albanian and anti-human
rights, saying it doesn't guarantee private property and would
weaken Albanian traditions by letting people change their religion
and nationality.
	   ``This constitution is like an egg which was broken a long time
ago, and it stinks,'' he said at a news conference. ``Albanians
should stay away from it.''
	   But many observers suspect his call for a boycott hinges on
hopes of returning to power if support for the government's charter
is low.

Bomb damages Communist offices in possible vendetta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A makeshift bomb exploded Thursday outside
a suburban office belonging to Greece's Communist Party, causing
some damage but no injuries.
	   The attack was the latest indication that a vendetta may have
broken out between the country's oldest political party and the
capital's newest urban guerrillas.
	   Police said there was no immediate claim of responsibility for
the blast in the Zografou suburb, but it was virtually identical to
a Tuesday bombing of another Communist Party office.
	   That blast was claimed by an anarchist group in retaliation for
the Communist Party's alleged cooperation with riot police during a
Tuesday march. It was held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of
bloody student uprising against the 1967-74 dictatorship.
	   More than 100 self-proclaimed anarchists and others were taken
into custody during the march. Many are thought to be linked with
obscure anarchist guerrilla groups that have carried out nearly 200
nearly firebombings against cars and offices this year.
	   Most attacks have been aimed at diplomats, government officials
and offices, foreigners and journalists.

Stock market chiefs to discuss pan-European market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Expands France-Euro Stock Exchange, incorporates
Italy-Euromarkets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The heads of nine European stock exchanges,
including the giant Frankfurt and London markets, will meet in
Paris on Nov. 27 to discuss creating a pan-European bourse,
officials said Thursday.
	   ``I think we need a unified market in financial matters in
Europe,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in an
interview broadcast by France Info radio.
	   The number of stock markets joining, the volume of trade and
other technical details remained to be worked out for the
pan-European exchange, which initially had the support of Britain
and Germany, but not France.
	   The meeting in Paris would mark a significant step toward a
market for the mutual trading of blue-chip stocks, first announced
in July after a meeting of officials from the Frankfurt and London
exchanges.
	   The Societe des Bourses Francaises said in a statement issued in
Paris that the meeting of the Paris, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam,
Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Stockholm and Zurich exchanges will aim
``to define the next step toward the creation of an efficient and
accessible pan-European market.''
	   Officials in Milan, Italy, and the Spanish cities of Madrid,
Bilbao, Valencia and Barcelona also announced they would back the
proposed pan-European bourse.
	   The Madrid stock exchange said late Wednesday that its
membership ``culminates a broad process of exchange of information
which guarantees an active presence in the governing bodies,
particularly the Exchanges Alliance Board, that will be created
soon.''
	   The chairman of the Milan stock exchange said in a published
interview that Italy's bourse is seeking to reach an agreement with
the stock exchanges of London and Frankfurt by the end of the year.
	   ``By the end of this month, there will be a multilateral
meeting, after many bilateral meetings, which have intensified
recently,'' Stefano Preda, chairman of Borsa Italiana SpA, told the
newspaper La Repubblica.
	   ``Our intention is to reach an accord in a brief time,'' Preda
said.
	   He acknowledged it would be some time before a single European
bourse could be established, but said the alliance is a step in
that direction.

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqis worked
together to avoid the media Thursday, new cooperation between two
parties whose stormy relations nearly triggered a military strike.
	   On the second day of their field work since their return to
Iraq, the weapons inspectors and their Iraqi escorts appeared happy
with the new arrangement.
	   ``We like it this way,'' said an Iraqi escort waiting for the
inspectors in a car outside the U.N. compound.
	   Instead of the old pattern of escorts entering the U.N. compound
and shaking hands with inspectors in front of TV cameras to start
the day, one escort hastily waved from outside the compound's
three-meter-high (10-foot) fence.
	   Immediately afterward, two U.N. vehicles each with three
monitors sped past television camera crews and disappeared onto a
congested highway.
	   The teamwork was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups, when several planned inspections had to be canceled because
Iraq refused to send escorts required under U.N.-Iraqi agreements.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Charles Duelfer, deputy
director of the U.N. Special Commission, said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``We're trying to keep the temperature
down as much as possible.''
	   The inspectors returned to Baghdad on Tuesday and began their
field trips Wednesday after being blocked from working under Iraqi
government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   A U.N. official in New York reported that the inspectors' first
field visits Wednesday came off without a hitch. ``They did a
normal day's work and came back _ no problems,'' said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency _ quoting Gen. Hussam Mohammed
Amin, director of the National Monitoring Authority that provides
government escorts for the U.N. inspectors _ said that at least
seven monitoring teams went out on Wednesday.
	   Three teams went to nuclear sites, two to missile sites and one
each to chemical and biological sites, INA said.
	   ``The Iraqi side provided all cooperation for the teams,'' it
added.
	   It's not clear if the new teamwork by weapons inspectors and
their escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of
their surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. sanctions on Iraq can be
lifted. Iraq insists it already has destroyed all its most
dangerous weapons.
	   Duelfer told the AP that UNSCOM was still waiting for documents
that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler had requested.
	   ``One of the best ways Iraq can prove its cooperation with the
Special Commission is by providing the documents demanded by the
Special Commission,'' Duefler said.
	   Butler on Wednesday sent a formal request to Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, asking for documents that Iraq previously
refused to hand over.
	   One is an Iraqi air force account of chemical munitions used in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   In a speech in Philadelphia Wednesday, Butler accused Aziz of
lying. He said he had written Aziz asking to see a copy of the
document.
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth,'' Butler said.
	   Iraq, which has accused Butler of working on behalf of the
Americans, has over the past months called for his resignation.
	   The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat on Thursday
quoted Butler as saying he was ready to quit his job if it meant
Iraq would reveal all its banned weapons.
	   ``If it becomes clear that Iraq will fully cooperate and reveal
all the banned weapons ... then the lifting of sanctions will be
achieved,'' Butler said.
	   ``If the only obstacle is Richard Butler ... I am ready to
resign.'' he said. ``I took this job to carry out the mission and
it is logical for me to resign if I am the real obstacle,'' he
added.

Member of Kosovo rebel force is sentenced to prison term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A district court in Kosovo convicted
a 54-year-old ethnic Albanian on terrorism charges and sentenced
him to 1 1/2 years in prison, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported Thursday.
	   Ali Kelmendi, from the village Kosuric in Pec municipality, 70
kilometers (44 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, was
handed a guilty verdict by the Pec court.
	   It court ruled that Kelmendi had ``conspired to (engage in)
anti-state activities'' by joining the Kosovo Liberation Army last
May.
	   Allegedly armed with a semi-automatic rifle, he had been on
guard duty with other rebels on roads leading into his village.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians are awaiting trial on similar
charges in Serbia's strife-torn province, where Albanians comprise
90 per cent of the population of 2 million.
	   A U.S.-sponsored peace agreement for Kosovo envisages amnesty
for all ethnic Albanians who had fought with the rebels and those
imprisoned because of it.
	   However, Yugoslav Justice Minister Drago Ljubljankovic recently
stated there would be no amnesty for those who had ``bloodied their
hands'' in the conflict in Kosovo.

	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Yasuharu Imano shot an
8-under-par 64 and combined with partner Mitsutaka Kusakabe to give
Japan a 10-under 134 and a three-stroke lead in the first round of
the World Cup of Golf on Thursday.
	   Both players capped their rounds in the strokeplay format with
birdies at the 18th, hitting their approaches within 3 meters (10
feet).
	   ``My putting was very good today and I hit every green but
one,'' Imano said through an interpreter. ``It's my first time in a
team match and my leader (Kusakabe) helped me read the line.''
	   Despite making his debut in the World Cup, Imano, winless in two
seasons and ranked 31st on the Japanese tour, clearly outshined the
bigger names in the 43rd edition of the 32-team event.
	   John Daly shot a 2-under 70 on the new 6,288-meter (6,850-yard)
Gulf Harbor course and with teammate Scott Verplank were tied with
Canada for eighth place at 140. Nick Faldo shot a 68 but David
Carter's 1-over 73 left England another shot back.
	   South Africa was closest to Japan. David Frost shot 66 and Nic
Henning a 71 to leave South Africa in second three shots back, one
in front of Sweden's Patrik Sjoland (68) and Mathias Gronberg (70)
and Australia's Peter O'Malley (69) and Richard Green (69).
	   Italy, Zimbabwe and Ireland were all next at 139.
	   Scores were low despite several swirling winds around the
ocean-front course. Tournament officials appeared to heed the
warnings on pin placements, giving the players plenty of birdie
chances. Imano said the greens were ``perfect'' compared to a day
earlier.
	   The 479-meter (517-yard) par-5 2nd gave up five eagles and 33
birdies from the 64 players.
	   Several teams made a run at Japan but were unable to maintain
momentum as the wind picked up through the day.
	   Faldo, playing in a bid to kick-start his form after a difficult
season, was 5-under through nine. But his back nine was
inconsisten. He bogeyed 10 and birdied 11 before bogeying the
spectacular par-4 16th, a hole which slopes wickedly towards the
Hauraki Gulf.
	   ``That's the highest I could have shot,'' said Faldo. ``There
were faults _ it was a case of looking, looking and looking,
identifying them and then working on one drill.''
	   Carter's 73 partially can be attibuted to a shoulder injury.
Carter took painkillers and struggled to read the break on the
greens.
	   Daly, who relished his previous U.S. team experience at the
Dunhill Cup this year, included an eagle at the par-5 6th and a
bizarre bogey at the 12th in his round.
	   The bogey came when he was forced to hit a second ball from the
tee after his first was ignored by stewards and could not be found
in the rough. He had another bogey at the 14th.
	   ``That was the two holes that cost me a good four or five
shots,'' said Daly. ``But we hung in there and we're right in the
tournament and that's all we wanted today.''
	   Costantino Rocca had the second best individual score with a
7-under 65, but partner Massimo Florioli was 2 over, leaving Italy
in a three-way tie for fifth.
	   Pre-tournament favorite Scotland was 2 under at 142 aftter a
disappointing round from European tour money leader Colin
Montgomerie.
	   He started with three birdies in the opening six holes, but then
gave the shots back to finish level. Andrew Coltart also birdied
three of the first six but had one bogey.
	   Large galleries watched New Zealand's first hosting of the event
and Daly was clearly the biggest draw. Germany's Sven Struver got
the loudest reception however. He relieved himself in the trees on
16 and after finishing was sent on his way with a burst of cheers
and applause.

 &UR; Serb leader accuses ethnic Albanians of stalling peace process &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic's one-day visit to Kosovo's
capital Pristina followed on the heels of the Serbian president's
Wednesday attempt to chair a meeting boycotted by leaders of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   The Serb politicians' successive trips to Kosovo were an attempt
to try and assert Serbia's authority over the southern province,
despite continued Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful
solution. Hundreds have been killed and about a quarter of a
million people in Kosovo left homeless since Serbs cracked down on
separatist Albanian rebels in February.
	   Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks called by Serb
President Milan Milutinovic, dismissing them as an act of
propaganda and saying a basic agreement on the future of the
province must come first.
	   In Belgrade Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier
Vojislav Seselj accused the U.S. of backing the ethnic Albanian
boycott of Serbian Kosovo talks, saying the top U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill cannot be an active participant, but only a guest
at any negotiations.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. Milutinovic instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its
own authorities and police, but under Serb rule.
	   Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring

Marjanovic blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace.
	   He accused the ethnic Albanians of ``causing great damage to
everybody, including a big majority of Albanians who want to live
and work in Kosovo with the others'' by boycotting the talks and

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow 2,000

say the troops threaten their territory. Huntzinger told reporters

Thursday and travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina Saturday to meet
ethnic Albanian leaders.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic's one-day visit to Kosovo's
capital Pristina followed on the heels of the Serbian president's
Wednesday attempt to chair a meeting boycotted by leaders of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   The Serb politicians' successive trips to Kosovo were an attempt
to try and assert Serbia's authority over the southern province,
despite continued Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful
solution. Hundreds have been killed and about a quarter of a
million people in Kosovo left homeless since Serbs cracked down on
separatist Albanian rebels in February.
	   Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks called by Serb
President Milan Milutinovic, dismissing them as an act of
propaganda and saying a basic agreement on the future of the
province must come first.
	   In Belgrade Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier
Vojislav Seselj accused the U.S. of backing the ethnic Albanian
boycott of Serbian Kosovo talks, saying the top U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill cannot be an active participant, but only a guest
at any negotiations.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. Milutinovic instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its
own authorities and police, but under Serb rule.
	   Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring
soldiers and police officers who participated in the crackdown,
Marjanovic blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace.
	   He accused the ethnic Albanians of ``causing great damage to
everybody, including a big majority of Albanians who want to live
and work in Kosovo with the others'' by boycotting the talks and
said Serbia's top priority was to ``preserve peace and freedom,
territorial integrity and sovereignty.''
	   Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said a
49-year-old doctor was killed and his daughter wounded when three
masked assailants broke into their home in Pec, some 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Pristina.
	   In Belgrade Thursday, the French ambassador to Macedonia Jacques
Huntzinger, met Milutinovic in an attempt to soften Yugoslavia's

New Confederations Cup schedule upsets French, Americans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moved from January to July and August to placate
the World Cup champion French, the Confederations Cup still is in
trouble.
	   The new calendar upsets the Americans, and the French still
don't know if they will play.
	   ``A competition cannot have these dates, it is a question of the
calendar,'' Noel Le Graet, president of the French National League
(LNF), was quoted Thursday in the French daily L'Equipe.
	   The French Football Federation's governing general council will
meet Friday to decide whether to accept the new dates proposed by
FIFA for the Confederations Cup.
	   FFF president Claude Simonet initially accepted the new dates,
but had asked for more time to consult with the French National
League.
	   A source at the FFF who requested anonymity said that there
remains a possibility that the federation will be unable to send a
team because the new dates clash with the start of the 1999-2000
French season.
	   After meetings earlier this week _ in which the participating
nations were consulted _ FIFA announced that the Confederations
Cup, an eight-team tournament that is to be comprised of the
continental champions, was being moved from Jan. 8-20 to July
28-Aug. 8.
	   Acknowleding it still had to be ratified by the Executive
Committee, FIFA announced that Simonet had committed Les Bleus to
play.
	   But only days later, Le Graet was exasperated, with the French
league schedule apparently set to begin July 28.
	   ``Mr. Simonet could not have looked at the calendar,'' Le Graet
said.
	   The French withdrew from the Confederations Cup, to be played in
Mexico, with its January schedule, saying it conflicted with the
European league season.
	   Simonet agreed to the new schedule, but has run into more
opposition.
	   ``The dates (for next year's French league) are still not set. I
am not going to get into a debate about this before bringing the
problem before the general council,'' Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games, and causes problems for Mexico,
Brazil and Argentina which will compete in the Copa America, set
for July 23-Aug. 8.
	   ``To my knowledge there has been no official communication with
the French FA,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday. ``As we
said a couple of days ago, our president (Sepp Blatter) had met
with the French president.
	   ``Those dates were proposed for everybody. Clearly we wouldn't
have laid down those dates where anybody said they couldn't make
it. Everybody got the same approach, each was able to express their
opinion.''
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation was represented at the FIFA meetings,
but one of them was not MLS commissioner Doug Logan, whose league
season was interrupted in 1996 by the Olympics and this year by the
World Cup.
	   ``I'm extraordinarily disappointed. As everyone knows I was
hopeful we'd have uniterrupted season to see what we could do,''
Logan said. ``However, we will make best of it. We will
enthusiastically support the (U.S.) federation fielding a
competitive team to the Confederations Cup.
	   ``We will work closely with (U.S. coach) Bruce Arena...in making
sure that the team is well-prepared and represents our country, our
federation and our league at the higest level.
	   ``Our preference would have been to have this scheduled at
another time. We'll dance with the partner given us.''

FIFA sticks to age limit for Sydney Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Thursday decided against
relaxing the age limit of 23 for soccer players at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics despite earlier indications it might be eased.
	   The world body's organizing committee for Olympic events
reaffirmed the current rules under which teams in Olympic
competition may field only three players over the age of 23.
	   The rules are intended to guard the supremacy of the World Cup
	   A joint IOC-FIFA statement in September said the age limit
question ``may be reopened'' and the number of over-23 players
could be increased to five for the Sydney Games.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has pushed for a
higher-level Olympic soccer tournament and expressed hope the
restrictions could be dropped altogether.
	   His FIFA counterpart, Sepp Blatter, has said he wants soccer
``given greater prominence'' in the Olympic Games.
	   Sixteen men's and eight women's teams will take part in the 2000
tournament, which will be staged in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide and Canberra.
	   The men's final will take place on Sept. 30, 2000 in Sydney's
new Olympic Stadium, FIFA said.

Injuries force West Indies' Walsh to drop from warm-up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies played a practice
session on Thursday without top bowler Courtney Walsh, who will sit
out a final warm-up match this weekend against the provincial Free
State.
	   After twisting his ankle against Griqualand West last weekend,
the 36-year-old paceman has also injured his left knee.
	   The first Test against South Africa begins Nov. 26.
	   West Indies captain Brian Lara said there was no reason to
panic.
	   ``Courtney is a professional,'' he said. ``I'm sure he knows
what is required of him. He'll be all right.''
	   The provincial match that starts Friday will give South African
captain Hansie Cronje a first chance to measure the competition up
close. Cronje will be playing as part of his provincial Free State
home team.
	   ``I've obviously watched plenty of videos of the West Indies and
we've played a lot of one-day games against them, but there's
nothing like first-hand knowledge,'' said Cronje.
	   Tentative team members for upcoming match are:
	   Free State _ Gerhardus Liebenberg (captain), Kosie Venter, Boeta
Dippenaar, Cronje, Louis Wilkinson, Jonathan Beukes, Nicky Boje,
Morne van Wyk, Herman Bakkes, Johan van der Wath, Victor Mpitsang
and 12th-man Dewald Pretorius.
	   West Indies _ Philo Wallace, Clayton Lambert, Lara, Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Darren Ganga, Stuart Williams, Ridley
Jacobs, Mervyn Dillon, Dinanath Ramnarine, Nixon McLean, Curtly
Ambrose.

War buff finds buried WWI tank, containing surprises

<TEXT>
	   FLESQUIERES, France (AP) _ After years of digging across
northern France, war buff Philippe Gorczynski has found his prize:
a rusty but intact British tank from the Great War, with a few
surprises inside.
	   On Thursday, a dozen archeological workers used an earth mover
to gently remove tons of red earth covering the Mark IV tank in
this farm town near the Belgian border, a former World War I
battlefield.
	   Under 2.5 meters of soil in a vegetable patch, Gorczynski said
finding the tank was like searching out the proverbial needle in a
haystack.
	   After years of talking to residents, poring over battle maps and
digging in about 20 sites, the hotel owner in nearby Cambrai
finally sunk his spade in the right place on Nov. 5.
	   ``I was almost in shock. It was the culmination of all my
research,'' Gorczynski said. ``I think of all the names of the
soldiers I knew.''
	   But what he found inside was even more surprising: both British
and German silverware, lamps and helmets.
	   British troops abandoned the tank on Nov. 20, 1917, and German
troops then buried it and used it as a bunker in this town of brick
houses and cow pastures.
	   The team of archaeologists was expected to officially raise the
tank on Nov. 20, next week, to mark the day the tank changed hands.
	   Using the earth mover, they were to dig a hold 5 meters (15
feet) deep around the tank in order to raise it with a crane.
	   ``We're going to repair it, remove the rust and clean it, then
turn it into a monument,'' said Alain Jacques, a leader of the
team.

Edmonton beats Stanford for 2001 world champs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The Canadian city of Edmonton beat
Stanford on Thursday for the right to stage the 2001 World
Championships, taking track and field's showcase event to North
America for the first time.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Edmonton,
capital of the province of Alberta, received ``massive consensus''
in the secret ballot by the 27-member IAAF Council.
	   Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   It was Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997
and 1999 championships.
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating
Championships.

Russian student arrested for hijacking prank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 19-year-old Russian student has been charged
with terrorism for threatening to blow up a passenger plane, even
though no bomb was found and he says it was just an experiment, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Mikhail Revatsky told investigators he never planned to take any
money, but placed the note because ``I wanted to watch how the
security services work and the behavior of people in that
situation,'' the Kommersant daily quoted him as saying.
	   ``Only once we arrived in Moscow, when I saw armed people
surrounding the plane, did I understand what I created,'' he said.
	   On Aug. 9, the crew aboard an East Line aircraft traveling from
the Siberian city of Tyumen to Moscow discovered a note warning of
a bomb on board. The note demanded 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000 at
the time) and onward passage to another country.
	   The plane landed at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and was held on
the tarmac for four hours while special forces in armored personnel
carriers and intelligence agents were brought in.
	   The 97 passengers were then taken into the terminal and
questioned. Police took handwriting samples from all of them except
the children, and released them.
	   No bomb was found on the plane and no ransom was paid.
	   Earlier this month, handwriting experts determined that
Revatsky, a student at a technical college near Tyumen, had written
the note. He was arrested and charged with terrorism, Kommersant
said.
	   If convicted, he faces five to 10 years in prison.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights a
number of times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

Sikh publisher fatally shot in Vancouver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A Sikh newspaper publisher
who was critical of Sikh hard-liners was shot to death in the
garage of his Vancouver home, police said Thursday.
	   Tara Singh Hayer, 64, publisher of the Indo-Canadian Times, was
killed Wednesday evening. He had used a wheelchair since being
partially paralyzed by a previous assassination attempt a decade
ago.
	   The publisher's son, Sukhdev Hayer, said he believed the killing
was an attempt to intimidate voters in upcoming elections for
leadership at a Sikh temple in the Vancouver area.
	   The area's Sikh community has been plagued for years by violence
between moderates and fundamentalists over an edict from the
religion's ruling body in India to remove tables and chairs from
temple dining halls.
	   Fundamentalists consider the tables and chairs to be improper
additions to a temple.

	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition
of organizing sports events and we are delighted to have a
commitment to host what we feel will be the greatest ever world
championships.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great
majority'' for Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentaion which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations
from Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show.
	   ``We presented third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund
said. ``We left the room thinking we would probably have a half an
hour wait. Within about four or five minutes, they called us back
in to announce that Edmonton had won the bid. Apparently it was
almost a unanimous decision.
	   ``From a track and field perspective for Canada, it's a
tremendous boost to our sport.''
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be provided for athletes and officials.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.
	   The result was another blow to track and field in the United
States.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and
television coverage.

French look to stop Russian streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of
France look to stop a Russian winning streak in Grand Prix figure
skating series at the Lalique Trophy competition this weekend.
	   The Russians are fresh from a sweep of all four events at the
Nations Cup in Gelsenkirchen, Germany last week. With world
champion Alexei Yagudin looking for his fifth victory in five weeks
and European champion Maria Butyskaya wanting to rebound from a
poor performance, the singles events have Russian favorites.
	   Former world champions Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov are
making their first start of the season in the pairs and are favored
in that event, despite the presence of French skaters Sarah Abitbol
and Stephane Bernadis.
	   Only in ice dance are the Russians vulnerable here where they
haven't sent their top skaters.
	   Anissina, who was born in Moscow but moved to France six years
ago, and Peizerat won the bronze medal behind two Russian couples
and then took second at the world championships.
	   But Olympic champions Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov have
split up and Angeleika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov, who won in
Gelsenkirchen, are not competing in Paris.
	   Anissina and Peizerat won Skate American three weeks ago with an
top-caliber performance.
	   The short programs and original dance are Friday with the free
programs on Saturday.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians had four
victories in the eight events. They doubled that in Gelsenkirchen.
	   Yagudin was the men's singles winner in Germany and showed his
first quadruple jump of the season. Over the past month he has won
two Grand Prix and two Pro-Am compeititons.
	   American Michael Weiss is entered and could challenge Yagudin if
he finally completes his quad. He has been coming close in his last
few competitions and was second to Yagudin at Skate America.
	   Butyrskaya had a disastrous long program in Gelsenkirchen but
salvaged third. She won Skate America.
	   Yelena Liashenko, who won Skate Canada, and American Nicole
Bobek are also entered.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competiitons, the women's competition is still looking for a
leader.
	   There have been three Grand Prix meets so far with three
different women's winners.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Subway consortium warns that Athens threatened with gridlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's capital may be in danger of
permanent gridlock unless its transit system is radically expanded,
the multinational consortium building its new metro warned
Thursday.
	   ``If serious measures are not taken, an impasse is
unavoidable,'' Leonidas Kykiras, chairman of the multinational
consortium, told a local radio station.
	   Known as Attiko Metro, the consortium is building the capital's
new dlrs 2.2 billion subway. It played a key role in the
International Olympic Committee's decision to grant Athens the 2004
Summer Games. It is to be finished by 2000.
	   According to Kykiras, a new 18-kilometer (11-mile) extension to
Athens' existing metro system must be made six-times bigger. Attiko
metro proposed adding another 105 kilometers (65 miles) to the
subway.
	   It also suggested the network should be complemented with
extensive tram and light railway systems. The total cost of the
improvement was estimated at nearly dlrs 9 billion
	   Public Works Minister Costas Laliotis reserved judgment on the
proposal, but said it would be examined.
	   Kykiras based his claim on a three-year study led by the
consortium which predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens
will almost double from their current number of about 1.5 million.
	   Funded by the European Union, the study predicted that the
population in greater Athens' will swell to nearly 5 million. It is
now home to just over 4 million people, or nearly half the
country's population of 10.2 million.
	   The Attiko Metro consortium is made up of of 23 companies,
including Greek, French and German ones. Bechtel International Inc.
of California is acting as consultant.
	   Premier Costas Simitis has committed his government to improving
the capital's cheap but notoriously tiresome transit system.
Efforts to streamline and improve public transport have so far been
stymied, met by a strike campaign waged by employees at state-owned
transit companies.

Deal announced to move NFL team to Hartford
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STRAT DOUTHAT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ The New England Patriots have
reached a tentative deal to move from suburban Boston about 160
kilometers (100 miles) southwest to Hartford, it was announced
Thrusday.
	   If the deal can be finalized between now and the end of the
year, the Patriots would play their first U.S. National Football
League game in Hartford in 2001, Connecticut Gov. John G Rowland
said, as team owner Robert Kraft stood at his side in the Capitol.
	   The announcement was met with raucous applause from business and
legislative leaders. Hartford has desperately wanted to regain
``major league'' status since the North American National Hockey
League's Whalers left in 1997 and became the Carolina Hurricanes.
	   The Patriots would play in a proposed dlrs 350 million,
68,000-seat, open-air stadium which also would become the new home
of college gridiron team from the University of Connecticut.
	   The proposed deal would keep the team in Hartford for at least
30 years.
	   Kraft had been unable to reach an agreement with lawmakers in
the state of Massachusetts on a new stadium for the Patriots. He
said the stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts _ used for the 1994
World Cup and also the home of the New England Revolution of Major
League Soccer, ``is not a stadium for the modern NFL,'' and said
the facility was built in 1970 on a 6 million-dollar budget.
	   ``I love the stadium, but it's just not proper for the future,''
he said.
	   Kraft said he did not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining
approval for the move from other NFL owners, despite Hartford's
proximity to the New York metropolitan area.
	   Despite the Revolution also being owned by Kraft, they are
expected to remain in Boston.

Fearing 2000 computer glitch, Danish state bank saves old currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Since Danes tend to hoard when they
get nervous, the state bank Thursday slowed destruction of old bank
notes to make sure it has enough cash on hand in case depositors
panic over the so-called millennium bug.
	   Many fear that the turn of the year 2000 will leave computers,
including those use by banks, crippled because older programs might
crash when the year turns from '99 to '00. Some computers might not
recognize the year 2000, or interpret '00 to mean the year 1900.
	   While the state Central Bank said there was no evidence that
Danes had begun hoarding bank notes, it was taking no chances.
	   ``We want people to know that that we have enough notes so there
is no reason to start hoarding,'' Bjarne Skafte of the central
Nationalbanken told The Associated Press.
	   The bank plans to stockpile an extra 20 billion kroner (dlrs 3.2
billion) in cash by 2000 simply by slowing down the rate at which
it shred olds currency notes.
	   Earlier this year, word of an impending strike by bank workers
had Danes hoarding gasoline, food and other products. Usually
placid Danes were actually getting into scuffles when supplies
began to dwindle.
	   Henrik Theil, of the Danish Bankers' Association, said the
thought of Danes hoarding cash and products on the even of the new
millennium was not a pleasant one.
	   ``We would like to avoid (again) see grownup Danes fight over (a
package of) yeast in supermarkets,'' Theil said.

FIFA sticks to age limit for Sydney Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Thursday decided against
relaxing the 23-year age limit for soccer players at the 2000
Sydney Olympics despite earlier indications it might be eased.
	   The world body's Olympic organizing committee reaffirmed the
current rules under which teams in Olympic competition may field
only three players over the age of 23.
	   The rules are intended to guard the supremacy of the World Cup.
	   A joint IOC-FIFA statement in September said the age limit
question ``may be reopened'' and the number of over-23 players
could be increased to five for the Sydney Games.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has pushed for a
higher-level Olympic soccer tournament and expressed hope the
restrictions could be dropped altogether.
	   His FIFA counterpart, Sepp Blatter, has said he wants soccer
``given greater prominence'' in the Olympic Games.
	   Sixteen men's and eight women's teams will take part in the 2000
tournament, which will be staged in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide and Canberra.
	   The men's final will take place on Sept. 30, 2000 in Sydney's
new Olympic Stadium, FIFA said.

Belarusian president denies food crisis but urges action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian city is issuing ration cards
for food staples, long lines are forming everywhere to buy sugar
and other basic goods and officials said Thursday that inflation
exceeded 85 percent so far this year.
	   But Belarus' autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko insisted
Thursday that food shortages in this former Soviet republic don't
amount to a ``crisis.''
	   Still, as he addressed an emergency task force charged with
sweeping control over the economy, Lukashenko ordered that the
troubles be resolved fast.
	   He dispatched officials to make sure Belarus has ``everything to
supply our people with food, clothes, and so on.''
	   He did not say where the government was expected to find
resources to do that, but he banned officials from dipping into
Belarus' emergency food supply.
	   Belarus still has a Soviet-style economy, as Lukashenko has
blocked most serious reforms.
	   The country was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a
dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to order
strict price controls. That led to a boom in exports and to
frequent shortages of staple goods, including meat and dairy
products, within Belarus.
	   In the western city of Ostovets, ration cards have been
introduced for sugar and butter, the independent daily Naviny
reported.
	   Authorities in the northwestern city of Novopolotsk have ordered
grocery stores to sell food only to customers who prove they are
local residents, Naviny said.
	   In a small town in the western Brest region where ration cards
have not been introduced, a store assistant refused to sell more
than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar to an elderly woman, even
after she stood in line for a second time to get a second bag.
	   The woman sued, but court ruled in favor of the store,
Belarusian state radio reported Thursday.
	   Vodka-lovers have been hit, too. The price of a half-liter
(pint) bottle of Belarusian vodka shot up from 90,000 (just under 1
dollar at the official exchange rate) Wednesday to about 170,000
(about dlrs 1.80) Thursday. Lines snaked around liquor stores and
kiosks Wednesday after the price hike was announced.
	   Also Thursday, a senior Economics Ministry official said
inflation in the first 10 months of the year was 85.1 percent.
	   Lukashenko, meanwhile, insisted: ``There is no catastrophe in
Belarus, no collapse, no crisis in provisions for the populace.''

Maximum sentences in the murder of a student
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defendants' full names, ADDS quote from
prosecutor in graf 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Warsaw provincial court on Thursday
handed down two life sentences and five other prison terms to a
group found guilty of abducting, torturing and murdering a
19-year-old student last summer.
	   In a trial that riveted Poles since May, a five-judge panel
convicted the two main perpetrators, Monika Szymanska and Tomasz
Kobus, of murder and gave both the maximum sentence of life in
prison.
	   The court said Szymanska, a 24-year-old mother of three, was the
ringleader of the group who ordered the abduction and murder and
Kobus carried out the stabbing that led to the death of the
student, Tomek Jaworski.
	   Another leader of the 19 to 34-year-old group, Marek Szmidt was
also charged with murder but got 15-years in prison because he
cooperated with investigators and told them were to find Jaworski's
body.
	   Robert Wojcieski got 12 years in prison for helping abduct and
torture the victim, Rafal Bogdanski, also charged as an accessory
in the abduction, got a seven-year term. Two participants in a
scuffle that preceded the abduction, Maciej Kusy and Robert
Juraszek got five- and two-year suspended sentences respectively.
	   They were all arrested within days of the murder.
	   ``No crime has justification, but in this case we met with such
accumulation of suffering that it bordered on bestiality,''
presiding judge Malgorzata Mojkowska said in reading the verdict.
	   Jaworski was abducted from an end-of-school party last June,
locked in an apartment for five days, and tortured and stabbed to
death.
	   Prosecutor Wanda Marciniak said the perpetrators' ``brutality
and ruthlessness was hard to understand.''
	   Jaworski's parents have said they cannot forgive the murderers
of their only child and that life imprisonment was not sufficient
punishment.
	   Poland's new penal code, introduced in September, abolished the
death penalty, in line with most codes in Western Europe. Poland, a
former communist-governed country aspiring to join the European
Union, replaced its communist-era code with one that applies to its
new political and economic situation.
	   People across the nation were shocked by the crime. Groups of
relatives and friends of Jaworski's family carrying black flags and
pictures of the victim, attended every court session in the case
and the media reported on the trial in detail. Some cried when the
verdict was announced.

New Confederations Cup schedule upsets French, Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS to Bolivia, sted Argentina, playing in Confedertions
Cup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moved from January to July and August to placate
the World Cup champion French, the Confederations Cup still is in
trouble.
	   The new calendar upsets the Americans, and the French still
don't know if they will play.
	   ``A competition cannot have these dates, it is a question of the
calendar,'' Noel Le Graet, president of the French National League
(LNF), was quoted Thursday in the French daily L'Equipe.
	   The French Football Federation's governing general council will
meet Friday to decide whether to accept the new dates proposed by
FIFA for the Confederations Cup.
	   FFF president Claude Simonet initially accepted the new dates,
but had asked for more time to consult with the French National
League.
	   A source at the FFF who requested anonymity said that there
remains a possibility that the federation will be unable to send a
team because the new dates clash with the start of the 1999-2000
French season.
	   After meetings earlier this week _ in which the participating
nations were consulted _ FIFA announced that the Confederations
Cup, an eight-team tournament that is to be comprised of the
continental champions, was being moved from Jan. 8-20 to July
28-Aug. 8.
	   Acknowleding it still had to be ratified by the Executive
Committee, FIFA announced that Simonet had committed Les Bleus to
play.
	   But only days later, Le Graet was exasperated, with the French
league schedule apparently set to begin July 28.
	   ``Mr. Simonet could not have looked at the calendar,'' Le Graet
said.
	   The French withdrew from the Confederations Cup, to be played in
Mexico, with its January schedule, saying it conflicted with the
European league season.
	   Simonet agreed to the new schedule, but has run into more
opposition.
	   ``The dates (for next year's French league) are still not set. I
am not going to get into a debate about this before bringing the
problem before the general council,'' Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games, and causes problems for Mexico,
Brazil and Bolivia which will compete in the Copa America, set for
July 23-Aug. 8.
	   ``To my knowledge there has been no official communication with
the French FA,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday. ``As we
said a couple of days ago, our president (Sepp Blatter) had met
with the French president.
	   ``Those dates were proposed for everybody. Clearly we wouldn't
have laid down those dates where anybody said they couldn't make
it. Everybody got the same approach, each was able to express their
opinion.''
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation was represented at the FIFA meetings,
but one of them was not MLS commissioner Doug Logan, whose league
season was interrupted in 1996 by the Olympics and this year by the
World Cup.
	   ``I'm extraordinarily disappointed. As everyone knows I was
hopeful we'd have uniterrupted season to see what we could do,''
Logan said. ``However, we will make best of it. We will
enthusiastically support the (U.S.) federation fielding a
competitive team to the Confederations Cup.
	   ``We will work closely with (U.S. coach) Bruce Arena...in making
sure that the team is well-prepared and represents our country, our
federation and our league at the higest level.
	   ``Our preference would have been to have this scheduled at
another time. We'll dance with the partner given us.''

Gullikson aims to talk Sampras, Agassi into facing Brits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After his third-string team lost 4-1 to Italy in
the semifinals, U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson will do all he
can to persuade Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi to play in next
April's match against Britain.
	   Britain's David Lloyd doesn't have that problem. He has Greg
Rusedski and Tim Henman and virtually no-one else.
	   American team officials came under fire when a weak U.S. team,
without Sampras or Agassi, lost to Italy in the semifinals in
Milwaukee in September.
	   Next year is the centenary of the competition and Gullikson said
he will hold individual meetings with his top two players to try
and persuade them to face Rudedski and Henman in Birmingham,
England, April 2-4.
	   ``I have not specifically talked to Andre and Pete yet about
playing in the tie. They have a very big event coming up next week
(the ATP World Tour Championship) in Hanover and in December I want
to personally go and visit each of them,'' Gullikson said Thursday
in a conference call from his home at Palm Coast, Florida.
	   ``I am going to approach them both after the season is over and
talk about next year.''
	   Gullikson said he was mindful of the fact that both players have
opted out of Davis Cup play in the past to concentrate on other
tournaments and Agassi, strongly critical of US Tennis Association
president Harry Marmion, had refused to play in Milwaukee.
	   ``There are a lot of pressures pulling on the players and it's
not quite as easy as it would appear on paper,'' Gullikson said.
``We need to have our very, very best team and Andre and Pete and
Todd (Martin) are the strongest team.''
	   ``Andre has said that was trying to leave the door open for the
new president (Judy Levering),'' Gullikson said. ``He had a little
bit of a row going with the outgoing president but he seems to have
left the door open for next year.''
	   Gullikson said Sampras and Agassi had already made major impacts
in Davis Cup play.
	   ``This guys are already part of Davis Cup history,' he said.
	   ``But we need our best team and we need the enthusiastic support
of the players. As these guys get a little older, probably in the
next three or four years they may be phasing out, I hope they would
want to put their stamp on Davis Cup history.
	   ``Next year the second round will be at the venue in Boston
where it all started 100 years ago. It's an extremely historic year
for the Davis Cup,'' Gullikson said.
	   ``If someone had wanted to write a tough draw for us they
couldn't have made it tougher. After we first play Britain then we
probably play Australia in Boston. God forbid it's a relegation
match.''
	   Gullikson said he still felt the criticism of last year's loss
to Italy.
	   ``People were clearly disgusted that we didn't, for some reason,
field our best team. There was some fairly negative press because
our best players weren't playing.''
	   Lloyd, who doesn't have a single player other than Henman
(ninth) and Rusedski (11th) ranked in the top 100, said he had
hoped to avoid the Americans by gaining a seed in the last 16.
	   ``I don't know how we weren't seeded, but that's another
issue,'' said the British captain, who also hoped that Sampras and
Agassi would play.
	   ``Whoever the Americans put out it will be a tremendous team,''
he said. ``If we can beat Andre and Pete it would be a lot more
than beating Todd Martin and someone else. I should like them both
to come here.
	   ``I think that if Sampras refuses to play, he should never play
for his country again,'' Lloyd said.
	   ``Sampras says he does not realize why he is not a national hero
when he walks out on the street. Maybe that's the reason.
	   ``I can't really understand anybody, whether it's in any sport,
not wanting to play for their country,'' Lloyd said. ``I would be
devastated if Greg and Tim didn't want to play for Britain.''
	   Henman says he can't wait for the match.
	   ``We've been talking about this tie for a long time,'' he said.
``We had two years in the wilderness and now we're back in the
World Group. It doesn't get much bigger than playing the U.S. in
any sport.''

Strike settled at Club Med where staff held guests hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A strike at a Club Med resort
where workers held 373 guests hostage earlier this month has been
settled, union and resort officials said Wednesday.
	   The resort will reopen Dec. 4, said manager Nicolas Japy.
	   ``We are satisfied because we have reached an agreement,'' said
Japy. ``That's the main thing.''
	   The resort closed after employees blocked entrances and refused
to let guests leave on Nov. 7 to protest a breakdown in contract
negotiations. Police raided the resort and freed the guests.
	   Guests said they were not mistreated but were not allowed to
leave the grounds.
	   The agreement signed Wednesday provides raises of 3.5 percent
now and an additional 1 percent in December, 1999.
	   ``We have signed an acceptable agreement,'' said union spokesman
Leo Cabit. ``We cannot say a very good one, but it is acceptable.''
	   The union, which represents nearly 300 workers, had sought 8
percent raises.

	   FLESQUIERES, France (AP) _ After years of scouring and digging
across northern France, war buff Philippe Gorczynski has finally
found his prize: a rusty but intact British tank from the Great
War, with a few surprises inside.
	   On Thursday, a dozen archeological workers used picks, shovels
and an earth mover to gently remove tons of muddy red earth
covering the Mark IV tank in this farm town near the Belgian
border, a former World War I battlefield.
	   Gorczynski, covered with mud from head to toe as he helped the
crew, said finding the tank under 2.5 meters (8 feet) of soil in a
vegetable patch was like searching out the proverbial needle in a
haystack.
	   After years of talking to residents, poring over battle maps and
aerial photos, Gorczynski dug in about 20 places before finally
sinking his spade in the right spot on Nov. 5.
	   ``I was almost in shock. It was the culmination of all my
research,'' the 38-year-old hotel owner from nearby Cambrai.``I
think of all the names of the soldiers I knew.''
	   But what he found inside was even more surprising: both British
and German silverware, lamps and helmets, as well as unexploded
grenades.
	   British troops abandoned the tank on Nov. 20, 1917, and German
soldiers then buried it and used it as a bunker in this town of
brick houses and cow pastures.
	   The blue-helmeted team of archaeologists was expected to
officially raise the tank on Nov. 20, next week, to mark the day
the tank changed hands. By Thursday afternoon, the top was exposed,
encrusted in mud.
	   With help from the earth mover, they were to dig a hold 5 meters
(15 feet) deep around the tank in order to raise it with a crane.
	   ``We're going to repair it, remove the rust and clean it, then
turn it into a monument,'' said Alain Jacques, a leader of the
team.

Edmonton beats Stanford for 2001 world champs

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The Canadian city of Edmonton beat
Stanford on Thursday for the right to stage the 2001 World
Championships, taking track and field's showcase event to North
America for the first time.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Edmonton,
capital of the province of Alberta, received ``massive consensus''
in the secret ballot by the IAAF Council.
	   Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released, but an IAAF source
said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. Two Council members were absent
and a third apparently abstained.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   It was Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997
and 1999 championships.
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating
Championships.
	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition
of organizing sports events and we are delighted to have a
commitment to host what we feel will be the greatest ever world
championships.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great
majority'' for Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentaion which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations
from Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show.
	   ``We presented third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund
said. ``We left the room thinking we would probably have a half an
hour wait. Within about four or five minutes, they called us back
in to announce that Edmonton had won the bid. Apparently it was
almost a unanimous decision.
	   ``From a track and field perspective for Canada, it's a
tremendous boost to our sport.''
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be provided for athletes and officials.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.
	   The result was another blow to track and field in the United
States.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and
television coverage.

Helicopter collision kills 22 in Mexico

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Officials said Thursday a crash of two
helicopters over the southern Gulf of Mexico killed all 22
passengers and crew members, most oil workers in the Gulf of
Mexico.
	   The accident occurred Wednesday as the private helicopters were
flying between two oil platforms, the government oil monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos reported.
	   Only 18 bodies have been recovered, Pemex said.
	   Pemex denied reports published by several Mexico City newspapers
that one of the casualties was a foreign citizen.
	   Pemex officials and Sen. Carlos Romero Deschamps, who is also
secretary-general of the Mexican Oil Workers Union, traveled to
Ciudad del Carmen to give their condolences to the workers'
relatives.
	   Pemex identified the owners of the helicopters as the ASESA and
PEGASO companies. Further information about the companies was not
provided.

Security forces raid ex-rebels in Khartoum, 2 people wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese security forces had a shootout
with former rebels in the capital Thursday, wounding at least two
people, witnesses said.
	   The fire fight took place when security forces raided premises
of the South Sudan Coordination Council in central Khartoum. The
council is made up of representatives of several southern rebel
factions who defected to the government and signed a peace
agreement in April 1997.
	   Police cordoned off the area during the 1 1/2-hour raid.
Ambulances rushed to the scene and witnesses said they saw two
wounded persons. It is not known whether they were faction members,
security force personnel or civilians.
	   The men who opened fire were thought to be followers of the
council's head, Riak Machar, a former commander of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army who was visiting the Upper Nile province
of southern Sudan on Thursday.
	   The governor of Khartoum province said earlier this week he
planned to put an end to the presence of armed groups in the
capital.
	   Three men were killed earlier this year in faction fighting
among the former rebels in Khartoum.
	   Several splinter groups have broken away from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting since 1983 for autonomy
for the Christian and animist south of the country from the
Muslim-dominated north.
	   The war and attendant famines have left more than 1.5 million
people dead.

Serie A player turns in ``non-negative'' drug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian League soccer player has turned in a drug
test that could reveal use of a banned substance, the national
Olympic committee (CONI) said Thursday.
	   The player's name and the substance will not be released unless
backup samples turn up positive, a CONI spokesman said. The case is
being considered a ``non-negative'' until further testing is done.
	   Italian soccer has been flooded since the summer with
allegations about and investigations into the use of
performance-enhancing substances. The fallout has included the
resignation of CONI president Mario Pescante and the closing of
Italy's drug testing lab.
	   The latest test result came from the IOC-accredited laboratory
in Lausanne, Switzerland, one of four facilities abroad that have
been handling testing for Italy since its laboratory was shut down
last month amid accusations of improper procedures.

divert attention from its weapons problems. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Richard Butler said Thursday he has every
intention of remaining as chief U.N. weapons inspector and accused
Iraq of trying to divert attention from its weapons problems to his
personality.
	   The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat quoted Butler
as saying in an interview that he was ready to quit his job if it
meant that Iraq would reveal all its banned weapons.
	   ``In the wildly theoretical circumstance that the only thing
standing between the complete and verifiable disarmament of Iraq
and the present situation where it can't be verified ... is me, of
course I would go. I wouldn't want to stand in the way,'' Butler
said.
	   ``This is a wildly theoretical circumstance and frankly it's an
attempt by Iraq to divert attention from its weapons problems and
on to a personality issue,'' he said.
	   ``I have every intention of seeing this job through,'' Butler
said.
	   Iraq has stepped up calls in recent months for the Australian
diplomat's resignation and accused him of working on behalf of the
Americans, a charge that he denies.
	   It has also called for the restructuring of the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, which Butler heads. The commission is
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and
tough economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait cannot be lifted until it does so.
	   Butler said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz had referred
to him in a letter to the U.N. Security Council over the weekend
outlining Baghdad's hopes for a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Aziz asked the council to consider ``the question of Butler and
the structure of UNSCOM and its practices ... seriously in order to
ensure a good relationship in the future.''
	   Butler sent a letter to Aziz after weapons inspectors returned
to Baghdad on Tuesday formally requesting documents on Iraq's
banned weapons programs.
	   In a speech Wednesday night to the World Affairs Council of
Philadelphia, Butler said he asked the Iraqis for ``a whole new
answer'' on its biological weapons program, which he called ``a
black hole.''
	   ``Break the habit of a lifetime and tell me the truth,'' Butler
said.

General strike halts business in Suriname as protest spreads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEO MORPURGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Defying a plea by the president to
stay open, nearly all businesses in Suriname's capital closed their
doors Thursday to support a two-day general strike.
	   The general strike follows three weeks of protests and strikes
by labor unions demanding salary increases as displeasure with the
deteriorating economy spreads.
	   The political opposition, four of the nation's five labor
federations and a business association all supported the general
strike, but for various reasons. Public employees are seeking a 100
percent wage increase to compensate for rising costs of living
while the opposition Suriname Labor Party hopes to oust President
Jules Wijdenbosch.
	   Labor Party leader Fred Derby said the success of the general
strike shows that Wijdenbosch has lost control.
	   On Wednesday evening, Wijdenbosch went on television to urge
residents ``to carry out their daily activities in the usual
manner,'' a plea that was ignored.
	   As more evidence of the government's slipping grip on power,
Derby also pointed to a refusal by firefighters to turn water hoses
on demonstrators and a protest march that took place and was
escorted by police despite a ban on the event by a regional
official.
	   Heavily dependent on commodity exports, Suriname's economy has
weakened with the global economic slowdown.
	   Wijdenbosch took office in 1996 promised to lower the exchange
rate from 500 guilders to the U.S. dollar to 400 to one. Instead,
the rate has now hit 720 guilders to the dollar and costs of basic
goods have soared.

Festina doubtful for major races, director says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Shorn of its better known riders, the
Festina team hasn't yet decided whether it will take part in all of
next year's major races, director Juan Fernandez said Thursday.
	   ``We want to begin at square one,'' said Fernandez, who took
over the team after it was thrown off this year's Tour de France,
told a news conference in Bern.
	   ``No decision has been taken yet'' on next year's races,
Fernandez continued. ``But it seems to me the Tour of Italy may be
too difficult for us.''
	   The team's participation in next year's Tour de France isn't yet
assured as it may not have a high enough world ranking to qualify
automatically.
	   Festina was kicked out of this year's race after some of its
riders admitted taking performance enhancing drugs.
	   Three of its riders _ Switzerland's Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux
and Armin Meier _ were banned from taking part in competitions
until May 1 next year after they admitted taking the
performance-enhancing hormone EPO.
	   Last month, Festina cut its budget for next season by half and
said its contracts with all its riders were being renegotiated.
	   Zuelle and Dufaux left the team in October. Earlier this month
French rider Richard Virenque, who denies knowingly using banned
substances, also parted company with Festina.
	   Festina says its new-look team will focus on the development of
young riders.

First SAfrican Cabinet minister to seek amnesty on Monday, offering
</HEADLINE>
glimpses into conflict among black groups &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ One of South Africa's most
violent periods that pitted two black political groups against each
other will be probed starting Monday, when a Cabinet minister seeks
amnesty before a human rights panel.
	   Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe is applying for amnesty from
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for his role in organizing
and arming self defense units (SDUs) that operated in KwaZulu-Natal
from 1990 to 1994, as South African was emerging from decades of
apartheid.
	   He is the first Cabinet minister of the ruling African National
Congress to appear at a public amnesty hearing.
	   Last month, the Truth Commission released a five-volume report
on testimony from victims of apartheid-era political violence and
assigned major blame for human rights violations to the National
Party, apartheid's architect. But it also cited black
anti-apartheid struggle groups for their excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess their crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _ a
process expected to last well into next year as decisions are made
on over 7,000 amnesty applications.
	   The period leading up to 1994's first democratic elections,
while political groups were trying to negotiate an end to white
minority rule, saw a dramatic escalation in violence.
	   Much of it centered in KwaZulu-Natal, where over 5,000 people
died in clashes between Inkatha Freedom Party Zulu nationalists and
the Self Defense Units.
	   The Zulu groups, called Self Protection Units (SPUs), were
backed by the apartheid government, according to the Truth
Commission's report.
	   Radebe was ANC chairman for the KwaZulu-Natal region and also
served as an underground commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of
the Nation), the ANC's armed wing.
	   He acted under direct orders of the armed wing's military
intelligence, Radebe states in his application.
	   Monday's hearing will also consider applications from other high
ranking ANC officials, including a former ANC member of Parliament
and a current captain in the South African National Defense Force
	   The conflict between the ANC and Inkatha spilled over into
Johannesburg's urban areas, 300 kilometers (180 miles) north west
of KwaZulu-Natal. A second amnesty committee will start hearing
applications in Johannesburg on that conflict, also starting
Monday.
	   In the past ten years, over 10,000 people have died in the
Kwa-Zulu clashes that continue to boil over four years after the
elections.

Edmonton beats Stanford for 2001 world champs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPATES with more IAAF comments

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The Canadian city of Edmonton beat
Stanford on Thursday for the right to stage the 2001 World
Championships, taking track and field's showcase event to North
America for the first time.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Edmonton,
capital of the province of Alberta, received ``massive consensus''
in the secret ballot by the IAAF Council.
	   Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released, but an IAAF source
said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. Two Council members were absent
and a third apparently abstained.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   It was Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997
and 1999 championships.
	   Edmonton trumped Stanford by lining up government financial
support and guarantees, promising to pay for the travel costs and
accomodation for athletes and officials, and presenting a lucrative
Canadian TV deal with the IAAF.
	   ``The financial issue was very important,'' IAAF spokesman
Giorgio Reineri said. ``I think that convinced a lot of people to
vote for Edmonton.''
	   Edmonton also impressed the IAAF by bringing a 27-member
delegation that included Albert Premier Ralph Klein and Canadian
Justice Minister Anne McLellan.
	   ``They gave an impression of being so enthusiastic to host the
world championships,'' Reineri said. ``But they also had facts to
back up their words.''
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating
Championships.
	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition of organizing sports
events and we are delighted to have a commitment to host what we
feel will be the greatest ever world championships.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great
majority'' for Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentaion which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations
from Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show.
	   ``We presented third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund
said. ``We left the room thinking we would probably have a half an
hour wait. Within about four or five minutes, they called us back
in to announce that Edmonton had won the bid. Apparently it was
almost a unanimous decision.
	   ``From a track and field perspective for Canada, it's a
tremendous boost to our sport.''
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be covered for athletes and officials.
	   Reineri said this was an important selling point for the IAAF,
which in the past has paid for athletes within the quotas set for
each country.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.
	   The result was another blow to track and field in the United
States.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and
television coverage.
	   Paris, meanwhile, used its bid as a trial-run for a more serious
run at the 2003 championships. London is also planning a bid for
2003, with a renovated Wembley Stadium as the proposed venue.

Hundreds line up to interview for jobs with the federal government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hundreds of people waited in line and
caused a traffic jam in center of the city of Ponce Friday in hopes
of interviewing for a job with the federal government.
	   Police estimated that more than 600 people attended the Job Fair
sponsored by the FBI. The line stretched outside, down one block
and around the corner.
	   FBI press spokeswoman Sara Lema said 10 federal agencies were
participating in the job fair.
	   Many of those waiting in line said they hoped to increase their
salaries by getting a job with the federal government, which pays
better salaries than most local government agencies and private
employers in Puerto Rico.
	   Oscar Velazquez, a probation officer, said he makes a little
more than dlrs 15,000 a year now, while many of the federal jobs
pay dlrs 40,000 a year or more.
	   In addition to the job-seekers, the fair also drew half a dozen
protesters who are members of pro-independence groups who want the
federal government to leave the island.

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from UNSCOM deputy director,
other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqis worked
together to avoid the media Thursday, showing new cooperation
between two parties whose stormy relations nearly triggered a
military strike.
	   On the second day of their field work since their return to
Iraq, the weapons inspectors and their Iraqi escorts appeared happy
with the new arrangement.
	   ``We like it this way,'' said an Iraqi escort waiting for the
inspectors in a car outside the U.N. compound.
	   The inspectors returned Tuesday to Baghdad and began their field
trips Wednesday after being blocked from working under Iraqi
government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened airstrikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   The U.N. inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction before sanctions, levied after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted. Iraq insists it already has
destroyed all its most dangerous weapons.
	   On Thursday, instead of entering the U.N. compound and shaking
hands with inspectors in front of TV cameras to start the day, one
Iraqi escort hastily waved from outside the compound's
three-meter-high (10-foot-high) fence.
	   Immediately afterward, two U.N. vehicles each with three
monitors sped past television camera crews and disappeared onto a
congested highway.
	   The teamwork was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups, when several planned inspections had to be canceled because
Iraq refused to send escorts required under U.N.-Iraqi agreements.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Charles Duelfer, deputy
director of the U.N. Special Commission, said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``We're trying to keep the temperature
down as much as possible.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency _ quoting Gen. Hussam Mohammed
Amin, director of the National Monitoring Authority that provides
government escorts for the U.N. inspectors _ said that at least
seven monitoring teams went out Wednesday.
	   Three teams went to nuclear sites, two to missile sites and one
each to chemical and biological sites, INA said.
	   ``The Iraqi side provided all cooperation for the teams,'' it
added.
	   It's not clear if the new teamwork by weapons inspectors and
their escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of
their surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   Duelfer said that the inspectors were still waiting for
documents that Chief inspector Richard Butler had requested.
	   ``One of the best ways Iraq can prove its cooperation with the
Special Commission is by providing the documents demanded by the
Special Commission,'' Duefler said.
	   Butler on Wednesday sent a formal request to Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, asking for documents that Iraq previously
refused to hand over.
	   One is an Iraqi air force account of chemical munitions used in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   In a Wednesday speech in Philadelphia, Butler accused Aziz of
lying. He said he had written Aziz asking to see a copy of the
document.
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth,'' Butler said.
	   Iraq, which has accused Butler of working on behalf of the
Americans, has over the past months called for his resignation.

Russia, Vietnam sign oil refinery deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Vietnamese state-run oil companies
signed a contract Thursday to build the first oil refinery in
Vietnam, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia's Zarubezhneft and Vietnam's Petrovietnam agreed in May
that Russian companies will be used as contractors to build part of
the refinery, the report said.
	   The contract was signed in Hanoi.
	   Overall capital investments in the project are estimated at dlrs
1.3 billion. The first stage of the refinery is scheduled to start
operating by 2001. The refinery will eventually handle 6.5 million
tons (1.88 billion gallons) of crude annually, ITAR-Tass said.

Rose improves but has little chance of making cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Justin Rose improved to a 1-over 73 at
Sotogrande Thursday but the amateur star of this year's British
Open still has more than 50 places to make up if he is to stand any
chance of winning his pro card on the PGA European Tour.
	   After his opening round 78, the 18-year-old Englishman is tied
in 131st place on a two-round total of 151 and is a long way off
making Saturday's four-round cut of 75 players.
	   Two more rounds of play Sunday and Monday will then decide the
35 players who win their cards.
	   Turning pro after his fourth-place finish at the Open at Royal
Birkdale, Rose failed to make the cut in eight pro tournaments and
wound up failing to win a single penny in prize money.
	   While Rose showed some improvement Thursday, Scotland's Ross
Drummond and Henrik Nystrom of Sweden led the field on a 7-under
total of 137.
	   Drummond carded a 67 and Nystrom, co-leader overnight after a
66, returned a 71.

Security forces raid ex-rebels in Khartoum, two people wounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese security forces and former
rebels had a shootout Thursday in Sudan's capital, wounding at
least two people, witnesses said.
	   The firefight took place when security forces raided the South
Sudan Coordination Council in central Khartoum. The council is made
up of representatives of several southern rebel factions who
defected to the government and signed a peace agreement in April
1997.
	   Police cordoned off the area during the 1 1/2-hour raid in
Khartoum. Ambulances rushed to the scene and witnesses said they
saw two wounded persons. It is not known whether they were faction
members, security force personnel or civilians.
	   The men who opened fire were thought to be followers of the
council's head, Riak Machar, a former commander of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army who was visiting the Upper Nile province
of southern Sudan on Thursday.
	   The governor of Khartoum province said earlier this week he
planned to end the presence of armed groups in the capital.
	   Three men were killed earlier this year in faction fighting
among the former rebels in Khartoum.
	   Several splinter groups have broken away from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting since 1983 for autonomy
for the Christian and animist south of the country from the
Muslim-dominated north.
	   The war and attendant famines have left more than 1.5 million
people dead.

Two people injured in bomb explosion in Karachi

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb planted in a motorcycle exploded
Thursday in Pakistan's restive port city, Karachi, injuring two
people.
	   The explosion occurred in the eastern Sohrab Goth area an hour
after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif left the neighborhood where he
laid the foundation stone for the construction of a new motorway.
	   The motorcycle was parked near a bridge about a kilometer (less
than a mile) from the site of the ceremony, Farooq Ameen Qureshi,
the chief of the Karachi police said. Sharif was safely back at the
state guest house by then, he added.
	   The two injured persons are the key suspects in the explosion,
he said.
	   Sharif last month dismissed the government of Sindh province _
of which Karachi is the capital _ and imposed a federal rule.
	   The government is trying to quell violence in Karachi, where
more than 1,000 people have died in a bloody conflict between rival
factions of an ethnic party.
	   Sharif has accused the ethnic-based Mohajir Qami Movement of
being involved in the violence which has paralyzed the economic
activity in Karachi _ the country's main financial and commercial
center.
	   Hundreds of MQM activists were arrested in a crackdown by the
security forces over the last two weeks.
	   The Movement, which represents the Urdu-speaking Muslims who
migrated from India after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947
and their descendants, politically controls the city.

 &UR; Serb leader accuses ethnic Albanians of stalling peace process &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks without international mediation.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic visited Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, on Thursday, the day after the Serbian president
attempted to meet directly with leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   The successive trips to Kosovo were an attempt to assert
Serbia's authority over the southern province, despite continued
Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful solution. Hundreds have
been killed and about a quarter of a million people in Kosovo left
homeless since Serbs cracked down on separatist ethnic Albanian
rebels in February.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks called
by Serb President Milan Milutinovic, saying a basic agreement on
the future of the province must come first _ With international
mediation.
	   In Belgrade on Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier
Vojislav Seselj accused the United States of backing the ethnic
Albanian boycott. He said U.S. mediator Christopher Hill can only
be a guest at any negotiations.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro. Milutinovic
instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its own authorities and
police, but under Serb rule.
	   Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring
soldiers and police officers who participated in the crackdown,
Marjanovic blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace.
	   He accused the ethnic Albanians of ``causing great damage to
everybody, including a big majority of Albanians who want to live
and work in Kosovo with the others'' by boycotting the talks and
said Serbia's top priority was to ``preserve peace and freedom,
territorial integrity and sovereignty.''
	   Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said a
49-year-old doctor was killed and his daughter wounded when three
masked assailants broke into their home in Pec, some 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Pristina.
	   In Belgrade, the French ambassador to Macedonia Jacques
Huntzinger, met Milutinovic on Thursday in an attempt to soften
Yugoslavia's resistance to a well-armed NATO force to be based in
neighboring Macedonia.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow 2,000
civilian verifiers into Kosovo. The NATO troops are meant to come
to the aid of the unarmed observers, should they be menaced.
	   But officials from Yugoslavia and its dominant republic Serbia
say the troops threaten their territory. Huntzinger told reporters
that high on the agenda in his talks was resistance to the NATO
deployments.
	   The French diplomat planned to return to Skopje, Macedonia,
Thursday and travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina Saturday to meet
ethnic Albanian leaders.

Edmonton beats Stanford for 2001 world champs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPATES with reaction from Stanford delegation

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The Canadian city of Edmonton beat
Stanford on Thursday for the right to stage the 2001 World
Championships, taking track and field's showcase event to North
America for the first time.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Edmonton,
capital of the province of Alberta, received ``massive consensus''
in the secret ballot by the IAAF Council.
	   Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released, but an IAAF source
said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. Two Council members were absent
and a third apparently abstained.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating
Championships.
	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition
of organizing sports events and we are delighted to have a
commitment to host what we feel will be the greatest ever world
championships.''
	   It was Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997
and 1999 championships.
	   The result was another blow to track and field in the United
States.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and
television coverage.
	   Edmonton trumped Stanford by lining up government financial
support and guarantees, promising to pay for the travel costs and
accomodation for athletes and officials, and presenting a lucrative
Canadian TV deal with the IAAF.
	   ``The financial issue was very important,'' IAAF spokesman
Giorgio Reineri said. ``I think that convinced a lot of people to
vote for Edmonton.''
	   Stanford couldn't match Edmonton's financial guarantees.
	   ``One of the challenges is American cities being asked to, in a
sense, guarantee the whole event), and that is certainly not done
in the United States,'' said Dan Fenton, chief operating officer of
the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau.
	   He said Stanford instead offered a novel deal under which an
insurance company would guarantee revenue. The Americans also
offered to offset transportation costs but ``not to the extent''
Edmonton did, Fenton said.
	   ``Edmonton was both creative and enthusiastic in their bid and
benefitted from more than dlrs 80 million in government supports,''
said Craig Masback, head of USA Track and Field. ``We remain
committed to bringing major international events to the United
States and I am confident that we will one day host the world
championships.
	   ``I think it was a very fair process. I know the IAAF realized
that from a sponsorship standpoint the potential of our bid was
superior to the Edmonton bid. But there were many other factors
that were part of the decision.''
	   Edmonton impressed the IAAF by bringing a 27-member delegation
that included Klein and Canadian Justice Minister Anne McLellan.
	   ``They gave an impression of being so enthusiastic to host the
world championships,'' Reineri said. ``But they also had facts to
back up their words.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great
majority'' for Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentation which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations
from Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show.
	   ``We presented third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund
said. ``We left the room thinking we would probably have a half an
hour wait. Within about four or five minutes, they called us back
in to announce that Edmonton had won the bid. Apparently it was
almost a unanimous decision.''
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be covered for athletes and officials.
	   Reineri said this was an important selling point for the IAAF,
which in the past has paid for athletes within the quotas set for
each country.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.
	   Paris, meanwhile, used its bid as a trial-run for a more serious
run at the 2003 championships. London is also planning a bid for
2003, with a renovated Wembley Stadium as the proposed venue.

Former Dinamo chief to surrender in embezzlement case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Military prosecutors have issued an
arrest warrant for the former chairman of Bucharest's Dinamo soccer
club, who is accused of embezzling dlrs 2 million from the team's
coffers.
	   Vasile Ianul acknowledged Thursday he had taken the money, but
said he gave it to the club's players and didn't pocket anything
for himself.
	   ``I am no more Dalmatian (blemished) than others in the club.
The money .... was given to the soccer players,'' he told daily
Libertatea.
	   Ianul said he'll voluntarily surrender to police custody on
Friday.
	   Ianul ran Dinamo between 1990 and 1993, during which time he
personally sold the contracts of 30 Dinamo players to foreign teams
which brought the club millions of dollars.
	   Those transferred included Ionut Lupescu to Germany's Bayer
Leverkusen, Dorinel Munteanu to FC Colognue, Tibor Selymes to
Anderlecht, and Mircea Rednic to Standard Liege.
	   Ianul is now chairman of Politehnica Iasi, northeast Romania.
	   In 1997, prosecutors charged Ianul with embezzling dlrs 2
million. They decided to issue the arrest warrant because Ianul's
trial was delayed for one year, allegedly because he was ill with
pneumonia.
	   Dinamo is in second place in the Romanian first division. The
club belongs to the Interior Ministry, which is why military
prosecutors are involved.
	   It was the second time members of the club allegedly have been
involved in financial wrongdoings in the past year.
	   Last month, Dinamo's chairman Petre Buduru resigned after
allegations that he was involved in a huge cigarette smuggling
case.

Clinton urges Japan to move aggressively toward economic revival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material, will be topped with 0100GMT Friday
speech to business leaders &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ President Bill Clinton told recession-weary Japan
to ``not be discouraged'' by hard times but seek recovery by
opening markets to American-made goods and moving with an
aggressive revival program.
	   ``If Japan is very strong, that brings back Asia,'' Clinton
declared Thursday at the opening of a five-day visit to Asia.
	   Far from impeachment hearings at home, Clinton was surprised at
a town hall meeting by a question of how he had apologized to his
wife and daughter about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``I did it in a direct and straightforward manner,'' Clinton
told a questioning housewife who said she could never forgive an
unfaithful husband. Clinton said he believed his family forgave him
but added, ``That's really a question you could ask them better
than me.'' He appeared uncomfortable and clenched his jaw.
	   Breaking the awkward moment, the town hall moderator said,
``Let's change the topic now'' and the affair was not mentioned
again. The primary topic was the economic turmoil that has spread
gloom and political turmoil across Asia.
	   Clinton offered Japan both encouragement and criticism and said
its problem's ``won't be solved overnight.''
	   ``Don't be discouraged but do be determined,'' the president
said, red-eyed and jet-lagged after a 19-hour flight. ``That would
be the advice of a friend.'' His first stop in Tokyo was a private
visit with Emperor Akihito at his Imperial Palace residence, where
Clinton lingered over a second cup of tea.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, in a toast to Clinton at Akasaka
Palace, said U.S. friendship and cooperation would be ``a tailwind
for our efforts'' in meeting Japan's challenges. Clinton commended
him for making ``difficult decisions'' to repair the economy.
	   The president arrived here about 10 hours before the House
Judiciary Committee opened its impeachment hearings in Washington.
	   The televised town-hall program was beamed across Japan by Tokyo
Broadcasting Systems from a studio with about 100 guests. Another
30 guests participated from a studio in Osaka, and nearly 4,000
e-mails and faxes were received with questions for the president.
	   When a welfare worker asked how he coped with the pressure of
being president, Clinton said, ``Sometimes you want to get away
from it. But I think the important thing is not to be overwhelmed
by the work.''
	   Tokyo was the first stop on an Iraq-delayed trip to Japan, South
Korea and Guam. Clinton is to address American and Japanese
business leaders Friday before flying to Seoul for a three-day
visit focusing on concerns about North Korea's nuclear program.
	   Relations between Washington and Tokyo have been strained by
economic and trade differences, as well as concern that Washington
is beginning to favor China over its longtime ally Japan.
	   Clinton urged the Japanese people to be patient as their
government tries to pull the economy out of its worst recession
since World War II.
	   But he also raised U.S. concerns, noting that Japan's exports of
hot-rolled steel to America have jumped 500 percent in a year and
the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan and China ``has gone way
up.''
	   Obuchi and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party have unveiled a
dlrs 195 billion package of spending and tax cuts to spur the
economy and have proposed a plan to pump tax money into Japan's
heavily indebted banks.

New Confederations Cup schedule upsets French, Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS dates of Copa America to June 29-Aug. 18 in 14th
graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moved from January to July and August to placate
the World Cup champion French, the Confederations Cup still is in
trouble.
	   The new calendar upsets the Americans, and the French still
don't know if they will play.
	   ``A competition cannot have these dates, it is a question of the
calendar,'' Noel Le Graet, president of the French National League
(LNF), was quoted Thursday in the French daily L'Equipe.
	   The French Football Federation's governing general council will
meet Friday to decide whether to accept the new dates proposed by
FIFA for the Confederations Cup.
	   FFF president Claude Simonet initially accepted the new dates,
but had asked for more time to consult with the French National
League.
	   A source at the FFF who requested anonymity said that there
remains a possibility that the federation will be unable to send a
team because the new dates clash with the start of the 1999-2000
French season.
	   After meetings earlier this week _ in which the participating
nations were consulted _ FIFA announced that the Confederations
Cup, an eight-team tournament that is to be comprised of the
continental champions, was being moved from Jan. 8-20 to July
28-Aug. 8.
	   Acknowleding it still had to be ratified by the Executive
Committee, FIFA announced that Simonet had committed Les Bleus to
play.
	   But only days later, Le Graet was exasperated, with the French
league schedule apparently set to begin July 28.
	   ``Mr. Simonet could not have looked at the calendar,'' Le Graet
said.
	   The French withdrew from the Confederations Cup, to be played in
Mexico, with its January schedule, saying it conflicted with the
European league season.
	   Simonet agreed to the new schedule, but has run into more
opposition.
	   ``The dates (for next year's French league) are still not set. I
am not going to get into a debate about this before bringing the
problem before the general council,'' Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games (July 23-Aug. 8), and causes
problems for Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia which will compete in the
Copa America, set for June 29-July 18.
	   ``To my knowledge there has been no official communication with
the French FA,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday. ``As we
said a couple of days ago, our president (Sepp Blatter) had met
with the French president.
	   ``Those dates were proposed for everybody. Clearly we wouldn't
have laid down those dates where anybody said they couldn't make
it. Everybody got the same approach, each was able to express their
opinion.''
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation was represented at the FIFA meetings,
but one of them was not MLS commissioner Doug Logan, whose league
season was interrupted in 1996 by the Olympics and this year by the
World Cup.
	   ``I'm extraordinarily disappointed. As everyone knows I was
hopeful we'd have uniterrupted season to see what we could do,''
Logan said. ``However, we will make best of it. We will
enthusiastically support the (U.S.) federation fielding a
competitive team to the Confederations Cup.
	   ``We will work closely with (U.S. coach) Bruce Arena...in making
sure that the team is well-prepared and represents our country, our
federation and our league at the higest level.
	   ``Our preference would have been to have this scheduled at
another time. We'll dance with the partner given us.''

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	   -0-
	   La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on the U.S-Iraq situation:
	   Once again, Saddam Hussein's subtle game has won, at least
partially.
	   After provoking the U.S. reaction with his refusal to allow U.N.
inspections, Saddam stepped back at the last minute. And President
Clinton was forced to suspend the ``Desert Thunder'' military
operation. ...
	   In explaining his decision, Clinton underlined Saddam's
unconditional surrender, but couldn't say that the United States
appeared to be alone after Iraq accepted to resume arms
inspections.
	   All the other members of the U.N. Security Council appeared
satisfied with Saddam's response, including the British, and the
attack would be no longer justified in front of global public
opinion.
	   The ``non-war'' has been yet another success for U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, who negotiated with Iraq up to the last minute.
	   But Saddam Hussein is, too, a partial winner: he gave in to
military threats, but also showed the whole world the problem of
tough economic sanctions, which starve the Iraqi people but leave
the regime intact.
	    &UR; ___
	   Neue Kronen Zeitung, Vienna, Austria, on Saddam Hussein:
	   ... Saddam Hussein is testing (the world's) patience. And one
has to wonder at the patience of his subjects. He has done so many
bad things to them, expects so much more from them and his regime
is so brutal. Yet, up to now, no rebellion against him has had the
smallest chance. And as pressure from the outside grows, Sadaam
finds it increasingly light to appeal to national feelings and to
ensure support from the masses.
	    &UR; ___
	   Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Japanese economy:
	   The Japanese government's latest economic program is being
regarded skeptically, above all in terms of its long-term effects.
	   Not least is the question of who will pay for the large-scale
plan to boost the economy.
	   For months the United States has led the criticism of Japan from
countries who are complaining it provided inadequate help in
overcoming the Asian crisis. ...
	   Just at the right moment, before Bill Clinton's arrival in Japan
on Thursday, Premier Keizo Obuchi has won an important argument in
the face of this sustained bombardment of criticism.
	   Tokyo has launched the biggest economic program in its history.
...
	   Whether this eighth program since the speculative bubble economy
burst at the beginning of the 90s will bring the hoped-for upturn,
or whether it will at least check the `cycle of recession,' as
Obuchi calls it, is another question entirely. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
visit to Russia last week:
	   A miracle was not on the agenda in freezing Moscow after all.
Yet Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's official visit to Russia, the
first in 25 years for a Japanese prime minister, holds the hope of
a future breakthrough in the question of the Northern Territories.
	   The Russians agreed to set up a committee to draw a new border
for the territories along with the committee for discussing joint
economic development of the islands. The agreement to create the
two committees is the biggest step _ on the long road toward
signing a peace treaty _ achieved in the first meeting between
Prime Minister Obuchi and President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Given the ailing president's declining leadership in Russian
politics and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's preoccupation with
Russia's economic crisis, it appears that the latest Russian reply
to the Japanese proposal was the most that Japan could hope for.
...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Australian, Sydney, Australia, on U.S. Vice President Al
Gore's speech at the APEC summit:
	   ... Al Gore has predictably upset the Malaysian government with
his reference to the ``brave people of Malaysia,'' supporting calls
for democracy and reform. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad
knew such a message was coming, ever since his former deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim, was arrested and put on trial on corruption and sodomy
charges. Dr. Mahatir has seen international support grow for Anwar.
	   Mr. Gore's remarks at a dinner on Monday drew a sharp rebuke
from Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who called them
unwarranted, provocative and abhorrent. Thus, this year's APEC
summit is taking on a human rights dimension that shifts the focus
from what many see as APEC's primary role: economic growth through
cooperation and enhanced trade and investment liberalization.
	   But while the Anwar affair and Japanese intransigence on
liberalizing its fish and forestry sectors seemed to put a further
dampener on APEC's economic usefulness, it is impossible to ignore
the recovery possibilities flowing from the proposed dlrs 10
billion Japan-U.S. initiative to help recapitalize Asian banks and
provide trade finance.

Italian premier says Italy won't bow to economic blackmail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with soccer diplomacy off, Turkish ambassador
reportedly threatens rupture of diplomatic relations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will not bow to ``economic blackmail,''
Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday, facing a Turkish boycott
aimed at forcing Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader jailed
in Rome.
	   The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to extradite Abdullah
Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year war for
Kurdish autonomy. Turkish businesses are now boycotting Italian
products and a mob on Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a
market.
	   And, according to the ANSA news agency, the Turkish ambassador
to Italy, Inal Batu, even threatened Thursday that Ankara would
break off diplomatic relations with Rome.
	   D'Alema stood firm.
	   ``Economic blackmail against Italy is inadmissible for the
simple reason that Italy adheres to Italian and international law
and the principles of modern civil law,'' D'Alema said at a Cabinet
meeting Thursday, according to ANSA.
	   Italian law forbids extraditing someone to a country where they
could face execution, as is the case with Ocalan.
	   Meanwhile, a chance for some soccer diplomacy crumbled. D'Alema
had said he'd attend a match between Italian champion Juventus of
Turin against Istanbul's Galatasaray in a Champions League game
next Wednesday.
	   But his Turkish counterpart, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, didn't
offer to meet him in Istanbul. ``If he wants to see me, let him
come to Ankara,'' Yilmaz said, according to Turkey's Anatolia news
agency.
	   D'Alema's office later issued a statement saying the premier
wouldn't be going to the game after all because Yilmaz ``couldn't''
meet him in Istanbul.
	   D'Alema has asked the European Union to back his efforts to
maintain friendly relations with Turkey while respecting Italian
law. But EU countries can't agree on whether Ocalan's Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, is a terrorist organization and have yet to
weigh in. The United States is pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan,
whom it considers a terrorist.
	   Ocalan, arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport after he stepped off
a flight from Moscow, has asked for political asylum. His lawyers
have asked that he be put under house arrest pending a decision on
extradition or asylum; a hearing on their petition is scheduled for
Friday.

Festina doubtful for major races, director says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Shorn of its better known riders, the
Festina team hasn't yet decided whether it will take part in all of
next year's major races, director Juan Fernandez said Thursday.
	   ``We want to begin at square one,'' said Fernandez, who took
over the team after it was expelled from this year's Tour de
France.
	   ``No decision has been taken yet'' on next year's races
Fernandez told a news conference in Bern. ``But it seems to me the
Tour of Italy may be too difficult for us.''
	   The team's participation in next year's Tour de France isn't yet
assured since its ranking may not be high enough to qualify
automatically.
	   Festina was expelled from this year's race after some of its
riders admitted taking performance enhancing drugs.
	   Three of its riders _ Switzerland's Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux
and Armin Meier _ were banned from all competition until May 1
after they admitted taking the performance-enhancing hormone EPO.
	   Last month, Festina cut its budget for next season by half and
said its contracts with all its riders were being renegotiated.
	   Zuelle and Dufaux left the team in October. Earlier this month
French rider Richard Virenque, who has denied knowingly using
banned substances, also parted company with Festina.
	   Festina says its new-look team will focus on the development of
young riders.

Strike settled at Club Med where staff held guests hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A strike at a Club Med resort
where workers held 373 guests hostage earlier this month has been
settled, union and resort officials said Wednesday.
	   The agreement provides raises of 3.5 percent now and an
additional 1 percent in December, 1999. The union, which represents
nearly 300 workers, had sought 8 percent raises.
	   The resort closed after employees blocked entrances and refused
to let guests leave on Nov. 7 to protest a breakdown in contract
negotiations. Police raided the resort and freed the guests.
	   The resort will reopen Dec. 4, said manager Nicolas Japy.

Singer Paul Simon agrees to testify at South African Boesak trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ American singer Paul Simon has
agreed to testify in the fraud trial against anti-apartheid
activist Allan Boesak _ as long as he can do it via telephone or
video from New York City.
	   Simon, who donated 600,000 rand (dlrs 180,000 at the time) to
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice Charity, was responding
to a request from the prosecutor's office, SABC-TV reported on
Thursday.
	   In a letter read before the court on Thursday, Simon cited his
heavy work schedule as preventing him from traveling to South
Africa in person.
	   Earlier this week, a major witness recanted allegations of
financial wrongdoing against Boesak, delivering a serious blow to
the prosecution's case.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, a bookkeeper at the Foundation for Peace and
Justice charity _ now defunct _ told the court he had lied under
oath about alleged theft by Boesak of a million rand (dlrs 300,000
at the time).
	   Much of the money was from Simon, Scandinavian donors and the
Coca-Cola Foundation.
	   Steenkamp was sentenced last year to six years in prison for
fraud and theft, after pleading guilty to charges totalling nearly
a million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the time.)
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak, 52, has paid back some money and an investigation
by the President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress cleared
him of any criminal wrongdoing.

voted the athlete of the year Thursday by the Finnish sports
writers' association.
	   Hakkinen, this year's World champion, edged cross country skiing
Olympic winner Mika Myllyla. He received 62.5 percent of votes for

Tommi Makinen, who stands a chance to defend his title this year.
NHL ice hockey goal scoring ace Teemu Selanne was fifth, and
Finland's top soccer player, Jari Litmanen of Ajax Amsterdam sixth.
	   Also in the top ten were Samppa Lajunen (Olympic double silver
medalist in Nordic combined skiing), Valentin Kononen (European
champion in the 50K walk), Finland's icehockey team which won a
bronze at the Olympics in Nagano and a silver at the Worlds' in
Switzerland, and Soviet-born Eduard Hamalainen, who was runnerup in

<TEXT>
	   Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, Sweden, on global-warming summit in
Buenos Aires:
	   The environmental meeting in Buenos Aires is not likely to go
down in history as one of the more successful gatherings. Only at
the last moment did they succeed in uniting around a plan for how
they will get to the point of legally binding agreements. Against
the background of the strong hopefulness that at one time
surrounded the U.N.'s climate conference it can be easy to feel
gloomy about the relatively feeble results that have been reached
so far. Complaints are also heard about how the environmental
meeting was more of an economics and business affair than a climate
discussion.
	   There is reason for disappointment. But not for black-as-night
pessimism. The discussion had much to do with how the trade and
taxation of so-called emissions rights will be handled. That is not
an easy question.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Buenos Aires Herald, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the IMF's
rescue package for Brazil:
	   Brazil and the International Monetary Fund hammered out an
agreement to provide over 41 billion dollars in aid to stabilize
this region's largest economy.
	   But Brazil is not out of the woods yet.
	   Firstly, delivery of the funds will depend on Brazil's
fulfillment of economic reform pledges and all too many of these
measures will have to pass through Congress _ a long and precarious
process.
	   Secondly, Brazil's austerity plan quite possibly misreads the
problem, which is not so much the size of the budget, or even the
debt, as the astronomic interest rates and tax evasion which
deprive Brazil of any serious revenue base.
	   The biggest point in Brazil's favour remains Friday's package -
both because it may stabilize expectations sufficiently to bring
down interest rates and because it shows that the U.S. cannot
afford to let the biggest country in its Latin American backyard go
down the drain.
	   Thus while there have been signs of recovery and even euphoria
on some financial markets, the overall evidence is that there are
no grounds for any premature optimism which might produce a new
bubble to burst.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Iraq:
	   The entire world, and particularly the Arab countries, breathed
a collective sigh of relief after the announcement by U.S.
President Bill Clinton that American and British strikes against
Iraq would not be carried out following Iraq's decision to resume
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The U.S. and Britain will continue their wait, fingers on the
trigger, for the next time Iraq decides to interrupt the work of
the UNSCOM team.
	   In addition to making no mention of a timetable or schedule for
lifting the sanctions, at least partially, Clinton in his speech
also offered the clearest indication yet that the American
administration is intent on toppling Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The sanctions have been tied to disarming Iraq, not a political
change in the country. Introducing this plan into the equation at
this point is grossly unfair to the Iraqi people.
	   Although this crisis is over, the difficult part remains:
getting the sanctions lifted. To do this, Iraq has no choice but to
cooperate fully with the UNSCOM staff. And the U.S. and Britain
should not change the nature of the inspections by introducing this
new political dimension.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Monde, Paris, on Kurdish rights:
	   The arrest of Abdullah Ocalan in Rome propels the Kurdish
question to the heart of Europe in a spectacular fashion. In 15
years of hidden war, 30,000 people have died in Anatolia (and) 2
million Kurds have been chased from their villages ....
	   ``The Kurdish question is a European question. Not only because
a million Kurds from Turkey live in Europe and because thousands of
refugees continue to come here, but above all because peace and
stability in the Middle East, issues in which the European Union
intends to play a role, can never be assured without the
recognition of the national rights of the Kurdish people.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Bradenton Herald, Bradenton, Florida, on United States and
Iraq:
	   Of course, President Clinton had no choice in calling off
American air strikes once Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
surrendered in his latest test of will over United Nations
inspection of his weapons of mass destruction. To have proceeded
with strikes after such a capitulation would have risked turning
all of Iraq's Arab neighbors and our other allies against the
United States once again. ...
	   We hope that this time, Clinton won't withdraw U.S. air and
naval forces from the Persian Gulf because of a piece of paper with
Saddam's signature on it. ... At the very first sign of
non-cooperation, take out a few military targets. Such an instant
reaction will show Saddam our threats are backed with intent. ...
	   We agree with Sens. Arlen Specter and John McCain that getting
rid of Saddam should be our ultimate goal. But how to do it? Better
intelligence would be a start. That's what we pay the CIA for. ...
	   The inspection cat-and-mouse game has dragged on far too long.
... Every delay since 1991 has bought him more time to develop and
stockpile his chemical and biological weapons. The current one has
lasted 102 days. That's a long time for a madman to perfect his
genocidal game plan.

Congolese rebels capture key northern town ahead of talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ On the eve of another round of Congolese
peace talks, the rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila
said Thursday they had overrun the last government stronghold in
northern Congo.
	   Arthur Ngoma, a rebel leader, said his forces had taken the
Congo River port of Bumba, 800 kilometers (500 miles) northwest of
Goma, the eastern rebel stronghold, and opened route to western
Congo.
	   Bumba fell on Monday, Ngoma said. There was no independent
confirmation.
	   The rebels claim they now control 45 percent of Africa's third
largest nation. In southern Congo, Ngoma said the rebel forces
backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda were consolidating their
gains and advancing on the diamond city of Mbuji-Mayi and
Lubumbashi, capital of copper-rich Katanga Province.
	   Kabila has refused to talk with the rebels since they took up
arms Aug. 2. He is instead insisting that Rwanda and Uganda first
withdraw their support for the insurgents and leave Congo.
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common
border from the rebels, and say they will stay as long as Congo
remains a threat to their security.
	   Kabila has the support of Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
Despite repeated attempts to launch a counteroffensive, the
government and its allies have failed to stop the rebels.
	   ``This is an internal conflict, not an interstate affair,''
Ngoma said. ``We want to negotiate a truce with Kabila and go on to
political negotiations with him.''
	   On Friday, rebel chief Ernest Wamba dia Wamba will hold talks
with negotiatiators from the Southern African Development
Community, Organization of African Unity and the United Nations in
the Botswana capital of Gaborone.
	   The Congolese government said it will not participate.
	   All previous attempts to secure a cease-fire, a withdrawal of
foreign forces and negotiations between Congolese combatans have
failed.
	   The rebel victory at Bumba opens the way to Mbandaka, capital of
Equatoria Province and home of former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,
who was ousted by Kabila in May 1997 in what was then Zaire.
	   The rebels claim the support of Mobutu's former Zairian Armed
Forces, many of whom are from Equatoria and who accuse Kabila of
negligence and promoting his own ethnic kin in the poorly paid
army.

 &UR; Fearing 2000 computer glitch, Danish state bank saves old currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Since Danes tend to hoard when they
get nervous, the state bank Thursday slowed destruction of old bank
notes to make sure it has enough cash on hand in case depositors
panic over the so-called millennium bug.
	   Many fear that the turn of the year 2000 will leave computers,
including those use by banks, crippled because older programs might
crash when the year turns from '99 to '00. Some computers might not
recognize the year 2000, or interpret '00 to mean the year 1900.
	   While the state Central Bank said there was no evidence that
Danes had begun hoarding bank notes, it was taking no chances.
	   ``We want people to know that that we have enough notes so there
is no reason to start hoarding,'' Bjarne Skafte of the central
Nationalbanken told The Associated Press.
	   The bank plans to stockpile an extra 20 billion kroner (dlrs 3.2
billion) in cash by 2000 simply by slowing down the rate at which
it shred olds currency notes.
	   Earlier this year, word of an impending strike by bank workers
had Danes hoarding gasoline, food and other products. Usually
placid Danes were actually getting into scuffles when supplies
began to dwindle.
	   Henrik Theil, of the Danish Bankers' Association, said the
thought of Danes hoarding cash and products on the even of the new
millennium was not a pleasant one.
	   ``We would like to avoid (again) see grownup Danes fight over (a
package of) yeast in supermarkets,'' Theil said.

Germans against easing import restrictions on British beef
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The government will not back a proposal by
the EU Commission to ease restrictions on the import of British
beef and will ask that the plan be dropped when EU agriculture
ministers meet in Brussels later this month, Health Minister Andrea
Fischer told parliament Thursday.
	   Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, in British beef and a fatal brain
ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fischer's announcement was also backed by some opposition
conservatives in parliament,
	   Heinrich-Wilhelm Ronsoehr, the agriculture spokesman for the
conservatives said that lifting of the export ban would have
serious consequences for the German beef industry because nervous
consumers would again react by declining to buy beef as they did
prior to the ban more than two years ago.
	   Opposition by veterinary officials from five of the 15 EU
nations, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Austria have thus far
opposed the plan to allow the export of beef from British cattle
born after Aug. 1, 1996.
	   EU agriculture ministers are now expected to make a decision on
the plan when they meet in Brussels on Nov. 23-24, with a simple
majority sufficing.

Cuban church says government approves 40 more religious workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba's Roman Catholic Church has won
government permission to bring in 19 priests and 21 other religious
workers _ the first such authorization since the January visit of
Pope John Paul II, the church announced Thursday.
	   Church spokesman Orlando Marquez said by telephone that the
church expects the arrival of ``a few dozen more'' to be arranged
shortly.
	   With the new priests _ five of whom fill existing positions _
Cuba will have just over 300 priests. The country had about twice
as many in 1961, before the government embraced communism and began
discouraging religious worship.
	   Government-church relations have improved markedly in recent
years. Even the Communist Party has dropped its ban on religious
believers as members.
	   The Roman Catholic church remains Cuba's largest religious
organization by far, although Protestant leaders claim that weekly
attendance at their churches roughly equals that as Catholic
services.

New Slovak leaders cite rights, integration as top priorities

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from U.S. official welcoming new
government. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Determined to reverse Slovakia's
course, the new government pledged Thursday to make human and
minority rights top priorities and push harder for membership in
NATO and the European Union.
	   Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda outlined his vision for Slovakia
in a nearly two-hour speech to Parliament in which he presented his
Cabinet's program for the next four years.
	   ``We intend to make Slovakia a stable country,'' Dzurinda said.
``The new government is prepared to make a great change in public
life.''
	   Parliament, which is dominated by Dzurinda's coalition, is
expected to adopt the program after debating it next Wednesday.
	   Under the previous government, led by the authoritarian Vladimir
Meciar, Slovakia grew isolated from the West and was criticized for
anti-democratic practices. It was left behind as NATO welcomed
three neighboring nations _ the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
_ into NATO, and was not considered a strong candidate for EU
expansion.
	   Dzurinda promises to try to change all that. His government took
power Oct. 30 after assembling a majority coalition from opposition
groups that finished just behind Meciar's ruling party in September
parliamentary elections.
	   Moving Slovakia towards NATO featured in talks Thursday when
Dzurinda met Marc Grossman, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
European and Canadian affairs.
	   ``The first (new members) shall not be last,'' Grossman told
reporters at a news briefing, reflecting the U.S. attitude that the
Alliance should continue to expand.
	   Grossman said U.S. officials welcomed the new Slovak government.
He also brought up economic cooperation and mutual relations
between the two countries.

<TEXT>
	   The Advocate, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on striking Iraq:
	   If Americans are tired of dealing with Saddam Hussein, think of
the poor people of Iraq. ...
	   Subsequent defiance of United Nations resolutions has resulted
in long-standing economic sanctions, which have done regrettably
little to destabilize Saddam Hussein, but which have done
regrettably more damage to the society he terrorizes. ...
	   We cannot expect that a renewed air offensive against Iraq will
do the trick and rid us of this troublesome dictator. Nevertheless,
President Clinton and numerous leaders of the United Nations _
including, significantly, many Arab countries _ have clearly made
the case that force will be used to compel Iraq's compliance with
United Nations resolutions arising from the Persian Gulf War.
	   America's armed forces are up to the challenge of dishing it out
to Iraq, but we hope that the Clinton administration and the United
Nations stay the course and do not allow Saddam Hussein off the mat
after a few rounds of cruise missiles. His capacity to make
trouble, for U.S. allies and other countries in the region, should
be significantly degraded before the pressure lets up.
	    &UR; ___
	   Tulsa World, Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saddam Hussein:
	   Saddam Hussein's attempt to drive a wedge between factions of
the U.N. Security Council and the United States has failed
miserably. Even those Arab countries that had been sympathetic to
the plight of the Iraqi people rallied behind the United States.
Isolated and outgunned, Saddam backed off at the last minute and
agreed to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their search for
weapons of mass destruction.
	   He has tried this ruse before, with some success. Russia and
France _ both members of the Security Council and both eager for
lucrative oil contracts with Iraq when sanctions are lifted _ have
in recent months supported an easing of the sanctions. Saddam's
Arab neighbors had criticized the United States and asked that
sanctions be eased.
	   In August _ the last time Saddam denied surprise inspections by
the U.N. team _ President Clinton was too passive. Saddam sensed
this and became bolder.
	   This time, however, Clinton showed a strong willingness to back
up his talk with force. As U.S. warplanes and ships moved into
position Saturday morning, Saddam blinked. He sent a series of
letters to the United Nations, finally granting unfettered access
to all sites by U.N. inspectors.
	   There is little doubt that Saddam will play this expensive and
dangerous game again. But this must be the last warning. The United
States must make it clear to the Security Council and the Arab
nations that further resistance by Iraq will be met with swift and
powerful military action _ not in days or weeks, but within hours.
...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Seattle Times, on alternative medicine:
	   For thousands of years, alternative-medicine practitioners
operated on the fringe of society. The Western health establishment
has scoffed at techniques involving herbs, plants, insects and
animal parts as junk science.
	   Traditionalists should always maintain a healthy skepticism of
the untried, but progress requires an open mind. Recently, the
fuddy-duddies at the venerable Journal of the American Medical
Association took a huge step in helping doctors separate the
scientifically tested wheat from the anecdotal chaff.
	   In an unprecedented special issue, JAMA published the results of
a half-dozen, rigorous studies on popular alternative therapies.
The medical association will disseminate a total of 80 reports on
alternative medicine in prestigious journals. The six highlighted
studies in JAMA used the gold standard of research design _
randomized clinical trials _ to test the effectiveness of such
treatments as acupuncture, chiropractic and yoga. ...
	   This is a welcome development in a time when cures and potions
are validated by anecdote or celebrity endorsement. ...
	   It's easy for consumers to mistake fervent belief for proof.
It's also easy for mainstream medical professionals to arrogantly
dismiss the entire phenomenon. ...

Thirty-nine nations allocate dlrs 20 billion to poor countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Thirty-nine countries have agreed on
donating dlrs 20 billion to a fund that provides financing to the
world's poorest countries, the World Bank said Thursday.
	   ``Despite the global financial crisis, the agreement shows
support to the poorest countries in the world is on the rebound,''
said Sven Sandstroem of the World Bank's International Development
Association (IDA).
	   Sandstroem told reporters that a large share of the credits
would be used in the social and health sectors, and for educational
matters. He added the funds to be allocated over a three-year
period presently were not earmarked to any programs.
	   Credits by IDA _ a World Bank affiliate established in 1960 to
provide assistance to poorer developing countries _ are only made
to governments.
	   The 80 countries eligible for funding from IDA represent 3.3
billion people or 80 percent of the population of the developing
countries.
	   Donor countries include most of Europe, North and South American
nations, African and Arab coutries, South Korea, Australia and New
Zealand.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ After nearly two years of U.S. prodding
and bitter disputes with the Palestinians, the government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reluctantly gave the final go-ahead
Thursday to withdrawing troops from a chunk of the West Bank.
	   The decision was narrowly approved 7-5, with three abstentions,
after acrimonious debate. It marked a point of no return for
Netanyahu who since taking office in May 1996 had zig-zagged on the
peace process and now faces the loss of support of key allies.
	   In anticipation of winning full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority
staged a jubilant independence day parade in the farming town of
Jenin in the northern West Bank on Thursday. Most of the land to be
handed over _ an area about the size of Chicago _ is near Jenin.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   Two percent of the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44
square miles), are being transferred from sole Israeli control to
joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400
square kilometers (160 square miles), move from joint jurisdiction
to sole Palestinian control.
	   The Palestinians already have full control of 3 percent of the
West Bank and joint jurisdiction over another 24 percent.
	   Unlike earlier pullbacks, this one held little promise of drama.
	   No army bases are being dismantled and all Israeli and
Palestinian troops have to do is move yellow-and-black road markers
the size of washing machines to road junctions to demarcate the new
dividing lines.
	   On Thursday night, the cement blocks were still lined up behind
the barbed wire fence of the Israeli army base of Dotan, south of
Jenin. On Friday morning, Israeli and Palestinian officers were
expected to meet to finalize the transfer with a handshake.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were indifferent to the prospect of coming under
full Palestinian rule. No Arafat posters or Palestinian flags
decorated the streets in anticipation.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet just barely approved the first stage
of the Wye River peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank in three stages by the end of January, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers backed stage one, with
five voting against, three abstaining and two abroad. Surprisingly,
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who helped negotiate the accord at
Wye Plantation in Maryland last month, abstained Thursday, saying
he felt the Palestinians had not lived up to all their commitments.
	   ``It's an indication that anything involving the giving away
parts of the (biblical) Land of Israel is very difficult for this
government to do,'' said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two.
	   In an attempt to reassure Jewish settlers, Netanyahu on Thursday
visited the Yafit settlement in the West Bank's Jordan Valley.
Netanyahu declared that Israel would never relinquish the valley.
``It will always be part of the state of Israel,'' he said. ``There
is no uncertainty.''
	   However, according to Israeli media reports, parts of the valley
will be handed to partial Palestinian control in one of the next
pullbacks.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying 18 settlements that will
become increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment, but is still negotiating the
amount. Israel seeks dlrs 1.2 billion, but any money transfer would
require congressional approval. The aid poses a dilemma for the
United States because some of it might be used for settler bypass
roads and reinforcement of Jewish settlements _ in violation of
U.S. position that settlements harm peace prospects.
	   With the implementation of the peace accord finally under way,
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said he hoped Israel
and the Palestinians would develop ``the kind of relationship so
necessary to forge peace over the long term.''
	   The players themselves were more cautious. Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the testy relations could
improve somewhat. Bar-Illan said he expected ``more bumps along the
road.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ No bananas or English bon bons this time. The
verdict was in before the close of the day Thursday -- date of the
official uncorking of Beaujolais Nouveau: this year's vintage
tastes like wine.
	   The light, young thing that made its reputation on a marketing
gimmick developed three decades ago is still, apparently, holding
its own, in France and abroad.
	   Half of the 55 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau produced
were shipped to the Americas, Europe and all points east.
	   Getting there has been half the story of Beaujolais Nouveau,
often snickered at by serious wine lovers as a beverage, not a
``vin.''
	   This year's Beaujolais Nouveau has a stark red robe, a fruity
bouquet and tastes mainly of red fruits, although opinions differ
on whether blackberries, raspberries or even crushed raspberries
predominate.
	   Past vintages have been compared to bananas and English bon
bons.
	   The wine is made from young Gamay grapes picked less than two
months before bottling. It is shipped out by land, sea and air and
uncorked on the third Thursday of November, starting at midnight,
wherever one is.
	   Cases of Beaujolais Nouveau filled cargo space on British
Airways' 14 daily flights from Paris to London, according to the
airline.
	   ``We have been planning this operation since June to make sure
every single one of the 1.5 million bottles arrives in shops, wine
bars and restaurants today,'' said BA's World Cargo spokesman Paul
Giblin.
	   Orders of Beaujolais Nouveau at Finland's nationwide Alko stores
were up 30 percent this year, at 65,000 bottles. ``Its popularity
is definitely on the increase,'' said Per Monnberg, who orders wine
for Alko.
	   In Japan, where red wine is replacing cognac as the drink of
choice, television news showed shoppers snatching up bottles of
Beaujolais Nouveau.
	   Tokyo's Keio Plaza Hotel held a midnight wine-tasting and the
consensus, said hotel official Akikazu Nishizawa, was thumbs-up.
	   In Paris, the Savour Club of wine lovers was holding a Thursday
night party, complete with jazz band, at its digs in a Montparnasse
parking garage.
	   Such fun-loving gimmicks go to the heart of what Beaujolais
Nouveau is about, according to aficionados. ``It's a wine that
doesn't take itself seriously,'' commented oenologist Myulene Bru,
of Narbonne, on her Internet site.
	   But it's not all good news for Beaujolais Nouveau.
	   The Cafe St. Phillipe, off the Champs-Elysee, had sold only 18
bottles by the end of the afternoon Thursday, said cafe owner Rene
Bourel. ``It's not the same as 10 years ago. The mood is
different.''
	   ``In the past, people arrived here at 8 or 9 a.m. and tasted the
Beaujolais. Now,'' Borel said, ``they wait till noon.''
	   By 4 p.m., four men at the counter were drinking beer.

With economy slowing and deficit rising government remains

confident &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Faced with a slowing economy and
record public deficit, a top planning ministry official Thursday
defended the government's budget as ``realistic and even
conservative.''
	   The budget, which seeks to trim 8.7 billion reals (dlrs 7.3
billion) in 1999, is a key piece of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's fiscal austerity program put in place to qualify Brazil
for a dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package led by the International
Monetary Fund.
	   But many analysts worry the savings are based on reduced
interest rates, not yet in place, and overly optimistic growth
predictions.
	   To achieve these savings, the budget assumes Brazil will
experience negative growth of 1 percent in 1999 and estimates
average annual interest rates of 21.9 percent, said Planning
Ministry executive secretary Martus Tavares.
	   ``We consider our predictions realistic and even conservative,''
he said, referring to the growth predictions.
	   Citibank and several other financial institutions, however,
believe the economy will experience a greater slowdown, somewhere
between 1.5 percent and 3 percent, making the target surplus of
16.4 billion reals (dlrs 13.7 billion) unrealistic.
	   Tavares, however, brushed such concerns aside.
	   ``We have a great opportunity to achieve our goal and even
surpassing it. Everyone has their own numbers, and some are more
pessimistic than others,'' he said.
	   The pessimists, however, got a boost Wednesday when the
government announced that gross domestic product dropped by 1.52
percent in the third quarter of 1999 and that the public deficit
had grown to a record 7.81 percent of the GDP, or 70.7 billion
reals (dlrs 60 billion).
	   Neither of these indicators, however, have begun taking into
account the sky-high interest rates _ currently around 42 percent
annually _ put into place in the wake of Russia's debt default and
the resulting financial crisis, something that should further
aggravate the country's recovery.
	   Tavares pointed out that even if the financial situation
continues to worsen, the budget included a clause that would enable
the president to make the necessary cuts to achieve the savings
goal.
	   Tavares said he was confident that Congress would pass the
budget.
	   ``I haven't seen anybody in Congress expressing that they would
not approve the budget...,'' he said.

New Confederations Cup schedule upsets French, Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS three grafs with Bolivian comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moved from January to July and August to placate
the World Cup champion French, the Confederations Cup still is in
trouble.
	   The new calendar upsets the Americans, and the French still
don't know if they will play.
	   ``A competition cannot have these dates, it is a question of the
calendar,'' Noel Le Graet, president of the French National League
(LNF), was quoted Thursday in the French daily L'Equipe.
	   The French Football Federation's governing general council will
meet Friday to decide whether to accept the new dates proposed by
FIFA for the Confederations Cup.
	   FFF president Claude Simonet initially accepted the new dates,
but had asked for more time to consult with the French National
League.
	   A source at the FFF who requested anonymity said that there
remains a possibility that the federation will be unable to send a
team because the new dates clash with the start of the 1999-2000
French season.
	   After meetings earlier this week _ in which the participating
nations were consulted _ FIFA announced that the Confederations
Cup, an eight-team tournament that is to be comprised of the
continental champions, was being moved from Jan. 8-20 to July
28-Aug. 8.
	   Acknowleding it still had to be ratified by the Executive
Committee, FIFA announced that Simonet had committed Les Bleus to
play.
	   But only days later, Le Graet was exasperated, with the French
league schedule apparently set to begin July 28.
	   ``Mr. Simonet could not have looked at the calendar,'' Le Graet
said.
	   The French withdrew from the Confederations Cup, to be played in
Mexico, with its January schedule, saying it conflicted with the
European league season.
	   Simonet agreed to the new schedule, but has run into more
opposition.
	   ``The dates (for next year's French league) are still not set. I
am not going to get into a debate about this before bringing the
problem before the general council,'' Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games (July 23-Aug. 8), and forces
Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia into two major events in less than a
month.
	   Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia will compete in the Copa America, set
for June 29-July 18.
	   ``To my knowledge there has been no official communication with
the French FA,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday. ``As we
said a couple of days ago, our president (Sepp Blatter) had met
with the French president.
	   ``Those dates were proposed for everybody. Clearly we wouldn't
have laid down those dates where anybody said they couldn't make
it. Everybody got the same approach, each was able to express their
opinion.''
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation was represented at the FIFA meetings,
but one of them was not MLS commissioner Doug Logan, whose league
season was interrupted in 1996 by the Olympics and this year by the
World Cup.
	   ``I'm extraordinarily disappointed. As everyone knows I was
hopeful we'd have uniterrupted season to see what we could do,''
Logan said. ``However, we will make best of it. We will
enthusiastically support the (U.S.) federation fielding a
competitive team to the Confederations Cup.
	   ``We will work closely with (U.S. coach) Bruce Arena...in making
sure that the team is well-prepared and represents our country, our
federation and our league at the higest level.
	   ``Our preference would have been to have this scheduled at
another time. We'll dance with the partner given us.''
	   The only affirmative voice heard so far has been from Bolivia,
which, like many World Cup teams, has recently changed coaches and
is rebuilding its squad.
	   ``We have time to prepare a good team,'' Bolvian Football
Federation president Sergio Asbun.
	   Coach Hector Rodolfo Veira said the conflict with the Pan Am
Games will not cause a problem because none of his under-23 players
are on the regular national team.

Americans propose WTO panel consider banana dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States proposed Thursday that a
World Trade Organization dispute panel rule by Jan. 15 on whether a
European Union proposal on bananas meets the trade group's
requirements.
	   In a letter, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
proposed that the United States and EU agree to reconvene the WTO
dispute settlement panel to rule on the EU's new banana proposal
and finally conclude the long-running fight.
	   ``They've said their new regime is consistent with their
obligations. Then let them have the courage of their convictions,
and put it to the test,'' U.S. special trade negotiator Peter Scher
told reporters.
	   Washington and Brussels disagree on whether the EU has done
enough to comply with a WTO verdict last year that the EU's
favorable treatment of former and present colonies in Africa and
the Caribbean violates trade rules.
	   An EU official in Washington said the latest U.S. proposal was
unacceptable.
	   ``Our initial reaction is that the US is twisting WTO procedures
and is still going by an illegal, unilateral sanctions timetable,''
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Both the United States and the EU claim to have the law on their
side in the latest round of their long-running banana battle, which
risks blowing up into a full-scale trade war.
	   Acting on a U.S. complaint, the WTO last year ordered the
15-nation EU to change its policy of giving duty preference to
fruit, particularly bananas, to former colonies in the Caribbean
and Africa. That policy has worked against banana producers in
Latin and Central America, including U.S.-owned operations.
	   The European Union rewrote its banana import agreements, but the
United States has been unsatisfied with the changes.
	   In October, Republican leaders in Congress expressed concern
that the EU was trying to circumvent the rulings. Earlier this
month, U.S. trade representatives threatened economic sanctions.

Government appeals to save main TV station from bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with order to seize station's cars, station
warning it may have to abandon video footage, bailiff saying no
money was found in company accounts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Court marshals moved Thursday to confiscate
company cars of Russia's largest television station as part of
bankruptcy proceedings, a step station officials said will force
them to abandon video coverage.
	   The government has appealed to law enforcement authorities to
halt the bankruptcy action. But court marshals continued their
preparations Thursday to sell the ORT station's assets to pay its
multimillion-dollar debt to government-owned transmitters, Russian
news reports said.
	   Court officials have already begun taking inventory of the
furniture and equipment at ORT, which reaches 98 percent of
Russia's population, more than any other station.
	   The marshals on Thursday demanded keys to all of ORT's company
cars. ORT director Igor Shabdurasulov said in an interview with
Interfax that without cars, the station would have no means to go
out and cover news events.
	   ``Our news broadcasts may amount to reading news agency
reports,'' he said. ``In the worst case scenario, we may display
text saying that ORT cannot keep viewers posted on the latest
developments.''
	   Russia's chief bailiff Boris Kondrashov said court officials
were seeking to seize ORT property because ``no money was found in
company bank accounts,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The station itself is 51 percent government-owned, with the
remainder held by various private investors, including prominent
financier Boris Berezovsky.
	   ``An absurd situation has emerged when government institutions
sue a TV company that is more than 50 percent owned by the
government,'' ORT spokesman Grigory Simanovich told Interfax.
	   The head of the Russian Federal Television and Radio
Broadcasting Service, Mikhail Seslavinsky, appealed to the Justice
Ministry on Wednesday to call off the proceedings against the
station, Interfax said.
	   Already, ORT has cut costs by replacing much of its programming
with reruns, Simanovich said. He said the station intends to pay
off its debts, but that, because of the country's economic crisis,
``the only source of company revenues _ commercials _ have
virtually stopped bringing in money.''

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on inspections; ADDS quotes from Duelfer,
Butler. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqis worked
together to avoid the media Thursday, new cooperation between two
parties whose stormy relations nearly triggered a military strike.
	   On the second day of their field work since their return to
Iraq, the weapons inspectors and their Iraqi escorts appeared happy
with the new arrangement.
	   ``We like it this way,'' said an Iraqi escort waiting for the
inspectors in a car outside the U.N. compound.
	   Instead of the old pattern of escorts entering the U.N. compound
and shaking hands with inspectors in front of TV cameras to start
the day, one escort hastily waved from outside the compound's
three-meter-high (10-foot) fence.
	   Immediately afterward, two U.N. vehicles each with three
monitors sped past television camera crews and disappeared onto a
congested highway.
	   The teamwork was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups, when several planned inspections had to be canceled because
Iraq refused to send escorts required under U.N.-Iraqi agreements.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Charles Duelfer, deputy
director of the U.N. Special Commission, said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``We're trying to keep the temperature
down as much as possible.''
	   The inspectors returned to Baghdad on Tuesday and began their
field trips Wednesday after being blocked from working under Iraqi
government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. sanctions on Iraq, imposed
after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, can be lifted. Iraq insists it
already has destroyed all its most dangerous weapons.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that more than seven U.N.
teams went out Thursday. Two visited nuclear sites, one a chemical
site, a biological team visited a military hospital, a number of
teams inspected missile sites and three teams visited monitoring
camps.
	   ``The Iraqi side provided all cooperation for the teams in order
to facilitate their work,'' INA said.
	   Duelfer said Thursday's inspections ``went quite normally and no
problems were reported.''
	   At least seven monitoring teams visited similar types of weapons
sites on Wednesday and INA claimed the Iraqis provided full
cooperation.
	   A U.N. official in New York reported that the inspectors' first
field visits Wednesday came off without a hitch. ``They did a
normal day's work and came back _ no problems,'' said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   It's not clear if the new teamwork by weapons inspectors and
their escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of
their surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   Duelfer told the AP that UNSCOM was still waiting for documents
that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler had requested.
	   ``One of the best ways Iraq can prove its cooperation with the
Special Commission is by providing the documents demanded by the
Special Commission,'' Duelfer said.
	   Butler on Wednesday sent a formal request to Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, asking for documents that Iraq previously
refused to hand over.
	   One is an Iraqi air force account of chemical munitions used in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   In a speech in Philadelphia Wednesday, Butler accused Aziz of
lying. He said he had written Aziz asking to see a copy of the
document.
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth,'' Butler said.
	   Iraq, which has accused Butler of working on behalf of the
Americans, has over the past months called for his resignation.
	   The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat on Thursday
quoted Butler as saying he was ready to quit his job if it meant
Iraq would reveal all its banned weapons.
	   ``If it becomes clear that Iraq will fully cooperate and reveal
all the banned weapons ... then the lifting of sanctions will be
achieved,'' Butler said.
	   ``If the only obstacle is Richard Butler ... I am ready to
resign.'' he said. ``I took this job to carry out the mission and
it is logical for me to resign if I am the real obstacle,'' he
added.
	   But he revised his comments in New York Thursday, saying he had
every intention of remaining as chief U.N. weapons inspector. He
accused Iraq of trying to divert attention from its weapons
problems to his personality.
	   ``This is a wildly theoretical circumstance and frankly it's an
attempt by Iraq to divert attention from its weapons problems and
on to a personality issue,'' Butler said.

Lithuanian legislator gets jail term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A court has sentenced Lithuanian
legislator and former defense minister Audrius Butkevicius to 5 1/2
years in prison for corruption.
	   The 38-year-old Butkevicius was found guilty Wednesday of taking
a dlrs 15,000 bribe from a Lithuanian oil company in exchange for a
promise to use his connections to have a suit against the firm
dropped.
	   Butkevicius, who has no party affiliation, has already spent 13
months in prison awaiting the conclusion of his trial and that time
will be subtracted from his sentence, the court said.
	   Lawyers for Butkevicius said they will appeal the conviction.
	   During the nation's drive for independence, Butkevicius was
considered a hero by many for organizing the defense of Lithuania's
parliament when Soviet troops threatened to attack it in January
1991.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite a cold response from foreign
donors, Rwandan officials said Thursday they will start moving the
first 130,000 people displaced by war into villages protected from
Hutu rebels.
	   The first settlements will be built in northwestern Rwanda,
where 650,000 people, most of them Hutus, have abandoned their
homes and sought protection from the soldiers in dozens of
makeshift camps, said James Kimonyo, the Interior Ministry's
resettlement director.
	   ``The first villages will be test cases. We'll address problems
as we move along,'' Kimonyo said. ``But we need foreign assistance.
We cannot do it ourselves.''
	   So far, foreign donors have been reluctant to finance the
resettlement _ which the government estimates will cost dlrs 52
million _ for fear it is forced rather than voluntary.
	   The donors are hesitant about the plan for fear that the
government is trying to separate the civilians from the rebels by
force _ both to protect loyalists and to keep civilian sympathizers
from providing support to the rebels.
	   Kimonyo said pressure to build the villages came from local
communities exhausted by rebels who demand scarce food, money or
shelter, and kill those who refuse.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus four years ago. The killing ended when
Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994, and promised a national
reconciliation.
	   Diplomats in Kigali, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
donor countries were unwilling to finance the village projects
without careful planning. They say the government appears to be in
a hurry to move people out of the makeshift camps, where they have
little water or food.
	   Kimonyo said his ministry has proposed a two-week consultation
period, after which the first three communes at Cyeru, Kinigi and
Rwerere, all about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Kigali,
would be resettled within eight weeks.
	   Under the plan, those willing to move to new villages will be
given a plot for a new house which they must build themselves.
	   Each sector _ which traditionally was made up of houses
surrounded by plots and scattered on hills _ will be replaced by 20
to 30 new homes at a central location, usually with a school and a
health clinic.
	   The village would be surrounded by its original agricultural
plots.
	   The government has long considered the idea of centrally located
houses surrounded by fields as the only solution to ease the
pressure of a rapidly growing population _ 7.4 million with
projected 16 million in 2022 _ on the scarce land.
	   Such construction concentrates civilians and makes them easier
to protect _ and monitor.
	   The plan, officially adopted by the government in 1996, was at
first rejected by Rwandans, who have strong cultural and social
ties to their land. However, recently, security concerns have made
people change their minds, Kimonyo said.
	   Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in the
world. In the northwest, the country's breadbasket, the population
density is twice the national average at 600 people per square
kilometer (900 people per square mile). Every patch of land is
occupied, and family plots have been slowly divided with each new
generation.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's premier vowed Thursday that his country
would not be blackmailed by threats of a Turkish boycott to force
the extradition of a Kurdish rebel leader jailed in Rome.
	   The Turkish government is pushing Italy hard to extradite
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year war
for Kurdish autonomy.
	   Turkish businesses are now boycotting Italian products and a mob
on Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a market. On
Thursday, the Turkish ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, said Ankara
would break off diplomatic relations if Ocalan isn't handed over.

U.N. committee calls for end to plastic bulletsin Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Northern Ireland's police should stop using
plastic bullets and interrogation centers a United Nations
committee recommended Thursday.
	   Civil liberties activists and Irish Republican Army supporters
welcomed the report of the Committee Against Torture, a 10-member
panel of independent experts that periodically reviews countries'
adherence to the U.N. Convention Against Torture.
	   But representatives of Northern Ireland's British Protestant
majority called it perverse and naive.
	   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, police force for the
British-ruled province, declined to comment. The predominantly
Protestant force is already being subjected to a yearlong public
review under terms of April's peace accord.
	   The U.N. committee criticized the continued operation of the
police's main Castlereagh interrogation center in Protestant east
Belfast where, under British anti-terrorist law, suspects can be
questioned for up to a week without being charged. It recommended
that Castlereagh be closed ``at the earliest opportunity.''
	   It also said British-style plastic bullets _ flat-headed
projectiles designed to knock down rioters without killing them _
should be abolished.
	   Since their introduction in Northern Ireland in 1972, plastic
bullets have killed 17 people, but none since 1989. British
authorities have consistently defended their use as more
discriminating than other available forms of riot control, such as
gas and water cannons.
	   Paul Mageean, spokesman for Northern Ireland's main
civil-liberties group, the Committee for the Administration of
Justice, said in Belfast that the findings highlighted ``the fact
that the Royal Ulster Constabulary's behavior and standards fall
short of what the international community expects.''
	   Also in Belfast, Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, welcomed the findings but said the British
government ``has a long, appalling record of totally and absolutely
ignoring such international investigations.''
	   Ian Paisley Jr., justice affairs spokesman for a Protestant
party, the Democratic Unionists, called it a ``scurrilous,
pernicious, nasty, evil little report.'' He said the IRA, not the
police, had been guilty of torture.

with a confidence vote next week hat is expected to topple the

	   The vote on whether to hold a vote was 311 to 213, a signal that
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' coalition is unlikely to survive the
confidence motion. It will take only 276 votes to topple his

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer started
first and finished there after the opening run of a women's World
Cup giant slalom on Thursday.
	   Meissnitzer excelled at the top of the Park City Mountain
Resort's C.B.'s Run course and carried speed down the treacherous
face and across the flats to the finish in 1 minute, 5.48 seconds.
	   Times climbed racer by racer until skiers in the second seed
began finding ways to shave hundredths of seconds. But those
racers, while jumping into places far above their start numbers,
were still well behind the Austrian.
	   Sonja Nef of Switzerland, second down the course, was second on
the scoreboard, .15 seconds back, and Martina Ertl of Germany, the
defending World Cup giant slalom champion, was third, .24 behind.
	   Karin Kollerer of Austria, starting 26th, zoomed into fourth in
1:06.15 and Italy's Karen Putzer claimed fifth out of the 19th
starting spot in 1:06.41.
	   Regine Cavagnoud of France, the 30th starter, was sixth in
1:06.52. Norway's Andrine Flemmen, winner of the season-opening
giant slalom at Solden, Austria three weeks ago, was seventh, 1.05
seconds behind.
	   Kristina Duvillard, latest in a long line from one of French
skiing's noteworthy families, started 45th and was eighth in
1:06.54.
	   Birgit Heeb of Liechtenstein was ninth in 1:06.58 and Urska
Hrovat of Slovenia was 10th in 1:06.59.
	   Italy's Deborah Compagnoni, third at Solden, was the most
notable of several early course casualties. She was fooled by a
terrain change from the flats on the top to the steep face
approaching the middle of the course and was unable to stay on the
course after her weight shifted onto her inside ski.

Thirty-nine nations allocate dlrs 20 billion to poor countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Thirty-nine countries have agreed on
donating dlrs 20 billion to a fund that provides financing to the
world's poorest countries, the World Bank said Thursday.
	   ``Despite the global financial crisis, the agreement shows
support to the poorest countries in the world is on the rebound,''
said Sven Sandstroem of the World Bank's International Development
Association (IDA).
	   Sandstroem told reporters that a large share of the credits
would be used in the social and health sectors, and for educational
matters. He added the funds to be allocated over a three-year
period presently were not earmarked to any programs.
	   Credits by IDA _ a World Bank affiliate established in 1960 to
provide assistance to poorer developing countries _ are only made
to governments.
	   The 80 countries eligible for funding from IDA represent 3.3
billion people or 80 percent of the population of the developing
countries.
	   Donor countries include most of Europe, North and South American
nations, African and Arab countries, South Korea, Australia and New
Zealand.

Banned for life, Johnson wants to compete again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Canadian track star Ben Johnson who was
stripped of his 1988 Olympic gold medal for drug use and later
banned from competition for life, wants to run again competitively,
his agent said Thursday.
	   Johnson arrived in Israel Thursday in search of fresh running
talent to train, and has applied to have his license to compete
reinstated, said his Israeli-born agent Morris Chrobotek.
	   Johnson, who coaches six runners in Canada, is looking to add an
Israeli athlete to the group, Maccabi Tel Aviv Athletics Club
manager Lior Beiderman said. Chrobotek said the club is checking to
see if the ban on competition preclude's Johnson's participation in
an exhibition race Monday.
	   ``I'm happy to be here in Israel, and I hope I can share some of
my 22 years of experience,'' the track star told Israel TV.
	   Johnson will stay in Israel until the middle of next week. He
plans to lecture to high school students about drug abuse in sports
and conduct a training session with Maccabi Tel Aviv runners.
	   Johnson was suspended from competition in 1988 after testing
positive for steroid use following his record-setting capture of
the 100 meter gold medal in 9.79 seconds. In 1993, after testing
positive a second time, he was banned from competition for life.

Serb leader accuses ethnic Albanians of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of three Serb police injured.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic's one-day visit to Kosovo's
capital Pristina followed on the heels of the Serbian president's
Wednesday attempt to chair a meeting boycotted by leaders of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   The Serb politicians' successive trips to Kosovo were an attempt
to try and assert Serbia's authority over the southern province,
despite continued Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful
solution. Hundreds have been killed and about a quarter of a
million people in Kosovo left homeless since Serbs cracked down on
separatist Albanian rebels in February.
	   Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks called by Serb
President Milan Milutinovic, dismissing them as an act of
propaganda and saying a basic agreement on the future of the
province must come first.
	   In Belgrade Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier
Vojislav Seselj accused the U.S. of backing the ethnic Albanian
boycott of Serbian Kosovo talks, saying the top U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill cannot be an active participant, but only a guest
at any negotiations.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. Milutinovic instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its
own authorities and police, but under Serb rule.
	   Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring
soldiers and police officers who participated in the crackdown,
Marjanovic blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace.
	   He accused the ethnic Albanians of ``causing great damage to
everybody, including a big majority of Albanians who want to live
and work in Kosovo with the others'' by boycotting the talks and
said Serbia's top priority was to ``preserve peace and freedom,
territorial integrity and sovereignty.''
	   Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said a
49-year-old doctor was killed and his daughter wounded when three
masked assailants broke into their home in Pec, some 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Pristina.
	   The Serbian Media Center reported three Serb police were
wounded, one seriously, on a road in western Kosovo late Wednesday
in an attack by ethnic Albanian rebels.

French look to stop Russian streak

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of
France look to stop a Russian winning streak in Grand Prix figure
skating series at the Lalique Trophy competition this weekend.
	   The Russians are fresh from a sweep of all four events at the
Nations Cup in Gelsenkirchen, Germany last week. With world
champion Alexei Yagudin looking for his fifth victory in five weeks
and European champion Maria Butyskaya wanting to rebound from a
poor performance, the singles events have Russian favorites.
	   Former world champions Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov are
making their first start of the season in the pairs and are favored
in that event, despite the presence of French skaters Sarah Abitbol
and Stephane Bernadis.
	   Only in ice dance are the Russians vulnerable here where they
haven't sent their top skaters.
	   Thursday, Anissina and Peizerat took first in the compulsory
dance, the blues, placing ahead of Italians Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Maurizio Margaglio. The French couple had marks in the 5.4 to 5.8
range.
	   The original dance with the short program of the other three
events will be held on Friday.
	   Anissina, who was born in Moscow but moved to France six years
ago, and Peizerat won the bronze medal behind two Russian couples
and then took second at the world championships.
	   But Olympic champions Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov have
split up and Angeleika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov, who won in
Gelsenkirchen, are not competing in Paris.
	   Anissina and Peizerat won Skate American three weeks ago with an
top-caliber performance.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians had four
victories in the eight events. They doubled that in Gelsenkirchen.
	   Yagudin was the men's singles winner in Germany and showed his
first quadruple jump of the season. Over the past month he has won
two Grand Prix and two Pro-Am compeititons.
	   American Michael Weiss is entered and could challenge Yagudin if
he finally completes his quad. He has been coming close in his last
few competitions and was second to Yagudin at Skate America.
	   Butyrskaya had a disastrous long program in Gelsenkirchen but
salvaged third. She won Skate America.
	   Yelena Liashenko, who won Skate Canada, and American Nicole
Bobek are also entered.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competiitons, the women's competition is still looking for a
leader.
	   There have been three Grand Prix meets so far with three
different women's winners.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Union ends five-month strike against world's top newsprint
</HEADLINE>
producer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Workers at 10 Abibiti-Consolidated pulp and
paper mills in Eastern Canada have voted to accept a new contract
and end a five-month strike against the world's No. 1 newsprint
producer, the union said Thursday.
	   The Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union, which
represents the 4,000 strikers, said 74 percent of the workers voted
in favor of a six-year contract.
	   The contract is expected to serve as a pattern for some 30,000
paperworkers in about 60 mills in Eastern Canada.
	   The company won its demand for a six-year deal, rather than four
years as the union had sought. The union got its wish for a single
contract for all the mills, rather than a separate deal for each
one.
	   Workers will get a lump-sum payment for 1998 of dlrs 2,750 (dlrs
1,790 U.S.) and salary increases of about 2 percent for each of the
next five years. The average hourly wage before the strike was dlrs
25 (dlrs 16 U.S.).
	   Workers will also get more vacation and improved
health-insurance benefits.
	   Abitibi reported a dlrs 57 million (dlrs 37 million U.S.) loss
in the third quarter because of the strike, which affected 30
percent of its newsprint capacity and 66 percent of higher grade
papers. The company had nine other mills operating in the United
States and Europe.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen was
voted the athlete of the year Thursday by the Finnish sports
writers' association.
	   Hakkinen, who beat Germany's Michael Schumacher in the final
race for this Formula One driver's title, edged Olympic
cross-country skiing champion Mika Myllyla. He received 62.5
percent of votes for first place, to 30 percent for Myllyla.
	   Jani Soininen, an Olympic ski jumping champion, was a distant
third with five percent.
	   The top three were followed by reigning world rally champion
Tommi Makinen, who is seeking to defend his title this year. Teemu
Selanne of the North American National Hockey League's Anaheim
Mighty Ducks was fifth, and Jari Litmanen of Ajax Amsterdam sixth.
	   Also finishing in top 10 were double Olympic Nordic combined ski
champion Samppa Lajunen; European 50K walk champion Valentin
Kononen; Finland's national ice hockey team, which won an Olympic
bronze medal and World Championship silver, and Soviet-born Eduard
Hamalainen, who was runner-up in the decathlon at the European
Championships.
	   Satu Pusila, a European champion trap shooter and world record
holder, was the top woman, in 11th place overall.

Russia's parliament drafts new START-II treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last three grafs with U.S. Senator Lugar saying any
changes to treaty unacceptable. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament drafted its own
version of the START-II nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday, a
top official said.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of Russia's lower house, the
State Duma, said hard-liners initially opposed to the treaty are
likely to pass the new version because it ``stipulates several
conditions which would ensure Russia's national security,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Some deputies in the Duma, mostly hard-line Communists, have
stalled on ratifying START-II because they say Russia does not have
the money to replace nuclear stockpiles that would be destroyed
under the agreement.
	   But Seleznyov said the new document would guarantee financing
for nuclear arms after START-II is implemented.
	   Various Duma committees will now discuss the draft for 10 days.
Deputies say they want President Boris Yeltsin to study it, and
then they will begin discussions in December on finally ratifying
it, said Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's committee for
international affairs.
	   The United States Senate has already ratified the treaty.
	   U.S. Senator Richard Lugar, visiting Moscow on Thursday, stood
firm against any changes to the treaty.
	   ``To add an item such as no nuclear weapons in the Baltics, or
something of this variety, as a condition clearly would be
unacceptable,'' he told a news conference.
	   ``If (the Duma) were to require the United States to have
another debate on Start II ratification on those terms, that does
not look promising.''

Sudanese government denies involvement in bid to kill rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's government denied Thursday that
it was involved in a reported bid to assassinate the rebel leader
John Garang.
	   Garang's group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, had accused
the government and the maverick rebel leader Kerubino Kwanyin Bol
of sending a hit squad of 20 men to assassinate their chief at his
house in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on Sunday.
	   ``The Sudanese government has nothing whatsoever to do with the
Garang-Bol conflict,'' Ali al-Haj Mohammed, a senior official of
the ruling National Congress party, said in a statement issued in
Khartoum.
	   The Kenyan government has declined to comment on the incident,
but an independent Nairobi newspaper cited an informed source as
saying Kerubino's men were involved in a gun battle with Garang's
guards before the police arrived and chased the assailants away.
One of Garang's men was killed.
	   Kerubino has denied trying to assassinate Garang.
	   Kerubino, the leader of a minor rebel faction who defected to
the government in April 1997 and rejoined the insurgency in
January, lives in Nairobi.
	   The friction underscored rivalries among the Sudanese rebels,
who have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy for the Christian
and animist south of the country from the Muslim-dominated north.
	   The war has left more than 1.5 million people dead and driven
hundreds of thousands from their homes.

Russian soccer chief hires bodyguards after threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's soccer federation chief has hired
bodyguards after receiving threats pressuring him to step down
before it's ``too late,'' a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The head of Soviet and then Russian soccer for nearly 20 years,
Vyacheslav Koloskov said the threats were coming from one of his
seven challengers in an election next month to lead the Russian
Football Union, or RFS.
	   ``This person told a close friend and colleague of mine: Tell
Koloskov that if he doesn't leave the RFS willingly then things
will end badly for him,'' Koloskov told the Sport-Express
newspaper.
	   Later he heard from another friend that Koloskov should step
down or else it will be ``too late.''
	   In response, Koloskov hired bodyguards, the newspaper said.
	   The head of the Russian ice hockey federation was gunned down in
a contract killing in 1996, and many prominent athletes have hired
bodyguards.
	   The Russian team has not qualified for the World Cup since 1990
or any major tournament since the 1992 European Championship. In
addition, the team has been hobbled by shortages in government
funding and a demoralizing loss to Iceland last month in qualifying
for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Koloskov's challengers include Dynamo Moscow president Nikolai
Tolstykh, former USSR striker Viktor Ponedelnik and the outspoken
leader of the southern Russian region of Kalmykia, Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, who also heads the International Chess Federation
(FIDE).

U.N. says peace agreement is defusing Kosovo tensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council said Thursday
that the recent U.S.-brokered peace agreement for Kosovo was
defusing the immediate crisis but expressed concern about
``persisting tensions.''
	   Council members welcomed ongoing efforts to promote a political
dialogue between Serb authorities and ethnic Albanians and
emphasized the urgency of such talks, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter
Burleigh, the current council president said.
	   ``In particular, they welcomed the fact that the recent accord
and agreements are contributing to defusing the immediate crisis
situation in Kosovo and are creating more favorable conditions for
a political settlement which respects the full rights of all the
people of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   The council started discussing a report on the embattled Serbian
province by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday morning
and issued a statement after the closed meeting.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule for the
province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. Hundreds have
died and about a quarter of a million people in Kosovo have been
left homeless since Serbs cracked down on separatist rebels in
February.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 peace agreement, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow 2,000 civilian
verifiers into the Serb province. NATO troops based in neighboring
Macedonia are meant to come to the aid of the unarmed observers,
should they be menaced.
	   Annan said reports of the return of Kosovo Albanian paramilitary
units to positions vacated by government forces, ``and particularly
by their continued attacks against security forces and civilians
are disturbing.''
	   This situation, he said, made the deployment of 2,000 civilian
monitors urgent.
	   The Security Council also stressed the importance of an early
deployment of the verification mission, being organized by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   It also called on all parties to cooperate with the mission and
provide security for its personnel.
	   Annan welcomed the peace accord and efforts by U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petrisch of
Austria to promote a political dialogue.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia. The Serbs instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its
own authorities and police, but under Serb rule.
	   Annan cited security fears of ethnic Albanians who fled their
homes during the nearly eight-month crackdown by the Yugoslav army
and Serb police.
	   ``The persistent fear expressed about returnees' security
highlights the need to actively monitor the activities of and to
train local police forces, particularly in the area of human
rights,'' he said.

Council calls for arms moratorium for conflict-prone Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council said Thursday it was
gravely concerned about arms flows into Africa and urged nations
restrict sales to countries embroiled in conflict.
	   In a unanimously adopted resolution, the 15-member council
called on African governments to enact legislation on the
possession and use of arms as well as laws regarding the import and
export of weapons.
	   The resolution, coupled with another one passed Thursday calling
for improved treatment for refugees in Africa, came amid mounting
conflicts on the continent.
	   Rebels in Congo are seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila in
a conflict that has involved troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia
and Chad on Kabila's side, and Uganda and Rwanda on the rebels'
side.
	   In Angola, the 1994 U.N.-mediated accord that ended two decades
of civil war has been unravelling with the resumption of fighting
between the government and the former rebel movement UNITA.
	   On Thursday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan was meeting with
Anthony Lake, the special U.S. envoy to Eritrea and Ethiopia, where
a six-month border dispute has prompted the countries to mass
troops and weapons on their border. Lake and Susan Rice, assistant
U.S. secretary of state for African affairs, were briefing the U.N.
chief on their recent trips to the region.

Iraqi opposition groups urge Clinton against funding Iraqi faction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two of Iraq's main opposition groups have
urged U.S. President Clinton against funding an Iraqi faction in a
bid to topple Saddam Hussein, saying the group does not represent
all of Iraq's opposition.
	   Leaders of the mainly Shiite group, the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
have asked the Clinton administration to stop backing the Iraqi
National Congress which is led by Ahmed Chalabi.
	   ``The message expressed concern over attempts to impose one
person or one group to represent the whole Iraqi opposition,'' said
an Iraqi opposition figure close to the two groups by telephone
from London. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the message was conveyed to the American administration
by U.S. diplomats in London.
	   Clinton on Saturday pledged to intensify work with the Iraqi
opposition groups to try to remove Saddam from power. The effort is
part of a plan passed by the Congress earlier this month to
dispense dlrs 97 million to help the dissidents to oust Saddam.
	   The Iraqi National Congress is an umbrella group in London that
seeks to unite numerous groups opposed to Saddam, the Iraqi leader.
	   At one time, it succeeded in bringing together Shiite Muslim
groups, former ruling party officials and Kurdish guerrillas who
sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   But the broad coalition crumbled over the years, hampered by
internal divisions, a lack of resources and what the group saw as
wavering U.S. support.
	   Clinton, in calling off a U.S. military attack on Iraq last
weekend, declared the administration would back opposition groups.
	   Chalabi met Thursday with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk.
	   He has proposed that the United States declare the western,
southern and northern parts of Iraq no-fly and no-drive zones for
Iraq's military. This would, in theory, create safe havens for
those wanting to join an opposition army. It would be enforced,
Chalabi says, with U.S. bombers, not ground troops.

Edmonton beats out Stanford for 2001 World Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Specifies location of Stanford; changes to athletics
throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The Canadian city of Edmonton beat
Stanford, California, on Thursday for the right to stage the 2001
World Championships, taking athletics' showcase event to North
America for the first time.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Edmonton,
capital of the western province of Alberta, received ``massive
consensus'' in the secret ballot by the IAAF Council.
	   Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released, but an IAAF source
said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. Two Council members were absent
and a third apparently abstained.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium.
Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth Games, 1983 University Games
and 1996 World Figure Skating Championships.
	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition
of organizing sports events and we are delighted to have a
commitment to host what we feel will be the greatest ever world
championships.''
	   It was Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997
and 1999 championships.
	   The result was another blow to athletics in the United States.
	   While America produces some of the sports greatest stars, apart
from during the Olympics, athletics continues to founder from lack
of public interest, sponsors, funds and television coverage.
	   Edmonton trumped Stanford by lining up government financial
support and guarantees, promising to pay for the travel costs and
accomodation for athletes and officials, and presenting a lucrative
Canadian TV deal with the IAAF.
	   ``The financial issue was very important,'' IAAF spokesman
Giorgio Reineri said. ``I think that convinced a lot of people to
vote for Edmonton.''
	   Stanford couldn't match Edmonton's financial guarantees.
	   ``One of the challenges is American cities being asked to, in a
sense, guarantee the whole event, and that is certainly not done in
the United States,'' said Dan Fenton, chief operating officer of
the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau.
	   He said Stanford instead offered a novel deal under which an
insurance company would guarantee revenue. The Americans also
offered to offset transportation costs but ``not to the extent''
Edmonton did, Fenton said.
	   ``Edmonton was both creative and enthusiastic in their bid and
benefitted from more than 80 million dollars in government
supports,'' said Craig Masback, head of USA Track and Field. ``We
remain committed to bringing major international events to the
United States and I am confident that we will one day host the
World Championships.
	   ``I think it was a very fair process. I know the IAAF realized
that from a sponsorship standpoint the potential of our bid was
superior to the Edmonton bid. But there were many other factors
that were part of the decision.''
	   Edmonton impressed the IAAF by bringing a 27-member delegation
that included Klein and Canadian Justice Minister Anne McLellan.
	   ``They gave an impression of being so enthusiastic to host the
World Championships,'' Reineri said. ``But they also had facts to
back up their words.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great
majority'' for Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentation which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations
from Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show.
	   ``We presented third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund
said. ``We left the room thinking we would probably have a half an
hour wait. Within about four or five minutes, they called us back
in to announce that Edmonton had won the bid. Apparently it was
almost a unanimous decision.''
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be covered for athletes and officials.
	   Reineri said this was an important selling point for the IAAF,
which in the past has paid for athletes within the quotas set for
each country.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.
	   Paris, meanwhile, used its bid as a trial-run for a more serious
run at the 2003 championships. London is also planning a bid for
2003, with a renovated Wembley Stadium as the proposed venue.

Relentless prosecutor catches cop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A public prosecutor leading an
unprecedented crackdown on police corruption staked out an alleged
hideout for prostitutes to catch his latest victim Thursday.
	   A policeman and a retired officer were arrested after prosecutor
Giorgos Gerakis waited for hours at a small apartment for two young
Ukrainian women to return home.
	   The two arrested men allegedly provided the Ukrainian women the
apartment and set them up as prostitutes after they entered the
country illegally.
	   Gerakis, known for his unorthodox methods, earlier this month
issued charges against 16 people, including senior police officers.
They were accused of involvement in nightclub protection rackets
and selling residence permits to illegal aliens, including
prostitutes and wanted foreign criminals.
	   The charges came after Gerakis paid an unannounced visit last
summer to the public order ministry, where he seized incriminating
documents.

Four Arab countries accept invitation to Nov. 30 conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Four Arab countries _ Egypt, Jordan, Oman and
Bahrain _ are among about a dozen nations that have accepted
invitations to meet here Nov. 30 to consider new assistance to the
Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza.
	   Israel, which has joined the United States in appealing for
financial help funneled through Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority, also plans to attend the one-day conference, as does
Arafat.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be the host. She has
urged wealthy European, Asian and Arab countries to help the
Palestinians and has appealed to the Arabs to establish or improve
relations with Israel, now that it is giving up another chunk of
the West Bank.
	   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Thursday a
positive response was expected now that the Israeli pullback is
about to start.
	   Past appeals produced dlrs 3.9 billion in pledges, about
two-thirds at a similar conference in 1993.
	   International donors at a conference sponsored by the World Bank
in Paris directed dlrs 750 million last December to help
Palestinians build roads, schools and other projects in the West
Bank and Gaza and promised to insure dlrs 150 million more in
private investment.
	   Among proposed Palestinian projects are an airport at Gaza,
water treatment facilities and a luxury hotel in Bethlehem.
	   In 1993, the United States pledged dlrs 500 million for five
years. Rubin said, ``We do hope to substantially increase that
amount in the coming years.''

Britain, Germany to consult on economic reform, jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and Germany announced Thursday that they
would work together to promote job creation and economic
enterprise.
	   Britain's Treasury chief Gordon Brown met with German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine, then announced that a new joint working
group on economic reform and job creation would consider such
issues as training and education, venture capital and research and
development.
	   It was the first time the men have met since the election in
October of the new socialist German government, and Brown called
the talks ``constructive.''
	   But he said there were also areas of disagreement. In particular
he underlined Britain's opposition to any moves towards European
Union tax harmonization.
	   ``There are issues where there is discussion like tax
harmonization where we have taken a different view,'' Brown said.
	   Treasury officials had stressed that Brown would use the meeting
to make clear Britain's determination to resist any measures that
would raise costs for business or would damage investment and jobs.
	   Lafontaine said despite their differences, Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government and the center-left German coalition were
very close on many issues.
	   ``The differences are not as big as they have been described,''
he said.
	   They had agreed that unemployment in Europe was too high and
that the main priority had to be job creation, he said.
	   The two men also discussed measures to help the central American
countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday supported a joint
bid by opposition parties to topple Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz'
minority government, setting a no-confidence vote for Wednesday.
	   The vote on whether to hold a vote was 311 to 213, a signal that
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' 17-month old coalition is unlikely to
survive the confidence motion. It will take only 276 votes to
topple his coalition government.
	   Parliament will debate the no-confidence motion Monday and vote
on it on Wednesday.
	   The fall of the government would open the way for negotiations
among parties for a new coalition since no party has enough votes
to rule alone.
	   The opposition seeking the no-confidence vote accuses Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime and
tampering with the privatization of a state bank.
	   The Republican People's Party, which had been providing the
minority government with the backing it needed, voted against the
government Thursday.
	   Yilmaz accused the Republican Party of defecting under what he
called the influence of mobsters, claiming the underworld would be
happy to see the back of his government.
	   ``If you bring this government down, you will make the gangs
laugh,'' Yilmaz, leader of center-right Motherland Party. ``Of all
governments past and present, ours has been the most determined to
go after gangs.''
	   Yilmaz was referring to a police crackdown on the organized
crime, which led to the arrest of several prominent mafia bosses
over the past few months.
	   The accusations against Yilmaz were raised after a a businessman
linked to the mafia claimed earlier this month that the premier
rigged the privatization of a state-run bank.
	   Yilmaz denied any wrongdoing, saying he tried to keep the mafia
out of the deal and get the highest price possible.
	   ``It was my responsibility to get involved...I was involved to
safeguard the interests of my people,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Turkey has been rocked by allegations of ties between the
government and organized crime since 1996, when a car crash injured
a legislator and killed a police official and a fugitive _ all
riding together in the same car. State Minister Eyup Asik, from
Yilmaz' party, resigned two months ago amid allegations that he had
close ties to a mobster.
	   Three coalitions have collapsed in Turkey over the past three
years. Yilmaz came to power in July 1997 after the military forced
out an Islamic-led government for policies it said increased the
influence of Islam in society.

Azerbaijani newspaper ordered to pay official in libel case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ An Azerbaijani opposition newspaper
whose staff is on a hunger strike to protest libel suits was
ordered Thursday to pay dlrs 5,000 to a top police official in a
libel case.
	   Nizami Godzhayev, chief investigator with the Azerbaijani
Interior Ministry, sued the Yeni Musavat newspaper for articles
connecting him to the slaying of one of his deputies.
	   A court in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, ruled in Godzhayev's
favor and ordered the newspaper to pay him 20 million manat (dlrs
5,000) in moral damages.
	   Yeni Musavat editor Rauf Arifoglu called the decision unfair and
an attempt to ``economically strangle independent newspapers.''
	   Nineteen editors and journalists from several independent
newspapers continued their hunger strike Thursday to protests such
libel suits and police beatings of journalists last week. Some of
those on hunger strike stopped eating last Thursday, while others
joined Wednesday.
	   Damages sought by officials in the lawsuits exceed dlrs 500,000
_ a staggering amount in this former Soviet republic where average
salaries rarely exceed the equivalent of dlrs 43 a month.
	   Yeni Musavat is facing another libel suit by the head of the
presidential administration, Ramiz Mekhtiyev. President Geidar
Aliev's brother Dzhalal has sued another opposition newspaper,
Azadlyg, for reporting that he and other relatives of the president
bought expensive real estate in Britain.
	   Four journalists with Yeni Musavat were injured last Friday when
police dispersed a rally by newspaper employees.
	   Human rights groups have criticized Aliev for cracking down on
the press, though he eased censorship this summer ahead of
presidential elections.

Radical Palestinians prepare for anti-peace accord conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Radical Palestinian factions said
Thursday they will hold a conference next month to protest Yasser
Arafat's plans to annul a reference in the Palestinian national
charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
	   A statement issued by representatives of the eight Syria-based
groups said a committee has been assigned to prepare for the
``general popular Palestinian conference in the Diaspora to condemn
the amendment.''
	   Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for Israel's
destruction are to be amended by the central committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization in December.
	   The radical Palestinian factions said their conference will be
held between 12-16 December, but the venue has not yet been
decided, although Damascus has been mentioned a possibility.
	   Members of Arafat's Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream
faction, dominate the 600-member Palestine National Council, the P
parliament in exile. But the radical groups may be able to head off
any charter change by denying Arafat a quorum for the meeting.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Moderate northeast trade winds across the region today brought
modest amounts of low-level moisture and clouds into the local area
this afternoon to yield widely scattered showers. The majority of
shower activity was passing well north of St. Thomas and St. John
and moving southwest into north and eastern Puerto Rico. Meanwhile,
a lone cluster of heavy showers developed across the southwest of
Puerto Rico and intensified into a thunderstorm before moving
southwest into the Caribbean.
	   Widely scattered to scattered passing trade wind showers will
affect the local area tonight as high pressure over the Atlantic
continues to produce moderate northeast trade winds. A weak middle-
to upper-level trough associated with a cold front currently over
the southwest Atlantic is forecast to sink south into our Atlantic
coastal waters Friday afternoon and night to destabilize the
atmosphere and allow showers to become more intense. Light rainfall
amounts are therefore expected to become the exception during the
next 24 hours, with moderate to briefly heavy rainfall accompanying
showers tonight and Friday.
	   Northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots and seas of 3 to 6 feet
will generally prevail across the local coastal waters through
Saturday before an increase in wave action is seen across the
Atlantic. Small craft should continue to exercise caution across
the off shore coastal waters.

Prince Charles demands newspaper apology for report on Harry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles publicly demanded an apology for a
front-page tabloid article Thursday about a minor sports injury
Prince Harry suffered at school.
	   The privacy of Charles' two sons has long been a concern to the
royal family, and most newspapers have agreed to its request that
Harry, 14 and Prince William, 16, be left alone at school.
	   Charles' office had sent a letter to the newspaper Wednesday
confirming Harry's injury occurred, but stating that coverage was
not in the public interest and did not warrant publication without
parental permission _ which Charles withheld.
	   The Mirror ran a front-page editorial under the headline
``Harry's had an accident'' that reproduced the palace letter, with
the details of the injury blacked out.
	   The editorial reassured readers the injury was not serious and
said, ``But we believe you are entitled to know if an heir to the
throne is involved in accident, however small, if it results in an
injury.''
	   In a letter to the Mirror, Charles' private secretary, Stephen
Lamport, called the story intrusive and trivial about events that
happens to many other children.
	   ``Yet you sensationalize them to an extent which makes it very
difficult for Prince Harry to have a normal life at his school,''
Lamport wrote.
	   The letter added that the story breached the agreement of
newspapers to allow the young princes privacy they need in which to
grow up, particularly after the death of their mother, Princess
Diana, in 1997.
	   ``I hope that for these reasons you will be ready to apologize
publicly to Prince Harry,'' the letter said.
	   Mirror editor Piers Morgan said he did not believe the request
for a public apology was appropriate and called the letter ``a
thinly disguised attempt to bully and censor the press.''
	   He said most of the stories published in the Mirror this year
about William and Harry were provided by ``sources close to the
household of the Prince of Wales.''
	   Last month, The Mirror reported on a haircut attempt by Harry
and his schoolmates that left him shorn. The tabloid used
computer-generated photos to show what he would look like.
	   At the time, Prince Charles' spokeswoman said he would take the
matter to the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission.
	   After Diana's death, the industry self-regulatory body issued a
privacy code stipulating among other things that children under the
age of 16 should not be subjected to ``unnecessary intrusion.''
	   Most British newspapers have adhered to a request from the royal
family to leave the young princes alone.

U.S. senator praises Russia's disarmament progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Senator Richard Lugar watched Russian experts
dismantle two nuclear submarines Thursday and praised Russia's
efforts toward disarmament under a program he spearheaded.
	   Lugar, accompanied by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and former
Senator Sam Nunn _ co-author of the disarmament program _ also
visited the Soviet Union's largest defense complex, the Mayak
plant. Russia is building a storage facility there for enriched
uranium and plutonium from nuclear weapons.
	   On Thursday, the delegation witnessed Russian experts dismantle
two Delta-1 nuclear submarines at a military site near the Arctic
city of Arkhangelsk.
	   ``These submarines were capable of launching 12 missiles with
one warhead apiece and 16 missiles armed with 48 nuclear warhead
respectively,'' Lugar told a news conference in Moscow later.
	   ``Until just a few years ago, they were prowling the North
Atlantic and the waters off America's eastern seaboard.''
	   The Nunn-Lugar program, started in 1991, provides for American
technical assistance to the former Soviet Union to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction and account for weapons material.
	   Lugar also visited the closed nuclear city of Ozersk, ``whose
location was never formally acknowledged by the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
	   Mayak, also known as Chelyabinsk-65, was created in the late
1940s to make plutonium for the first Soviet atomic bombs. It
stopped plutonium production in 1992.
	   When the storage facility at Mayak opens in 2002, it will hold
material from 6,250 nuclear weapons, Lugar said.
	   ``People are extraordinarily supportive of the program, very
hopeful, as we are,'' Lugar said. The Russians ``are doing
remarkable work,'' he said.
	   The United States has been spending more than dlrs 400 million
each year from 1992-1997 on the Nunn-Lugar program, and plans to
allocate another dlrs 440 million this year, Lugar said.
	   The delegation called it money well-spent.
	   ``What we witnessed in terms of these programs had been funded
partially with the help of American taxpayers, and as a result of
that support, the American people are more secure, the Russian
people are more secure, the world is more secure,'' Levin said.
	   Under the program, former Soviet republics have deactivated
4,838 warheads from strategic systems that were aimed at the United
States, Lugar said. The countries have also destroyed 339 ballistic
missiles, 286 ballistic missile launchers, 37 bombers, 96 submarine
missile launchers.
	   Lugar watched Ukraine destroy a strategic warplane under the
program earlier this week.

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ After nearly two years of U.S. prodding
and bitter disputes with the Palestinians, the Israeli government
reluctantly gave the final go-ahead Thursday to withdrawing troops
from a chunk of the West Bank the size of Chicago.
	   The Cabinet narrowly approved the decision, 7-5, with three
abstentions, after acrimonious debate. It marked a point of no
return for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who since taking
office in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace process and now faces
the loss of support of key allies.
	   In anticipation of winning full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority
staged a jubilant independence day parade in the farming town of
Jenin in the northern West Bank on Thursday. Most of the land to be
handed over is near Jenin.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   Two percent, or 110 sq. kilometers (44 square miles), of the
West Bank land in the agreement approved Thursday is being
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In
addition, 7.1 percent, or 400 sq. kilometers (160 square miles), of
the land in the deal moves from joint jurisdiction to sole
Palestinian control.
	   The Palestinians already have full control of 3 percent of the
West Bank and joint jurisdiction over another 24 percent.
	   Unlike earlier pullbacks, this one held little promise of drama.
	   No army bases are being dismantled and all Israeli and
Palestinian troops have to do is move yellow-and-black road markers
the size of washing machines to road junctions to demarcate the new
dividing lines.
	   On Thursday night, the cement blocks were still lined up behind
the barbed wire fence of the Israeli army base of Dotan, south of
Jenin. On Friday morning, Israeli and Palestinian officers were
expected to meet to finalize the transfer with a handshake,
followed by an evacuation of Israeli troops expected to be
completed in a few hours.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a housewife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were indifferent to the prospect of coming under
full Palestinian rule. No Arafat posters or Palestinian flags
decorated the streets in anticipation.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet just barely approved the first stage
of the peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent
of the West Bank in three stages by the end of January, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers backed stage one, with
five voting against, three abstaining and two abroad. Surprisingly,
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who helped negotiate the accord at
Wye Plantation in Maryland last month, abstained Thursday, saying
he felt the Palestinians had not lived up to all their commitments.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two.
	   Israeli troops began fortifying 18 settlements that will become
increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.
	   The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians
pay for the cost of redeployment, but is still negotiating the
amount. Israel seeks dlrs 1.2 billion, but any money transfer would
require congressional approval.
	   The aid poses a dilemma for the United States because some of it
might be used for settler bypass roads and reinforcement of Jewish
settlements _ in violation of the U.S. position that settlements
harm peace prospects.
	   With the implementation of the peace accord finally under way,
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said he hoped Israel
and the Palestinians would develop ``the kind of relationship so
necessary to forge peace over the long term.''
	   The players themselves were more cautious. Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the testy relations could
improve somewhat. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said he
expected ``more bumps along the road.''

Solnechny, just outside St. Petersburg.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   Ice fishing, especially in the coldest of winter, has been a

Sosa wins MVP in landslide over McGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sammy Sosa was voted the National League Most
Valuable Player on Thursday in a landslide over Mark McGwire, his
rival in the most memorable home run chase ever.
	   Sosa, who finished second to McGwire with 66 homers, got 30 of
32 first-place votes and 438 points in balloting by the Baseball
Writers' Association of America.
	   ``I would have voted for Mark,'' Sosa said from Chicago during a
telephone conference call. ``In my heart, Mark McGwire is still the
man for me.''
	   McGwire, who set the record with 70 homers, got the other two
first-place votes and 272 points. Two sports writers for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch both voted for McGwire and listed Sosa second.
	   ``It's hard to hit 70 home runs and not win MVP,'' Sosa said.
``I was never so sure to myself that I had it until today.''
	   While Sosa was first or second on every ballot, McGwire got 20
seconds, three thirds, one fourth, four fifths, one sixth and one
seventh.
	   Sosa, given a hero's welcome when he returned to his native San
Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic last month, created a
historic Latin American sweep. Texas' Juan Gonzalez, who is Puerto
Rican, won the AL MVP on Wednesday.
	   Sosa, a former teammate of Gonzalez in the Rangers minor-league
system, is the second Dominican to win an MVP, joining George Bell
(1987). Sosa intends to return home Friday to resume his relief
efforts following the damage caused by Hurricane Georges.
	   Sosa hit .308 with a major league-leading 158 RBIs _ one more
than Gonzalez _ as Chicago reached the postseason for the first
time since 1989. He also led the majors with 132 runs and 414 total
bases.
	   McGwire, who smashed Roger Maris' previous home run mark of 61,
finished with 147 RBIs and a .299 average as the Cardinals stumbled
to a third-place finish in the NL Central, 19 games behind Houston
and seven behind the wild-card Cubs. McGwire led the majors in
walks (162), slugging percentage (.752) and on-base percentage
(.470).
	   ``My reputation outside the field, that counts a lot,'' Sosa
said. ``Maybe people took it from there.''
	   Even St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa thought Sosa had
the edge when it came to MVP voting,
	   ``I'm so biased it's ridiculous, but I think Sammy deserves
it,'' he during the season's final week. ``I don't think he's done
more for his team than Mark has, but his team has done more than
ours has, so his contribution counts for a little more in my book.
Just barely, but that's who I would give it to.''
	   Sosa, who was in Japan for the major league all-star tour,
returned to Chicago for the announcement. McGwire, who remained on
vacation in Australia, said late in the season that a team's finish
shouldn't be taken into account.
	   ``It should be the guy who has the best overall year, no matter
if his team is in last place or first place,'' he said.
	   Houston's Moises Alou was third with 215 points, followed by San
Diego's Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 homers and wound up with 185
points. Houston's Craig Biggio was fifth with 163 points, followed
by Atlanta's Andres Galarraga (147), San Diego's Trevor Hoffman
(117) and San Francisco's Barry Bonds (66).
	   It was the eighth time a Cubs player won the MVP, the first
since Andre Dawson in 1987.

Gonzalez, happy with second MVP in three years, just as pleased for

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ The skinny guys with the big swings from
the 1987 Gastonia Rangers sure have come a long way.
	   Juan Gonzalez won the American League MVP for the second time in
three years on Wednesday, and Sammy Sosa, Gonzalez's long-ago
teammate and still a good friend, received the Natinal League honor
on Thursday.
	   Gonzalez is the first native Latin American player with two
MVPs, and this is the first time Latin players have swept the award
in both leagues. Gonzalez is from Puerto Rico and Sosa from the
Dominican Republic.
	   ``Absolutely, it would be a special moment for all Latin America
for both players to win the MVP award in the same year,'' Gonzalez
said in a conference call from San Juan.
	   Gonzalez began the year on a monster RBI pace, driving in 101 by
the All-Star break to join Hank Greenberg as the only players to
crack the century mark by the season's traditional midpoint.
	   While most of North America tracked Mark McGwire and Sosa
pursuing Roger Maris' mark of 60 homers, Texas fans followed
Gonzalez's pursuit of Hack Wilson's record of 190 RBIs in 1930.
	   But after reaching 116 RBIs in 105 games, Gonzalez injured his
hamstring, and his production tailed off. He still finished with
157, the most in the AL since Boston teammates Ted Williams and
Vern Stephens had 159 in 1949. Sosa, however, drove in 158 to lead
the majors.
	   Gonzalez admitted he really wanted the record.
	   ``I was disappointed a little bit because when I drove in the
first 101 in the first half, I had a great chance,'' he said.
	   Gonzalez came into this season determined to put up huge
numbers. He worked out with a trainer all offseason and stated his
biggest goal was 162 _ games played. He ended at 154, his most
since 1992, while hitting .318 with 45 homers and an AL-best 50
doubles.
	   ``The key for this year was staying healthy, playing 154
games,'' Gonzalez said. ``When I'm healthy, I'm putting (up) the
best numbers I can.''
	   A healthy Gonzalez also bodes well for the Rangers. They won
their second AL West title this season, the other coming in '96
when Gonzalez won his first MVP.
	   Gonzalez won the 1996 award 290-287 over Seattle shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, a margin he called ``too tight.'' This time, he received
21 first-place votes and seven seconds in balloting by the Baseball
Writers' Association of America to comfortably top Boston shortstop
Nomar Garciaparra, 357-232.
	   Gonzalez is the 22nd player to receive multiple MVPs. The only
other active players in that group are San Francisco outfielder
Barry Bonds, a three-time winner, and Chicago White Sox first
baseman Frank Thomas.
	   As for the '87 Gastonia club, they went 58-52 in the Class A
South Atlantic League. Gonzalez, then 17, hit a team-high 14 homers
while batting .265. Sosa, then 18, hit 11 homers and batted .279.
Both made the majors with the Rangers in 1989, although Sosa was
traded to the Chicago White Sox later that summer.

Russian soccer chief hires bodyguards after threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's soccer federation chief has hired
bodyguards after receiving threats pressuring him to step down
before it's ``too late,'' a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The head of Soviet and then Russian soccer for nearly 20 years,
Vyacheslav Koloskov said the threats were coming from one of his
seven challengers in an election next month to lead the Russian
Football Union, or RFS.
	   ``This person told a close friend and colleague of mine: Tell
Koloskov that if he doesn't leave the RFS willingly then things
will end badly for him,'' Koloskov told the Sport-Express
newspaper.
	   Later he heard from another friend that Koloskov should step
down or else it will be ``too late.''
	   In response, Koloskov hired bodyguards, the newspaper said.
	   The head of the Russian ice hockey federation was gunned down in
a contract killing in 1996, and many prominent athletes have hired
bodyguards.
	   The Russian team has not qualified for the World Cup since 1990
or any major tournament since the 1992 European Championship. In
addition, the team has been hobbled by shortages in government
funding and a demoralizing loss to Iceland last month in qualifying
for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Koloskov's challengers include Dynamo Moscow president Nikolai
Tolstykh, former USSR striker Viktor Ponedelnik and the outspoken
leader of the southern Russian region of Kalmykia, Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, who also heads the International Chess Federation
(FIDE).

Cardinals send Gant to Phillies in five-player deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Ron Gant was traded to the Philadelphia
Phillies on Thursday in a deal that sent reliever Ricky Bottalico
to the St. Louis Cardinals,.
	   The trade also sends reliever Jeff Brantley and starter Cliff
Politte to the Phillies for Bottalico and right-hander Garrett
Stephenson. As part of the deal, the Cardinals will pay in excess
of dlrs 5 million to cover the dlrs 11 million Gant is owed during
the remainder of his contract.
	   ``Ronnie seemed to be genuinely excited about it,'' said Gant's
agent, Bean Stringfellow.
	   Gant, who will be 34 next season, is headed to his fourth team.
He hit .240 with 26 homers and 67 RBIs in 383 at-bats last year
after a .229 season with 17 homers in 1997.
	   He was the premier right-handed power hitter in the lineup when
the Atlanta Braves began a run of seven straight division titles
and four National League pennants in the '90s.
	   The Braves released him in 1994 after Gant broke his leg in a
dirt-bike accident _ one week after he signed a dlrs 5.5 million,
one-year contract that wasn't guaranteed. He later signed with
Cincinnati and then St. Louis, but never recaptured his 30-homer,
30-steal days with the Braves.
	   Gant's departure could mark the beginning of the Cardinals'
revamped outfield. Free agent Brian Jordan has held talks with
Atlanta, Baltimore, the New York Yankees and the New York Mets.
	   Bottalico, 29, finished strong last season as Philadelphia's
closer after missing two months following elbow surgery. Bottalico,
who had six saves after back-to-back seasons with 34, made dlrs 2.2
million last season and is eligible for salary arbitration.
	   With the trade, the Phillies will make the veteran Brantley
their closer until Wayne Gomes is ready to assume the role.
Brantley was 0-5 with a 4.44 ERA and 14 saves last season. He had
44 saves in 1996, but hurt his shoulder early in '97.
	   Politte began last season as the Cardinals' No. 2 starter after
being voted the organization's minor league player of the year in
1997. He pitched well in his debut in his hometown of St. Louis in
the second game of the year, but finished 2-3 with a 6.32 ERA in
eight starts.

Iraq, U.N. arms inspectors cooperate _ to avoid the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on inspections; ADDS quotes from Duelfer;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqis worked
together to avoid the media Thursday, showing new cooperation
between two parties whose stormy relations nearly triggered a
military strike.
	   On the second day of their field work since their return to
Iraq, the weapons inspectors and their Iraqi escorts appeared happy
with the new arrangement.
	   ``We like it this way,'' said an Iraqi escort waiting for the
inspectors in a car outside the U.N. compound.
	   Instead of the old pattern of escorts entering the U.N. compound
and shaking hands with inspectors in front of TV cameras to start
the day, one escort hastily waved from outside the compound's
three-meter-high (10-foot) fence.
	   Immediately afterward, two U.N. vehicles each with three
monitors sped past television camera crews and disappeared onto a
congested highway.
	   The teamwork was in contrast to past dealings between the two
groups, when several planned inspections had to be canceled because
Iraq refused to send escorts required under U.N.-Iraqi agreements.
	   ``Our work is confidential. It is Iraq's business and U.N.
business .... That's the protocol,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told reporters when asked about the speedy exit.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Charles Duelfer, deputy
director of the U.N. Special Commission, said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``We're trying to keep the temperature
down as much as possible.''
	   The inspectors returned to Baghdad on Tuesday and began their
field trips Wednesday after being blocked from working under Iraqi
government orders since Oct. 31.
	   Their return came only after the United States and Britain
threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed full
cooperation with the monitors.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. sanctions on Iraq, imposed
after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, can be lifted. Iraq insists it
already has destroyed all its most dangerous weapons.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that more than seven U.N.
teams went out Thursday. Two visited nuclear sites, one a chemical
site, a biological team visited a military hospital, a number of
teams inspected missile sites and three teams visited monitoring
camps.
	   ``The Iraqi side provided all cooperation for the teams in order
to facilitate their work,'' INA said.
	   Duelfer said Thursday's inspections ``went quite normally and no
problems were reported.''
	   At least seven monitoring teams visited similar types of weapons
sites on Wednesday and INA claimed the Iraqis provided full
cooperation.
	   A U.N. official in New York reported that the inspectors' first
field visits Wednesday came off without a hitch. ``They did a
normal day's work and came back _ no problems,'' said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   It's not clear if the new teamwork by weapons inspectors and
their escorts will last once the inspectors try to make one of
their surprise visits to an Iraqi military installation.
	   In the past, these searches for material related to Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles have led to
sharp clashes.
	   Duelfer told the AP that UNSCOM was still waiting for documents
that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler had requested.
	   ``One of the best ways Iraq can prove its cooperation with the
Special Commission is by providing the documents demanded by the
Special Commission,'' Duelfer said.
	   Butler on Wednesday sent a formal request to Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, asking for documents that Iraq previously
refused to hand over.
	   One is an Iraqi air force account of chemical munitions used in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   In a speech in Philadelphia Wednesday, Butler accused Aziz of
lying. He said he had written Aziz asking to see a copy of the
document.
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Break the habit of a
lifetime and tell me the truth,'' Butler said.
	   Iraq, which has accused Butler of working on behalf of the
Americans, has over the past months called for his resignation.

Religious Jew arrested for planning attack on Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man police said was planning an
attack against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a northern
Israeli city Thursday, was arrested.
	   Israel radio identified the suspect as 48-year-old Shabtai
Blochman, a central figure in the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement.
Blochman was apparently planning to attack Netanyahu in the city of
Tsfat, where the premier was visiting soldiers wounded in Lebanon.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not provide details of the
planned attack. She said the incident was being investigated.
	   The radio said Blochman had organized dozens of Chabad activists
in Tsfat to protest an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the
West Bank set to begin early Friday.
	   Israel radio said that Blochman, like many in the Chabad
movement, had been active in Netanyahu's 1996 election campaign and
felt betrayed by the prime minister for giving up land to
Palestinians that religious Jews believe was promised to them by
God.

Meissnitzer captures giant slalom at Park City
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second run &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer, gaining
speed and time at every gate, stormed to an overwhelming victory in
a women's World Cup giant slalom on Thursday.
	   Meissnitzer, fastest by a mere .15 seconds after the morning
run, showed total domination in the afternoon to win by a stunning
2.16 seconds.
	   Her time of 2 minutes, 18.13 seconds left defending World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl of Germany far back in second,
with Liechtenstein's Birgit Heeb gaining her first-ever podium
finish in 2:20.39.
	   After a first run conducted on the hard snow and brilliant
sunshine that are trademarks of the Park City Mountain Resort, the
top 30 racers who qualified for the second run had to fight not
only the clock but flat light and snow squalls that intensified as
the afternoon progressed.
	   The flat light, caused by heavy cloud cover that moved in just
before the afternoon session, made it especially difficult to make
the transition from the relatively flat upper section to the steep
middle pitch. Until Ertl and then Meissnitzer came down, Heeb was
the only racer able to carry enough speed off the middle section to
keep from getting bogged down on the flats leading to the finish.
	   Even Ertl wasn't as good as Heeb in the second run, and she lost
most of the .86-second margin she had on the Liechtensteiner after
the first run. Had the second run been a few yards longer, she
might have failed to grab second.
	   All that became moot after Meissnitzer rolled down the mountain.
As on the first run, when she was fastest as the first racer of the
day, she was flawless at the top. Where others struggled with the
transition change from flat to steep, she carved strong turns that
only added to her speed. By the time she reached the flats, she was
ahead by almost two seconds and adding to the margin with every
gate. When she flashed across the finish line, she knew she had won
and it was only the incredible margin of victory that caused her to
throw her arms in the air and sink to her knees in the snow.
	   Meissnitzer's fourth career victory and Heeb's first-ever podium
overshadowed some other starting results. One was turned in by
16-year-old rising star Janica Kostelic of Croatia, a stunning
fourth and only .37 out of the top three. Added to the 12th she had
in the season-opening race at Solden, Austria three weeks ago, she
has branded herself as an immediate factor in the battle to rest
away Ertl's title.
	   Placing a heartening seventh was Austria's 31-year-old former
World Cup overall champion Anita Wachter, whose career appeared
over after a knee injury in a crash just before the Olympics last
season. Wachter fought back through the summer and, displaying the
light touch that has been her trademark since 1985, appeared to be
as good as ever.
	   The United States got a boost when Sarah Schleper of Vail,
Colo., considered more of a threat in slalom, finished 16th in
2:21.89. Schleper had a start number of 39, a disadvantage she
overcame by placing 18th in the first run. Teammate Alex Shaffer of
Aspen, Colo., who was .01 slower than Schleper as the 40th starter,
struggled a bit in the afternoon but still earned five points by
placing 26th in 2:23.52.
	   Canada, like the United States, was figured to serve as
also-rans in an event expected to be the sole domain of Europeans.
But Allison Forsyth, who just qualified for a second run by placing
29th, improved five spots for 24th in 2:22.91.

Serb leader accuses ethnic Albanians of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of three Serb police injured. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks without international mediation.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic visited Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, on Thursday, the day after the Serbian president
attempted to meet directly with leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   The successive trips to Kosovo were an attempt to assert
Serbia's authority over the southern province, despite continued
Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful solution. Hundreds have
been killed and about a quarter of a million people in Kosovo left
homeless since Serbs cracked down on separatist ethnic Albanian
rebels in February.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks called
by Serb President Milan Milutinovic, saying a basic agreement on
the future of the province must come first _ With international
mediation.
	   In Belgrade on Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier
Vojislav Seselj accused the United States of backing the ethnic
Albanian boycott. He said U.S. mediator Christopher Hill can only
be a guest at any negotiations.
	   The Serb leadership has rejected a draft version of a plan
proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro. Milutinovic
instead offered Kosovo self-rule, with its own authorities and
police, but under Serb rule.
	   Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring
soldiers and police officers who participated in the crackdown,
Marjanovic blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace.
	   He accused the ethnic Albanians of ``causing great damage to
everybody, including a big majority of Albanians who want to live
and work in Kosovo with the others'' by boycotting the talks and
said Serbia's top priority was to ``preserve peace and freedom,
territorial integrity and sovereignty.''
	   Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said a
49-year-old doctor was killed and his daughter wounded when three
masked assailants broke into their home in Pec, some 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Pristina.
	   The Serbian Media Center reported three Serb police were
wounded, one seriously, on a road in western Kosovo late Wednesday
in an attack by ethnic Albanian rebels.

Investigators raid offices of India's largest private company

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Federal sleuths raided offices of
India's largest private company Thursday, looking for evidence
against a top executive allegedly involved in a sensational
political scandal.
	   Police say Reliance Industries Group President V.
Balasubramanian, who has been on the run since investigators
charged him last month, received top-secret government documents
before they were presented in Parliament. Investigators have not
given details on the documents.
	   S.M. Khan, spokesman for the Central Bureau of Investigation,
said raids were ordered to investigate alleged violations of the
Official Secrets Act by Balasubramanian. A federal officer said on
condition of anonymity that searches were carried out in offices in
New Delhi and Bombay.
	   The New Delhi police, which filed a case against Balasubramanian
before federal investigators took over the investigation, said he
received classified papers from Romesh Sharma, alleged to be a
master swindler with close links to powerful politicians,
bureaucrats and Mafia gangs.
	   Sharma was arrested last month and charged with bribing top
Indian politicians from various political parties in return for
business deals. His alleged wrongdoing reads like a racy thriller _
a mix of political rackets, sexual scandals, underhand deals and
extortion of large sums of money from influential people.
	   Officials of Reliance Industries _ a conglomerate with interests
ranging from oil and gas production to petrochemicals, textiles and
weaving _ initially denied that the raids had occurred, then said
that ``nothing incriminating'' was found.
	   ``Reliance has never obtained or used any documents or
information covered by the provisions of the OSA (Official Secrets
Act) for any purposes,'' Reliance said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press from the company's Bombay headquarters.
	   ``Allegations and misinformation to the contrary are being
continuously unleashed on the media by our known corporate
rivals.'' it said.
	   Investigators also searched the 18-story residence of Reliance
chairman Dhirubhai Ambani in Bombay's plush Cuffe Parade
neighborhood, Press Trust of India reported.
	   At the country's main stock market, reports of the raids created
unease on the Bombay Sensitive Index, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
However, the market and Reliance stocks were down only slightly at
the market's close Thursday.

Lyon downs leader Marseille as Bordeaux edges closer to top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Lyon ended league leader Marseille's 18-match
unbeaten run with a 2-1 win Thursday as Bordeaux - the other team
in what has become a two-horse race for the French title - picked
up three vital points at Monaco.
	   Marseille, unbeaten in 14 league and four European games this
season, went behind to a 17th minute goal from David Linares.
	   Linares, 10 yards (meters) from goal, saw his cross bounce off
Laurent Blanc, but smashed in the rebound.
	   Philippe Violeau doubled the lead in the 56th minute when he
curled in a fine 20-yard (meter) free kick over the defensive wall.
	   Lyon, which climbed to fourth place with the win, had dominated
possession.
	   In the second half, Marseille coach Rolland Courbis brought on
playmaker Robert Pires and strikers Florian Maurice and Christophe
Dugarry - three internationals surprisingly on the substitutes'
bench despite the absence of the injured Fabrizio Ravanelli.
	   Courbis preferred to start with powerful frontman Titi Camara
and gave a debut to Arthur Moses.
	   Late on, Marseille, which had won its previous eight games,
attacked feverishly, and Maurice tapped in a goal against his
former club in the 76th minute.
	   Lyon defender Jacek Bak was sent off for a violent tackle on
Pires in the 84th minute but the home side held on.
	   Bordeaux moved up to 35 points, one point behind Marseille, with
a 2-0 win at Monaco, which had won each of its six previous home
games this season.
	   Bordeaux, the loser on its previous five visits to the Louis II
Stadium, took the lead in the sixth minute when a left wing cross
from Herve Alicarte bounced off Lilan Laslandes into the net.
	   Minutes later, Monaco goalkeeper Fabien Barthez saved
brilliantly from Sylvain Wiltord.
	   But in the 37th minute, Johan Micoud collected a Laslandes
through ball 20 yards (meters) from goal and lobbed Barthez to make
it 2-0.
	   Monaco, emerging from an early-season injury crisis, welcomed
back Martin Djetou and Sylvain Legwinski, who both came on as
substitutes.
	   Monaco, the 1997 French champion, now lies in a distant fifth
place.
	   Friday's top game sees Rennes, in third place with 27 points,
travel to inconsistent Paris Saint-Germain.

First Palestinian planes ready for take-off

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the
young Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone on
the road to maturity: its very own airport.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and
Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport
Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport
would open Sunday.
	   The airport has been nearly completed for months but Thursday
officials there added a few extra touches of yellow paint and fresh
flowers.
	   It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.
	   Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by
car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted the
first international flight may be reserved for U.S. President Bill
Clinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the first plane to land
would be carrying Egypt's health minister and several doctors
bearing medical supplies as gifts.
	   Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, has
forbidden its own citizens from using the airport initially,
Israel's Channel 2 TV said. And all flights, which must be approved
by Israel in advance, would not be allowed to fly over their
airspace.
	   After touring the airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more
work needed to be done before the airport was ready for Clinton.
	   ``It may be a landing site for President Clinton, but we're not
confirming,'' said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``When you fly Air Force One, you're flying several planes and a
lot of equipment,'' he said.
	   The airport will be the first unfettered access route
Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.

Cuban exiles to appeal Spanish judge's rejection of suit against
</HEADLINE>
Castro &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Cuban exile group said Thursday it would
appeal a Spanish judge's refusal to open a probe into allegations
of genocide, terrorism and torture filed against Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
	   ``We will appeal the decision within the statutory three days
allowed,'' said lawyer Javier Barrilero who represents the
Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba.
	   Earlier Thursday, National Court Judge Ismael Moreno rejected
the foundation's petition for an investigation. The judge said the
suit, filed Nov. 5, referred to common crimes committed outside
Spain that were not within Spanish jurisdiction.
	   The Cuban petition was inspired by National Court probes into
human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that developed into an
extradition request against former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet, accused of the same three charges.
	   On Oct. 30 the National Court gave a green light Moreno's
colleague Judge Baltasar Garzon to seek Pinochet's trial in Spain
on the basis of crimes committed during his 1973-1990 regime that
it considered could be reasonably described as genocide, terrorism
and torture. Under Spanish law these crimes are not subject to
national boundaries.
	   According to Barrilero, Moreno's initial rejection of the
foundation's suit was ``not a surprise.''
	   ``The case against Castro was inspired by the Pinochet case but
has since become independent. The road does not stop here,'' he
said.
	   Barrilero said his clients would take their case all the way up
the Spanish judicial system, and were studying the possibility of
involving international courts.
	   Moreno's ruling said the petition failed to present credible
evidence that Castro, and several close associates also named in
the suit, had committed genocide by attempting to eliminate a group
of people.
	   The judge also said that none of those named could be accused of
terrorism because they were all high government officials seeking
to bolster rather than subvert the state order, the Spanish news
agency Europa Press reported.
	   Further, Moreno's ruling said that the alleged cases of torture
were better described as ``degrading treatment,'' the agency
reported.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro.
	   Its Spanish suit was backed with papers detailing the cases of
about 120 people who allegedly suffered torture or other abuses by
Castro's government, were executed or died while in Cuban jails or
in police custody.
	   Another 18,000 people were also named, including some from North
America and Spain, who were allegedly killed or disappeared in Cuba
since 1959 when Castro took power.
	   The suit also accused Castro's brother Raul, Tourism Minister
and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and Carlos Amat, Cuba's
ambassador in Geneva and also a former member of the military.
	   Immediately after the suit was filed, Spanish Foreign Minister
Abel Matutes said it could not prosper because Castro holds
diplomatic immunity as a head of state.
	   Barrilero said these comments were ``understandable'' because
Matutes was on the point of visiting Cuba on an official tour, but
were ``legally inappropriate'' given the Spanish government's
refusal to comment on the Pinochet case.
	   Garzon had Pinochet arrested in London on Oct. 16, and the
Spanish government formally requested his extradition earlier this
month but has repeatedly insisted that it is a purely legal matter
and refused to comment.
	   Meanwhile, the possibility that Pinochet could be extradited to
Spain depends on a decision due Wednesday from Britain's House of
Lords on whether the aging former dictator is entitled to immunity
as a former head of state.

Meissnitzer captures giant slalom at Park City
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Alexandra Meissnitzer, gaining speed and
time at every gate, stormed to an overwhelming victory in a women's
World Cup giant slalom on Thursday.
	   The Austrian, fastest by a mere .15 seconds after the morning
run, showed total domination in the afternoon to win by a stunning
2.16 seconds.
	   Meissnitzer, a pal of Olympic gold medalist Picabo Street,
sounded like her American friend in describing her winning race.
	   ``I just decided to, you know, go for it,'' said Meissnitzer,
whose effervescent personality demolishes the stereotype that
Austrians are bleak, austere automatons.
	   Her time of 2 minutes, 18.13 seconds left defending World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl of Germany far back in second,
with Liechtenstein's Birgit Heeb gaining her first-ever podium
finish in 2:20.39.
	   ``I was nervous because it was still snowing when it was my
turn,'' Ertl said. ``My light was not as good as Meissnitzer. After
getting a second (after a disappointing 10th in the season opener),
I'm looking forward to my next race a lot more.''
	   After a first run conducted on the hard snow and brilliant
sunshine that are trademarks of the Park City Mountain Resort, the
top 30 racers who qualified for the second run had to fight not
only the clock but flat light and snow squalls that intensified as
the afternoon progressed.
	   The flat light, caused by heavy cloud cover that moved in just
before the afternoon session, made it especially difficult to make
the transition from the relatively flat upper section to the steep
middle pitch. Until Ertl and then Meissnitzer came down, Heeb was
the only racer able to carry enough speed off the middle section to
keep from getting bogged down on the flats leading to the finish.
	   For a time, she flirted with becoming the first Leichtenstein
woman to win a race since two-time overall champion Hanni Wenzel,
now head of the country's ski federation, in 1984.
	   ``It (the second run) was more difficult than the first one,
with the snow falling,'' said Heeb, whose four top-five career
finishes have come in the United States _ three in Park City. ``I
had some problems but I still was happy.''
	   Even Ertl wasn't as good as Heeb in the second run, and she lost
most of the .86-second margin she had on the Liechtensteiner after
the first run. Had the second run been a few yards longer, she
might have failed to grab second.
	   All that became moot after Meissnitzer rolled down the mountain.
As on the first run, when she was fastest as the first racer of the
day, she was flawless at the top.
	   Where others struggled with the transition change from flat to
steep, she carved strong turns that only added to her speed. By the
time she reached the flats, she was ahead by almost two seconds and
adding to the margin with every gate. When she flashed across the
finish line, she knew she had won and it was only the incredible
margin of victory that caused her to throw her arms in the air and
sink to her knees in the snow.
	   ``I got a little better light than the skiers in front of me,''
Meissnitzer said. ``The second course was more turny but I decided
I couldn't take it safe.''
	   Meissnitzer's fourth career victory and Heeb's first-ever podium
overshadowed some other starting results. One was turned in by
16-year-old rising star Janica Kostelic of Croatia, a stunning
fourth and only .37 out of the top three. Added to the 12th she had
in the season-opening race at Solden, Austria three weeks ago, she
has branded herself as an immediate factor in the battle to rest
away Ertl's title.
	   Placing a heartening seventh was Austria's 31-year-old former
World Cup overall champion Anita Wachter, whose career appeared
over after a knee injury in a crash just before the Olympics last
season. Wachter fought back through the summer and, displaying the
light touch that has been her trademark since 1985, appeared to be
as good as ever.
	   The United States got a boost when Sarah Schleper of Vail,
Colorado, considered more of a threat in slalom, finished 16th in
2:21.89. Schleper had a start number of 39, a disadvantage she
overcame by placing 18th in the first run. Teammate Alex Shaffer of
Aspen, Colorado, who was .01 slower than Schleper as the 40th
starter, struggled a bit in the afternoon but still earned five
points by placing 26th in 2:23.52.
	   Canada, like the United States, was figured to serve as
also-rans in an event expected to be the sole domain of Europeans.
But Allison Forsyth, who just qualified for a second run by placing
29th, improved five spots for 24th in 2:22.91.

Mexican volcano likely to erupt, geologists say
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YERBA BUENA, Mexico (AP) _ Against the nerve-shattering rumble
of rockslides, army troops on Thursday guarded this abandoned
village on the slopes of Mexico's most active volcano.
	   Soldiers said they spent a nervous night listening to boulders
tumble from the 3,820-meter (12,533 feet) peak of the smoking
Colima Volcano, which geologists say could erupt at any time,
sending lava down its slopes.
	   ``You could hear it last night, a booming sound as rocks tumbled
down the slope,'' Capt. Audelio Ramos said as he stood watch over
the evacuated hamlet of Yerba Buena, eight kilometers (five miles)
from the crater's white plume of gas and water vapor.
	   Geologists say there is also a one-in-three chance that pent-up
lava could blow away the blocked passages of the cone in a massive
explosion, possibly rivaling a 1913 eruption that showered ash and
blew out windows far from the peak.
	   ``The volcano's activity continues to rise ... which means that
the possibilities of an eruption continue to increase,'' a
committee of volcano experts and civil defense officials said in a
joint statement released at a news conference in the city of
Colima, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the peak.
	   ``The small rock dome that has formed on the crater may
collapse, allowing a flow of lava to descend,'' said geologist
Servando de la Cruz of the National Center for Disaster Prevention.
	   Civil defense coordinator Melchior Urrutia said the Colima state
government is prepared to evacuate as many people as necessary.
	   ``It's better to sin by being over-cautious than to pick up
bodies,'' Urrutia said.
	   Officials just hope the peak, also known as the ``Volcano of
Fire,'' will give warning enough to evacuate the towns nearest the
base.
	   ``If the volcano will just give us two hours, we could have
everybody out,'' Capt. Ramos said. Other soldiers nearby tended to
the farm animals left behind by the village's 140 residents when
they were evacuated Wednesday.
	   Yerba Buena _ where abandoned dogs, pigs and chickens wandered
the deserted streets and plastic banners hung for an interrupted
town festival hung limply in the air _ has seen this before.
	   The hamlet is built on an 8-meter (25-foot) thick layer of
debris from ancient eruptions, which residents say only makes the
soil richer. Bulbous squash plants and others crops poke out of the
dark soil on local farms.
	   In recent times, lava has never descended in recent times below
the 2,000-meter (6,500-foot) mark, volcano researcher Carlos
Navarro said _ well above the altitude of the villages.
	   A gaggle of children at the elementary school in La Becerrera,
just 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) down the slope from Yerba Buena, took
a break from studying the little their textbooks say about
volcanoes _ about three paragraphs _ and said they aren't afraid of
the smoking giant above them.
	   ``I would just run away'' if the volcano erupted, said Humberto
Gonzalez Godin, 11. Some older schoolmates said they would try to
catch a ride to the nearest village, 5 kilometers (three miles)
away.
	   Their teacher, Noe Perez Rodriguez, held class outside because
the concrete roof of his former classroom is cracked and may be
vulnerable to earthquakes, another threat during eruptions.
	   ``They did a study last year, and found that the kids who lived
closest to the volcano knew the least about it,'' Perez Rodriguez
said. ``To them, it's just a big, smoky monster.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO is ``deeply concerned'' about the
upsurge in violence in Kosovo this month and condemned the increase
tension which has been brought about by both sides in the conflict,
alliance officials said Thursday.
	   ``These incidents risk creating a dangerous cycle of
provocation,'' NATO said in a statement after the weekly meeting of
the 16 Alliance ambassador. ``It could destabilize the ceasefire.''
NATO had already made similar statements last week.
	   ``Since the beginning of November there has been a sharp
increase in tension resulting from incidents created, in some cases
by Serbian security forces and in other cases by armed Kosovar
elements,'' the statement from the ambassadors said.
	   ``NATO is deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation,''
the Alliance said.
	   Since the Oct. 12 deal U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there have been an
increasing number of attacks in which Serb police or fighters from
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army have been killed.
	   ``NATO is monitoring the situation closely,'' the statement
said.
	   On Thursday, Serbia's prime minister Mirko Marjanovic accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts, a day after
they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed talks.

First SAfrican Cabinet minister to seek amnesty on Monday, offering
</HEADLINE>
glimpses into conflict among black groups &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A painful period of
black-on-black violence in South Africa will be probed next week,
when a Cabinet minister seeks amnesty before a human rights panel.
	   Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe is applying for amnesty from
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for his role in organizing
and arming self defense units (SDUs) that operated in KwaZulu-Natal
from 1990 to 1994, as South African was emerging from decades of
apartheid.
	   He is the first Cabinet minister of the ruling African National
Congress to appear at a public amnesty hearing.
	   Last month, the Truth Commission released a five-volume report
on testimony from victims of apartheid-era political violence and
assigned major blame for human rights violations to the National
Party, apartheid's architect. But it also cited black
anti-apartheid struggle groups for their excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess their crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _ a
process expected to last well into next year as decisions are made
on over 7,000 amnesty applications.
	   The period leading up to 1994's first democratic elections,
while political groups were trying to negotiate an end to white
minority rule, saw a dramatic escalation in violence.
	   Much of it centered in KwaZulu-Natal, where over 5,000 people
died in clashes between Inkatha Freedom Party Zulu nationalists and
the Self Defense Units.
	   The Zulu groups, called Self Protection Units (SPUs), were
backed by the apartheid government, according to the Truth
Commission's report.
	   Radebe was ANC chairman for the KwaZulu-Natal region and also
served as an underground commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of
the Nation), the ANC's armed wing.
	   He acted under direct orders of the armed wing's military
intelligence, Radebe states in his application.
	   Monday's hearing will also consider applications from other high
ranking ANC officials, including a former ANC member of Parliament
and a current captain in the South African National Defense Force
	   The conflict between the ANC and Inkatha spilled over into
Johannesburg's urban areas, 300 kilometers (180 miles) north west
of KwaZulu-Natal. A second amnesty committee will start hearing
applications in Johannesburg on that conflict, also starting
Monday.
	   In the past ten years, over 10,000 people have died in the
Kwa-Zulu clashes that continue to boil over four years after the
elections.

Schleper surprises with 16th-place finish in giant slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ With flowing, curly blonde hair that
can't be contained by her helmet, Sarah Schleper cuts a memorable
figure on the slopes.
	   And with a career-best 16th-place finish in the World Cup giant
slalom on Thursday, Schleper served notice that she plans to be
known for her racing prowess as well as her coiffure.
	   Along with Alexandra Shaffer's surprising 26th-place
performance, the first event of the four-day America's Opening was
a solid success for the home team. Their feats were even more
impressive considering their late starting numbers: 39th for
Schleper and 40th for Shaffer.
	   A small but vocal Park City crowd cheered both Americans down
the slopes and carried them to their best World Cup finishes.
	   ``There's nothing like racing at home and hearing the crowd
cheer,'' Schleper said. ``They were great.''
	   Schleper hopes to use a strong finish in the Park City event as
a steppingstone to greater success, just like top American skier
Kristina Koznick did last season. Koznick placed fourth in the 1997
slalom on the same course and went on to a stellar year.
	   ``I wanted to finish well, but the bottom line was I wanted to
finish, period,'' Schleper said.
	   She tamed the tricky C.B.'s Run in a solid morning performance,
finishing 18th with a time of 1:07.01 in the first run. She
credited her success to concentrating on her own performance
instead of watching the European stars before her.
	   ``It makes you feel like you're not part of it when you watch
too much,'' Schleper said. ``I just wanted to concentrate on
myself.''
	   On her second run, Schleper finished just as a light snow began
to dust the course. Visibility immediately decreased near the top
of the run, and many later skiers struggled.
	   ``Well, God's in charge of time, and he gave me a little
today,'' she said.
	   Long considered a slalom specialist, Schleper has actually
enjoyed her greatest international success in giant slalom in
recent months. Last season, she scored her first World Cup points
and also won her first national title, but she accomplished both
feats in the GS discipline.
	   ``The snow was easy today,'' Schleper said. ``I was thinking
that I could definitely finish well here.''
	   Schleper, 19, also drew inspiration from her father, Buzz, and
brother, Hunter, who made the trek to Park City from their hometown
of Vail, Colorado, where Buzz owns a ski shop.
	   ``It's great having my family here,'' Schleper said. ``It gives
you that little extra incentive.''
	   Schleper's previous best World Cup finish was 24th in the giant
slalom last season at Are, Sweden. She also competed at the Nagano
Olympics.
	   She closed the season by winning the national championship in GS
at Jackson, Wyoming, beating since-retired Julie Parisien and
Caroline Lalive, who finished out of the second run on Thursday.

Radical Palestinians prepare for anti-peace accord conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Radical Palestinian factions said
Thursday they will hold a conference next month to protest Yasser
Arafat's plans to annul a reference in the Palestinian national
charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
	   A statement issued by representatives of the eight Syria-based
groups said a committee has been assigned to prepare for the
``general popular Palestinian conference in the Diaspora to condemn
the amendment.''
	   Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for Israel's
destruction are to be amended by the central committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization in December.
	   The radical Palestinian factions said their conference will be
held between 12-16 December, but the venue has not yet been
decided, although Damascus has been mentioned a possibility.
	   Members of Arafat's Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream
faction, dominate the 600-member Palestine National Council, the
parliament in exile. But the radical groups may be able to head off
any charter change by denying Arafat a quorum for the meeting.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the
fledgling Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone
on the road to maturity: its own airport.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and
Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport
Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport
would open Sunday.
	   The airport has been nearly completed for months. On Thursday,
officials added a few extra touches of yellow paint and fresh
flowers.
	   It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.
	   Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by
car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted the
first international flight may be reserved for U.S. President Bill
Clinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the first plane to land
would be carrying Egypt's health minister and several doctors
bearing medical supplies as gifts.
	   Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, has
forbidden its own citizens from using the airport initially,
Israel's Channel 2 TV said. All flights, which must be approved by
Israel in advance, would not be allowed to fly over Israeli
airspace.
	   After touring the airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more
work was needed to be done before the airport was ready for
Clinton.
	   ``It may be a landing site for President Clinton, but we're not
confirming,'' said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``When you fly Air Force One, you're flying several planes and a
lot of equipment,'' he said.
	   The airport will be the first unfettered access route
Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.

of dlrs 52,000 Barbados (dlrs 26,000 U.S.) and deported Thursday

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government was aware of reports
regarding possible contacts between a reputed Colombian drug
trafficker and associates of Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares, the State Department said Thursday.
	   But spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. officials saw no evidence
to confirm that money from the alleged trafficker, Jose Castrillon
Henao, was used in Perez Balladares' 1994 presidential campaign.
	   ``When the source of this money became known to President
Balladares, he had that fact publicly disclosed and asked his
attorney general to investigate,'' Rubin said.
	   Rubin's comments were in response to a Washington Post story
alleging that Castrillon channeled hundreds of thousands of dollars
into Balladares' campaign and established business links to the
president's son-in-law.
	   Imprisoned in 1996, the newspaper said Castrillon tried to buy
his way out of jail with dlrs 1 million in bribes.
	   He thought his ploy succeeded last May when police escorted him
to a waiting helicopter that he believed would take him home to
Cali, the report said.
	   Instead, according to the Post, he was transferred to a U.S. air
base in Panama from where he was flown to Florida. He is imprisoned
in Tampa facing charges of smuggling 34 tons of cocaine to the
United States on behalf of the Cali cartel.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ After nearly two years of U.S. prodding
and bitter disputes with the Palestinians, the Israeli government
reluctantly gave the final go-ahead Thursday to withdrawing troops
from a chunk of the West Bank the size of Chicago.
	   The Cabinet narrowly approved the decision, 7-5, with three
abstentions, after acrimonious debate. It marked a point of no
return for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who since taking
office in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace process and now faces
the loss of support of key allies.
	   In anticipation of winning full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority
staged a jubilant parade in the farming town of Jenin in the
northern West Bank on Thursday. Most of the land to be handed over
is near Jenin.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   Two percent, or 110 sq. kilometers (44 square miles), of the
West Bank land in the agreement approved Thursday is being
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In
addition, 7.1 percent, or 400 sq. kilometers (160 square miles), of
the land in the deal moves from joint jurisdiction to sole
Palestinian control.
	   The Palestinians already have full control of 3 percent of the
West Bank and joint jurisdiction over another 24 percent.
	   Unlike earlier pullbacks, this one held little promise of drama.
	   No army bases are being dismantled and all Israeli and
Palestinian troops have to do is move yellow-and-black road markers
the size of washing machines to road junctions to demarcate the new
dividing lines.
	   On Thursday night, the cement blocks were still lined up behind
the barbed wire fence of the Israeli army base of Dotan, south of
Jenin. On Friday morning, Israeli and Palestinian officers were
expected to meet to finalize the transfer with a handshake,
followed by an evacuation of Israeli troops expected to be
completed in a few hours.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a housewife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were indifferent to the prospect of coming under
full Palestinian rule. No Arafat posters or Palestinian flags
decorated the streets in anticipation.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet just barely approved the first stage
of the peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent
of the West Bank in three stages by the end of January, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers backed stage one, with
five voting against, three abstaining and two abroad. Surprisingly,
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who helped negotiate the accord at
Wye Plantation in Maryland last month, abstained Thursday, saying
he felt the Palestinians had not lived up to all their commitments.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two.
	   If Netanyahu's coalition unravels, he could be forced to new
elections. The Labor-led opposition is pledged to back Netanyahu on
the peace process, but will not necessarily prop up his government
if hard-liners bolt.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man police believed to be planning
an attack against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday has
been arrested.
	   Israel radio identified the suspect as 48-year-old Shabtai
Blochman, a central figure in the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement.
Blochman was apparently planning to attack Netanyahu in the city of
Safed, where the premier was visiting soldiers wounded in Lebanon.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not provide details of the
planned attack. She said the incident was being investigated.
	   The radio said Blochman had organized dozens of Chabad activists
in Tsfat to protest an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the
West Bank set to begin early Friday.
	   Israel radio said that Blochman, like many in the Chabad
movement, had been active in Netanyahu's 1996 election campaign and
felt betrayed by the prime minister for giving up land to
Palestinians that religious Jews believe was promised to them by
God.

Rebel turned congressman may finally get U.S. visa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A former rebel who now serves in
Brazil's congress may finally be going to the United States, a
country that has barred him from its shores.
	   U.S. immigration laws have long blocked Fernando Gabeira from
visiting America because he helped orchestrate the kidnapping of a
U.S. ambassador in 1969.
	   However, the 57-year-old lawmaker has recently been appointed as
a congressional observer to the U.N. General Assembly, which will
meet later this month in New York.
	   ``It's been a long fight'' to gain entry into the United States,
Gabeira told The Associated Press. ``But this time it will be much
more difficult for them to say `no.'''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Davidson said, ``Until we receive a
visa application from Mr. Gabeira, we have no official position.''
	   Gabeira, the lone congressional representative of Brazil's Green
Party, says his days of anti-Americanism are long over. ``The U.S.
government must overcome its incapacity to forget the past,'' he
said.
	   In his latest attempt to get a visa, Gabeira was refused entry
in January to attend the New York premiere of ``Four Days in
September,'' a movie about the kidnapping of U.S. Ambassador
Charles Burke Elbrick.
	   Elbrick, who received a blow to the head, was held for four days
and released after the then-military dictatorship allowed 15
political prisoners to be flown out of the country.
	   Gabeira, who was later shot and nearly killed by military
agents, was released himself in a prisoner exchange for a kidnapped
German ambassador. After spending nine years in exile, he returned
to Brazil under a 1979 amnesty.
	   Gabeira has made radical changes in his life since his days as a
member of the left-wing MR-8, the revolutionary group that nabbed
Elbrick as he drove to work.
	   These days, the congressman's fights include saving the Amazon,
promoting gay and indigenous rights and legalizing nudity on
Brazilian beaches. He now says that ``violence is not the right
response, under any circumstances.''
	   If Gabeira comes for the U.N. meeting, he could be restricted to
a 24-mile (40-kilometer) limit of New York as was Cuban leader
Fidel Castro during his last visit to the United Nations, a U.S.
official said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Rescue teams have recovered the bodies of 21
people who were aboard two helicopters that crashed while flying
between offshore rigs in the southern Gulf of Mexico, government
oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos said Thursday.
	   One more person is missing and presumed dead.
	   In a press release, Pemex said that 20 of the victims have been
identified and that the search by Pemex and Mexican navy teams for
the last victim was continuing.
	   The two helicopters collided Wednesday while flying between two
offshore platforms in the Campeche Sound.
	   Most of the victims were Pemex workers, but also included four
crew members of the two aircraft, which belonged to the private
companies Pegaso and Asesa.
	   Three of the victims were identified as working for private
companies Perforadora Central, Bechtel and Construcciones Maritimas
Mexicanas.
	   Pemex has denied reports published by several Mexico City
newspapers that one of the victims was a foreign citizen.

Bear nicknamed `Dracula' kills cattle and deer in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLUJ, Romania (AP) _ A giant black bear, whom peasants have
nicknamed ``Dracula,'' is creating anxiety in western Romania
because of his taste for cattle and sheep, an official said
Thursday.
	   Peasants whose livestock has been devoured by the bear have
lodged seven complaints in the past six weeks, said Nicolae Onetiu,
head of the state hunting and fishing reserves in western Romania.
	   Dracula was named after the Transylvanian vampire count of
legend because of his bloody appetite, Onetiu said. The male bruin
weighs at least 660 pounds (300 kilos) and has moved closer to
inhabited areas from forested regions with the onset of cold
weather, but is apparently not yet ready to hibernate.
	   Dracula has killed at least six cows and seven sheep over the
past six weeks.
	   State rangers count 135 bears living in the Apuseni Mountains in
western Romania, all of them protected by law.

Police cop thorny problem with gift of roses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Wellington police were left with
a thorny problem when a gift of roses from a man they had arrested
earlier turned out to be stolen.
	   The roses were rare blooms from the local Botanical Gardens _
and a gardener reporting their theft spotted them on display at the
police public counter.
	   The police reaction was swift. They re-arrested the rose thief,
and removed the embarrassing blooming evidence from public display.
	   The man charged with the rose theft had delivered the flowers
Thursday in appreciation at how police had handled a charge laid
against him. He said he wanted them to go to a female officer on
duty.
	   Wellington Botanic Gardens supervisor Leanne Killalea went to
the central police station to report the theft from the garden's
flowerbeds.
	   She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the vase of the prize
blooms on the counter.
	   ``There they were our roses,'' Killalea said. ``I couldn't
believe it. They're unique. They couldn't have come from anywhere
else.''
	   Inspector Dave Allan said the rose gift-giver, charged earlier
with misuse of a telephone, also faces a charge of stealing the
roses.

Patriots, Connecticut governor announce deal on moving team

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ The New England Patriots struck a
tentative deal Thursday to move from suburban Boston to Hartford,
in what could leave another major U.S. city without an American
football team but elevate Hartford's image from that of one big,
dull insurance office.
	   The Patriots' plans to move 77 miles (123 kilometers) from
Foxboro, Massachusetts, to the Connecticut capital by 2001 touched
off a celebration among many of Hartford's 135,000 people.
	   ``This puts us back in the national spotlight,'' crowed Mayor
Mike Peters. ``To be known as a National Football League city will
do wonders for our image.''
	   The move is subject to approval by the Connecticut Legislature
and the National Football League owners.
	   The proposal calls for a 68,000-seat, dlrs 350 million stadium,
part of a dlrs 1 billion development on the banks of the
Connecticut River. The state would use bonds to pay for the
stadium, recouping the money in part through a 10 percent tax on
tickets.
	   ``This puts us, if you will, on the 10-yard line and a goal to
go,'' said state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan of
West Hartford. ``But we all know those last 10 yards are tough
yards.''
	   The Patriots would be the fifth NFL franchise to shift cities in
three years, and the move would be yet another instance in which a
major city lost a team to a second-tier community. Los Angeles and
Houston, two of the biggest TV markets in the country, no longer
have football teams.
	   The loss of another big city will be on the minds of NFL owners
when they meet early next year to consider the Patriots' move out
of the nation's sixth-largest TV market and into the 27th.
	   ``The critical aspect of today's announcement ... is that the
team remains in New England in a new state-of-the-art stadium,''
the NFL said in a statement.
	   Hartford, the longtime capital of America's insurance industry,
has spent years trying to overcome an image as a boring,
second-tier city _ a ``milemarker between Boston and New York,'' as
Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland put it Thursday. Just two years
ago, Hartford lost another sports franchise _ the Whalers of the
National Hockey League _ to North Carolina.
	   The arrival of the Patriots would not only make the city more
attractive to companies and residents but would also create as many
as 10,000 new jobs in downtown Hartford, the mayor said.
	   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci doubted his state could have
put together the ``extraordinarily sweet deal'' the Patriots got in
Hartford.
	   ``There are lots of Massachusetts fans that love the Patriots
like I do. I feel for the Massachusetts fans,'' he said.
	   Founded as the Boston Patriots in 1960, the football team has
gone from playing at local college fields to their current home in
Foxboro, 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Boston, where they have
played since 1970.
	   In the past, the Patriots flirted with relocating in Rhode
Island, and there was an earlier attempt to buy the team and move
it to Hartford.
	   Not everyone is convinced Hartford _ situated 102 miles (163
kilometers) from Boston and 111 miles (177 kilometers) from New
York _ can support a football team.
	   Since 1995, the Rams and Raiders have moved from Los Angeles to
St. Louis and Oakland; the Browns left Cleveland for Baltimore; and
the Oilers moved from Houston to Nashville, Tennessee.

Cuban exiles to appeal Spanish judge's rejection of suit against
</HEADLINE>
Castro &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish court on Thursday rejected a
Cuban exile group's petition for an investigation into allegations
of genocide, terrorism and torture filed against Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba said it would appeal
within the statutory three days allowed.
	   National Court Judge Ismael Moreno said the suit, filed Nov. 5,
referred to common crimes committed outside Spain that were not
within Spanish jurisdiction _ and did not cover genocide, terrorism
and torture, crimes that Spanish courts are enabled to consider.
	   The Cuban petition was inspired by National Court probes into
human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that developed into an
extradition request against former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet, accused of the same three charges.
	   ``The case against Castro was inspired by the Pinochet case but
has since become independent,'' said the group's lawyer, Javier
Barrilero. ``The road does not stop here.''
	   On Oct. 30 the National Court gave Judge Baltasar Garzon a green
light to seek Pinochet's trial in Spain on the basis of crimes
committed during his 1973-1990 regime that it considered could be
reasonably described as genocide, terrorism and torture. Under
Spanish law these crimes are not subject to national boundaries.
	   Moreno's ruling said the petition failed to present credible
evidence that Castro, and several close associates also named in
the suit, had committed genocide by attempting to eliminate a group
of people.
	   The judge also said that none of those named could be accused of
terrorism because they were all high government officials seeking
to bolster rather than subvert the state order, the Spanish news
agency Europa Press reported.
	   Further, Moreno's ruling said that the alleged cases of torture
were better described as ``degrading treatment,'' the agency
reported.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro.
	   Its Spanish suit was backed with papers detailing the cases of
about 120 people who allegedly suffered torture or other abuses by
Castro's government, were executed or died while in Cuban jails or
in police custody.
	   Another 18,000 people were also named, including some from North
America and Spain, who were allegedly killed or disappeared in Cuba
since 1959 when Castro took power.
	   The suit also accused Castro's brother Raul, Tourism Minister
and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and Carlos Amat, Cuba's
ambassador in Geneva and also a former member of the military.
	   Barrilero said his clients would take their case all the way
through the Spanish judicial system, and were studying the
possibility of involving international courts.
	   Immediately after the suit was filed, Spanish Foreign Minister
Abel Matutes said it could not prosper because Castro holds
diplomatic immunity as a head of state.
	   Barrilero said these comments were ``understandable'' because
Matutes was about to visiting Cuba on an official tour, but were
``legally inappropriate'' given the Spanish government's refusal to
comment on the Pinochet case.
	   Garzon had Pinochet arrested in London, where he was receiving
medical attention, on Oct. 16, and the Spanish government formally
requested his extradition earlier this month.
	   Pinochet's extradition to Spain depends on a decision due
Wednesday from Britain's House of Lords on whether the aging former
dictator is entitled to immunity as a former head of state.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Delivering hot pizza is a constant
battle for couriers in the traffic-clogged Dutch capital. But one
innovative delivery boy managed to blaze a trail.
	   Officers had to jump to the courier's rescue when they saw smoke
billowing from a heated box attached to the back of his moped to
keep the pizzas warm, police reported Thursday.
	   The delivery boy, unaware of the fire, was riding through a
western suburb when he was stopped Wednesday by police who put out
the blaze, caused by a faulty heating element.
	   ``The pizzas survived, but had an extra-crunchy crust,'' a
police statement said.

X-rays can detect osteoporosis before patients break bones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ An X-ray procedure that has been available for
about five years can diagnose osteoporosis in people before they
break a bone, the government reported Thursday. But it stopped
short of endorsing routine screening.
	   Generally, brittle bone disease goes undiagnosed until a patient
suffers a fracture.
	   The new procedure _ Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry _
identifies dangerously low bone density in patients and takes just
five minutes.
	   Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
used it to screen 2,314 post-menopausal women for brittle bones and
found that 17 percent had osteoporosis. Of those, only 7 percent
said they had been previously diagnosed.
	   However, the CDC decided against recommending routine screening,
even in post-menopausal women, because of the high cost and
uncertainty over whether it would make much of a difference in
treatment. A scan costs dlrs 100 to dlrs 200.
	   Osteoporosis causes about 300,000 hip fractures in the United
States each year, the CDC said.

Iraqi opposition groups urge Clinton against funding Iraqi faction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two of Iraq's main opposition groups have
urged U.S. President Clinton against funding an Iraqi faction in a
bid to topple Saddam Hussein, saying the group does not represent
all of Iraq's opposition.
	   Leaders of the mainly Shiite group, the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
have asked the Clinton administration to stop backing the Iraqi
National Congress, led by Ahmed Chalabi.
	   ``The message expressed concern over attempts to impose one
person or one group to represent the whole Iraqi opposition,'' said
an Iraqi opposition figure close to the two groups by telephone
from London. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the message was conveyed to the U.S. administration by
U.S. diplomats in London.
	   Clinton on Saturday pledged to intensify work with the Iraqi
opposition groups to try to remove Saddam from power. The effort is
part of a plan passed by the Congress earlier this month to
dispense dlrs 97 million to help the dissidents to oust Saddam.
	   The Iraqi National Congress is an umbrella group based in London
that seeks to unite numerous groups opposed to Saddam, the Iraqi
leader.
	   At one time, it succeeded in bringing together Shiite Muslim
groups, former ruling party officials and Kurdish guerrillas who
sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   But the broad coalition crumbled over the years, hampered by
internal divisions, a lack of resources and what the group saw as
wavering U.S. support.
	   Clinton, in calling off a U.S. military attack on Iraq last
weekend, declared the administration would back opposition groups.
	   Chalabi met Thursday with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk.
	   He has proposed that the United States declare the western,
southern and northern parts of Iraq no-fly and no-drive zones for
Iraq's military. This would, in theory, create safe havens for
those wanting to join an opposition army. It would be enforced,
Chalabi says, with U.S. bombers, not ground troops.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man police believed to be planning
an attack against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday has
been arrested.
	   Israel radio identified the suspect as 48-year-old Shabtai
Bloch, a central figure in the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement.
Blochman was apparently planning to attack Netanyahu in the city of
Safed, where the premier was visiting soldiers wounded in Lebanon.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not provide details of the
planned attack. She said the incident was being investigated.
	   The radio said Bloch had organized dozens of Chabad activists in
Safed to protest an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West
Bank set to begin early Friday.
	   Israel radio said that Bloch, like many in the Chabad movement,
had been active in Netanyahu's 1996 election campaign and felt
betrayed by the prime minister for giving up land to Palestinians
that religious Jews believe was promised to them by God.

Cardinals sign Eric Davis, Scott Radinsky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM SALTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The St. Louis Cardinals, looking to remake a
team that has struggled for two seasons, signed free agents Eric
Davis and Scott Radinsky on Thursday and made a five-player trade
with the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   The Cardinals sent left fielder Ron Gant, reliever Jeff Brantley
and minor league right-hander Cliff Politte to the Phillies for
reliever Ricky Bottalico and right-hander Garrett Stevenson. The
Cardinals agreed to pay in excess of dlrs 5 million of the dlrs 11
million Gant is owed in the next two seasons.
	   Davis agreed to an dlrs 8 million, two-year contract and
Radinsky agreed to a dlrs 5.5 million, two-year deal.
	   The Cardinals, favorites to win the NL Central each of the past
two years, finished well short of the playoffs both times, even
with Mark McGwire's 70 home runs.
	   Davis, who hit .327 with 28 homers and 89 RBIs for Baltimore
last season and made dlrs 2.5 million, is expected to replace Gant
in left field. Davis, 36, will earn dlrs 3.5 million in 1999 and
dlrs 4.5 million in 2000.
	   Radinsky, 6-6 with 13 saves and a 2.63 ERA for Los Angeles, gets
dlrs 2.5 million in each of the next two seasons with a dlrs 2.5
million team option for 2001 and a dlrs 500,000 buyout. Radinsky,
30, earned dlrs 900,000 for the Dodgers this season.
	   Ironically, Davis and Radinsky have both overcome cancer. Davis
was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1997, then came back after
chemotherapy and rejoined the team late in the season and in the
playoffs. He was the American League Comeback Player of the Year in
1998.
	   Radinsky was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1994 and missed
the season.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ After nearly two years of U.S. prodding
and bitter disputes with the Palestinians, the Israeli government
reluctantly gave the final go-ahead Thursday to withdrawing troops
from a chunk of the West Bank the size of Chicago.
	   The Cabinet narrowly approved the decision, 7-5, with three
abstentions, after acrimonious debate. It marked a point of no
return for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who since taking
office in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace process and now faces
the loss of support of key allies.
	   In anticipation of winning full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority
staged a jubilant parade in the farming town of Jenin in the
northern West Bank on Thursday. Most of the land to be handed over
is near Jenin.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   Two percent, or 110 sq. kilometers (44 square miles), of the
West Bank land in the agreement approved Thursday is being
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In
addition, 7.1 percent, or 400 sq. kilometers (160 square miles), of
the land in the deal moves from joint jurisdiction to sole
Palestinian control.
	   The Palestinians already have full control of 3 percent of the
West Bank and joint jurisdiction over another 24 percent.
	   Unlike earlier pullbacks, this one held little promise of drama.
	   No army bases are being dismantled and all Israeli and
Palestinian troops have to do is move yellow-and-black road markers
the size of washing machines to road junctions to demarcate the new
dividing lines.
	   On Thursday night, the cement blocks were still lined up behind
the barbed wire fence of the Israeli army base of Dotan, south of
Jenin. On Friday morning, Israeli and Palestinian officers were
expected to meet to finalize the transfer with a handshake,
followed by an evacuation of Israeli troops expected to be
completed in a few hours.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a housewife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were indifferent to the prospect of coming under
full Palestinian rule. No Arafat posters or Palestinian flags
decorated the streets in anticipation.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop.
	   Israel's 17-member Cabinet just barely approved the first stage
of the peace accord under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent
of the West Bank in three stages by the end of January, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers backed stage one, with
five voting against, three abstaining and two abroad. Surprisingly,
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who helped negotiate the accord at
Wye Plantation in Maryland last month, abstained Thursday, saying
he felt the Palestinians had not lived up to all their commitments.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two.
	   If Netanyahu's coalition unravels, he could be forced to new
elections. The Labor-led opposition is pledged to back Netanyahu on
the peace process, but will not necessarily prop up his government
if hard-liners bolt.

Cuban church says government approves 40 more religious workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Roman Catholic Church in Cuba has won
government permission to bring 19 priests and 21 other religious
workers to the island, the first such authorization since the
January visit of Pope John Paul II.
	   The church expects the arrival of ``a few dozen more'' religious
workers to be arranged shortly, church spokesman Orlando Marquez
said Thursday.
	   With the new priests _ five of whom fill existing positions _
Cuba will have just over 300 priests. The country had about twice
as many in 1961, the Castro government embraced communism and began
discouraging religious worship.
	   Government-church relations have improved markedly in recent
years. Even the Communist Party has dropped its ban on religious
believers as members.
	   The Roman Catholic Church remains Cuba's largest religious
organization by far, although Protestant leaders claim that weekly
attendance at their churches roughly equals Catholic services.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The National Party said Friday it
would not launch a legal challenge to prevent the only candidate
from right-wing populist Pauline Hanson's One Nation party from
entering parliament.
	   Heather Hill narrowly defeated the National Party's Bill O'Chee
for a Queensland Senate seat on Oct. 3, but O'Chee said Thursday he
was planning to challenge Hill's victory in court.
	   O'Chee claimed Hill, who became an Australian citizen in May,
was not eligible to enter parliament because she had not renounced
her British nationality.
	   But party officials told O'Chee that he would have to fund any
court action himself, which O'Chee has said he would not do.
	   Hill, who has been in Australia for 26 years, said she was on
safe legal grounds.
	   ``Basically what they say is that I have to take reasonable
steps to ensure that I have removed my British national linkages,''
she said. ``I believe I have done that.''

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Hours before Israel was to hand over
this West Bank village to full Palestinian control as part of the
Mideast peace accord, residents on Thursday yearned for the arrival
of jailed relatives, not Palestinian police.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``We will be much more happy to see the
prisoners than to see the Palestinian police.''
	   In addition to a troop withdrawal from 2 percent of the West
Bank, Israel is also expected to set free 250 Palestinian prisoners
Friday, the first of three groups to be released as part of the
latest peace agreement.
	   The list of prisoners has not been made public and families do
not know whether their relatives will be included in Friday's
release. Residents of this village of 17,000 just south of Jenin,
prepared for arrivals anyway.
	   But no welcomes of any other kind were organized. Absent were
posters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat or national flags
decorating the streets.
	   Badly scarred by years of Israeli occupation, residents seemed
indifferent to falling under Palestinian rule.
	   During their six-year uprising against Israel, known as the
Intefadeh, Qabatieh was notorious for factional killings among
Palestinians. In one instance, a Palestinian accused of
collaborating with Israel was brutally murdered and his mutilated
body strung from an electricity pole for public viewing.
	   The village is also the birthplace of Yehiyeh Ayyash, the
assassinated bomb-maker of the militant Hamas movement which
opposes Arafat's peace-making with Israel. Ayyash was believed to
have master-minded a spate of suicide bombings which killed scores
of Israelis before he was murdered when a rigged mobile phone
exploded in his hand in 1996. His death is widely attributed to
Israel.
	   Qabatieh is one of 24 West Bank villages to come under
Palestinian control Friday as part of the first phase of an Israeli
troop withdrawal agreed upon last month in Washington. After the
hand-over, Palestinian police will enter each community and
maintain a full-time presence.
	   On the eve of the withdrawal, olive presses hummed through the
night after an exhausting day of olive-picking at the height of the
season.
	   Tarek Munasser, a shop keeper said he though people would be
happy to see the Israelis go. ``This means Freedom,'' he said. But
his customer, Adnan Kamil said only prisoners would spark a
celebration.
	   ``People are busy picking olives in the fields,'' Kamil
explained.

Howard says he's still concerned over Anwar's treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday he remains concerned for the welfare of former Malaysian
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim despite a lengthy explanation
from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Howard, speaking on a Melbourne radio station, said Mahathir had
told him that the full story regarding Anwar's sex and corruption
charges was not fully understood by the rest of the world.
	   Mahathir and Howard met during the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Kuala Lumpur this week.
	   ``I told him we were very concerned with what had happened to
his deputy,'' Howard said on radio station 3AW.
	   ``He gave me a lengthy explanation. I didn't change my mind. I'm
still concerned, the Australian government is still concerned.''
	   Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister in September and was
later arrested and charged with sodomy and with fraud in relation
to attempts to cover-up accusations against him.
	   International concern has since been voiced over the treatment
of Anwar while in custody and over his trial.

Patrick Kennedy, newly promoted in House, rules out Senate run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Fresh from his appointment to a top Democratic
post, Rep. Patrick Kennedy said Thursday he will not challenge
Republican Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee in 2000.
	   Kennedy, 31, named this week to head the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, also ruled out running for an
open seat should Chafee retire.
	   ``I'm going to stay in the United States House of
Representatives and run for re-election in 2000,'' Kennedy told The
Associated Press in an interview.
	   By running for the Senate, Kennedy would have been turning his
back on Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a close ally, and other
colleagues who supported him for his promotion against other
contenders.
	   Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of President John
Kennedy and the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, has been much in
demand as a Democratic fund-raiser. Since coming to Congress in
1995, he's raised about dlrs 1.5 million for candidates or the
party, his aides say.

It's a wonderful pain for American skier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Alex Shaffer was in pain _ and loving it.
	   The affable 22-year-old from Aspen, Colorado proved to herself
Thursday that she has the talent and the equipment to compete at
ski racing's highest level after finishing 26th in a women's World
Cup giant slalom.
	   She struggled a bit in the afternoon after a sparkling first run
that left her in 19th place, quite an improvement considering she
started 40th in the field. Despite rattling over the ruts left by
39 previous starters, Shaffer was solid throughout and broke into a
wide grin as soon as she slid to a halt, cheers ringing in her
ears.
	   ``I came through the finish line and I've had a permanent grin
ever since,'' Shaffer said. ``My face hurts, but it's a nice
pain.''
	   Only rarely does a skier make an immediate impact on World Cup
skiing. The vast majority score a point here, two points there in a
torturous climb up the ladder. It's an ascent made even more
difficult if a racer changes ski companies, as Shaffer did over the
summer.
	   ``Any time you switch a company, skis are different and it takes
time to figure out which skis are right for you, to get your
timing, get your whole system up to date,'' she said.
	   It was time that in previous seasons she had devoted to race
training.
	   ``For me, it may have been good because now I've combined all
the focus into a short time. And maybe I do better under pressure
like that,'' she said. ``It's a learning experience.''
	   Shaffer passed a major maturity hurdle last year when she
finished ninth in the combined event of the Winter Olympics. While
she didn't win a medal, she learned she could ski with the best.
	   ``I'm my own worst enemy but I'm also my best friend,'' she
said. ``A lot of times I psyche myself out. For some reason, at the
Olympics I just didn't care. I went down that slalom course like
nothing else mattered.
	   ``And after it was over, I was like, `You know, I belong here.
This is where I can compete.'
	   ``I had a taste then and I lost a little over the summer and in
Solden (the season opener last month in Austria) I had a rough go.
But I have that taste again today.''
	   And she was sporting the smile to prove it.

Jamaica, Botafogo in 1-1 tie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A magnificent curling free kick from
star player Bebeto earned top Brazilian team Botafogo a 1-1 draw
with Jamaica in a friendly international.
	   Bebeto's strike came one minute from full-time and cancelled
striker Deon Burton's equally superb goal for the home team in the
76th minute.
	   Wednesday's match was the first for the Reggae Boyz since their
win over Japan in June in the World Cup and extended their unbeaten
streak at home to 36 matches.
	   The fast-paced game saw the Brazilians having the better of the
early play by making inroads in the Jamaican defense. Their best
chance of the first half came in the third minute when Junior's
header from close range was parried by goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence.
	   The home team came into their own in the second half with the
introduction of Burton, one of the heroes of Jamaica's pre-World
Cup campaign.
	   Burton came close to scoring in the 50th minute but was denied
when his firm shot was saved low down by goalkeeper Silva.
	   Bebeto was also denied by substitute goalkeeper Warren Barrett
in the 63rd minute. His goalbound shot was parried by a sprawling
Barrett after the Brazilian World Cup star was sent clear by a
through pass from midfield.
	   Burton broke the deadlock in the 76th minute after a superb run
by substitute Walter Boyd resulted in a cross that found the Derby
County player unmarked in the penalty area. Burton's acrobatic kick
gave Silva no chance.
	   The Brazilians stepped up the pace and pressed for the
equalizer. They were rewarded ticks before the final whistle when
Bebeto's perfectly placed kick beat Barrett to the far post.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Civil defense authorities warned Thursday that
seismic activity had risen across Peru in recent months and said
they had prepared emergency measures to deal with possible
earthquakes.
	   Dozens of tremors have been detected this year and an earthquake
measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale was felt Thursday near the port
of Chimbote, 225 miles (365 kilometers) northwest of Lima,
seismologists said.
	   No injuries or damages were reported.
	   A civil defense report warned of the ``high probability'' of
earthquakes measuring 4.5 to 5 on the Richter scale along Peru's
Pacific coast and southern desert. It did not specify the time
period.
	   The tremors arise from the collision of the Continental and
Nazca plates off Peru's Pacific coast and geological faults on the
Western side of the Andes mountains, which run the length of the
country, the report said.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Communications Minister
Thursday denied manipulating the privatization of a
telecommunications company in testimony before Congress.
	   In a five hour session, Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros stood
firm amid claims that he disclosed a closed envelope bid by one
company to give a rival an unfair advantage.
	   Barros said he had simply been encouraging as many bidders as
possible to participate in the privatization auction which saw 12
telecommunications companies sold for a total of dlrs 19 billion in
July.
	   But he promised to resign from his post if there was common
consensus he should in Congress.
	   The controversy surrounding Barros began two weeks ago when
illegally recorded segments of his telephone conversations were
published in the Brazilian media. A police investigation into the
phone tapping is underway.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Some 7,000 employees of
the Dominican Electricity Corporation will be laid off in December
as part of plans to privatize the government owned utility,
President Leonel Fernandez announced.
	   The announcement was made Wednesday night shortly after
Fernandez submitted his plan for selling half of the troubled
utility to private companies.
	   Under Fernandez's plan, the government will retain control of
its hydroelectric plants. Nineteen companies interested in buying
the other 50 percent of the utility will submit bids on Dec. 21.
	   Blackouts lasting up to 15 hours have been one of the key
complaints by residents in this Caribbean country.
	   The electric utility has owes more than dlrs 562 million U.S. to
international organizations. It owes private power generators dlrs
139 million.
	   ___
	   LAS MERCEDES, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana pledged
Thursday to continue a U.S.-backed program to eradicate illegal
drug crops, even as he seeks peace with leftist rebels who earn
millions from the crops.
	   ``The fumigations continue and have never been suspended,'' said
Pastrana, inaugurating a police anti-narcotics base in this Andean
mountain town near Neiva, the capital of Huila state, 150 miles
(240 kilometers) southwest of Bogota.
	   The president's comments were apparently to assuage U.S. fears
that anti-narcotics operations will be curtailed due to a troop
pullout now in effect across a massive southern coca-growing region
_ a Pastrana concession to spur peace talks with the guerrillas.
	   The area is a stronghold of the rebels, who finance their
insurgency by taxing peasant producers and protecting drug
traffickers' airstrips and laboratories.
	   The U.S. Congress has threatened to halt a three-year, dlrs 200
million aid program should Pastrana's peace overtures impinge on
the U.S.-funded eradication effort, and in attendance Thursday was
U.S. Sen. Michael DeWine, an Ohio Republican.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Kenneth Starr on Thursday laid out the
evidence against President Bill Clinton that triggered the United
States' third impeachment inquiry, then fended off a withering
attack by Democrats. In a long day in the witness chair, Starr also
said the ``plain language'' of the Constitution makes clear that
Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury after he leaves office,
regardless of the outcome of the impeachment case. The independent
counsel was peppered with criticism of his report outlining grounds
for possible impeachment arising from Clinton's sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Even before Starr began to speak, Democratic
Rep. John Conyers accused the former federal judge of having
``crossed the line into obsession'' with his four-year, dlrs 40
million investigation. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ After nearly two years of U.S. prodding
and bitter disputes with the Palestinians, the Israeli government
reluctantly gave the final go-ahead Thursday to withdrawing troops
from a chunk of the West Bank. The Cabinet narrowly approved the
decision, 7-5, with three abstentions, after acrimonious debate. It
marked a point of no return for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who since taking office in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace
process and now faces the loss of support of key allies. In
anticipation of winning full or partial control of an additional
9.1 percent of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority staged a
jubilant parade in the farming town of Jenin in the northern West
Bank on Thursday. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqis worked
together to avoid the media Thursday, showing new cooperation
between two parties whose stormy relations nearly triggered a
military strike. On the second day of their field work since their
return to Iraq, the weapons inspectors and their Iraqi escorts
appeared happy with the new arrangement. The teamwork was in
contrast to past dealings between the two groups, when several
planned inspections had to be canceled because Iraq refused to send
escorts required under U.N.-Iraqi agreements. Their return came
only after the United States and Britain threatened air strikes
against Iraq unless it resumed full cooperation with the monitors.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish court on Thursday rejected a
Cuban exile group's petition for an investigation into allegations
of genocide, terrorism and torture filed against Cuban leader Fidel
Castro. The Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba said it would
appeal. National Court Judge Ismael Moreno said the suit, filed
Nov. 5, referred to common crimes committed outside Spain that were
not within Spanish jurisdiction _ and did not cover genocide,
terrorism and torture, crimes that Spanish courts are enabled to
consider. The Cuban petition was inspired by National Court probes
into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that developed into
an extradition request against former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet, accused of the same three charges. (SPAIN-CASTRO)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's prime minister accused
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts Thursday, a day
after they failed _ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed
talks without international mediation. Serbian Premier Mirko
Marjanovic visited Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Thursday, the day
after the Serbian president attempted to meet directly with leaders
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Hundreds have been killed and
about a quarter of a million people in Kosovo left homeless since
Serbs cracked down on separatist ethnic Albanian rebels in
February. Ethnic Albanian politicians refused to attend the talks
called by Serb President Milan Milutinovic, saying a basic
agreement on the future of the province must come first _ with
international mediation. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose Thursday, with popular technology
names leading the market back toward record highs after another
encouraging update from Intel. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 14.94 points _ or by 0.17 percent _ at 9,056.05 after swinging
from an early 46-point gain to a 19-point loss. The Dow, which fell
below 7,500 just six weeks ago, is now up about 1,150 points for
the year and 300 points from the July 17 record of 9,337.97.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The heads of nine European stock exchanges,
including the giant Frankfurt and London markets, will meet in
Paris on Nov. 27 to discuss creating a pan-European bourse,
officials said Thursday. ``I think we need a unified market in
financial matters in Europe,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said in an interview broadcast by France Info radio.
The number of stock markets joining, the volume of trade and other
technical details remained to be worked out for the pan-European
exchange, which initially had the support of Britain and Germany,
but not France. The meeting in Paris would mark a significant step
toward a market for the mutual trading of blue-chip stocks, first
announced in July after a meeting of officials from the Frankfurt
and London exchanges. (EUROMARKET)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Railway workers plan to paralyze train
traffic in six European Union nations Monday to protest
liberalization plans, but trade union differences stand in the way
of an EU-wide rail strike. Train traffic is expected to come to a
halt in France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg.
Unions will hand out leaflets to commuters in Germany, Britain,
Austria and the Netherlands in a bid to stop plans to further
privatize the sector. The EU's executive Commission already has a
blueprint to increase liberalization in the freight sector from 5
percent to 25 percent to try and increase the efficiency of
Europe's dense railway network. ``We fear this will only be a first
step,'' said Sabine Trier of the Federation of Transport Workers'
Unions in the European Union. (EU-RAIL STRIKE)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Faced with a slowing economy and
record public deficit, a top planning ministry official Thursday
defended the government's budget as ``realistic and even
conservative.'' The budget, which seeks to trim 8.7 billion reals
(dlrs 7.3 billion) in 1999, is a key piece of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso's fiscal austerity program put in place to qualify
Brazil for a dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package led by the
International Monetary Fund. But many analysts worry the savings
are based on reduced interest rates, not yet in place, and overly
optimistic growth predictions. To achieve these savings, the budget
assumes Brazil will experience negative growth of 1 percent in 1999
and estimates average annual interest rates of 21.9 percent, said
Planning Ministry executive secretary Martus Tavares.
(BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Thirty-nine countries have agreed on
donating dlrs 20 billion to a fund that provides financing to the
world's poorest countries, the World Bank said Thursday. ``Despite
the global financial crisis, the agreement shows support to the
poorest countries in the world is on the rebound,'' said Sven
Sandstroem of the World Bank's International Development
Association (IDA). Sandstroem told reporters that a large share of
the credits would be used in the social and health sectors, and for
educational matters. He added the funds to be allocated over a
three-year period presently were not earmarked to any programs.
Credits by IDA _ a World Bank affiliate established in 1960 to
provide assistance to poorer developing countries _ are only made
to governments. (WORLD BANK-POOR COUNTRIES)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Microsoft has a monopoly in computer operating
systems and has aggressively tried to protect that power by
engaging in anti-competitive acts that ultimately hurt consumers,
says the latest government witness to testify against the software
giant. The claims by Frederick Warren-Boulton, former chief
economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, mirror
government allegations against Microsoft. Taking the stand Thursday
for cross-examination, Warren-Boulton testified that Microsoft has
significantly ``raised prices above competitive levels,'' and could
continue to do so because of its industry influence. He also said
Microsoft saw the emerging browser market as a threat to its
monopoly stronghold. (US-MICROSOFT)

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Paul Simon has agreed to testify
in the embezzlement trial of prominent anti-apartheid activist
Allan Boesak as long as he can do it via telephone or video from
New York City.
	   The singer, who donated 600,000 rand (about dlrs 180,000) to
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice Charity, was responding
to a request from the prosecutor's office, SABC-TV said Thursday.
	   Simon cited his heavy work schedule as preventing him from
traveling to South Africa in person.
	   Earlier this week, a major witness recanted allegations of
financial wrongdoing against Boesak, delivering a serious blow to
the prosecution's case. Freddie Steenkamp, a bookkeeper for the
defunct charity, told the court he lied under oath about Boesak
stealing about 1 million rand (dlrs 300,000).
	   Much of the money was from Simon, Scandinavian donors and the
Coca-Cola Foundation.
	   Steenkamp pleaded guilty to fraud and theft and was sentenced
last year to six years in prison.
	    &UR; ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ British pop star George Michael will deliver
meals to people with AIDS next month to fulfill a community service
sentence handed down after he pleaded no contest to committing a
lewd act in a Beverly Hills park restroom.
	   ``It's a worthwhile cause ... but I don't know his motivation
behind it,'' Josephine Green, a spokeswoman for the singer at
Connie Filipello Publicity, said Thursday in a telephone interview
from London.
	   Michael was arrested April 7 by an undercover police officer at
Will Rogers Memorial Park, across from the Beverly Hills Hotel on
Sunset Boulevard.
	   Michael was fined dlrs 810, ordered to perform 80 hours of
community service and told that any future lewd acts would land him
in jail.
	    &UR; ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Opera star Jessye Norman can't sue a magazine for
libel over a remark about her size that she called ``vulgar and
undignified,'' an appeals court ruled Thursday.
	   In a flattering 1994 profile, Classic CD magazine said that when
Miss Norman became trapped in some swinging doors on the way to a
concert and was advised to turn sideways to free herself, she
replied: ``Honey, I ain't got no sideways.''
	   Miss Norman contended she never uttered the remark, which she
said held her up to ridicule, mockery and contempt because it
conformed to a ``degrading racist stereotype of a person of
African-American heritage''.
	   But Lord Justice Peter Gibson ruled the remark could never
convey the defamatory meanings she suggested.
	   ``I could have wished that Miss Norman had told the hoary old
joke contained in the anecdote _ the subject of this libel action _
as it would have shown that, in addition to possessing the
remarkable vocal and dramatic talents which have made her
world-famous as a distinguished opera singer, she had an engaging
sense of humour,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude
have wrapped the Reichstag in Germany and 11 islands in Miami's
Biscayne Bay with kilometers (miles) of fabric. Now, they're
turning their attention to 163 trees.
	   Although less grandiose than earlier projects, Christo said
Thursday he was enjoying the latest challenge in a museum park in
Riehen, a quiet suburb of the Swiss city of Basel.
	   ``It was impossible to shape the forms in advance. That's the
exciting thing about this project,'' he said. ``Each tree has its
own personality.''
	   The project involves 55,000 square meters (461,000 square feet)
of woven polyester fabric and 23 kilometers (14 miles) of rope.
	   The husband-and-wife artists waited until the trees lost their
leaves to start the wrapping. The material lets air pass through,
and is used in Japan to protect trees in winter.
	   The exhibit opens to the public Saturday, and up to 500,000
visitors are expected. Weather permitting, the ``wrapped trees''
will be on display until January.
	   The display coincides with a ``Magic of Trees'' exhibition
inside the Beyeler museum, featuring works of art from Picasso,
Chagall, Cezanne and Giacometti.
	    &UR; ___
	   DUBLIN, California (AP) _ Heidi Fleiss, the Hollywood madam
convicted of running a sex-for-hire service for the rich and
famous, was released from jail Thursday to a halfway house to
complete her sentence.
	   Fleiss will serve the remaining 17 months on her 37-month
federal term for conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering call-girl
profits. As part of a plea bargain, she's also serving a concurrent
state sentence of 18 months for attempted pandering.
	   A tearful Fleiss apologized at her sentencing for running a
business she blamed on youth and bad choices. On the cable show
``American Justice,'' Fleiss called for equal punishment for the
men who used her service, including Charlie Sheen.
	   Fleiss was arrested in 1995 after an undercover sting operation.
Her attorney, Anthony Brooklier, didn't immediately return a phone
call Thursday.

Rio gives its street children an identity

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Selling peanuts in bars, begging
at traffic lights, sniffing glue or picking pockets, Rio's street
children often seem to be everywhere.
	   Nobody knows for sure how many there are. And because few have
even the basic trappings of Brazilian citizenship, like a birth
certificate or an identity card, many die as anonymously as they
lived.
	   ``We've always had wildly conflicting numbers about how many
children are on the streets, from as few as 300 to as many as 3
million,'' Youth Court Judge Siro Darlan said.
	   But the mystery may be ending. Darlan is coordinating a new
project involving about 40 psychology students, paramedics,
photographers and other volunteers to take the first serious census
of Rio's street children.
	   For months, Darlan's volunteers cruised the streets, talking to
street children, taking their pictures and fingerprints and
providing 932 of them with special identity cards.
	   Darlan believes the ID cards are important because they give the
children something tangible that says they are recognized by
society. The cards have proved so popular that some kids have
showed up at Youth Court asking for them, he said.
	   Darlan thinks one reason for the demand is that many children
believe recognition by society means protection from the frequent
beatings they suffer at the hands of police and private security
guards.
	   ``I feel good with the card, because I feel protected with it,''
said 13-year-old Marcos Antonio Santos Jesus, fingering the
laminated card that announces him as part of the ``assisted street
population.''
	   Others are less impressed with their newfound social status.
	   ``Even having it with me, the police still hit us to hurt us,''
said Alan Vilela Marques, 11.
	   Darlan thinks the 932 children registered is pretty close to the
actual number of youngsters living on the streets. But that doesn't
mean the project is over.
	   Among the census' more surprising findings was that almost all
the street children have at least one living parent, and about
two-thirds have both parents still alive.
	   ``Our goal is to get the family to take responsibility for the
kid,'' Darlan said.
	   The volunteers are now trying to locate the parents and bring
them to the Youth Court for a mandatory series of courses ranging
from personal hygiene and family planning to criminal code
provisions and the government social services available.
	   To ensure attendance by parents, the authorities will keep their
children in city shelters until they complete the courses, Darlan
said.
	   ``It's getting better slowly,'' said the judge, who conceded
that solving the problem of street kids will not be easy.
	   Darlan's project was financed entirely by private contributions
because government resources are stretched thin. And Brazil
continues to overlook its poor and outcast _ especially the young.
	   ``It's not changing a law that changes the situation. You have
to change the culture,'' Darlan said. ``And unfortunately, we have
a culture where children are neglected.''

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Hands clasped and chests bare,
nearly 100 chanting young men force their way through the crowded
street, shoving, shouting, pushing.
	   The crowds press back, a few people are trampled, but the line
of men holds.
	   They are the new warriors of their people, and in a village
consumed by one of Africa's largest cities they are celebrating
their coming of age.
	   Every three years, the Ebrie people celebrate their festival of
generations, reveling in their young men's journey to adulthood.
	   The festival lasts between three and four months, a time
consumed with practicing songs, learning dances and preparing
clothing, but the climax is a public ceremony that is the most
important annual event in every Ebrie village.
	   The neighborhood of Blokossi _ the Ebrie village of Blokossi
until the sprawl of Abidjan swallowed it _ celebrated this final
ceremony in August. Thousands of people turned out to watch,
jamming streets, balconies and rooftops.
	   The previous generation was there, too, linking arms and
gathering around the new group. They sometimes pushed against one
another, a generational clash made real.
	   The generation's leader, known simply as The Warrior, danced
aggressively as he went block by block through the neighborhood,
clearing it of spirits. Repeatedly, he opened communication with
the spirit world by throwing eggs, then closing off communication
by throwing limes.
	   In days past, when village wars were common, he was the man who
would have led his generation of soldiers into battle.
	   When the day was over, when both generations had pushed their
way up and back through the town, the new group had officially
ended childhood. From then on, they would be treated as men.
	   The next day, the new warriors celebrated their manhood,
parading around town in their best clothing, draped in gold jewelry
and ornate cloth, that may have taken years of saving to buy. They
mingled with the village elders, also dressed in their finest.
	   Children, too, looked on _ the next generation.

Liberal Judaism is reviving in Germany

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Statuesque in her black robe and embroidered
shawl, Cantor Rebecca Garfein lighted two candles and poured red
wine into a goblet. Her soprano rang clear and strong as she
blessed the wine, marking the start of the Sabbath.
	   It is the most basic of Jewish rituals, but the service last
week was extraordinary. Worshippers sat intermingled, men and women
side by side. And for the first time in a German synagogue, a
female cantor presided.
	   Progressive _ or Reform _ Judaism is seeing a renaissance in
Germany, where liberal Jewish life thrived before the Holocaust but
where Jews after the war turned to Orthodoxy, in part to preserve
the strict traditions of the religion for which they were
persecuted.
	   Today, however, a growing number of Jews seek the equal
participation for women prohibited under Orthodox law _ bat
mitzvahs for girls, female cantors and rabbis, and
non-fundamentalist interpretations of the Torah.
	   Helping the changes in Berlin are cultural festivals
highlighting Jewish communities outside Germany. Last year's theme
was Jewish life in New York City, and the program brought Garfein,
the musical leader of a temple there, to Berlin for the first time.
	   Her October 1997 concert before a packed audience of Reform and
Orthodox Jews, as well as non-Jews, was the first time most had
seen a female cantor. As a result, an Orthodox synagogue agreed for
the first time this summer to give Berlin's most liberal Reform
Jews space for egalitarian services, with men and women sitting
together.
	   Andreas Nachama, the leader of Berlin's Jewish community, said
it was a goal of his when elected in 1997 to establish an
egalitarian service within a year. So he invited Garfein, whom he
met while on sabbatical in New York.
	   ``It's always helpful to have an example for people to see, how
it could sound, what it looks like,'' Nachama said. Her concert
``represented more than music. It represented the revival of
progressive Judaism in Berlin.''
	   Hoping to push that revival further, Nachama invited Garfein
back to lead the egalitarian service Nov. 13 and to hold another
concert. Last Monday night, she performed in the city's most formal
Reform synagogue, where men and women sing together in the choir
but still sit apart in the congregation.
	   ``I think people really do want to practice the tradition, but
they want women to be able to be equal with men,'' Garfein said.
	   ``The more I'm here, the more I learn. And one of the things I'm
realizing is what an amazing community Berlin was before the war.
This city was so cutting edge. Then the war happened and everything
stopped.''
	   Reform Judaism was flourishing in Berlin in the 1920s, during
the avant-garde, cabaret days of the Weimar Republic. Berlin saw
the first choirs and organs brought into synagogues and the
ordination of the first woman rabbi. The World Union of Progressive
Judaism, today the main body of Reform Jews, held its first meeting
in Berlin in 1928.
	   After the Holocaust, the few Jews left in Germany were most
concerned with survival. Religious life returned gradually,
influenced by Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland and Russia.
Berlin retained its roots in the Reform movement, but worship
practices were frozen as they were in 1938, with men and women
sitting on separate sides of the synagogues.
	   Today, about 10,000 of the city's 12,000 Jews are non-Orthodox.
But nearly all the estimated 50,000 Jews outside Berlin follow
Orthodoxy, which is recognized as Germany's ``official'' Judaism
and thus receives government funding as do the other official
religions, Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.
	   Many German Jews simply find comfort in knowing that ancient
Jewish laws are being practiced in the country that killed 6
million Jews in the Holocaust.
	   ``Out of nostalgia and a strong sense of loyalty to the past,
the majority of Jews in Germany prefer Orthodox synagogues even if
they themselves are not Orthodox,'' said Joel Levy, head of the
Lauder Foundation in Berlin.
	   For years, U.S. military bases in West Germany gave many Reform
Jews their only place to worship, in egalitarian services led by
American chaplains.
	   Most bases closed in 1994, though, spawning a movement in German
cities from Munich to Hamburg to seek ``official'' recognition for
the 1,500 Jews outside Berlin who consider themselves Reform.
	   Walter Homolka, 34, a former publishing executive with a
doctorate in religion, took charge. He became a rabbi last year,
because outside Berlin there was no Reform rabbi, and he helped
form the Union of Progressive Judaism in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland.
	   In October, the group won official status in the state of Lower
Saxony, joining Orthodoxy.

	   ``It's still a serious problem, though,'' Homolka said.
``Because the Union for Progressive Jews really forms a kind of
second-class Judaism here in Germany.''
	   Some Orthodox Jews fear the Reform movement threatens tradition.
They agree liberal Jews should be allowed to worship as they
please, but they insist only Orthodoxy can preserve authentic
Judaism for future generations.
	   ``You can have 500 different kinds of movements _ Jews for Jesus
and whatever _ but it only takes us further from our roots,'' said
Rafael Korenzecher, a member of the executive council for Berlin's
Jews.
	   ``It is very important to show that it's impossible to
extinguish Jewish life, that in the capital of Adolf Hitler there
is a strong Jewish community.''
	   For Korenzecher, female cantors and egalitarian services are the
public signs of a deeper abandonment of the true Judaism, with
fewer Jews following laws and rituals at home. His concern is
especially strong because of the Orthodox minority in Berlin.''
	   So far, only 20 to 50 Jews frequent the new egalitarian
services. Nachama, the community leader, would like to see that
number grow. He used to attend a U.S. Army base service but now
goes to the traditional Reform synagogue. His 80-year-old father,
Estrongo Nachama, is the head cantor there.
	   Cantor Nachama, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp,
performed at the concert with Garfein. His warm baritone echoed in
the gold and white temple, mingling with her mezzo soprano as they
sang the sacred music together.
	   ``It will be easier to make more changes when the survivors are
gone, in 30 or 40 years,'' Andreas Nachama said. ``I don't want
anyone who survived the Holocaust to sit at home and say, `I lost
my place of worship.' So we are pushing, but slowly.''

British designers new victims of industrial espionage

	   LONDON (AP) _ British designer Anthony Symonds was downing
champagne at a London Fashion Week party this fall when thieves
broke into his workroom and made off with dlrs 48,000 worth of
drawings and finished pieces.
	   Symonds was the sixth designer to be robbed since April _ and
fashion cognoscenti fear he won't be the last. Similar thefts have
been reported in New York and Milan.
	   ``We suspect this will be a growing trend, unfortunately,'' said
John Wilson, chief executive of the British Fashion Council.
``British fashion is growing in importance and, like any work of
art, the garments are going up in value.''
	   The council estimates Britain's fashion industry is now worth
more than dlrs 27 billion annually, so the potential for profits is
vast.
	   Designs can either be sold to discreet, wealthy clients or
copied, often in the Far East.
	   New York-born designer Liza Bruce lost her entire 1998
autumn/winter collection in April when a man smashed his way into
her new London shop and swept everything off the racks, including
swimsuits and underwear.
	   She believes it unlikely the garments were taken to be copied.
	   ``People can browse in a shop and buy or take one or two
different samples for that,'' she told The Times newspaper.
	   Police detective Peter Johnstone, who is investigating several
of the thefts, agreed.
	   ``These pieces are very recognizable, but there is obviously a
market for them somewhere,'' he said. ``So it follows that they are
going out of the country _ perhaps to former Eastern bloc
countries, or the Far East, where designer labels are much in
demand.''
	   Johnstone said police believe the thieves are gangs of men. No
arrests have been made and police have very little to go on.
	   Authorities say thieves had very specific information about the
movements of garments belonging to Antonio Berardi, whose entire
autumn and winter collection of 180 outfits _ worth at least dlrs
800,000 _ was stolen during a delivery in April.
	   Other victims include Caroline Charles, designer to the late
Princess Diana, who lost dlrs 50,000 worth of goods from her store
in upscale Beauchamp Place; streetwear label Duffer of St. George,
where dlrs 16,000 worth of shoe samples went missing; and young
designer Effi Samara, whose entire stock, worth dlrs 80,000, was
stolen from her shop.
	   ``These were not opportunistic crimes,'' Johnstone said.
	   Though the heists are on the rise in London, it is not the only
fashion capital to suffer.
	   Thefts are not uncommon in New York, where earlier this year a
thief pretending to be a New York Times stylist stole thousands of
dollars' worth of samples from Calvin Klein, Guess and Safilo USA,
a New Jersey-based distributor of Gucci and Gianfranco Ferre
eyewear.
	   And several years ago, top Milan designer Mariuccia Mandelli _
the name behind the Krizia label _ had a collection snatched the
night before a show. Recently, Milanese designer Antonio Coppola
had his entire 1999 collection lifted from a rented showroom.
	   Wilson, the British Fashion Council boss, noted that such thefts
are ``a disaster for the individual _ they lose months of work and
preparation.''
	   Berardi's collection, for example, was to have been photographed
for the U.S. version of Vogue and for British magazines.
	   Even in Britain, which has strict copyright laws, taking legal
action against someone for the theft of a design is ``legally
tortuous and costly,'' Wilson said.
	   Many designers are short of funds and ``maybe don't have as good
security as other business people,'' or proper insurance _ ``so
they are very vulnerable,'' he said.
	   Symonds, the young British designer, managed to find a silver
lining.
	   ``In a way, it's the biggest compliment they could have paid
me,'' he said. ``Somebody somewhere seems to think that I am so
credible and my work is so important that it could damage their
business.''

Israeli troop withdrawal: a defining moment for Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Through all the crises surrounding the
Israel-Palestinian negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
kept everyone guessing.
	   He promised peace with the Palestinians yet allowed Jewish
settlers to expand their communities. He staked out tough positions
in negotiations but ultimately relented on key issues.
	   Now, with the start of a withdrawal that will give Palestinians
a sizable chunk of the West Bank, Netanyahu has alienated some of
his most loyal supporters, who believe it is a sin to give away the
sacred land of Israel.
	   It could cost him his job.
	   Yitzhak Levy, education minister and head of the pro-settlement
National Religious Party, predicted on Israel television following
the Cabinet vote Thursday that early elections were in the offing.
``The political situation is not stable,'' he said.
	   Yossi Beilin, a leading figure in the dovish Labor Party, said
he believed Netanyahu's coalition was unraveling and said Labor was
not willing to join in a broad coalition that would save the prime
minister. He suggested elections would be held by May, a year
early.
	   Netanyahu's success in keeping his six-party coalition in power
has been almost magical. In recent months he has weathered several
crises with a one-vote majority in the 120-seat Knesset, but nobody
really knows how that majority would play if it were to be tested
in the coming weeks.
	   Critics like Beilin argue that Netanyahu stays in power by
endless maneuvering, and his only goal is to survive from day to
day.
	   But others disagree.
	   ``He has a strategy,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a political
science professor at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. ``He gives
as little as possible over the longest period of time possible, and
lets the other side make mistakes.''
	   His forecast for the three-month phased withdrawal is more and
more delay as each stage is argued over. Steinberg suggests it will
become harder and harder to keep the right-wingers from bolting
Netanyahu's coalition as more Jewish settlements become islands
surrounded by the Palestinian autonomy.
	   The more Netanyahu tries to appease the right, the more
difficult it will be to negotiate with the Palestinians.
	   Already, the constant bickering and acrimony is eroding the
credibility of the peace process in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and undermining support for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``He is creating a hostile atmosphere. It's a pity because we
were willing to proceed in a much more positive way,'' said Ahmed
Tibi, a top adviser to Arafat.
	   In the end, Netanyahu may keep his word not to yield a
double-digit percentage of land if he halts the process and goes to
early elections.
	   The religious right takes its cues from prominent rabbis, and
nine religious leaders signed a document opposing handing over more
land, which they argued would be used by Palestinians to launch
terrorist attacks on Israel.
	   ``The borders of our Holy Land were established by God and
Israel cannot make any concessions on these borders,'' declared the
statement by rabbis affiliated with the ultra-Orthodox United Torah
Judaism party, a member of the ruling coalition.
	   Shaul Yaalom, a leading figure in the National Religious Party,
said he voted against going ahead with the pullback because it
posed a danger to Israelis.
	   ``I believe we could have reached a better and more cautious
agreement, to be implemented over a longer period of time and
should not make agreements when you are not sure if there is true
peace,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu has been embarrassed in the cabinet and Knesset by
allies who voted against the new peace accord and members of his
own party who abstained.
	   Aides say he is too weak politically to fire or punish the
dissenters, but Israel army radio reported that Netanyahu was so
angry he planned to threaten his partners with early elections or
an alliance with the Labor Party.
	   New elections could well be worse for his coalition partners
than Netanyahu, who has maintained a consistent lead over Labor
leader Ehud Barak in opinion polls.
	   In the meantime, by implementing the accord, Netanyahu is edging
closer and closer to the political center. And the center is where
he needs to be if he hopes for re-election in a country where
surveys indicate more than 70 percent of the public favors pursuing
the peace process.

	   GANIM, West Bank (AP) _ The name of this Jewish settlement on
the West Bank means ``gardens,'' and to the 51 Israeli families who
moved here from noisy cities to find a peaceful, rural life, it has
fulfilled its promise. Flowers and neat lawns abound and the air
echoes with the sounds of birds chirping and dogs barking.
	   But residents fear their paradise will come to an end by the
weekend, once Israeli troops pull back and Palestinian police
deploy just outside the perimeter fence.
	   ``If we had known this might happen, we would never have come
here,'' said 47-year-old Miri Deutsch.
	   Her husband Dov, 49, felt even stronger. ``I don't think there
is anyone here who wouldn't leave if he received the right offer
(of compensation from the government),'' he said.
	   The Deutsch family moved two years ago from Upper Nazareth, a
suburban development town 25 miles (40 kms) to the north, in
Israel.
	   While some Israelis moved to the West Bank for religious or
ideological reasons, the residents of Ganim and the nearby
settlements of Kadim and Shaked wanted to improve their lives.
	   Now they feel abandoned by the government.
	   ``Not a single official or a single member of parliament has
come here to explain the situation to us,'' complained Zehava
Barsheshet, 31.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to tour the
settlements soon, and on Thursday received representatives from the
beleaguered communities.
	   But Barsheshet said she was worried about the safety of her
husband and one of her four children, who have to leave the
settlement every day to get to work and school.
	   ``We don't know what will happen on the road,'' she said,
describing her feelings as ``hysterical.''
	   Even now, schoolchildren from the settlement travel in convoys
of armored buses, with army jeeps riding in front and behind.
	   Once the first stage of the Israeli pullback is completed
Friday, Ganim, Kadim and Shaked will be surrounded on three sides
by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   While the government has started fortifying several other
settlements by rolling barbed wire and digging cement-enforced
trenches, nothing has changed so far in Ganim.
	   The community is ringed by a barbed-wire fence. Six soldiers are
posted at the gate, and from time to time they patrol the area in
pairs. Half a mile away is a small army base.
	   From Ganim, residents can see the Palestinian town of Jenin,
three miles (five kms) away, which came under Palestinian rule in
1995.
	   People in Ganim have mostly become accustomed to the Palestinian
police presence in Jenin.
	   There have been no attempts by Palestinian militants to attack
Ganim. Barsheshet said she gets along with her Palestinian
neighbors, and that many residents of Ganim shop for groceries in
Jenin rather than the nearest Israeli town of Afula, 15 miles (25
kms) away.
	   ``But now we are afraid, we are turning into a bubble,'' she
said. ``Now we will have to be accompanied by army jeeps to buy
bread in Afula.''

Hospital bombing underlines dangers of civil war in Sudan

	   YEI, Sudan (AP) _ Peres Yahwa tenderly strokes the thin arm of
her teen-age daughter, who writhes in pain with meningitis in the
only hospital in this rebel-held south Sudan town.
	   The wall above the bed is deeply gouged where shrapnel struck
Saturday when a Sudanese government plane bombed the hospital for
the third time in a month. Two people were killed and nine wounded,
including Yahwa. Most of the patients have fled.
	   The hole is a reminder that Yei Hospital is no haven from danger
in Sudan's 15-year civil war. The bombing was the sixth since the
Sudan People's Liberation Army captured Yei in March 1997.
	   The fall of the important trading town has only fueled the war
between government forces from the mainly Arab, Muslim north and
the rebels from the Christian and animist south.
	   At least 1.5 million people in one of the world's poorest and
most underdeveloped nations _ the largest in Africa _ have died
either as a result of the fighting or the resulting famines.
	   In Yei, about 100 miles (160 kms) southwest of Juba _ the
largest government-held city in southern Sudan _ the market is
still open, but poverty is rampant.
	   Many residents fled during the battle for Yei. The economy has
stagnated, and the dirt roads in and out are now mostly impassable
_ and dangerous.
	   Fear of air raids has instilled panic among the population and
further destabilized the region.
	   ``I am tired of this, it's enough,'' said Daniel Chute, 36, a
trader who recently returned to Yei.
	   Chute was wounded by shrapnel in his right hip Saturday.
	   ``The government is bombing hospitals. But where else can I
go?'' he said from his hospital bed.
	   Yei Hospital is a remarkably clean colonial-era complex of red
brick buildings interspersed with flower beds.
	   Since the city fell to the SPLA, the hospital has been
refurbished by the private Norwegian People's Aid with dlrs 100,000
from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Norwegian
relief group runs the hospital on a dlrs 250,000 quarterly grant
from Sweden. It also runs three other hospitals in southern Sudan.
	   But the giant red crosses painted on the hospital's gray
corrugated iron roofs do not ward off the bombers. On Saturday,
bombs blew out all the windows and destroyed supplies in the
pharmacy.
	   The Norwegian relief group says the bombings are proof that the
Khartoum government is targeting civilians.
	   ``The hospital is the most important institution in the area in
allowing the population to come back and resettle,'' said Dan
Effie, spokesman for the Norwegian group, which supports the
rebellion in southern Sudan.
	   The government this week accused the relief agency of prolonging
the war by treating rebel soldiers and giving them arms.
	   The group denies that it provides military assistance to the
rebels and says the hospital treats all war victims.
	   ``We don't segregate,'' said Dr. Sebit Sindani, a Sudanese man
educated in Nairobi, Kenya, who is the hospital's only surgeon.
``That is the ethics of medicine.''
	   Like others on the meager staff, Sindani chose to stay in Yei
rather than move to someplace safer or even leave his country and
the war with no end in sight.
	   ``There is nobody left to help the people here,'' the surgeon
said.

British TV loses 10 o'clock news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's long-established prime time television
News at Ten will disappear next year, despite opposition from the
prime minister and other political leaders.
	   The independent commercial network ITV won approval on Thursday
from the regulatory Independent Television Commission to switch its
main evening news from 10 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and show another news
program at 11 p.m.
	   The move, which opens a two-hour prime-time slot every
weeknight, is expected to increase advertising revenues.
	   The newscast's 10 p.m. slot, one hour after the 9 p.m.
``watershed'' for adult programming, meant interrupting movies in
the middle to make time for the 30-minute News at Ten.
	   ITV is losing viewers and says the Big Ben ``bongs'' that
introduce the show are a signal for a third of its audience to
switch off or over to another channel. Younger viewers tend to find
something else to do.
	   The program, in that slot for 31 years, had become an
institution and had held on despite earlier ITV efforts to change
it.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair opposed the change.
	   ``He has made clear that his personal view, in as much as
everybody has a personal view on this, is that his preference was
to keep it at 10 o'clock,'' Blair's office said Thursday. But,
``the prime minister's personal view doesn't come into the
equation. It's a matter for the ITC.''
	   Former Prime Minister John Major, whose opposition helped head
off the scrapping of the program in 1993, said Thursday's decision
was ``a grave mistake'' which he feared would herald the
``downgrading'' of ITV's evening programs.
	   ``We have passed a new milestone in the dumbing down of
Britain,'' said legislator Gerald Kaufman, who is chairman of a
parliament committee on culture, media and sport.
	   Fellow legislator Martin Bell, a former BBC News correspondent,
said, ``It means news is being marginalized, whatever they say.
Nothing matters but money; nothing matters but ratings.''
	   The Independent Television Commission, which licenses and
regulates commercial television, imposed conditions on the
independent network in exchange for permitting the time change.
These included maintaining present levels of funding of news
programs of the same range and quality.
	   ``In a multi-channel age, direct intervention by a regulator to
dictate the precise scheduling of a program, even an institution
such as News At Ten, looks increasingly inappropriate,'' said ITC
chairman Sir Robin Biggam.
	   ``Our role is to ensure that the public service elements of the
ITV schedules as a whole are met and this we will do.''
	   One fixture of the News at Ten will remain unchanged: The
popular newscaster Trevor McDonald will continue to present the
news, but at the new time.

Israel sets to withdraw, autonomy for more Palestinians

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ A row of yellow-and-black cinder blocks
line the gate of an army base in the northern West Bank, ready for
duty at highway junctions where Israeli forces will cede control to
the Palestinians.
	   Friday's troop withdrawal will bring autonomy to thousands of
Palestinians. Israeli and Palestinian officers were expected to
meet to finalize the transfer with a handshake.
	   The withdrawal, reluctantly authorized by the Israeli government
Thursday, comes after nearly two years of U.S. prodding and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians.
	   For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a hard-liner who had
zig-zagged on the peace process since taking office in 1996, it
marked a point of no return.
	   For Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the pullback, agreed to in
Washington last month, would place another 9.1 percent of the West
Bank under his full or partial control. At the end of the staged
withdrawal, Palestinian autonomy will encompass 40 percent of the
West Bank, where they hope to establish a future state.
	   Most of the land to be handed over is near Jenin, a
Palestinian-run city in the northern West Bank.
	   In anticipation of the pullback, the Palestinian Authority
staged a jubilant parade there Thursday.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   Two percent of the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44
square miles), are being transferred from sole Israeli control to
joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400
square kilometers (160 square miles), move from joint jurisdiction
to sole Palestinian control.
	   The Palestinians already have full control of 3 percent of the
West Bank and joint jurisdiction over another 24 percent.
	   Unlike earlier pullbacks, this one held little promise of drama.
	   No army bases are being dismantled, no Israeli troops remained
in the Palestinian villages to be turned over and the only thing to
be moved were the washing machine-sized cement blocks lined up
behind the barbed wire fence of the Israeli army base of Dotan,
south of Jenin.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were more concerned about whether jailed relatives
would be among some 250 prisoners to be released by Israel Friday.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``What is the meaning of peace? It is
the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two. If Netanyahu's coalition
unravels, he could be forced to new elections.
	   In an attempt to reassure Jewish settlers, Netanyahu on Thursday
visited the Yafit settlement in the West Bank's Jordan Valley.
Netanyahu declared that Israel would never relinquish the valley.
``It will always be part of the state of Israel,'' he said. ``There
is no uncertainty.''
	   However, according to Israeli media reports, parts of the valley
will be handed to partial Palestinian control in one of the next
pullbacks.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying 18 settlements that will
become increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.

	   VISOKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ First she recognized the
sweater she'd knitted for her husband. Then, his belt and jeans.
When she saw the teeth, the old woman broke into tears. ``It's
him,'' she whispered. Another file is closed.
	   After 24 hours the morgue in Visoko also closed Thursday, all 29
bodies brought there from around the Serb-held wartime camp
``Rasadnik'' in eastern Bosnia identified.
	   On the eve of the third anniversary of the Nov. 21 signing of
the Dayton peace agreement that ended the 3 1/2-year-long Bosnian
war, tens of thousands of people are still searching for relatives
and loved ones who disappeared.
	   It is a long, expensive process but many Western officials claim
reconciliation in Bosnia is impossible until all the missing have
been found and the perpetrators face justice.
	   During a recent visit to Bosnia, David Scheffer, the U.S. State
Department's roving ambassador on war crimes issues, said this is
why the West will continue to financially support exhumations in
Bosnia.
	   Of the hundreds of people passed through the morgue at Visoko 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Sarajevo Thursday, looking at
various skeletons, some found their fathers, husbands and sons _
recognized mostly by clothes or documents found in their pockets.
	   ``In some cases the identification percentage is 100 percent,''
said Amor Masovic, the head of the Sarajevo-based Muslim Commission
for missing people. They search for the tens of thousands listed in
the ``missing files'' that collected in the wake of Bosnia's Some
20,000 people remain unaccounted for in the wake of the 1991-1995
war.
	   Every time bodies from a particular area are exhumed, the
commissions broadcast invitations to relatives of the missing to
visit the morgue.
	   Two other commissions for the missing exist in the country, one
for Bosnian Croats and another for Bosnian Serbs. But Masovic's is
the busiest, as most of the bodies exhumed from mass graves have
been Muslims.
	   His commission moves next week to dig on two other sites, but
his workers must move quickly. When the first snow arrives, the
third season of searching will end and families of those still
missing will wait for digging to resume in the spring.
	   Back in Visoko, the old woman told the staff her husband was
taken to Rasadnik in 1992. He had no foot and wore a green coat.
They uncovered a skeleton in a green coat, missing a foot.
	   She sat down and asked for the permission to smoke a cigarette.
A tear rolled down her cheek as she studied the remains for a few
moments.
	   ``Now I'm at peace,'' she broke the silence. ``At least he is no
longer missing. I'll bury him with dignity.''

Singer performs in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Superstar singer Sarah McLachlan performed on a
different sort of stage than she's used to as her lawyer launched a
blunt attack on a musician claiming credit for four of her songs.
	   McLachlan stood over a keyboard in a Vancouver courtroom
Thursday and played several chords from her 1988 song Steaming.
Then, the Juno and Grammy-winning performer began singing lyrics
from the song featured on the album that launched her career.
	   Darryl Neudorf, who has sued McLachlan and Nettwerk Productions,
McLachlan's label, looked on grim-faced.
	   ``I think I am playing this in the wrong key,'' McLachlan told
an audience that included teen-age fans, reporters, court buffs and
music industry figures.
	   Neudorf, a Vancouver producer and former drummer with the band
54-40, is suing McLachlan, saying he didn't receive sufficient cash
or credit for helping her develop four songs on her 1988 debut
album Touch _ Vox, Sad Clown, Steaming and Strange World.
	   McLachlan sobbed on the stand as she recalled how she wrote
Ben's Song, featured on the album, while grieving the death of a
friend from a brain tumor.
	   McLachlan's lawyer, Jennifer Conkie, promised testimony that
will prove Neudorf has fabricated testimony.
	   ``The defendants say that not only does the plaintiff have an
exaggerated sense of his own importance on the Touch project, but
that he has fabricated and taken undue credit in various parts of
his testimony,'' Conkie said in an opening statement.
	   Neudorf, 34, claims that he was asked by Nettwerk co-founder
Mark Jowett, an old friend, to help develop songs for McLachlan,
whose songwriting skills were shaky.
	   Touch's cover notes credit McLachlan for solo writing of all but
two cuts on the album. Work on the other two is shared between
McLachlan and Darren Phillips, who has testified for Neudorf.
	   Neudorf is credited for helping coordinate pre-production work
on the album, production assistance and ``inspiration.''
	   McLachlan described her songwriting approach as ``instinctual''
and a routine that hasn't changed much since she arrived in
Vancouver in late 1987 from her native Halifax.

Stanford loses again; Edmonton wins 2001 worlds

	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ In another setback for athletics in
the United States, Stanford, California was denied for a third time
in its bid to secure the sport's marquee event.
	   Yes, the World Championships will be going to North America for
the first time in 2001. But they're headed to Edmonton, Canada,
instead.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation voted by ``massive
consensus'' Thursday to award the event to the capital of Alberta.
	   The exact voting breakdown was not released, but an IAAF source
said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. Two members of the IAAF Council
were absent and a third apparently abstained.
	   Paris, which is planning more seriously for the 2003
championships, and New Delhi, which dropped out of the race, had
been the other bidders.
	   It had been widely expected that the event would go to North
America after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991),
Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville
(1999).
	   The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating
Championships.
	   ``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,''
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition
of organizing sports events and we are delighted to have a
commitment to host what we feel will be the greatest ever world
championships.''
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo has repeatedly said he would like
to take the championships _ considered the third-biggest
international sports event behind the Olympics and the World Cup _
to the United States some day.
	   But Stanford, which launched unsuccessful attempts for the 1997
and 1999 events, came up way short again.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and
television coverage.
	   With the championships expected to return to Europe in 2003, the
prospects of the event ever being held in the United States remain
uncertain.
	   ``Edmonton was both creative and enthusiastic in their bid and
benefitted from more than dlrs 80 million in government supports,''
said Craig Masback, head of USA Track and Field. ``We remain
committed to bringing major international events to the United
States and I am confident that we will one day host the world
championships.
	   Edmonton trumped Stanford by lining up government financial
support and guarantees, promising to pay for the travel costs and
accomodation for athletes and officials, and presenting a lucrative
Canadian TV deal with the IAAF.
	   ``The financial issue was very important,'' IAAF spokesman
Giorgio Reineri said. ``I think that convinced a lot of people to
vote for Edmonton.''
	   Stanford couldn't match Edmonton's financial guarantees.
	   ``One of the challenges is American cities being asked to, in a
sense, guarantee the whole event), and that is certainly not done
in the United States,'' said Dan Fenton, chief operating officer of
the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau.
	   He said Stanford instead offered a novel deal under which an
insurance company would guarantee revenue. The Americans also
offered to offset transportation costs but ``not to the extent''
Edmonton did, Fenton said.
	   ``I think it was a very fair process. I know the IAAF realized
that from a sponsorship standpoint the potential of our bid was
superior to the Edmonton bid. But there were many other factors
that were part of the decision.''
	   Edmonton impressed the IAAF by bringing a 27-member delegation
that included Klein and Canadian Justice Minister Anne McLellan.
	   ``They gave an impression of being so enthusiastic to host the
world championships,'' Reineri said. ``But they also had facts to
back up their words.''
	   Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great majority'' for
Edmonton.
	   ``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures
promised and the overall presentation which was really splendid,''
he said.
	   The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, Jack M.
Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city would
be covered for athletes and officials.
	   Reineri said this was an important selling point for the IAAF,
which in the past has paid for athletes within the quotas set for
each country.
	   Canadian television, which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in
Athens, committed to a three-year, dlrs 6-million contract with the
IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001.

Spirlea grabs spot in Chase semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Irina Spirlea did a little wiggle when her drop
shot fell over the net for a winner, and was even more animated a
few points later when she closed out 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Belgium's Dominique Van Roost to move into the semifinals at the
Chase Championships.
	   Spirlea, making her third appearance in the season-ending
tournament at Madison Square Garden, will face either second-seeded
Martina Hingis of Switzerland or No. 6 Mary Pierce of France on
Saturday. Their match will be played Friday night.
	   Thursday's late match paired two former No. 1s _ No. 5 Monica
Seles and unseeded Steffi Graf. Between them, they have won eight
championships.
	   Spirlea had her entire repertoire of shots working against Van
Roost, who made her Garden debut this year. She had help from her
opponent, who struggled with her serve.
	   Van Roost got only 50 percent of her first serves in and served
seven double faults. Spirlea, meanwhile, got 71 percent of her
first serves in.
	   The tone of the match was set right at the beginning. The
Belgian right-hander had problems holding her serve, and had to
battle through three deuces to hold her service in the first game
of the match.
	   Spirlea, a right-hander from Romania, never let up on the
pressure, always forcing Van Roost to play her style and at her
pace.
	   After Van Roost held to start the match, Spirlea won five
straight games to take control. Twenty-nine minutes after they
started, the Romanian had wrapped up the opening set.
	   The second set was more even. But by then it was too late for
Van Roost, who dropped her serve at love in the third game and at
15 in the eighth game.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist. The top
eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's blue carpet.
The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

NBA collective bargaining talks to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Will it be a serious negotiating session or
another day of public posturing?
	   That was the big question Thursday as owners and players
prepared to resume collective bargaining talks Friday at a
Manhattan hotel.
	   It will be the first time in more than three weeks that each
side's full negotiating committee will be present.
	   ``My hope is that the owners will be inclined to move off their
number and to really talk seriously about trying to reach some
accord,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``And if they
demonstrate a willingness to talk about a compromise and reach an
agreement, then I think we might be similarly situated.''
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik did not give a rosy forecast.
	   ``There will be no new proposal,'' he said, responding to a
rumor that the owners would put something new on the table. ``That
rumor has been out there for a few days, but it's not true.
	   ``But that's not to say something won't come out of the meeting,
because we're going in prepared to negotiate.''
	   After talking to players on conference calls for the past two
weeks, union officials said their marching orders were to withhold
any more concessions until the owners showed an inclination to
compromise.
	   With that mindset, Hunter sent a letter to every owner, team
president and general manager outlining the offers each side has
put on the table and warning that it would be ``an enormous
miscalculation to further test the players' resolve.''
	   The letters were received at team offices Thursday.
	   ``I agree with none of his characterizations,'' Granik said.
``But that's his privilege to send it out.''
	   Friday's bargaining session will be the outgrowth of a telephone
call National Basketball Association commissioner David Stern
placed to Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks earlier this week
which led to a two-hour meeting Tuesday that included Hunter, union
president Patrick Ewing, Stern and Granik.
	   ``They were concerned that if we weren't soon able to reach some
agreement, things might be in the dump,'' Hunter said. ``I don't
think they want to see that, and I don't want to see it.
	   ``I guess the issue would be whether they would be compelled
after a period of time to cancel the season. I don't really feel
they're suicidal and inclined or willing to do it, but that's what
they're talking about.''
	   League officials had not comment on that.
	   So far, the first month and a half of the season has been
canceled. An agreement would need to be reached in the next week or
so in order to start the season before Christmas.

Davies eagles two par-5s for her first lead of the year in final
</HEADLINE>
event &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Laura Davies, hoping to salvage a miserable
season with a win in her final official tournament, used her length
to eagle two par-5 holes Thursday and shoot a 6-under-par 66 for
the first-round lead in the LPGA Tour Championship.
	   Davies, who hasn't won in 20 months on the LPGA Tour, and was in
danger a few months ago of not even qualifying for the
season-ending event, dominated the short par-5s on the Desert Inn
Country Club course to take a two-shot lead over Juli Inkster.
	   Brandie Burton and Dottie Pepper were another shot back.
	   ``I'm almost scared to be leading after day one,'' Davies said
after a round played in perfect scoring conditions. ``I don't think
I've led a tournament after day one all year.''
	   Davies didn't make a putt over 10 feet but played the par-5
holes in a total of 6-under to post an early score that stood up
among the field consisting of the tour's top 30 money winners.
	   Annika Sorenstam, looking to wrap up player of the year honors,
struggled with her driver all day and shot 74. Rookie sensation Se
Ri Pak, who could surpass Sorenstam for player of the year with a
win, opened with a 72.
	   Thirteen players shot par or better in light winds and
temperatures in the 60s on the well-manicured course just a good
par-5 from the glittering lights of the city's casinos.
	   ``You get the 30 best players out here so you expect to see them
shoot some good scores,'' Inkster said.
	   Davies chipped in on the fifth hole for her first eagle and hit
a 6-iron to 10 feet (3 meters) for another eagle on the 15th. In
between, she birdied the ninth and 10th holes, both par-5s, with
tap-in putts.
	   It was a welcome change for the former No. 1 women's player,
whose struggles with her short game have left her winless on the
American tour since the Standard Register Ping last year.
	   ``It's been horrible, just horrible,'' Davies said. ``When
you've had three years of being No. 1 it's very difficult having a
year like this. If others are happy with 23rd (24th) on the money
list that's fine. I'm not happy with it.''
	   Davies used her length to reach two of the par-5s in two shots,
and chipped from just off the green on the other two. Though the
Desert Inn course on the Las Vegas Strip is listed at 6,373 yards
(5,800 meters), it played much shorter for the longer players who
enjoyed good roll on the tight fairways.
	   Davies hit wedges to most of the par-4s and, aside from a
driver-driver to set up her first eagle on the 525-yard (478-meter)
fifth hole, she hit middle irons for her second shots to the
par-5s.
	   ``It seems like a pitch-and-putt,'' said Davies, who played last
week with men's tour players in the Johnnie Walker Super Tour event
that stretched over four countries in six days.
	   Davies credited the experience of playing with Vijay Singh,
Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik on different days with helping her
concentrate more on her short game.
	   ``They were pretty honest. They said your short game isn't good
enough,'' Davies said. ``I watched the way they looked at
everything from every different angle. It really makes you think
maybe I've been doing something wrong.''
	   Inkster, a 15-year tour veteran, made five birdies but stumbled
on the final hole with a bad pitching wedge that missed the green
and led to her only bogey of the day.
	   Inkster has won once this year and is sixth on the money list,
after finishing in the same position a year ago.
	   ``I think I'm just kind of learning how to play this game,'' she
said.

Dollar drops against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Friday
in Tokyo after Japan's prime minister signaled a willingness to
consider more tax cuts. Japanese stocks rose.
	   The dollar bought 119.98 yen in early trading, down 0.68 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and slightly lower than its late New
York level of 119.99 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 106.74
points, or 0.74 percent, to 14,461.20 in the 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   In sealing a political alliance late Thursday with Liberal Party
leader Ichiro Ozawa, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi indicated he was
open to Ozawa's economic revival ideas, which include lowering a
national sales tax.
	   The move comes just a week after markets gave a lukewarm
reception to Obuchi's long-awaited stimulus package, which
contained 6 trillion yen (dlrs 50 billion) cuts in personal and
corporate income taxes.
	   The cuts were aimed at drawing Japanese consumers to back to
stores. But critics have said consumers would probably just salt
away the money instead of spending it.
	   Ozawa and others have called for repealing last year's increase
in the national sales tax, which they blame for dampening
consumption in the first place. Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party
had been fiercely resisting any calls to lower the national tax.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 6.79 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,110.79. The TOPIX
closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.925 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price down to 107.68 yen from 108.40.

Russia to launch first segment of international space station

<TEXT>
	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The long-delayed launch of the first
piece of the international space station, a Russian cargo module
called Sunrise, will usher in a new era of cooperation among former
space race rivals.
	   Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the
liftoff of the 24-ton module from the Baikonur rocket base in
Kazakstan, scheduled for 11:40 a.m. (0640 GMT) _ a year behind
schedule.
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that
will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment, the
cargo and control module Zarya (Sunrise), was repeatedly postponed
mainly because the chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't
afford to complete another part of the station that is to go up
later.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya will be launched by a
three-stage Proton booster rocket that would put the module into
orbit less than 10 minutes after blastoff. Zarya is designed to
serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project,
providing propulsion, power and communications.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to
blast off next July or August.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for
the new station, said at a news conference earlier this week.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware.''
	   Russian officials were more cautious.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which is
rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a
deputy chief of the Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said the new station is the only hope
for the once-mighty Russian space industry, whose funding has
disintegrated since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow
Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
	   Russia is expected to retire the Mir sometime next year,
although some officials have talked about trying to keep it aloft
longer.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

Two planes came within 100 meters of each other: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Qantas regional aircraft carrying 19
passengers and an air force plane came within seconds of colliding
earlier this week, Australia's aviation safety group said Friday.
	   A Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) spokesman said it was
the quick-thinking of an air-traffic controller using a trial radar
tracking system that averted a collision near Newcastle north of
Sydney on Monday.
	   A plane owned by Eastern Regional Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary,
and a Royal Australian Air Force light aircraft carrying two crew
passed within 100 meters of one another near Williamtown airport,
the spokesman said.
	   The Eastern plane, a Jetstream 31, was en route to Williamtown
from Sydney when it and the air force plane crossed paths in cloud.
	   Preliminary investigations had reportedly found the incident was
caused by a misunderstanding about radio frequencies and radar
coverage.
	   But the CASA spokesman said it appeared radar had prevented a
catastrophe.
	   ``It's radar that really saved them,'' said the spokesman, who
declined to be named.
	   ``The operator, the man who runs the radar on the ground, saw
the potential of either a collision or a very near miss and he
alerted them.''
	   A Bureau of Air Safety Investigation spokesman said it had
launched an investigation into the ``serious incident.''

Ted Purdy takes lead in PGA Tour qualifying tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Ted Purdy, a former University of
Arizona star who has played most of his professional golf in Asia,
had his second consecutive bogey-free round Thursday to take the
lead in the PGA qualifying school.
	   Purdy, 25, fired a 5-under 67 at the Weiskopf Course at PGA West
for a two-day total of 12-under 132, one shot better than tour
veteran Rick Fehr.
	   Fehr opened with a 62 on the La Quinta Resort Dunes Course on
Wednesday but had a 71 at the Weiskopf Course in the second round.
	   Brian Gay of Orlando, Florida was alone in third place at 134
after a 70 at the Dunes Course, with six players tied at 135.
	   Purdy, the 1997 Rookie of the Year on the Asian Omega Tour, was
the only golfer in the 169-player field to complete 36 holes
without a bogey.
	   He birdied three of the four par-5s Thursday, including a birdie
on the ninth hole, his last of the day, to gain sole possession of
the lead.
	   Fehr's second round was less eventful than his opening 62. He
had three birdies and two bogeys on a day that saw temperatures in
the mid-70s but more wind than in the first round.
	   Golfers will be re-paired for Friday's third round, with the low
half of the field playing the Dunes Course and the high half
playing the Weiskopf Course. Golfers will switch courses for
Saturday's fourth round.
	   The top 35 players and ties at the end of the six-day, 108-hole
tournament that finishes Monday earn exemptions to the PGA Tour
next year. The next 50 players are fully exempt to the
developmental Nike Tour, while the rest of the 169-player field has
a conditional exemption for the Nike circuit.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hetty Malik stands at the gates of
Jakarta's Atma Jaya university, recalling how the euphoria of a
3,000-strong pro-democracy protest degenerated into the panic of
street battles after soldiers opened fire on students.
	   Eight students died in the melee last week. Bloody rioting and
looting in other parts of the city killed at least eight more,
including members of the military.
	   In a gentle tropical rain, she watches supporters leave messages
swearing to continue the protests until Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie is toppled _ just as students led the struggle to force his
predecessor, Suharto, out of office.
	   ``It is a great tragedy,'' the diminutive 20-year-old English
language student says. ``The killing must stop.''
	   The deaths sent shock waves through the student movement, which
is driving Indonesia's fledgling democracy movement.
	   Suharto, who ruled the world's fourth most-populous nation for
32 years with an iron fist, stepped down in May.
	   At that time, massive protests ended in jubilation when
thousands of students stormed and occupied the green-domed
Parliament building.
	   Those protests, and the worst economic recession in 30 years,
had fueled a bloody rampage of rioting and looting in Jakarta. At
least 1,200 people were killed.
	   Suharto stood down to defuse the chaos, to be succeeded by his
protege and former deputy.
	   B.J. Habibie promised political reforms and took the first
tentative steps towards introducing democracy to Indonesia.
	   But the students and Habibie's detractors say his rule is little
different from Suharto, accused of accumulating vast wealth for his
family through corruption.
	   Vowing to topple Habibie in the same way as Suharto, student
bodies stepped up their protests.
	   On the gritty pavement outside Atma Jaya, commuters and
passersby crouch over a white banner, writing messages of
condolence and support for the dead students.
	   ``You lives were taken for reform. This will not be forgotten,''
reads one. ``Keep on struggling to destroy the evil of the
nation,'' said another. Wreathes of palm fronds and flowers stand
nearby.
	   At the gates of the Parliament other students placed paper roses
at the feet of riot police who, armed with sticks and shields,
prevent their entry.
	   At other ceremonies, students raised their fists and bowed their
heads in prayer before taking to the streets again.
	   ``None of us are afraid of the soldiers,'' Arif Rachman, a
protest organizer said.
	   ``We are getting stronger now because of the killing of our
colleagues.''
	   ``We will continue to stage protests until this country has a
democratic transitional government which is free from Suharto,
Habibie and their cronies,'' The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted
another student leader, Adian, as saying.
	   Habibie has alleged that the student protests have been
orchestrated by conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old
government.
	   Ten opposition figures have been charged with sedition.
	   Workers come out of the office towers in Jakarta's business
district to clap and shout messages of support during rallies.
Drivers sound their horns and wave.
	   ``I think the people are very supportive of the students,'' says
Heru Arifin, a 42-year-old travel agent.
	   In St. Carolus Hospital in Central Jakarta, Engkus Kusnadi is
kept alive by artificial respiration and intravenous feeding
devices.
	   Unable to eat or speak and unaware of his surroundings, the
19-year-old architecture student was beaten by police during the
violence at Atma Jaya, his friends said.
	   His father said it was the first time he had taken part in a
protest.
	   At the mourning gathering outside Atma Jaya, 21-year-old Gina
Iriani proudly wears her bright-orange school blazer makes a rude
gesture as a military truck passes by.
	   ``We hate the armed forces,'' she said. ``This is now the second
tragedy and we are angry. The government is not taking
responsibility. We are not satisfied with the government. We will
continue to fight.''

South Korean forces on alert after ship disappeared
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Marines and navy warships went on
alert along South Korea's west coast Friday after a suspected North
Korean vessel crossed the sea border, military officers said.
	   South Korean radar lost track of the boat early Friday, one hour
after it was first spotted crossing the the buffer zone separating
the two Koreas, they said.
	   South Korean patrol boats searched the choppy waters as
anti-submarine helicopters hovered above, acting on the possibility
that the vessel was a North Korean submersible. Marines searched
the western coastline.
	   ``It may be just a stray fishing boat, but we are preparing for
the possibility that North Korea may have tried to land
infiltrators,'' said a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman, who
identified himself only as Lt. Col. Chung.
	   With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Hanoi prepares to host annual heads of state meeting

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Many of the leaders who attended the
troubled summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation this week
will soon be meeting again to tackle the same seemingly intractable
problems.
	   Vietnam, one of the newer members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, has made it clear that the aim of the
nine-nation group's annual summit next month will be to avoid the
public bickering that overshadowed the APEC meeting in Malaysia.
	   Half of the leaders from the APEC summit are expected at the
Vietnam gathering on Dec. 15-16.
	   The theme will be peace, stability and equitable development,
all of which have suffered in much of the region since the Asian
economic crisis began last year. It is reflected in the logo, which
features a blooming lotus flower, a Vietnamese symbol of
prosperity.
	   ``In recent months, Southeast Asia has been seen as a region
seriously affected by the financial and monetary crisis,''
Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Vu Khoan said Thursday.
	   ``We think it will be seen again as a region of prosperity,
peace and stability _ a reliable partner in the world community.''
	   Adding to the prospects for a friendlier summit is that Vietnam,
which as host is supposed to mediate disputes and foster consensus,
opposes suggestions that it is time to change ASEAN's founding
principle of non-interference in members' internal affairs.
	   Such proposals came from the Philippines and Thailand after
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was fired and jailed
on abuse of power and sex charges.
	   The opportunity for outside criticism also has been heavily
curtailed.
	   Unlike last year's meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, U.S.
officials won't be here. Neither will six other ``dialogue
partners'' that Malaysia invited: Russia, Canada, India, the
European Union, New Zealand and Australia.
	   Khoan blamed ``technical problems'' for curtailing the dialogue
partners to China, Japan and South Korea. He said Vietnam did not
make the decision.
	   There were private grumblings by several members last year that
inviting so many outsiders diluted what started out as an
Asians-only meeting.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Burma and Vietnam.
	   Cambodia has applied for membership, but its recent political
uncertainty has delayed a final decision. Khoan said Vietnam wants
its neighbor admitted and hopes that an agreement reached last week
on structure of a new government could finally pave the way.
	   This is the biggest and most high-profile international
gathering that Vietnam has hosted, and there have been concerns
raised about problems in everything from technical support to
logistics and access by reporters to officials.
	   ``There might be some problems,'' Khoan admitted. ``If that
happens, we urge you to understand.''
	   The summit will preceded by several days of meetings by
high-level officials who ASEAN hopes will finish work on a final
declaration that the heads of state will be able to basically
rubber-stamp, further avoiding the prospects for dissension.
	   ``So far we have already reached a fairly high level of
consensus'' on many issues, Khoan said.
	   In addition, ASEAN hopes to complete agreements on
implementation of several protocols that were signed last year.
	   The summit will be followed by a mass meeting between ASEAN
members and the dialogue partners, then separate sessions with each
of those three countries.

Quakes hit southwest China

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two strong earthquakes hit a rural area in
southwestern China and injured 240 people, the Central Seismology
Bureau reported Friday.
	   A quake measuring 5.0 struck the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County
in southwest China's Yunnan province and neighborinng Yanyuan
County in Sichuan province at 7:31 p.m. (1131 GMT) Thursday,
followed by a 6.2 quake seven minutes later.
	   Sixty-three people suffered serious injuries, but there were no
deaths, said a bureau spokesman, who gave only his surname, Tan.
	   The quake destroyed houses of 223 families, and there were
numerous small aftershocks, he said.
	   Quakes measuring 5.3 and 5.2 hit the same area, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Oct. 2 and 27.

Tourists swim through freshwater crocs after boat sinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ About 50 tourists swam frantically to
safety around several freshwater crocodiles after their tour boat
sank in the Fitzroy River in Western Australia's remote northwest,
police said Friday.
	   The boat went down in the Geikie Gorge when the tourists, most
from Germany, rushed to one side to photograph a freshwater
crocodile on Thursday morning.
	   Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) officers
who were in charge of the vessel believe it had already started to
take on water when the imbalance created by the rush sent it down.
	   Some of the passengers swam 15 meters (about 50 feet) through
the fierce-looking but usually harmless freshwater crocodiles to
the riverbank, a CALM spokesman said. They said more dangerous
saltwater crocodiles were not in the river.
	   Other tourists were plucked from the water by rangers who were
about 500 meters (yards) away in another boat when the accident
happened. Divers were attempting Friday to recover some of the
tourists' belongings.
	   ``The police are investigating and will be taking statements
from the passengers,'' CALM regional manager Chris Done said.
	   He said the tour boat, Miss Geikie II, was licensed to carry 60
passengers.

Mexican legislators to meet with Zapatista rebels in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Seeking to break a
two-year impasse, Mexican lawmakers and Zapatista rebel leaders
were hoping a weekend meeting in the southern state of Chiapas
could get the peace process back on track.
	   The three-day talks beginning Friday in San Cristobal de las
Casas mark the first meeting since January 1997 between the rebels
and a mediating committee made up of Mexican legislators. The rebel
leaders also plan to meet with representatives of non-governmental
organizations.
	   ``We have the full desire of obtaining good results with the
civil society that is working for peace,'' said Major Moises, a
rebel leader.
	   Moises and 28 other rebel leaders were bid farewell Thursday by
2,000 Tojolabal Indians as they left the hamlet of La Realidad,
near the Zapatista hideout in the Lacondon jungle, to head to the
talks.
	   Subcomandante Marcos, the charismatic leader of the Zapatista
movement, is not expected to participate in the meetings.
	   The almost 5-year-old conflict has been a constant cloud over
the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, who took office a
year after the Zapatista staged an uprising in the name of greater
rights for indigenous peoples.
	   Negotiations between the government and the rebels have been
stalled since 1996, when the government failed to honor a partial
peace accord signed that year by federal representatives.
	   While the Zapatista National Liberation Army does not pose a
threat to the Mexican government in a military sense, its continued
presence in Chiapas' Lacandon jungle has left Zedillo open to
criticism at home and abroad that he is not doing enough for peace
and to help Mexico's poor Indians.
	   ``What the Zapatistas demand is their right to live with
justice, democracy, liberty and dignity,'' Subcomandante Marcos
said in an interview published Wednesday in the Mexico City daily
La Jornada.
	   Zedillo's refusal to abide by indigenous rights guarantees that
were part of the San Andres accords has led to dissent within the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   Ruling party Sen. Eloy Cantu on Tuesday urged a peace initiative
that ``goes beyond the stubbornness of not recognizing past
mistakes.''
	   Sen Luis H. Alvarez of the conservative National Action Party, a
member of the mediating committee, also criticized the government's
failure to end the conflict.
	   ``The marginalization of indigenous people, which led to the
uprising, continues to worsen,'' he said after arriving in Chiapas.
``That is why it is urgent for the government and the Zapatistas to
return to the negotiating table and reach an agreement.''

Clinton urges Japan to move aggressively toward economic revival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with UPDATED material on Clinton speech Friday
morning. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton offered measured praise
Friday for Japan's strategy to end the nation's longest recession
since World War II but said he was ``quite worried'' about trade
battles if Tokyo does not open its markets to American-made goods.
	   Clinton also suggested that Japan might have expand its recovery
programs ``to jolt the economy back into growth.''
	   In a speech to business leaders, Clinton said the world may
resort to retaliatory protection unless Japan lowers trade barriers
and opens its markets. ``I'm quite worried about this.''
	   The president spoke as Americans watched his attorney, David
Kendall, defend him at House impeachment hearing in Washington.
	   Clinton complained in particular about a 500 percent increase of
Japanese imports of hot-rolled steel into the United States. He
warned that the lack of market access for American goods ``will
create in our country the potential for a retrenchment here in a
way that will not be good for Asia or Japan or for the United
States in the long run.''
	   ``We want to keep our markets open, but we need fair,
rule-based, disciplined expansion,'' the president said.
	   He pressed Japan to vigorously implement its programs to save
failing banks and to cut spending and taxes by dlrs 196 billion. He
said that rapid action is crucial.
	   ``The people here may conclude that even more must done to jolt
the economy back into growth,'' the president said.
	   Saying that nations cannot ignore their responsibilities,
Clinton added, ``As my daughter's generation says, that denial is
not simply a river in Egypt. We know what the challenges are and we
have to find the means to meet them.''
	   He said he was confident that Japan can restore growth for
itself and the rest of Asia.

Spy organization seeks help from migrants to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Members of Sydney's ethnic
communities are being recruited by the Australian Security
Intelligence Organization (ASIO) to work as volunteer ``spies'' for
the 2000 Olympics.
	   ASIO, Australia's main domestic spy agency, said Friday it has
begun liaising with ethnic groups whose countries have been linked
to terrorism for help identifying potential targets.
	   The intelligence agency has a list of 16,000 known terrorists
from 600 active groups and is concerned some foreign extremists may
have already established themselves in local communities.
	   ASIO said its aim is to have informal networks in place to
identify potential terrorists who slip through the net Australia's
authorities have set up at the nation's air and sea ports in
advance of the Games.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In the climax to a historic impeachment
hearing, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr unflinchingly defended
his investigation of a presidential sexual affair Thursday night
under insistent questioning from President Clinton's private
attorney.
	   ``I am confident that we have abided by our obligations,'' Starr
said as David Kendall pressed him on several allegations of
improper investigative work.
	   As the House Judiciary Committee's opening session went late
into the night, Kendall began his interrogation by saying that
Starr had run an ``overkill of investigation'' that failed to turn
up evidence of impeachable offenses.
	   Starr calmly said he wasn't appearing as an advocate for the
report he had presented to Congress. But he accused the president
of ``perjury and obstruction of justice'' in connection with his
affair with Monica Lewinsky and Clinton's long effort to conceal
the truth about it.

Australia makes cautious start to the Ashes series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ English left-arm seamer Allan
Mullally had early success against Australia on Friday as the home
side made a careful start to be 58 for one at lunch on the first
day of the first Ashes test.
	   Mullally, bowling first change in the 11th over at the Gabba,
had Michael Slater dropped with his third ball, but in the next had
the opener well caught by Mark Butcher at third slip for 16 runs.
	   Mark Taylor, who had earlier won the toss in his 100th test, was
rather subdued in scoring 30 runs in two hours while one-drop
batsman Justin Langer, after a nervous start, settled down to score
seven in 51 minutes at the break.
	   Australia did well to not lose more than one wicket in the first
session, especially with Mullally repeatedly beating the outside
edge in his seven overs. He has taken 1-16.
	   After Slater had punched his third ball off Dominic Cork to the
point boundary in the second over to put runs on the board, Taylor
waited for 17 balls to score his first runs.
	   Slater, playing his first home test since January 1996, was
dropped on five at second slip with Nasser Hussain managing to get
his finger tips to a flying outside edge with the score on 18.
	   But Slater failed to make use of the reprieve, lasting just 10
more deliveries before edging a head-high catch in Mullally's
second over.
	   Taylor was given a stern working over from paceman Darren Gough
with the new ball, the Yorkshire bowler having extra motivation
following the death of his grandfather Fred on Wednesday.
	   Gough was told of the death after the Australian Cricket Board's
official launch of the international season at the Brisbane Town
Hall on Wednesday night. England players wore blackarm bands Friday
as a mark of respect. (ik/djp)

Japanese brokerage to withdraw from several overseas markets:
</HEADLINE>
report

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nikko Securities Co., a top Japanese brokerage
which became a unit of Citigroup Inc. in June, will effectively
withdraw from several overseas markets as part of a broad
restructuring effort, a local report said Friday.
	   Nikko will close or scale-back 11 of its 14 foreign subsidiaries
by year's end, including those located in New York and Hong Kong,
the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Japan's largest daily said an
official announcement was expected as soon as later Friday.
	   A Nikko spokesman said he was unaware any such decision had been
made.
	   The report comes as just the latest signal of a full-scale
retreat from overseas markets by recession-hit Japanese financial
institutions.
	   Other firms which have announced plans to close their foreign
branches include Mitsui Trust and Banking Co., Daiwa Bank Ltd. and
the recently nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   Travelers Group Inc., which later merged with Citicorp to create
Citigroup, stunned Japan's financial industry earlier this year
when it bought a 25 percent stake in Nikko Securities, the
country's third-largest broker, for dlrs 1.6 billion.

UN to test whole scope of searches before reporting on Iraqi
</HEADLINE>
cooperation &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector said he plans
to test the ``whole spectrum'' of U.N. searches over the next three
to four weeks _ including surprise, potentially confrontational
visits of suspected arms sites.
	   After that time, Richard Butler said he could report to the
Security Council on whether inspectors have received the full and
unfettered access to weapons sites demanded by U.N. resolutions and
agreed to by Iraq last weekend in a bid to stave off threatened
U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   Already, Butler has sent Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq three
letters _ the last one Thursday _ demanding Iraq immediately turn
over documents that detail what types of weapons of mass
destruction Iraq produced and where the weapons are now.
	   ``If I can have the answer to those two questions, and if the
answers are good ... then I will happily say to the Security
Council it's over,'' Butler told the Overseas Press Club on
Thursday.
	   No reply has been received, he said.
	   Butler spoke at a midtown hotel as inspectors completed their
second day back on the job after Baghdad severed all cooperation
with them Oct. 31. Iraq reversed the decision on Saturday, and the
inspectors returned to Baghdad on Tuesday after leaving the country
in fear of U.S. airstrikes.
	   To date, the inspectors have only visited sites already searched
to check on monitoring equipment.
	   Over the next week, Butler said he would start compiling teams
who will go on unannounced searches of suspected weapons sites _
visits which have been the most confrontational but also have given
inspectors some of their best information over the past seven
years.
	   The United States and Britain have said that their threat of
military force remains against Iraq _ a threat which Butler
acknowledged provided him a unique window to gain valuable
information. ``But it won't last long,'' he said.
	   ``We will test the whole spectrum of our work,'' before
reporting back to the council within three to four weeks, he said.
	   The Security Council has said it would conduct a complete
overview of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions once Butler
has reported that inspectors have received full cooperation from
Iraq.
	   Iraq hopes the so-called ``comprehensive review'' will lead to a
lifting of the eight-year-old U.N. oil embargo, which has
devastated its economy.
	   But U.N. and western diplomats noted Thursday that the more Iraq
cooperates with inspectors in the short term _ by turning over
documents, for example _ the more it could actually hurt its
chances of having sanctions lifted.
	   With more information, countries that take a harder line against
Baghdad, particularly the United States, would have that much more
ammunition to justify keeping sanctions in place until their stated
goals of ousting Saddam Hussein is met, the diplomats said.
	   The Security Council imposed sanctions in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, sparking the Gulf war. Sanctions can only be lifted
once inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles used to deliver
them.

Brazil's Cruzeiro beats Argentina's San Lorenzo 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Alex Alves scored an early goal to
give Cruzeiro a 1-0 win over San Lorenzo in this Mercosur Cup
semifinal first leg on Thursday.
	   About 40,000 fans gave Cruzeiro a firework reception onto the
pitch and cheered them on for much of the game. But its players
could not make it a game to remember.
	   Alex Alves goal came after 19 minutes when he bundled a swinging
cross from Gustavo into the net.
	   After an early onslaught by the Brazilian side, San Lorenzo
started to creep back and just before the break, its striker Acosta
looked set to score from six yards when Marcello made a timely
rescuing tackle.
	   Right on the stroke of halftime, Goalie Dida performed similar
heroics for the Argentinian team. He dived at Valdo's penalty kick,
pushing it with one hand over the bar.
	   The spot kick had been awarded when Malusovich blocked a
goalbound shot by Muller with his hand.
	   San Lorenzo kept a tighter rein on the game in the second half,
snuffing out the Brazilian sides attacks with relative ease,
despite some last minute pressure.
	   Alex Alves continued to threaten, overshadowing partner Fabio
Junior _ who was substituted _ but missed his easiest chance on 50
minutes when he hit wide from close.
	   Junior's performance was disappointing for those who have
predicted he will follow in the footsteps of Ronaldo who used to
play for the same club.
	   The second leg will be played in Buenos Aires, although no date
has been set for it. The overall winners will play Brazil's
Palmeiras in the final.
	   Line-ups:
	   Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo, Marcelo Dijan, Gottardo, Gilberto,
Marcos Paulo, Djair, Valdo, Muller (Caio), Alex Alves, Fabio Jr
(Marcello).
	   San Lorenzo: Passet, Paredes, Tuzzio, Ameli, Coudet, Lussenhoff,
Malusovich, Rivadero, Gorosito, Estevez (Corta), Acosta (Baiugo).

Religious Jew arrested for planning attack on Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with Chabad officials denying man is
central figure in the movement. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man has been arrested for allegedly
planning an attack Thursday on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
a northern Israeli city.
	   Israel radio identified the suspect as 48-year-old Shabtai
Bloch, a follower of the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement. Bloch
allegedly planned to attack Netanyahu on Thursday in the city of
Safed, where the premier was visiting soldiers wounded in Lebanon.
	   Chabad officials in New York, however, said they had never heard
of the man, although they said it is possible that Bloch is a
follower of the movement.
	   ``Violence, and even the threat of violence, is anathema to
everything that the Chabad-Lubavitch movement teaches and stands
for,'' said Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a spokesman at the group's
headquarters in Brooklyn.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not provide details of the
planned attack, and said the incident was being investigated.
	   The radio reported that Bloch had organized dozens of Chabad
activists in Safed to protest an Israeli troop withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank set to begin early Friday.
	   Israel radio said Bloch, like many in the Chabad movement, had
been active in Netanyahu's 1996 election campaign and felt betrayed
by the prime minister for giving up land to Palestinians that
religious Jews believe was promised to them by God.

Publisher's killing shocks Vancouver
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Moderate Sikh leaders sought
answers and protection from police Thursday following the killing
of an outspoken supporter and friend.
	   Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of the Indo-Canadian Times, was
gunned down Wednesday in the garage outside his home in suburban
Surrey.
	   Hayer, 64, an outspoken critic of violent Sikh fundamentalists,
survived a murder attempt a decade ago that left him in a
wheelchair.
	   Harkirat Singh Bagga, then 18, was sentenced in December 1988 to
14 years in prison for shooting Hayer six times.
	   Hayer's daughter blamed ``worthless cowards'' for the death of
her father.
	   ``They are responsible for not only killing an honourable
Canadian, a journalist, father, grandfather and husband, but also
for branding the Indo-Canadian community as violent terrorists,''
Rupinder Hayer told a news conference on the lawn of a family
friend's home.
	   Rupinder Hayer, choking back tears, was surrounded by about a
dozen family members and friends. The publisher's children pledged
their father's newspaper would continue.
	   Hayer had recently been excommunicated and received repeated
threats over his criticism of an edict from the religion's high
priest in India.
	   ``The police knew about the threats ... they (family) complained
to the police,'' said Balwant Singh Gill, the moderate president of
Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh temple and a friend of Hayer.
	   Police said they did all they could to protect the controversial
newspaper publisher.
	   Hayer's murder came as a shock to Jarnail Singh Bhandal, the
moderate vice-president of the Ross Street temple in Vancouver.
	   ``It should never happen. This is shameful,'' said Bhandal, who
has himself received several threats. He wants to meet with police
immediately to discuss protection for moderate supporters.
	   Gill and Bhandal believe the killing was an attempt to
intimidate people from electing moderate candidates in a temple
election Sunday in Abbotsford in Vancouver on Dec. 5.
	   ``People are very anxious,'' said Gill, who has himself been
threatened. ``Maybe some more people will get killed. I don't
know.''
	   Violence has plagued Greater Vancouver's Sikh community since
the edict was issued by high priest Ranjit Singh to remove tables
and chairs from temple dining halls. The edict aggravated tensions
between fundamentalist and moderate factions.

Meissnitzer makes it look easy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Alexandra Meissnitzer calls Austria home.
But this pal of Picabo Street has a lot of American in her.
	   One thing is for sure: The United States feels like a second
home when Meissnitzer competes in a ski race.
	   ``I just like the States,'' Meissnitzer said after a crushing
2-second victory in a women's World Cup giant slalom on Thursday.
``It's hard to find conditions this good.
	   She won a silver medal in GS in the 1998 Winter Olympics in
Japan ``and I'd like to go for gold in Salt Lake City (in 2002),''
she said. ``It's always special to race here; it must be something
in the air.''
	   Meissnitzer, who got a big hug in the finish area from Street,
the American Olympic gold medalist, sounded like her American
friend in describing her winning race.
	   ``I just decided to, you know, go for it,'' said Meissnitzer,
whose effervescent personality demolishes the stereotype that
Austrians are bleak, austere automatons.
	   Her time of 2 minutes, 18.13 seconds left defending World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl far back in second, with
Liechtenstein's Birgit Heeb gaining her first-ever podium finish in
2:20.39.
	   ``I was nervous because it was still snowing when it was my
turn,'' Ertl said. ``My light was not as good as Meissnitzer. After
getting a second (after a disappointing 10th in the season opener),
I'm looking forward to my next race a lot more.''
	   After a first run conducted on the hard snow and brilliant
sunshine that are trademarks of the Park City Mountain Resort, the
top 30 racers who qualified for the second run had to fight not
only the clock but flat light and snow squalls that intensified as
the afternoon progressed.
	   The flat light, caused by heavy cloud cover that moved in just
before the afternoon session, made it especially difficult to make
the transition from the relatively flat upper section to the steep
middle pitch. Until Ertl and then Meissnitzer came down, Heeb was
the only racer able to carry enough speed off the middle section to
keep from getting bogged down on the flats leading to the finish.
	   For a time, she flirted with becoming the first Leichtenstein
woman to win a race since two-time overall champion Hanni Wenzel,
now head of the country's ski federation, in 1984.
	   ``It (the second run) was more difficult than the first one,
with the snow falling,'' said Heeb, whose four top-five career
finishes have come in the United States _ three in Park City. ``I
had some problems, but I still was happy.''
	   Even Ertl wasn't as good as Heeb in the second run, and she lost
most of the .86-second margin she had on the Liechtensteiner after
the first run. Had the second run been a few yards longer, she
might have failed to grab second.
	   All that became moot after Meissnitzer rolled down the mountain.
As on the first run, when she was fastest as the first racer of the
day, she was flawless at the top. Where others struggled with the
transition change from flat to steep, she carved strong turns that
only added to her speed.
	   By the time she reached the flats, she was ahead by almost two
seconds, and adding to the margin with every gate. When she flashed
across the finish line, she knew she had won and it was only the
incredible margin of victory that caused her to throw her arms in
the air and sink to her knees in the snow.
	   ``I got a little better light than the skiers in front of me,''
Meissnitzer said. ``The second course was more turny, but I decided
I couldn't take it safe.''
	   Meissnitzer's fourth career victory and Heeb's first-ever podium
overshadowed some other starting results. One was turned in by
16-year-old rising star Janica Kostelic of Croatia, a stunning
fourth and only .37 out of the top three. Added to the 12th she had
in the season-opening race at Solden, Austria, three weeks ago, she
has branded herself as an immediate factor in the battle to wrest
Ertl's title.
	   Placing a heartening seventh was Austria's 31-year-old former
World Cup overall champion Anita Wachter, whose career appeared
over after a knee injury in a crash just before the Olympics last
season. Wachter fought back through the summer and, displaying the
light touch that has been her trademark since 1985, appeared to be
as good as ever.
	   The United States got a boost when Sarah Schleper of Vail,
Colorado, considered more of a threat in slalom, finished 16th in
2:21.89. Schleper had a start number of 39, a disadvantage she
overcame by placing 18th in the first run. Teammate Alex Shaffer of
Aspen, Colorado, who was .01 slower than Schleper as the 40th
starter, struggled a bit in the afternoon but still earned five
points by placing 26th in 2:23.52.
	   Canada, like the United States, was figured to serve as an
also-ran in an event expected to be the sole domain of Europeans.
But Allison Forsyth, who just qualified for a second run by placing
29th, improved five spots for 24th in 2:22.91.

_ about his own conduct, and that of the prosecutors, FBI agents
and others who worked for him.
	   After a litany of allegations, Starr responded: ``It's time for
some fairness with respect to all of these charges that keep
getting bandied about.''
	   Kendall's questions were a continuation of the day-long pattern
under which Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee
sought to put the spotlight on Starr, whose evidence triggered the
third impeachment inquiry in the nation's history.
	   The day began with Starr laying out the evidence he has gathered
about Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky, and accusing the president of
conducting a ``scheme to conceal.''

Japanese defense chief resigns in widening corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's Defense Agency stepped down
Friday, one day after releasing an internal agency report that
exposed a cover-up at the highest levels in a growing corruption
scandal.
	   Fukushiro Nukaga handed his resignation to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi after a Cabinet meeting Friday morning, an agency spokesman
said.
	   Nukaga, who served in the post since July, will be replaced by
fellow ruling party lawmaker Hosei Norota, news reports said.
	   Defense Agency officials are being investigated for allowing
Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. inflate defense contract bills
in exchange for cushy jobs for retiring bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted, as have a dozen
employees and former employees from NEC and two subsidiaries.
	   Nukaga first made public his intention to resign at a press
conference Thursday, where he released the results of an inquiry
into the scandal.
	   On Thursday, he also announced punishments such as temporary
paycuts for 31 officials in connection with the scandal.
	   Three high-ranking officials questioned by prosecutors in the
scandal, including the agency's top bureaucrat, Vice Defense
Minister Masahiro Akiyama, also resigned Friday, said the agency
official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   In a statement, NEC said it ``deeply regrets and offers a
heartfelt apology for the distress and disturbance it has caused.''
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
the Defense Agency totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 13.9
million).
	   Thursday's report, put together after an internal agency
investigation, said that officials throughout the agency conspired
to hide evidence from prosecutors.
	   The report follows an earlier internal inquiry into the scandal
released last month that absolved the agency of widespread
wrongdoing. The report was harshly criticized on the floor of
Japan's Parliament as a bureaucratic cover-up.
	   Nukaga pledged to take personal charge of a second
investigation, which produced Thursday's report.

Campaign to ban death penalty worldwide launched
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Roman Catholic nun who wrote ``Dead
Man Walking'' came to the United Nations on Thursday to launch a
international campaign for a moratorium on the death penalty.
	   Sister Helen Prejean was joined by Tim Robbins, who directed the
1995 Oscar-winning film based on her book, in delivering petitions
backing the appeal to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The petitions _ signed the Dalai Lama, six other Nobel Peace
Prize winners and close to a hundred other prominent people
worldwide _ calls for the U.N. General Assembly to establish a
universal moratorium on executions next year, with a view to a
total abolition.
	   ``There are some human rights that are so deep they are
nonnegotiable,'' Sister Prejean told reporters. ``They are not
given by governments to people for good behavior nor taken away by
governments for bad behavior.''
	   The petition was organized by Hands Off Cain, an Italian
anti-capital punishment group.
	   Robbins was nominated for an Oscar as best director for the
film, which was based on the true story of the spiritual
relationship between Sister Prejean and a killer on death row.
Robbins' longtime companion, Susan Sarandon, won an Oscar for her
role as the nun.
	   Robbins said capital punishment was a worldwide human rights
issue.
	   ``Unfortunately in this country, it's an issue of politics. Too
often, politicians who would say otherwise privately, have to
publicly come out for the death penalty,'' he said at a news
conference.

	   In a House Judiciary Committee appearance that was televised
nationally, Starr said the ``plain language'' of the Constitution
makes clear that Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury after he
leaves office, regardless of the outcome of the impeachment
proceedings.
	   ``I stand behind it because it is mine,'' he said of the report
he submitted to the committee in September outlining grounds for
possible impeachment arising from Clinton's sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   The committee is to vote at the end of the hearing, expected to
last several days, on whether to recommend impeachment to the full
House. If impeachment prevails in the House, the Senate would hold
a trial to decide whether Clinton should be removed from office.

South Korea fires guns at suspected North Korean ship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new detail throughout

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A suspected North Korean vessel
crossed the fog-shrouded sea border but sped away Friday after
South Korean marines fired at it, military officers said.
	   Marines and navy warships went on alert along the west coast.
The Defense Ministry mobilized reserve forces to join the search in
Kanghwa, an island county just south of the border and 50
kilometers (31 miles) west of Seoul.
	   South Korean naval radar first spotted the boat crossing the
buffer zone into South Korean waters 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) off
Kanghwa at 1:45 a.m. (4:45 GMT)
	   With flares lighting up the sky, marines fired a number of
rounds from shore-based artillery. Officers characterized them as
warning shots.
	   Marines used rubber boats to chase the ship, which quickly
turned around and disappeared into thick fog. South Korean radar
lost track of the boat an hour later, the officers said.
	   South Korean patrol boats searched the choppy waters as
anti-submarine helicopters hovered above, acting on the possibility
that the vessel was a North Korean submersible. Marines searched
the western coastline.
	   ``It may be just a stray fishing boat, but we are preparing for
the possibility that North Korea may have tried to land
infiltrators,'' said a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman, who
identified himself only as Lt. Col. Chung.
	   With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Spirlea grabs spot in Chase semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Graf-Seles match &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When the last ball had been struck, Steffi Graf
was still standing. Barely.
	   After surviving a nearly perfect set by fifth-seeded Monica
Seles to begin the match, Graf continued her remarkable run
Thursday night by outlasting her longtime foe 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 and
advancing into the semifinals of the season-ending Chase
Championships.
	   In the night's first quarterfinal, Irina Spirlea of Romania
easily beat Belgium's Dominique Van Roost 6-2, 6-3.
	   By winning her 12th consecutive match, Graf proved she is a
serious contender once again. And even in defeat, Seles, named
Comeback Player of the Year earlier this week, showed she also is
ready to battle for the No. 1 ranking.
	   ``I don't like to compare victories,'' said Graf, seeking her
third straight title. ``It's just been great to be able to keep on
playing well after my injury. It's just been great to keep on
going.''
	   The first set took just 24 minutes _ the length of time Graf
used to post in rushing past her victims. This time, she was on the
losing end. As she walked to her chair, she muttered aloud to
herself. In German.
	   It was a conversation she would continue until the final point.
Then, Graf sat in her chair, her head thrown back in exhaustion,
but smiling.
	   This was a match that should have been played at Paris and the
U.S. Open in 1993 _ before a crazed Graf fan stabbed Seles in the
back during a match.
	   This was a match that should have been played at the Australian,
French and U.S. Opens in the intervening years that saw first one,
then the other, then both sidelined by injuries.
	   Graf, 29, underwent wrist surgery in September. Seles, 24, just
overcame a 48-hour stomach virus.
	   You couldn't tell it by the quality of the battle between the
two former top-ranked players.
	   They tested every line on the blue Madison Square Garden court,
found every corner, hit most of the angles. While their basic plan
of attack was battering-ram groundstrokes from just inside the
baseline, they tried every shot in the book, trying to impress
their will on the other.
	   There was no way Seles could keep up the game she showed in the
opening set. Perfection goes only so far. All Graf could do was
wait until her opponent's game cooled off a bit.
	   Graf appeared a little nervous, a little tentative. She had
every reason to.
	   ``She just overpowered me,'' Graf said. ``I couldn't get a
return in.''
	   She solved Seles' serve for the first time in the third game of
the second set, breaking her at 30 with a patented Graf forehand
that skipped off the carpet deep in the far corner.
	   Seles broke right back, and the two traded service breaks again
in the seventh and eight games.
	   But Seles made a few errors in her next service game, and that
was all Graf needed. She held at 15 in the 10th game and, 61
minutes after they had begun, the two were level at one set apiece.
	   Neither refused to yield. Graf fought through four deuces to
hold serve in the fourth game of the third set. Seles held from
deuce in the next game.
	   On the changeover following the fifth game of the final set,
Graf called for a trainer and had her right foot and ankle
rewrapped. During the injury timeout, Seles stood alongside the
umpire's chair and stretched, trying to keep limber.
	   In the ninth game, Graf finally got the crucial break.
	   It started when Seles buried a forehand in the net. Then Graf
hit a forehand that Seles thought was long. Seles returned it into
the net and looked at umpire Leanne White, seeking an overrule.
There wasn't one, and Graf had a love-30 lead.
	   Two more errors by Seles gave Graf the break, and the German was
serving for the match.
	   Seles refused to surrender, fighting off four match points
before Graf finally hit an inside-out forehand winner for the spot
in Saturday's semifinals where she will play the winner of Friday
night's match between top-seeded Lindsay Davenport and No. 8
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Spirlea did a little wiggle when her drop shot fell over the net
for a winner, and was even more animated a few points later when
she closed out her straight-set victory.
	   Spirlea, making her third appearance in the Championships, will
face either second-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland or No. 6
Mary Pierce of France on Saturday. Their match will be played
Friday night.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist. The top
eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's blue carpet.
The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

Japanese stocks up sharply, dollar lower against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with midday stock, late morning bond and
currency prices; ADDS 5th graf trade quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose sharply early Friday amid
optimism the government may cut a national sales tax to spur
consumer spending and pull the world's second largest economy out
of a prolonged slump. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 362.61
points, or 2.53 percent, to 14,717.07 as of midday. On Thursday,
the average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.37 yen in late morning trading, down 1.27
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 119.99 yen overnight.
	   Share prices soared after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party sealed a political alliance late Thursday
with the minority Liberal Party, which has pushed hard for a
temporary suspension of the national sales tax.
	   ``What surprised the market was that the two parties had more
specific discussions on the sales tax cut,'' said Masatoshi Sato,
manager of investor information group at Kankaku Securities Co.
	   The parties agreed to a ``radical revision'' of the unpopular
sales tax, which was raised to 5 percent last year from 3 percent.
The tax hike was widely blamed for tipping the economy back into
recession after a brief spurt of growth.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section climbed 20.68 points, or 1.87 percent, to 1,124.68. The
TOPIX closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, the day before.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, optimism about the impact
of a possible reduction in the so-called consumption tax led
players to bid up the yen and sell dollars, traders said.
	   The dollar was also weakened by speculation about a possible
resurgence of trade friction between the U.S. and Japan and rumors
that unspecified U.S. hedge funds might dump Deutsche marks for
yen, they said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.930 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.850 percent, driving its price down to 107.64 yen from 108.40.

Sosa overwhelms McGwire for NL MVP award

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sammy Sosa insisted all along that Mark McGwire
should be the National League's Most Valuable Player. No one
outside St. Louis agreed with him.
	   After losing to McGwire in the race for the home run record,
Sosa overwhelmed his friendly rival Thursday, getting 30 of 32
first-place votes and 438 points in balloting by the Baseball
Writers' Association of America.
	   McGwire, who hit 70 homers to Sosa's 66, got the other two
first-place votes and 272 points. Two sports writers for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch voted for McGwire and had Sosa second.
	   ``I would have voted for Mark,'' Sosa said in Chicago. ``In my
heart, Mark McGwire is still the man.''
	   McGwire, on vacation in Australia, praised his rival but didn't
say how he would have voted.
	   ``To put it in his words, today Sammy is the man,'' McGwire said
in a statement issued by the Cardinals. ``He did a great job
carrying the Cubbies back to the playoffs.''
	   As they approached Roger Maris' old home run record of 61, Sosa
and McGwire became friends. Sosa repeatedly predicted McGwire would
get to the record first and often said it was McGwire's year.
	   ``It's hard to hit 70 home runs and not win MVP,'' Sosa said.
``I was never so sure to myself that I had it until today.''
	   But the baseball writers put a premium on playing for a winning
team, and Sosa led the Chicago Cubs into the playoffs for the first
time since 1989. The Cardinals stumbled to a third-place finish in
the NL Central, 19 games behind Houston and seven behind the
wild-card Cubs.
	   Sosa hit .308 and led the majors with 158 RBIs, 132 runs and 414
total bases.
	   McGwire finished with 147 RBIs and a .299 average, leading the
majors in walks (162), slugging percentage (.752) and on-base
percentage (.470).
	   Sosa's win made the MVP awards a sweep for Latin American
players. Texas' Juan Gonzalez _ a former teammate of Sosa's in the
Rangers' minor-league system and a native of Puerto Rico _ won the
AL MVP on Wednesday.
	   Everyone back in Sosa's homeland in the Dominican Republic
expected him to win. He joined George Bell (1987) as the only
Dominican MVP winners.
	   ``Sosa, This is Your Day,'' blared the lead sports page of the
newspaper Listin Diario, printed before the vote totals were
announced.
	   Sosa will go to the Dominican Republic early Friday morning and
meet with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said his agent, Tom
Reich. Sosa, who intends to spend about 10 days on the island, has
been heavily involved in helping the country recover from Hurricane
Georges.
	   ``My reputation outside the field, that counts a lot,'' Sosa
said. ``Maybe people took it from there.''
	   Sosa, given a hero's welcome last month when he returned to San
Pedro de Macoris, said his charitable foundation has been involved
in distributing food.
	   While Sosa was first or second on every ballot, McGwire got 20
seconds, three thirds, one fourth, four fifths, one sixth and one
seventh.
	   Even Cardinals manager Tony La Russa thought Sosa had the edge.
	   ``I'm so biased it's ridiculous, but I think Sammy deserves
it,'' La Russa said during the season's final week. ``I don't think
he's done more for his team than Mark has, but his team has done
more than ours has, so his contribution counts for a little more in
my book. Just barely, but that's who I would give it to.''
	   Under their contracts, Sosa gets a dlrs 250,000 bonus for
winning and Houston's Moises Alou gets a dlrs 10,000 bonus for
finishing third with 215 points. Atlanta's Andres Galarraga gets a
dlrs 100,000 bonus for finishing sixth.
	   It was the eighth time a Cubs player has won the MVP award, the
first since Andre Dawson in 1987.

Clinton urges Japan to move aggressively toward economic revival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with more details from speech, additional material. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested Friday that
Japan may have to expand efforts to end its longest recession since
World War II and said he was ``quite worried'' about trade battles
if Tokyo fails to open its markets to American goods.
	   Urging rapid implementation of banking reform plans and a huge
economic stimulus program, Clinton said, ``The people here may
conclude that even more must be done to jolt the economy back into
growth.''
	   In a speech to business leaders, Clinton said the world may
resort to retaliatory protection unless Japan lowers trade barriers
and opens its markets. ``I'm quite worried about this now.''
	   He complained in particular about a 500 percent increase of
Japanese exports of hot-rolled steel to the United States. ``No one
seriously believes that this is solely because of changing economic
conditions,'' the president said.
	   He warned that the lack of market access for American goods
``will create in our country the potential for a retrenchment here
in a way that will not be good for Asia or Japan or for the United
States in the long run.''
	   After Clinton's speech, Tom Foley, U.S. ambassador to Japan,
told reporters, ``Japan is a country that is the least likely, I
think, to feel that a growth of international protectionism would
help it, for I don't think there is any likelihood of that.''
	   In a show of friendship, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took
Clinton to the bustling Ginza district for lunch at one of his
favorite restaurants.
	   ``We want to keep our markets open, but we need fair,
rule-based, disciplined expansion,'' the president said.
	   He pressed Japan to vigorously implement its programs to save
failing banks and to cut spending and taxes by dlrs 196 billion. He
said that rapid action is crucial.
	   ``The people here may conclude that even more must be done to
jolt the economy back into growth,'' the president said.
	   Saying that nations cannot ignore their responsibilities,
Clinton added, ``As my daughter's generation says, that denial is
not simply a river in Egypt. We know what the challenges are and we
have to find the means to meet them.''
	   He said he was confident that Japan can restore growth for
itself and the rest of Asia.
	   With 70 percent of Asia's economic power, ``Japan and only Japan
can lead Asia back to stability and growth by meeting its own
economic challenges,'' Clinton said.
	   Toyko was the first stop on a five-day Asia trip, and Clinton
opened his visit by telling Japan ``don't be discouraged'' by
economic hard times ``but do be determined.''
	   Gene Sperling, a senior economic adviser, said, ``There is no
question that we were frustrated that Japan did not play a more
constructive role'' on trade liberalization this week at the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia. Japan reneged on
pledges to lift tariffs in the forestry and fishing sectors.
	   Tokyo was the first stop on an Iraq-delayed trip to Japan, South
Korea and Guam. Later Friday, Clinton was traveling to Seoul for a
three-day visit focusing on concerns about North Korea's nuclear
program.

Despite problems in Thailand, studio optimistic about new Foster
</HEADLINE>
film
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Though 20th Century Fox has dropped
plans to shoot a remake of ``The King and I'' in Thailand, a studio
spokesman said Friday the company is confident the new film
starring Jodie Foster and Hong Kong actor Chow Yun Fat will strike
a chord with today's audiences.
	   The movie targets a generation of younger moviegoers who may
have seen previous versions of the tale _ about a prim Victorian
governess, Anna Leonowens, hired by a Thai king to teach his
children English _ only on the small screen.
	   ``The very iconic presence of Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat
seems like it would work for this audience today. People want to
see romances,'' said Fox spokesman Jorge Carreon, noting the
success of the film ``Titanic.''
	   Fox had planned to shoot the film on location in Thailand, but
cited red tape and bureaucracy in its decision earlier this week to
move production of ``Anna and the King'' to neighboring Malaysia.
	   The Thai Film Board twice rejected scripts submitted by Fox,
saying they were demeaning and featured inaccurate portrayals of
Mongkut, a 19th Century king of Siam, as Thailand was then known.
	   ``The studio would love to have filmed in Thailand,'' said Fox
spokesman Carreon, reached in Beverly Hills by telephone. ``It's a
beautiful country where the story takes place and would add
realism.''
	   Thai officialdom were unwilling to sanction another unflattering
representation of Mongkut following ``Anna and the King of Siam''
in 1946 and the musical ``The King and I'' a decade later, for
which Yul Brynner won an Oscar.
	   Most Thais revere the monarchy and feel these early films
portrayed Mongkut as a cruel buffoon. Many blame this caricature on
filmmakers' use of the gossip-laden memoirs of Leonowens, whom
local historians view as an unstable woman who wildly exaggerated
her own importance.
	   ``The King and I'' was banned from theaters in Thailand and the
new film was likely to suffer the same fate, board officials have
suggested.

Singapore finance minister more optimistic about economy next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's finance minister has said economic
performance in the recession-hit city-state should be better than
expected next year, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``The outlook for 1999 is not as gloomy as we originally
thought,'' Finance Minister Richard Hu was quoted as saying by The
Business Times.
	   Hu said Singapore's falling interest rates, combined with
regional economies beginning to bottom out, had started to take the
pressure off the island republic's vulnerable economy.
	   ``But anything can happen, we don't know,'' he warned.
	   The most recent forecasts from Singapore's economic planners
have estimated slight overall growth this year, but a more
uncertain performance next year.
	   The government has predicted gross domestic product in 1999
somewhere between a one percent contraction and one percent
expansion compared to this year.
	   But on Thursday, Hu pointed to the general easing of credit in
Singapore over the last few months, and said this trend ``seems
likely'' to continue, ``which I think is fortunate for everyone.''
	   The latest round of rate cuts has led to a prime rate at major
banks of around 6 percent, down 1.5 percentage points since
mid-September. Analysts expect prime rates to slide below 5 percent
by the middle of next year.
	   The rate cuts make it easier for businesses to raise capital and
relieves the burden of mortgage payments on homeowners.
	   He added that the falling rates should mitigate imminent wage
and pension cuts that will be the main component of a 10 billion
Singapore dollar (dlrs 6 billion) business cost cutting package
from the government.
	   Hu was also optimistic about Singapore stocks and property
markets, which are ``both beginning to firm up.''
	   On Thursday, the benchmark Straits Times Index rose to a
six-month high to close at 1316.55 points. Banks and property
stocks have fared well on the back of falling interest rates.
	   Although real estate prices continue to fall, demand has picked
up recently, signaling that the property slump may be near its end.

Bangkok struggles to clear notorious traffic jams for sports fest

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taxi driver Suthip Theerapong took a
nanosecond to give his traffic outlook for the Asian Games in
Bangkok.
	   ``Very bad,'' said Suthip, 36, cruising past banners advertising
the regional Olympic-style event down the middle of a choked
expressway. ``Too many cars, too many people. It's going to be very
bad.''
	   Bangkok's traffic ranks among the world's worst. Everyone from
ordinary motorists to Asia's top sports officials have fretted how
the city will cope when 8,000 athletes and larger hordes of support
staff, officials, journalists and fans converge here Dec. 6 to Dec.
20.
	   Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director-general of the Olympic Council
of Asia _ charged with ensuring that the games' organizers have
facilities up to international standards _ recently spent a week in
Bangkok focusing on traffic.
	   ``No one can claim to have any magical solution to this eternal
problem in Thailand,'' al-Ahmad said. ``But I'm very comfortable
with the arrangements made for the movement of the athletes and the
media.''
	   Officials of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee have
made traffic flows a major priority and say they'll have it as
under control as possible.
	   Schools will close for the two-week period of the games, taking
parents ferrying their children off the roads _ something that
normally eases traffic considerably. Major roadworks will be shut
down, keeping the streets clear of heavy equipment.
	   A deputy director of the national police has a place on the
organizing committee, and he's deploying 9,000 traffic officers _
easily distinguished by their surgical masks to cut down on
breathing exhaust fumes.
	   Bangkok has also just finished 24 kilometers (15 miles) of new
expressway to link up the three main sporting centers, including
the athletes village. Train services are also being beefed up.
	   ``How can we call the Asian Games a success if athletes,
officials and spectators cannot get to the events on time?'' asked
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, president of the organizing
committee.
	   Al-Ahmad believes the bigger problems will surface for officials
and spectators staying in downtown hotels, who may have a tough
time getting through surface streets to the expressway.
	   ``They'll need to be organized to reach their facilities,''
al-Ahmad said. ``They'll have to allocate time, lots of it, to get
where they're supposed to be.''
	   Designated ``Asian Games Lanes'' on some downtown streets may
help. Shuttle bus services are being laid on from various hotels
and shopping centers.
	   Bangkok has had a reputation for poor traffic ever since the
first roads started being laid to replace the historic canal system
that once gave the steamy city the nickname ``Venice of the East.''
	   The Thai capital has roughly the same number of cars as New York
or Paris, but only 40 percent of the road area.
	   Unconnected, dead-end streets abound, forcing traffic onto the
same major arteries that quickly become saturated. Motorcycles
thread between stalled cars, buses and tuk-tuks _ three-wheel taxis
open to the pollution of a million spewing tailpipes.
	   Mass transit projects have been talked about for years. A subway
is finally being built and a skytrain nearing completion _ though
the construction sites along major roadways often worsen traffic.
	   An overhead rail-and-road system meant to serve the Asian Games
was canceled last year due to huge cost overruns.

Russia to repay loans to South Korea with bartered goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Russia has agreed to provide South
Korea with up to dlrs 63 million worth of aluminum, copper and
other raw materials this year to repay outstanding loans, officials
said Friday.
	   Russia will also deliver 10 helicopters over the next three or
four years, said South Korean Finance and Economy Ministry
officials who took part in debt repayment talks in Moscow last
week.
	   Russia borrowed dlrs 1.47 billion from South Korea in 1990-92,
but could not repay the debt on schedule.
	   Under a 1995 deal, Moscow has provided South Korea with dlrs 210
million in weapons and ammunition, including 33 T-80U tanks and 33
armored vehicles. South Korea also obtained 22 civilian helicopters
and raw materials.
	   That still left Moscow with dlrs 160 million in overdue
principal and interest payments.

Chinese sentenced for 1993 hijacking

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese hijacker who was sent back to the
mainland from Taiwan was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in
prison on Friday, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Intermediate People's Court in Shenzhen, in Guangdong
province in south China, tried and sentenced Huang Shugang on
Friday morning. He also was convicted of embezzling public funds,
the report said.
	   Huang was repatriated on July 16, 1997, after extensive
negotiations between the two government-backed organizations that
handle talks between the mainland and Taiwan in the absence of
official ties. He was accused of hijacking an airliner to Taiwan on
April 6, 1993.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seven people convicted of murder and robbery were
executed in Beijing, a local newspaper reported Friday.

on Thursday after a high court denied appeals, and the executions
were immediately carried out, the Beijing Daily reported.
	   Four of the seven were convicted of being part of a gang that
stabbed a pregnant market stall owner to death and stole 10,000
yuan (dlrs 1,200). The other three were convicted of a kidnapping
and using guns and knives in robberies.

Buddhist monks refuse to evacuate temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Some people get evicted for not paying their
rent or disturbing the peace with unruly parties _ but three
Buddhist monks became suspicious when the government ordered them
out of a remote hillside retreat.
	   The Rev. Fah Koon, 65, told the South China Morning Post he
thinks the government is trying to evict him and two fellow monks
from the Bodhi Monastery to develop luxury villas on the outskirts
of Kowloon.
	   The government says it issued the order because the temple sits
on a dangerous slope and denied any property developments were
planned, the newspaper reported Friday.
	   The monks defied the eviction order on Tuesday and are seeking
legal aid so they can stay put. Fah Koon shrugged off any hazard of
living on the hill.
	   ``Even if you move to the moon, you are subject to some kind of
danger. We have been living here for 40 years. We think it is a
safe place,'' he said.
	   If the monks lose their legal battle, the government will set a
new eviction date, the paper quoted an official as saying.

knife, then fatally stabbed himself in the neck, police said
friday.
	   Le Van Vu, 35, died two hours after he was admitted Wednesday to
the Bac Lieu provincial hospital in southern Vietnam with his
parents-in-law, who are still being treated. Police are

Canadian prime minister lauds China's progress on rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised
China for signing international accords on human rights Friday, but
said his country was still troubled by reports of curbs on freedom.
	   ``Indeed, progress is being made. Progress which we applaud,''
Chretien said in a speech at elite Tsinghua University.
	   But he cautioned: ``Many Canadians are disturbed when we hear
reports from your country of restrictions on the right to free
expression of different political views. And particularly when we
hear of people being harassed and imprisoned for expressing
political views different from the government.''
	   Chretien urged China to quickly ratify two key United Nations
accords providing fundamental guarantees of civil, religious and
political rights.
	   Following meetings between Chretien and his Chinese counterpart,
Zhu Rongji, the two countries signed a set of seven agreements
Thursday on cooperation in environmental work, legislation, urban
development, agriculture and the preservation of cultural relics.
	   Chretien also was to inaugurate a fast-food venture at a local
bus station on Friday. On Saturday, he was to make a quick trip to
the western city of Lanzhou, in Gansu province, to inspect joint
development projects there, before returning to Canada late in the
day.
	   The Canadian leader was accompanied on the visit by an entourage
of 70 trade officials and executives.
