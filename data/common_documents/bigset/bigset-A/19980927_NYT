ARIZONA LAST IN AID PAID TO SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
For Sue Scully, the question doesn't go away.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It haunts her as she drives the 75 miles from Golden Valley,
west of Kingman, to her job as a grocery store checker in Boulder
City, Nev. It stays with her as she sits in her dilapidated mobile
home, and watches the bills stack up. It gnaws at her when she
thinks about her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   How can her husband's life be worth $183.75 a week?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Scully gets from workers' compensation _ a poor
replacement for her husband, Regis, who was killed in an industrial
accident in Kingman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very hard,'' said Scully, 45, through a voice choked
by tears. ``We have no money left over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully's situation is not unique. Arizona ranks dead last among
the 50 states in workers' compensation benefits paid to widows and
widow ers of workers killed on the job. At $183.75, Scully gets the
maximum. In the highest-paying state, Iowa, surviving spouses
receive $817 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (benefit levels) are an embarrassment,'' said Sandra Day,
a Mesa lawyer who represents injured workers. ``They're an
indication that workers don't have much status or financial value
to the public policymakers in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 114,000 workers received medical benefits and
about 15,000 received reim bursement for lost work days, ac cording
to the Arizona Industrial Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, more than 1,000 workers end up on permanent disa
bility. &QL; 
INJURY BENEFITS ALSO POOR
</P>
<P>
   While the survivors' benefits rank last, the benefits are almost
as bad for workers injured on the job. Arizona ranks 45th
nationally in the maximum wage available under workers' comp _ $322
per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, on these cases, if your claim gets denied, you
are going to be broke immediately,'' said Chris Johnson, who also
repre sents injured workers. ``If you get accepted, you'll probably
be broke in a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gila County deputy sher iff Joseph Llewellyn can attest
to that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990-91, he was hurt on the job, not once but twice. Neck and
back injuries left him 50 percent disabled and in constant pain. He
received $500 a month from work ers' compensation, and some of that
went to the lawyer he hired to get his benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He was financially devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our credit, lost a vehicle, almost lost our home,''
said Llewellyn, 51, a Vietnam veteran and 13-year deputy who had
made $25,000 a year. ``Our family had to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn, who went to college during his rehabilitation, now
works for the state Rehabilitation Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn said he found there was virtually no support for
workers injured on the job. He says the law needs revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to be a support system, then it should support
you, like a crutch does a broken leg,'' he said. ``If it's not a
support system, let's get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While people such as Scully and Llewellyn are forced to
struggle, the state workers' compensation system is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums have been cut by double digits in each of the past four
years. In 1997, the State Compensation Fund _ the state's largest
workers' comp provider _ returned more than $75 million in
dividends to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arizona ranks last in benefits, the premiums paid in the
state _ which are set by a national rating bureau _ are below
average, according to a national study by the Oregon Department of
Consumer and Business Services.
</P>
<P>
   Those low rates are a selling point in attracting new business
to the state, and that has blunted attempts by organized labor to
get the Legislature to raise benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is then you have the Legislature and the
governor's office and everybody saying, `Boy we want to really
protect this. This is really a plus for the state,' '' said Larry
Etchechury, director of the Arizona Industrial Commission, which
administers workers' com pensation. &QL; 
LOW RATES A SELLING POINT
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a selling point,'' said Jerry LeCompte,
director of the State Compensation Fund. ``Espe cially when
compared to the system that California had. The benefits had gone
crazy and there was so much fraud in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, LeCompte recognizes that benefits levels may
have to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, personally, I don't believe the benefit levels in Arizona
should be last in the nation,'' LeCompte said. ``Should they be
first in the nation? I don't believe that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the five-member In dustrial Commission wrote to the
Legislature, asking for benefits to be increased for the first time
in six years. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the commissioners noted the state Constitution
calls for a ``just and humane'' benefit to workers injured on the
job. They said raising benefit levels could be offset by premium
decreases.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of increasing bene fits falls to the Legislature,
which has been frozen on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 50th out of 50 states,'' said Chuck Huggins,
secretary-treasurer of the Arizona AFL-CIO. ``That's below the
federal poverty line. How do we justify that?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, labor unions backed a bill that would have increased
benefits by indexing the payout to a percentage of the state's
average weekly wage, which is $506. It didn't make it out of
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business leaders want a number of technical revisions
to the law, dealing with issues such as judicial review,
reemployment and the loss of earning capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But neither labor nor business can gain an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a standoff,'' said Farrell Quinlan, a spokesman for
the Arizona Chamber of Commerce. ``Both sides have enough power to
blunt the other, but not enough to advance our agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, who heads a state Chamber committee that deals with
workers' comp, says it will be a tough sell as long as the economy
is doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us realistically see any changes in the workers' comp
law in the next year or two,'' Jones said. ``The economy is too
good. To be perfectly realistic, workers' compen sation insurance
premiums have been going down in the last six to eight years, and
as long as they're going down, no one wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Except people like Javier Figue roa.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Yuma County man lost his arm and was paralyzed
in a cotton gin accident in Roll last year.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa was on a catwalk when his jacket sleeve was caught in a
pulley of a machine that was supposed to have been turned off. He
was tossed 35 feet into the air, hit the ceiling and then hit a
beam on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his left arm, and broke his back, his ribs and his
ankle. He now must use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed everybody around me, completely,'' he said. ``I'm
talking familywise. Everybody's personality has changed because of
this. They've got to do special things for me. I don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers' compensation insurance paid for his wheelchair, his
medical care and a new wheelchair-accessi ble mobile home. &QL; 
CAN'T COVER THE BILLS
</P>
<P>
   But Figueroa, who has two young sons, can't cover his bills with
the $1,050 he receives each month in workers' compensation. Making
things worse, his wife had to stop working so she could care for
him. Before the accident, they were making close to $2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family of four can't live on a thousand dollars a month,''
he said. ``Not when you're used to having two paychecks coming in
every week.'' &QL; 
As for Sue Scully, she continues to struggle to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Each of her children _ ages 8 and 19 _ receives $315 a month
from workers' compensation. She and her youngest child receive a
combined $1,300 a month from Social Security, which pays survi vors
benefits based on what the deceased made during his or her life.
</P>
<P>
   Scully's life has changed drasti cally. Before the accident, she
and her husband worked opposite shifts, so they didn't need day
care. It now costs her several hundred dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
   And she has no health insurance. Every time a kid has the
sniffles, it comes straight out of her pocket. And she has to pay
for her own expensive blood pressure medica tion.
</P>
<P>
   Regis was insured for $20,000. Still, mortgage payments, water
assessments and repairs have eaten up all the money. Her husband,
an expert mechanic, is no longer around to keep the car running or
fix things around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Unless survivors can fall back on family members or carry hefty
life insurance policies, they don't have enough to live on. Others
are forced to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Under Arizona law, an employee (or his family) cannot
successfully sue his direct employer for a workplace injury or
death, unless the employee turns down workers' compensation
coverage when he's hired.
</P>
<P>
   But the law doesn't protect other companies that are involved in
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Carrie Jayo-Thomas. Her husband, Sabino Jayo
Jr., was killed in May 1994 when a wall collapsed on a job site at
the Yuma Proving Ground. While she couldn't sue his direct
employer, she filed a lawsuit against the general contractor,
another subcontractor and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the case was settled for an undisclosed sum,
requiring Jayo-Thomas to pay back all the workers' compensation
benefits she had received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful what they put you through.'' &QL;

USC OVERMATCHED BY FLORIDA STATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Hurricane Georges barely made an appearance
Saturday, depositing just a few intermittent bursts of showers
above Doak Campbell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it left a far stronger impression on the locals than
USC's offense, which was as close as anything came to being
declared a natural disaster in this city.
</P>
<P>
   At least USC took its offense home with it. The 18th-ranked
Trojans certainly didn't leave it on the field in an embarrassing
30-10 loss to 10th-ranked Florida State before 79,815.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a test of USC's mettle, but it turned
out to be an expose of its greatest shortcoming, an offense that
barely mustered a whimper against the Seminoles' swarming defense.
</P>
<P>
   USC's quarterbacks amassed 23 yards passing, a total so low that
school officials were going to have to research the last time the
Trojans passed for so few yards.
</P>
<P>
   Several Trojans teams have passed for 0 yards, the last time
against College of the Pacific in 1945. But the Trojans did not
even attempt a pass in that game.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was so anemic that Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick threw for more yards (14) than USC quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst (5 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned into girls and didn't play,'' said USC offensive
lineman Travis Claridge, analyzing how his unit got totally
outclassed by its opponent.
</P>
<P>
   On most plays, the quarterback simply snapped the ball, waited
about two seconds and got hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good feeling,'' freshman quarterback Carson
Palmer said. ``There's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After entering this game confident from their 3-0 start, the
Trojans were taught just how far their offense remains from testing
one of the nation's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge game for USC football,'' Trojans wide receiver
Billy Miller said. ``And a big blow. We didn't do anything with the
ball. We looked like we belonged in Division I-AA.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest was also viewed as USC coach Paul Hackett's first
chance to direct the Trojans against a top-notch program.
Obviously, he's got a lot of work ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, they overwhelmed us,'' Hackett said. ``We tried
different schemes. We tried moving the quarterbacks. We changed
blocking styles and they still got pressure on the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Van Raaphorst was bothered by flu-like symptoms,
neither he nor Palmer were able to stress the Seminoles (3-1).
Together, they completed just 3 of 19 passes.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the defense's strong performance, USC trailed only
13-3 at halftime. The Trojans were still in the game after freshman
tailback Frank Strong's 73-yard run set up a touchdown that cut the
lead to 20-10 with 25 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Strong's game-breaking run turned out to be nothing more
than an aberration. He also had two fourth-quarter fumbles that
ended drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a contribution from an offensive standpoint to
keep in the mix,'' Hackett said. ``We couldn't get the ball in the
air. The penalties continue to plague us. We've got some issues on
the offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps USC's last gasp occurred early in the fourth quarter,
with the Trojans losing 23-10. With a third-and-1 at their own 39,
nearly 10 seconds burned off the 25-second clock as Palmer talked
to assistant coach Ken O'Brien on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Palmer joined the huddle and the offense lined up,
there was no chance to snap the ball before the clock expired.
Palmer completed a bomb to R. Jay Soward over the middle, but the
play had been whistled dead before the snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we made the decision to fake on the line, and go for a
touchdown,'' Hackett said. ``We couldn't get the mechanics to
Carson on how to do it in time. I've got to take a close look if
it's not too much for him. We've got to examine if maybe it's too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's offense also struggled, but made several clutch
plays. Quarterback Chris Weinke completed just 13 of 31 passes, but
passed for 228 yards and two touchdowns. The Trojans also got
burned repeatedly by Warrick, who caught six passes for 112 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense was just good enough to win,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``We've got all the pieces on offense. (But) the
inconsistency of our offense can undo the potential that is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Hackett tried to hold things together as the
Trojans became the 36th straight opponent to leave Doak Campbell
Stadium without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all that shocked. This is the level we need to play
at. We were not up to that today,'' he said. ``There was no
shellshock at all. This football team, we're not going to blink.
This team has too much character.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros won't have anything of importance to play for until the
playoffs begin in a few days. Nevertheless, their intensity remains
as strong.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Umpire Eric Gregg ruffled some feathers on the home team with a
controversial, rally-killing call in the Astros' 3-2 loss to the
Chicago Cubs on Saturday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg called pinch hitter Dave Clark out for running out of the
baseline on a play that would have brought the tying run home in
the ninth inning. Gregg's call ended the game and left the Astros
in a foul mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a brutal call,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``How
could two (umpires) miss that? And then they take off running up
the tunnel, and there's nothing you can do about it. That was just
a bad call.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros didn't like it, one can only imagine what the San
Francisco Giants thought of Gregg's game-ending decision. The
Giants, who beat Colorado, would have gained sole possession of the
wild-card lead had the Astros defeated the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Giants and Cubs hold a one-game lead over the Mets, who
will be eliminated today if they lose to the Braves or if either
the Giants or Cubs win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets are eliminated, the Astros will host San Diego in
the Division Series beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Astros haven't lost sight of their ultimate goal,
Saturday's postgame rhetoric was heavy on Gregg and light on the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the hell Eric saw,'' Clark said. ``It was a
bad call. I didn't get to say anything. He made the call and got
the heck off the field. He didn't even ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Eric sees the replays. I have to believe the Giants
hated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's explanation of the call was short and to the point: ``I
called him out for running out of the baseline when he (Cubs closer
Rod Beck) tried to tag him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the commotion was a strong outing by Astros starter
Shane Reynolds, who deserved more than a no-decision. Reynolds, who
was attempting to become a 20-game winner for the first time,
scattered seven hits over seven innings and allowed just one run
while striking out 11.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds left with the score 1-1, but reliever Jay Powell
couldn't keep the Cubs off the scoreboard and the Astros' offense
disappeared in the middle seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   All of Reynolds' strikeouts came in the first six innings, and
the Cubs advanced just two runners into scoring position before
Gary Gaetti led off the seventh with a double and scored on a
sacrifice fly by pinch hitter Orlando Merced.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti provided the finishing touch in the eighth with a two-run
double off Powell (7-7).
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Magnante retired Mickey Morandini on one pitch to
start the eighth inning, Dierker summoned Powell from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who was 2-for-4 with a pair of singles, and Mark
Grace greeted Powell with back-to-back hits. Glenallen Hill took a
called third strike for the second out of the inning. Gaetti then
ripped a slider into the gap in left-center to give the Cubs a
two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made two good pitches to Sosa and Grace, but they found the
holes,'' said Powell, who has allowed only one other hit _ also a
double _ to Gaetti in nine career confrontations. ``The pitch to
Gaetti was just a bad pitch. It was a hanging slider _ a terrible
slider. It just seems like he sits on certain pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was all Beck could do to sit on the 3-1 lead in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros appeared ready to work some more of their late-inning
magic when Jeff Bagwell led off with a solo homer off the back wall
of Lefty's Pub. Bagwell, who was 3-for-4, drove in the Astros'
other run with a single to center in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou followed Bagwell's homer with a double and moved to
third on a ground ball by Carl Everett. At that point, all it would
have taken was a sacrifice fly to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a good shot,'' Bagwell said. ``Everyone is so
used to us coming back, but it's not going to happen all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck struck out Tony Eusebio on four pitches, setting the stage
for the game-ending drama.
</P>
<P>
   Clark tapped a slow chopper down the first-base line and veered
away from Beck, who fielded the ball and attempted to tag Clark.
Unsure if he had made the tag, Beck wheeled and threw toward first,
hitting Clark in the back. The ball bounced away as Alou crossed
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Players rose from the Astros' bench to greet what they thought
was the run, and even Beck was unclear regarding what had
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the tying run had scored,'' said Beck, who earned
his 50th save and claimed he tagged Clark. ``I was turning around
to argue with Eric, but when I saw him make the out call, I said
`Yeah!'''

WILLIAMS' 6 TDS DRIVE LONGHORNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ For those seeking the first watershed moment in Texas
football coach Mack Brown's tenure, consider what his team did last
night in Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns took the suspense out of a matchup with Rice,
scoring early and often en route to a 59-21 romp.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to throttle lesser lights with regularity figured
heavily in the reassignment of predecessor John Mackovic after the
1997 season. But there was no struggle for these Longhorns, who
followed the record-setting lead of tailback Ricky Williams to
improve to 2-2 after consecutive losses against top 10 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Williams rushed for a career-high 318 yards and six touchdowns,
bettering his five-touchdown performance in last year's 38-31
nail-biter at Rice Stadium. He averaged 10.6 yards per carry on 30
attempts and, with 32 yards in receptions, set a school record with
350 all-purpose yards. Williams' all-purpose total provided more
than half of Texas' school-record 692 yards total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky looked as good tonight as anybody I've ever seen,''
Brown said. ``He's just a fabulous football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite, the team's redshirt freshman quarterback, also
thrived on a Rice diet, completing 71.4 percent of his passes (15
for 21) for a career-high 258 yards and two touchdowns. He directed
a first-team offense that exploded for 616 yards on 58 snaps (10.6
average) before retiring for the evening with 5 minutes, 50 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UT's performance, which included a season-high four sacks by a
swarming defense, stood in stark contrast to its effort in last
week's 48-7 loss to No. 5 Kansas State. It also stood in marked
contrast to Mackovic's five career matchups against Rice, which
included two victories by a touchdown or less and a 19-17 loss in
1994 that broke the Longhorns' string of 28 consecutive victories
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football is a game of momentum, and we needed a game
like this to establish ourselves and boost our confidence,'' said
offensive guard Ben Adams. ``It's hard to predict the future, but
this win could be very big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly qualifies as big for Williams' Heisman Trophy
campaign, as well as his pursuit of several NCAA career records. On
the strength of a six-touchdown night, Williams jumped from 17th to
seventh on the NCAA career scoring list and, with 62 touchdowns,
stands within three of the NCAA career mark (65) held by Indiana's
Anthony Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely in the zone out there ... more than I've ever
been,'' said Williams, who missed a potential seventh touchdown
with a lost fumble at the Rice goal line in the second quarter.
``For the first time in a while, I felt like a real running back. I
was relaxed and I made some moves on their safeties. I expected to
get at least 250 yards against Rice. But when I got to 300, that
was special. It proved I had the conditioning to take it that
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' scoring runs varied in length from 16 to 41 yards.
Most were accomplished dragging Rice defenders into the end zone as
Owls coach Ken Hatfield stood in wonder while his team dropped to
1-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is a great back, but they've got the best offensive line
we've seen all year,'' Hatfield said. ``They've bigger than us,
they're faster than us, they're stronger than us, they're a better
football team than us and they beat the dog out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Hatfield never uttered similar remarks after a
matchup against a Texas team coached by John Mackovic.

AS OUR ETHICS WANE, LIES GROW
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started in the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Adam was contemplating his na vel when Eve walked up wearing a
new fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, do you think this makes me look fat?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, Eve. It looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first lie.
</P>
<P>
   No, just a little fib. Would you believe, Eve was standing by
this tree, see, checking out some fruit, when a serpent slithered
up and hissed, ``Trust me, you'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, President William Jefferson Clinton is hardly unique
when it comes to temptation and dishonesty. Humankind's story is a
rollicking saga of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Herodotus, the father of history, was also dubbed ``the father
of lies'' because his accounts were so bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Scriptures bulge with tales of perfidy, from Genesis to Peter's
denial that he knew Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Niccolo Machiavelli said success ful princes are ``those who
give their word lightly, who have known how to trick men with their
cun ning.''
</P>
<P>
   The namesake of our nation, Amerigo Vespucci, lied about being
the first to discover South America.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon wrote fantastically fraudulent dispatches of military
exploits.
</P>
<P>
   The story about George Washington's cherry tree is a myth
concocted by a minister with a penchant for fibbing.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler advocated ``the big lie,'' and perfected it with
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon appeared on TV to say, ``There can be no whitewash
at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver North conducted covert operations in defense of truth,
justice and the American way _ then lied to Congress about it.
</P>
<P>
   And now a president faces possi ble impeachment while much of
the public seems indifferent to his deceit. Polls, if you can trust
them, say six of 10 people believe Clinton lied under oath about
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, yet an equal number don't want him
out of office. &QL; 
WATERGATE EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kerr, author of The Pen guin Book of Lies, wrote in 1989
that the public conscience changed after Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas before we expected politicians to lie, and to resign
if they were caught, today we expect them to lie as much, and then
we excuse them for it. . . . We seem to want to excuse them just as
we would want to be excused ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics, honesty and truth are no longer perceived to be of
such fundamental importance in public life because they are not
perceived to be of much importance in private life, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some of us are more virtuous than others.
</P>
<P>
   But four of 10 Americans are said to fudge on taxes. We lie
about traffic tickets, sell cars and houses without mentioning
defects, falsify resumes, exaggerate in arguments and ask our kids
to fib on the phone. &QL; 
MOST HAVE REASONS
</P>
<P>
   In Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life, Sissela Bok
ob served: ``The fact is that reasons to lie occur to most people
quite often. . . . Not many stop to examine the choices confronting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as a nation judges its presi dent, it may also want to take
time out for soul-searching on deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Lies are seldom detected, fre quently effective, sometimes harm
less, occasionally even good.
</P>
<P>
   We fabricate to avoid conse quences, enhance ourselves, damage
others, gain esteem, make money. Lawyers and undercover cops are
paid to deceive. We maintain social grace with white lies,
protecting others from hurt as in the fable of Eve's silly leaf. We
dupe our kids about Santa Claus. We may lie to prevent a greater
evil _ telling the Gestapo, for instance, that we don't know where
Anne Frank's family is hiding.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue raised by Clinton's affair is not about Anne Frank
or Santa. It is about misleading others for selfish reasons. And it
is an old story, right down to the excuses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1668, Englishman Samuel Pepys duped his wife _ at least for a
while _ about an affair with a young maid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth (is) that I did adven ture upon God's pardoning me
this lie,'' Pepys wrote in his diary, ``knowing how heavy a thing
it would be for me to be the ruin of the poor girl; and next,
knowing that if my wife should know it all, it would be impossible
for her ever to be at peace with me again.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of rationalization would later prompt Friedrich
Nietzsche, the German philosopher, to observe, ``The most common
lie is the lie one tells to one self; lying to oth ers is
relatively the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Another phi losopher, Im manuel Kant, argued in the 18th century
that deceit is always wrong because it strips humans of dignity. In
Kant's mind, man was distinct from beasts because of an ability to
make ethical choices based on truth. To use deception, Kant
reasoned, is to corrupt that power and to rob others of their
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deceit and violence _ these are the two forms of deliberate
assault on human beings,'' wrote Bok. ``Both can coerce people into
acting against their will.''
</P>
<P>
   Each lie distorts our faith. And, as Shakespeare pointed out,
one lie usually results in a tangled web.
</P>
<P>
   Gini Graham Scott, author of Making Ethical Choices, Resolving
Ethical Dilemmas, says dishonesty is dragging American culture down
in a miasma of cynicism. &QL; 
REDEFINING LYING
</P>
<P>
   ``You have enough people doing it and pretty soon nobody can
trust anybody,'' she notes. ``We're sort of redefining lying as
being OK. I think what's happening in our soci ety today _ why
we're in this sort of social melt-down _ is that we're losing our
moral grounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Societies have collapsed in the past because they haven't paid
attention to moral principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a sociologist and anthropol ogist, says Clinton's
predicament is a symptom rather than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not the sex thing, as distasteful as that may be.
It's the lying. It's sort of a statement of where we've dissolved
as a society. The law of the jungle starts prevail ing. And I think
that's where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   What rises to the top?
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer. Jerry Springer. Professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Popular icons revel in glory like pigs in muck. Political
spin-doctor ing is regarded as art. Hit movies such as Liar, Liar
and Wag the Dog romanticize deceit. Television is a cesspool of
intrigue about conniving cops, lawyers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   We laugh at the staged deceit of Joe Isuzu, Maxwell Smart or
John Lovitz _ all parodies of the bull artists we know, or are.
</P>
<P>
   We elect a president nicknamed ``Slick Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists have found that honesty varies from generation
to generation, gender to gender, class to class. But virtually
every creed and culture in history has featured overt or tacit
rules against lying.
</P>
<P>
   In the Judeo-Christian heritage, deceit is banned in a
commandment handed to Moses: ``Thou shalt not bear false witness .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, parents in 10 Western nations were asked to rank
qualities they wished to pass on to their kids. In nine of those
nations, the No. 1 response was: honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lies keep growing like Pinoc chio's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Josephson, president of the Josephson Institute for
Ethics, found in a study that seven of 10 high school kids cheated
on tests in the past year _ a rate that is rising. &QL; 
GETTING AWAY WITH IT
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hole in the moral ozone and it's getting bigger,''
Josephson says. ``There's a sense that cheaters get away with it.
Liars lie and we shrug it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Dale Fushek, pastor of St. Timothy's Catholic Church in
Mesa, suspects that integrity has declined because we are
disconnected _ products of broken families, modern technology and
mobility. Without bonds, there is no faith in one another. Without
faith, truth dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have become more self-centered,'' he adds.
``That becomes your highest priority, and if you have to lie to
meet your own needs, people are more willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Most ethicists say the paradox is that lies damage the deceiver
as much as the deceived. There may be an instant benefit, notes
Fushek, but dishonest people ultimately lack an inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible says, `Truth will set you free.' Whenever you lie,
you bind yourself somehow. It always catches up with you. But in
our microwave society, the short term is all that people look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Chase, director of the Center for Applied Christian Ethics
at Wheaton College in Illinois, said he's troubled by the nation's
seem ing acceptance of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cynicism is evident. It's underlying the statements of
people saying, `Let's just put this behind us and get on with the
business of the country.' Why would we put this behind us? This
seems to be a situation that's right for moral reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Dobrin, a secularist pro fessor of humanities at Hofstra
University in New York, says virtue is its own reward, adding,
``The point of truth-telling is that we really can count on one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin says Clinton's drama may infect children, much as it has
adults, with cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't trust the president, whom can you trust?'' he
asks. ``That's pretty serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin says the Clinton crisis is a morality lesson for kids of
all ages:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes good people do bad things. Sometimes bad people do
good things inadvertently.'' &QL;

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OK, Sammy, you were right all along.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is The Man.
</P>
<P>
   While you were doing boring stuff like hitting clutch singles,
hustling to balls in the outfield, pumping up your teammates in the
dugout and speeding home with the go-ahead run against maybe the
best team in baseball, The Man hit another pair of home runs in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think this is, Sammy, baseball? Some 51,950
Astrodome fans were disappointed in you. They wanted you to bring
your big stick Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted streamers and booming shots. They wanted high-flying
action _ Rip Taylor tossing confetti to the crowd, bright lights,
announcers reaching for higher octaves, fireworks. They wanted
curtain calls and tips of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   They even booed Astros starter Shane Reynolds, poor guy, as he
masterfully worked his way through seven innings looking for his
20th win. Reynolds had the nerve to get you out, and few seemed to
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted you to be the man, Sammy, but all you could give
them was the game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   You came ready to play some good old-fashioned baseball, but
they wanted you to do what The Man did as he was the guest of honor
at another wild carnival in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Man swung for the fences, hammered blasts to the bleachers
and smiled that familiar broad smile as he rounded the bases
slamming forearms with everyone in sight. The Man hit Nos. 67 and
68. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   You know what this means, Sammy. Yet again, The Man has put some
distance between you and him in this remarkable home-run race. And
there's only one day left in this season _ for The Man, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It means McGwire probably has secured the illustrious home-run
title with this latest effort. Sure, you've heard that line before,
but this time we really mean it. McGwire is The Man. Just like you
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably hit some more (today),'' you told us after
sparking the Cubs' 3-2 win over the Astros on Saturday. ``I hope he
gets to 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he probably will. You all but conceded the home-run race
to McGwire after Saturday's game, although we did notice that
twinkle in your eyes when you said it.
</P>
<P>
   And it was hard not to notice something else, too. The Man has
only today remaining in this remarkable season, then the circus
will leave town and McGwire will be off to do those things
larger-than-life figures do _ books, talk shows, driving contests
against Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But you still have your team fighting for playoff life, thanks
to, well, you. A win over the Astros today would guarantee at least
one more game, maybe three, four, five or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw today why Sammy is our guy,'' Cubs veteran Mark Grace
said Saturday. ``He's our MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   You're everybody's MVP, Sammy. You hustled and scratched out
hits, rounded the bases, like you have all year. You even talked
about just wanting ``to make contact'' during the critical late
innings Saturday when the Astros and Reynolds all but had your
season at its breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   You again showed why the case for the Astros' Craig Biggio or
Moises Alou winning the MVP honor has been a long shot all along.
You showed why McGwire will get votes, and deservedly so, but won't
get the award.
</P>
<P>
   You're bringing the Cubs to the Astrodome today tied with the
San Francisco Giants in the race for the wild-card berth and only a
game ahead of the New York Mets. You have helped your team stay
alive all year, and now it's all there in front of you _ the
playoffs, not the carnival.
</P>
<P>
   You sliced a single in the eighth Saturday, moved up on a hit by
Grace and scored the go-ahead run on a clutch double by Gary
Gaetti. When you crossed the plate, you skipped around in the dirt
and shook your fists as if you had just homered. But you didn't.
You just played baseball. And that's why you are what you are.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there will be one more carnival in St. Louis every time
McGwire steps to the plate. But in the Dome, there will be a good
old-fashioned playoff race on the line every time you do, a chance
to move on to an elimination game or maybe a date with the Atlanta
Braves in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say it is the biggest game of my career (today),''
you said. ``It's been a great year, but we need to get to the
playoffs. I just want to do anything I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A single, a double. A sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really says something when there's someone like McGwire who
has 68 home runs, or more, and someone else who could get the
MVP,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``That really says
something about Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   It says what you said with your actions again Saturday, Sammy.
The Man is McGwire. The MVP is you.

HORNED FROGS DENY LATE BID, UPSET AIR FORCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ For the second time in as many games, TCU sophomore
cornerback Greg Walls found himself in the spotlight with the
outcome of the game in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But showing tremendous growth from two weeks ago, Walls
responded with two spectacular pass breakups in the waning moments
last night to preserve TCU's 35-34 upset victory against No. 23 Air
Force before 26,418 spectators at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As Air Force threatened, Walls came through twice to break up
pass plays from Falcons quarterback Blane Morgan to receiver Dylan
Newman, with the final effort giving the ball to TCU on downs with
1 minute, 25 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Oklahoma Sooners threw a game-winning
touchdown pass over Walls in the corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference this week was confidence,'' said Walls, a
first-year starter. ``I knew they had watched the game film and
they were going to come right at me. But this time around I came up
and made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As did his Horned Frogs teammates, who earned the school's first
victory against a Top-25 opponent since upending No. 23 Kansas in
1994 at Amon Carter Stadium. The victory last night also puts TCU
atop the Mountain Division of the Western Athletic Conference
Mountain Division with a 1-0 league mark and 2-1 mark overall.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the players were confident they had erased many of
the demons from last season's 1-10 mark under former coach Pat
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is huge,'' nose guard J.W. Wilson said. ``Never in my
wildest imagination did I think we would come out of this thing
with a win. This team has really come a long ways.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was never more evident than when the Frogs fought back
from an 11-point third-quarter deficit to take a 35-31 lead early
in the fourth quarter against the previously undefeated Falcons
(3-1, 2-1 WAC).
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a spirited performance in his first action at
tailback this season, LaDainian Tomlinson scooted 2 yards up the
middle to cap an impressive 15-play, 70-yard drive that began in
the third quarter and ended with 13:21 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   One series earlier, fullback Lance Williams charged up the
middle for a 13-yard scoring run that seemed to give the Frogs some
momentum. And they gained even more confidence when quarterback
Patrick Batteaux rolled right to complete the two-point conversion
pass to tight end B.J. Roberts, pulling TCU within 31-28 with 3:08
to play in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' offense, showing much improvement over their effort
two weeks ago against the Sooners, stayed on the field for 77
offensive snaps and won the time-of-possession battle 36:42 to
23:18. TCU gained 256 yards on the ground, with Tomlinson coming
off the bench with the key contribution of 99 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing for us tonight was execution,'' said
Batteaux, who completed 10 of 19 passes for 95 yards. ``When we
were down we still kept our focus and that was difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus also was evident in the second quarter, when TCU
scored 20 points to take a 20-17 halftime lead.

BEATING RANKED FOE THE TONIC TCU NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The bleeding, a full year's worth, stopped
at 9:24 last night.
</P>
<P>
   Having forgotten the routine, obviously, the TCU Horned Frogs
danced across the football field to the student section. They
hugged. They high-fived. They warbled the alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the friskier Frogs attempted an impromptu version of the
Lambeau Leap, but they were able to vault only partly up the high
concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   Flying Frogs? That must come later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the tourniquet is in place. The resurrection at Amon
Carter Stadium continues. Rising to the occasion, TCU dominated the
time of possession and upset No. 23-ranked Air Force last night,
35-34.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's wounds, when the program went winless for three
months, are finally behind the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great confidence builder,'' new coach Dennis
Franchione said. ``It was a great emotional win. I think it stopped
the bleeding from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to keep building on it.''
</P>
<P>
   This, however, was no small nail to drive. The Falcons of coach
Fisher DeBerry came into the contest as the nation's eighth-highest
scoring team and with the NCAA's No. 2 running game.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, when so many Saturdays last season
seemed to wither on the vine, the TCU defense rose to stymie three
critical Air Force drives. The Falcons' final four possessions
produced only one field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give a lot of credit to TCU,'' DeBerry said. ``They came out
with a lot of different schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schemes? Formations? Certainly the extra week of preparation
that the TCU coaches enjoyed was exploited to the max. But this was
a night made more for heartbeats than chalkboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of us wanting to win more than they did,'' TCU
linebacker Joseph Phipps said.
</P>
<P>
   Like we said, the resurrection continues.
</P>
<P>
   As Franchione, the master rebuilder, prepared for his first TCU
season, he had wished aloud for a night just like last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a nice win early _ to build our confidence,''
Franchione said back in August.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the new coach had one in the season opener, winning on
the road at Iowa State. Were it not for a bounce here, a knee
there, he almost had another one two weeks ago against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But this one, the Frogs' first victory against a ranked opponent
in four seasons, puts a loud, purple stamp of validity on what
Franchione and his staff are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when you're a Top 25 team,'' Air Force's DeBerry said,
``your opponent comes out ready to play and plays hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't take it so personally. Franchione has had the Frogs
trying to fly for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Franchione's other preseason wishes had been that the
Frogs would not turn tail at the first sign of adversity, the way
they did so often under Pat Sullivan a year ago. But TCU faced
several of those game-turning moments last night, only to emerge
unrattled.
</P>
<P>
   One came when the defense let Air Force quarterback Blane Morgan
march the Falcons 79 yards in seven instant plays to knot the
score, 17-all, right before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' Patrick Batteaux responded with a swift drive of his
own, leading to a Chris Kaylakie field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential killing blow came when return man Royce
Huffman lost a third-quarter punt. Officials ruled a fumble.
Franchione argued animatedly that Huffman had been interfered with.
Air Force promptly scored in three plays to take a 31-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But, behind Batteaux and LaDainian Tomlinson, the Frogs came
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to put the dagger in, and we didn't come up
with the big plays,'' the Falcons' DeBerry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs, on the other hand, reaped a telling abundance of big
plays. They converted nine of 18 third-down situations. And with
Morgan trying to move Air Force into field-goal range in the final
minute, Greg Walls and the TCU secondary rose to swat the ball
away.
</P>
<P>
   When Batteaux ran out the final seconds, the symbolic bleeding
was over. TCU, the eternal train-wreck victim, had a healing
victory at last.
</P>
<P>
   One day, maybe sooner than anyone ever expected, Frogs will fly.
In the meantime, watch them try.

AGGIES' OFFENSE STRUGGLES IN WIN OVER NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M put a little air into its
offense during a ho-hum 28-9 victory against North Texas before
56,072 at Kyle Field last night.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, as to whether the Aggies' offense
will float in the Big 12, into which A&AMP;M (3-1) ventures for the
first time next week at Kansas. Considering that at kickoff 99
teams in Division I-A had better pass defenses than that offered by
the winless (0-4) Eagles, a season-high of 247 passing yards can be
considered little more than a trial balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was less than impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in our play tonight,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``I thought we were very sloppy. We've got a whole lot of
work to get done to get ready to play in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but I'm glad we were able to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggies split end Chris Cole and junior backup quarterback Randy
McCown were among those who escaped Slocum's blanket of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cole surpassed his three-game season yardage total (162) with
six receptions for a career-high 174 yards and three touchdowns,
his first three scoring catches of the season. A&AMP;M obliterated a
previous season-high, 139-yard passing total against Louisiana Tech
_ in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Cole hauled in a 60-yard TD pass from Branndon Stewart on the
Aggies' first play from scrimmage. He also scored on receptions of
35 and 52 yards from McCown as A&AMP;M probed deeply into an
ineffective and injury-weakened UNT secondary.
</P>
<P>
   McCown completed 11 of 13 passes for a career-high 167 yards and
the two touchdowns. He also regenerated doubt as to whether he or
Stewart should be running the offense. After completing his first
pass to Cole, Stewart went 3-for-9 for only 20 more yards and threw
his first interception of the season into double coverage at the
UNT 13.
</P>
<P>
   McCown relieved Stewart for the last series of the first half
and guided the Aggies 85 yards in nine plays for a 14-3 halftime
lead. Cole's scoring catch in the end zone culminated that drive
after McCown scrambled out of trouble on third-and-16 at the UNT
35.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches just told me to be ready to play this week,''
McCown said. ``Our offensive line gave us time to throw tonight and
our receivers made some big plays. Chris Cole was outstanding. It's
the first time we've seen a receiver play like that since Albert
Connell.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's defense was not exactly Wrecking Crew awesome. But it did
set the table for Sirr Parker's 3-yard scoring run with 6:30 left,
when linebacker Warrick Holdman popped Eagles quarterback Jason
Attaway and end Rocky Bernard recovered the resulting fumble at the
UNT 16. Extra points A&AMP;M sophomore kicker Russell Bynum missed
field-goal attempts from 35 and 27 yards after hitting the first
five of his career. Bynum kicked three points-after-touchdown, but
was relieved of that duty on the last TD by sophomore Terence
Kitchens. ... UNT split end Jay Young caught 11 passes for 105
yards. ... Cole's 174 receiving yards rank No.4 on A&AMP;M's
single-game total. ... LB Dat Nguyen's seven tackles put him into
the 400-tackle club along with Johnny Holland (455), Mike Little
(448) and Ed Simonini (425). ... Stewart's interception came after
72 attempts without one. ... Dante Hall and Parker combined to gain
133 yards on 27 carries.

GRISSOM LEADS BREWERS PAST DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marquis Grissom is going home after today. And
he's not happy about it,
</P>
<P>
   After batting .390 in the past three World Series, Grissom finds
himself on the last day of the regular season at Dodger Stadium,
about as far as one can get from the center of the baseball
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But he showed up Saturday night and hit two home runs in the
Milwaukee Brewers' 6-1 victory in front of 30,645 at Dodger
Stadium. That is as many as he has hit in 336 career at-bats
against the Dodgers. And it was the first time in 1,280 career
games that Grissom hit more than one homer in a game.
</P>
<P>
   So much for numbers. He'd trade them all to be back in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom helped the Atlanta Braves beat Cleveland in 1995 by
hitting .360 (9 for 25). The next year, when the Braves lost to the
New York Yankees, Grissom batted .444 (12 for 27).
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Grissom was traded from Atlanta to the Indians as
part of a deal for Kenny Lofton. He batted .360 (9 for 25) in a
tense seven-game loss to the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lofton returned to the Indians and Grissom went to
the Brewers, who are 27 games out of first place in the National
League Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was going to the postseason, but I'm looking forward
to going home and getting healthy,'' said Grissom, who is playing
with a sore right shoulder. ``Cleveland will do well, but they have
to go through the Yankees. Anything can happen in the best-of-seven
series. We proved that last season.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-climax of this series is striking. Only 35,000 are
expected for today's Fan Appreciation Day, usually a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the usual giveaways of Toyota Corollas, fans have a
chance to see Chan Ho Park go after a career-high 15th victory.
Most of all they can bid farewell to a disappointing Dodgers
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers enter the game with an 82-80 record, which
guarantees a winning season for the fifth consecutive year. But in
the end, this team hardly has the look of a winner. If Raul
Mondesi, who has missed the past three games with a injured left
index finger, doesn't play today, the Dodgers will not field one
member of their Opening Day lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game suffered from a distinct lack of energy. It was
scoreless until Grissom homered with one out in the fourth against
Dodgers starter Carlos Perez (11-14), who was going for his fifth
consecutive complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Perez and Milwaukee's Scott Karl were a study in contrasts.
Perez came in allowing just three earned run in his previous 36
innings. Karl hadn't won since Aug. 9, with five losses and three
no decisions. But after six innings, it was Karl (10-11) who had
the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who gave up seven homers in four losses to St. Louis this
season, did not allow a Dodgers baserunner to reach third in six
innings. He allowed just three hits and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Perez probably would have finished this one, too, but he
sprained the index finger on his pitching hand trying to field
Fernando Vina's bunt RBI single in the seventh that gave the
Brewers a 2-0 lead. Perez was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical
Center for precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing, he pitched to one more batter, Mark Loretta,
but nearly threw two pitches over the head of rookie catcher Angel
Pena. Sean Maloney took over and finish the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was replaced by right-hander David Weathers, who gave up a
home run to Matt Luke, his first batter. Weathers also allowed a
two-out pinch double to Charles Johnson after getting ahead 0-2 in
the count. But Roger Cedeno grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers added a run in the eighth on Grissom's second homer
that just cleared the fence in left-center. It was his 10th of the
year. They scored three in the ninth, two on an RBI singles by
Loretta off the Dodgers' fourth pitcher, Eric Weaver.

REVOLUTION SHOT DOWN IN SEASON FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga had to be satisfied with the
Revolution's fourth shutout in five games Saturday night. But the
Revolution also failed to score and lost the post-match shootout to
the MetroStars to finish the season with the worst record in Major
League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well and had good chances to score,'' Zenga said.
``In the second half, we got a little tired, but that is
understandable with the third game in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the games since Zenga replaced Thomas Rongen late last month,
the Revolution were 3-2 and outscored the opposition, 11-6. But
they nonetheless finished with 29 points, their lowest total and
the second-worst record in the three-year history of the league.
</P>
<P>
   But even though there were no playoff stakes for either team, a
crowd of 24,763 attended the match, raising the season average to
19,158, third-highest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   This was a curious matchup of coaches. Zenga had not coached
before last month and the MetroStars' Bora Milutinovic was in his
first MLS game and did not even know the names of all of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga displayed a winning touch with the Revolution, though it
came too late to salvage the team's playoff hopes. And he nearly
concluded the season with a victory, as Carlos Rocha hit the post
with a first-half header and Paul Keegan's goal off a corner kick
was disallowed on a questionable offside call.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution appeared fatigued in the second half, and
Zenga used only one substitute _ Jamar Beasley for Rocha.
Midfielder Jair, who converted the clinching goal in a 2-0 win over
Columbus Sept. 12, remained on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that played well for the last month,'' Zenga
said, indicating that the players deserved to conclude the game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution discovered some cohesion under Zenga,
who is attempting to build a foundation for next season. They had
few major defensive breakdowns in the final five games, and
minimized them Saturday night, though the Metro-Stars nearly won
the match in the final minute, but Tab Ramos hit the side of the
net with a volley.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's high-energy approach produced many
opportunities in the first half. But the MetroStars nearly
capitalized on a bobble by goalkeeper Ian Feuer in the 30th minute.
Mike Sorber sent a low 30-yard shot from the right side that
bounced off Feuer's chest to Giovanni Savarese. With a clear shot
on goal, Savarese sent a low drive toward the far post. But Brian
Dunseth, whose giveaway had allowed Chicago tie the score in a 3-2
loss Wednesday, cleared off the line.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution starters were optimistic about next season, based on
what they've seen in recent games. ``We played well in the first
half; we should have scored a couple of goals,'' midfielder Edwin
Gorter said. ``It's normal that we would be tired playing our third
game in seven days. It's the same everywhere in the world. But this
gives us something to build on for next year, that's for sure.
Hopefully, we can start where we left off this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Joe-Max Moore, ``We are on the way to putting a good team
on the field. Walter is going to try and figure out a way to put a
better team on the field, and he has the resources to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution named Moore most valuable player and Mike Burns
defensive player of the year. Gorter was named Revolution man of
the year in a vote conducted by the Midnight Riders fan group.

LEWIS SETTLES FOR DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ How popular is Lennox Lewis? He couldn't
fill up a tent at an Indian reservation.
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the situation that befell the World Boxing
Council heavyweight champion when he came to the Connecticut woods
Saturday night to defend his title against unknown Croatian
challenger Zeljko Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegan Sun Casino erected a tent that housed 5,000 seats
for the first heavyweight title fight in New England since Muhammad
Ali stopped Sonny Liston with a phantom punch in one round in
Lewiston, Maine, 33 years ago. Many of the tent's seats were empty
Saturday night when Mavrovic entered the ring.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, a late-arriving crowd would have had
plenty of time to get to their seats. But they were smart enough to
stay away. At times, it appeared Lewis and Mavrovic were inclined
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis went about defending his title well enough to win a
lopsided and occasionally interesting 12-round unanimous decision.
Judge Tom Kaczmarek had it 119-109, judge Bob Logist scored it
117-112, and judge Franco Ciminole had it 117-111, all for Lewis.
The Globe card also had Lewis winning, 117-112.
</P>
<P>
   Had Mavrovic thrown a few more punches things might have gotten
interesting, especially late in the seventh round when he had a
tiring Lewis pinned on the ropes. He drilled Lewis with a right
uppercut and a right-left combination that seemed to trouble the
fading champion.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the extent of Mavrovic's assault. He threw only 298
punches all night, an average of 24 per round, while the champion
was far busier, despite being tired from the third round on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox was definitely puffing from the third round,'' said
Lewis's trainer Emanuel Steward. ``I can't explain it. He trained
properly for the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors were he had not and the evidence of his heaving chest and
open mouth from early in the fight belied that. Yet Lewis still
controlled most of the action, landing far more powerful shots far
more frequently and leaving Mavrovic reluctant to move his hands
late in the fight when Lewis seemed vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punched and beat me unlike anyone in the world,'' Mavrovic
(27-1) said. ``I thought I'd get him in rounds 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12,
but he was way too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1) was particularly effective when he landed to the
body, once hitting Mavrovic so hard with a right to the belly that
the challenger grunted in English and then Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   But while Mavrovic was less aggressive than Lewis, Lewis was
less than aggressive, just as World Boxing
Association-International Boxing Federation champion Evander
Holyfield had been a week ago against a similarly inept challenger
(Vaughn Bean). Lewis attributed part of his problems to a strategic
error, claiming he had trained for a different style than Mavrovic
exhibited. The 243-pound Lewis argued that his performance had
resulted from expecting to face an opponent who ran, rather than
stood solidly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained wrong,'' Lewis said. ``I expected Mavrovic to run
and he didn't. Some fighters give you a hard time. I was just glad
I adjusted well in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's manager, Frank Maloney, was not glad that a fight he
hoped would end in spectacular fashion droned on to a quiet
conclusion. He credited the chin of the Croatian for some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mavrovic must have 240 pounds of steel in his chin,'' said
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   If Mavrovic had a few pounds of steel in his fist, he might have
won the fight, especially in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   What Lewis's and Holyfield's performances did was cry out for
them to meet before one loses to a nondescript challenger who holds
no interest to either champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to make Holyfield-Lewis,'' HBO sports senior vice
president Lou DiBella said. ``It's time for Evander to sign the
contract before one of these guys loses to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had come into this fight mocking Holyfield's lackluster
performance against Bean and promising to make a statement Saturday
night with his own performance against Mavrovic. If he did, it was
a quiet one.

MCGWIRE HITS TWO FOR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Citizens of coastal Florida removed plywood from
window frames and most Nebraskans watched the Cornhuskers slug it
out with Washington. In the nation's capital, Beltway insiders
prepared for the weekly Sunday morning talk show spin.
</P>
<P>
   But no one else in the Americas strayed too far from the Great
Home Run Chase Saturday, and on a 90-degree day in the shadow of
the Great Arch, Mark McGwire hit home runs Nos. 67 and 68 to regain
the lead he's held most of the summer. In Houston, Sammy Sosa
remained ``stuck'' on Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never let go of this season,'' McGwire said after the
game. ``I'll always hold onto it. It might not ever happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 67th was a heat-seeking missile to left in the fourth
inning off Dustin Hermanson. Then came No. 68, a 435-foot rocket to
center in the seventh off Kirk Bullinger. When he hit the second
one, McGwire held his bat aloft in his right hand and pointed to
the heavens as he trotted down the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   The hardball gods must be crazy. These home run numbers
represent wild new territory. It is as if scientists had discovered
two additional planets in our solar system. All this time, we
thought 61 was the home run limit. Maybe 62. Suddenly, the number
70 doesn't sound impossible. And yet the Great Home Run Chase is
still not over.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his two-homer lead, McGwire said, ``Obviously, it
feels nice. But I got one more game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since this is the wacky, unbelievable summer of '98,
Sosa might have two more games. The Cubs are in a three-way
scramble for the final National League wild-card slot and Sammy
might get to slam in a 163d game if there's a tie among the Cubs,
Giants, and Mets. And forget the asterisk. A playoff game would
count for the Cubs slugger. So even though he holds a two-homer
lead, McGwire remains very much threatened by the Sosa challenge.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire claimed he hadn't thought about the prospect of Sosa
playing an extra game. ``That's the first I've heard of it,'' said
Big Mac. ``Would it count?'' Assured that it would, he responded,
``Well, there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I'll be home
on the beach. So sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire fell behind by one Friday night when Sosa cranked No.
66, but that lead lasted only 45 minutes, until the St. Louis
slugger came to bat in the fifth inning against Shayne Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the second time that McGwire trailed in the Home
Run Derby. On Aug. 19, Sosa hit No. 48 at Wrigley Field while
McGwire was stalled at 47. Precisely 58 minutes later, McGwire went
deep in the eighth inning of his game, then hit No. 49 in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   They were tied at 55 after 138 games, and again at 62, 63, 65,
and 66. But today they are tied no more because of McGwire's
Saturday Afternoon Double Feature.
</P>
<P>
   Game 161 was just another day in paradise for the
baseball-crazed citizens of this town. At 9:30 a.m., the 910-room
Adams Mark Hotel in downtown St. Louis had already sold all copies
of Saturday's St. Louis Post-Dispatch. At this moment, everything
is a souvenir. An hour before the gates opened, a sea of
red-shirted fans splashed up against the perimeter of Busch
Stadium. When the doors were unlocked, Big Mac Maniacs stormed into
the team store to snap up the last of the authentic $200 McGwire
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa was going homerless in Houston, McGwire took back the
lead with a first-pitch shot over the left-field wall in the
fourth. No. 67 was estimated to have traveled 403 feet. There was
no guess on travel time. Speeding bullets don't register on the
radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up a fastball,'' he said. ``It was a nice, easy
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The second bomb of the day exploded in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard sinker in. I just tried to drive it back at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The magical ride ends Sunday for McGwire. He said he'll be on an
airplane bound for California by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to sit back and reflect on anything till
it's over. It doesn't matter who comes out on top. It's just
fantastic what we've done in the last two months. He and I are the
only ones who know what we've gone through. It hasn't been easy.
Believe me, it has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody understands how difficult it is. Once we
got to 62, everybody wanted more. Instead of cherishing what we
did, it was, `Oh, no, they went three or four games without a home
run. What's wrong with them?'''
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire and Sosa were rescuing baseball and racing past
Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, it's been fashionable to say that the
chase would probably go down to the last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has. And that day is Sunday. McGwire is in St. Louis
against Montreal and Sosa is at the Astrodome, desperately trying
to put the Cubs into a division playoff game. Two worthy warriors
will go at it one more time to see who replaces Maris in the record
book.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' he said. ``But I've got enough left for one more
game.''

INJURIES, ILLNESS PLAGUE TROJANS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst required
intravenous fluids before USC's 30-10 loss to Florida State on
Saturday, after suffering severe flu-like symptoms prior to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get sick until I was here,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I
couldn't really function.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst's illness was considered far more serious than the
case of food poisoning he experienced the night before USC's season
opener against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike came down with something,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``He was not 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst tried to downplay the effect the illness had on
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never an excuse for me. I should have played better,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton re-injured his strained back while scoring
on a 7-yard run in the third quarter. A Florida State defender hit
Morton in the back with his helmet near the play's completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just really sore. It's just hard to move right now,''
Morton said. ``I felt like I did when I first got (hurt).''
</P>
<P>
   Few touches: Until tailback Frank Strong's 73-yard run in the
third quarter, only three USC running backs or wide receivers _
Morton, R. Jay Soward and Petros Papadakis _ had gotten the ball.
Strong's run was the first game in which the freshman showed why he
had been so impressive during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that somebody was going to do something. They
brought it a little bit harder than we thought they would,'' Strong
said. ``I just had the faith that I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictable outcome: With the loss, USC dropped to 3-8-1 against
top 25 opponents since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Notable ref: The game's head referee was Jim Knight, who has
suffered seven heart attacks and had to be revived during last
year's Virginia-North Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   Total player: USC linebacker Chris Claiborne continues to be one
of the nation's top players. He had 14 tackles, and single-handedly
stopped Travis Minor on a fourth-and-1 at the USC 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Career kick: USC kicker Adam Abrams made a career-best 49-yard
field goal in the first quarter. It was USC's longest field goal
since Quin Rodriguez made a 54-yarder in 1990. &QL;

SOSA'S REAL RACE IS FOR WILD CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It has suddenly become all so clear for Sammy Sosa and
the Cubs. The slugger's home run race with Mark McGwire has been
placed on the back burner with the realization that with one more
victory Chicago can control its destiny as it fights for a
wild-card berth in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa went 2 for 4 _ two singles _ in Saturday's 3-2 victory over
the Astros, and thus fell behind McGwire, who cracked home runs
Nos. 67 and No. 68 in St. Louis. But more important to Sosa, the
three-team race for the final postseason spot has come down to the
season's final day with the Cubs tied with the Dusty-come-lately
San Francisco Giants, who outlasted Colorado Saturday while the
Mets lost to Atlanta, dropping the New Yorkers one game back.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cubs are in OK position as they enter the final day of
the wild-card race, but Sosa needs yet another miracle day if he is
to win the home run crown. He may get an extra crack at it. Should
the Cubs and Giants both win Sunday, there would be a one-game
playoff Monday at Wrigley Field. A victory by either team this
afternoon eliminates the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right where we wanted to be,'' says Chicago's Gary
Gaetti. ``It would be nice to have it wrapped up. But it didn't
happen that way. This is what you play for. We're down to the final
day in a 162-game season. That's pretty interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's quest has so dominated the headlines that you almost
forget that the Cubs had put themselves in a must-win situation by
losing five of six prior to Saturday. The crowd of 51,950 at the
Astrodome gave Sosa his due Saturday and seemed to fully expect him
to hit No. 67. Instead, he singled twice and scored the go-ahead
run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run chase is not on my mind,'' Sosa insisted
afterward. ``I'm more concerned about the wild card. I'm just happy
when I do my job every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow is going to be great. Anything can happen. Whatever
feelings there are have to be good feelings. It's not for sure that
every time I hit the ball, it's going to go out of the ballpark. As
for Mark, he's still ahead of me and tomorrow he'll probably hit
some more. I hope he finishes with 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Home run derby aside, the Cubs had their own business to take
care of Saturday. Chicago went ahead to stay with two runs in the
eighth. Sosa hit a one-out single and advanced on a single to right
by Mark Grace. The 40-year-old Gaetti, who had scored the tying run
in the seventh, then plated both runners with a double to center.
</P>
<P>
   As Gaetti sees it, Sosa has carried a big load for a long time,
and now it's time for other Cubs to step into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Sammy gave it his best shot at trying to hit a home
run,'' he said. ``He fell behind in the count each time, but he is
such a good hitter he was able to do what he had to do to get on
base. This is a good day. We kept pace and keep ourselves tied.''

US SMASHED BY ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Whither the Davis Cup as far as the United States is
concerned? It's all in the hands of Julia Levering now that the
guys she inherited when she took over as president of the US Tennis
Association have crashed to the most abysmal American defeat in
nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches were applied Saturday by the fine Italian
hands of Diego Nargiso and Andrea Gaudenzi in a frantic 3 1/2-hour
skirmish that was marked by US reprieves and even hope for a pardon
in the fifth set. But there was to be no stay of execution for the
last-chance pairing of novitiate Justin Gimelstob and erratic Todd
Martin, who were beaten, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to settle the five-match semifinal series, 3-0,
and send the unlikely Italians into their seventh Cup final Dec.
4-6 at Milan against defending champion Sweden, a 3-0 victor over
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The ecstatic Gaudenzi, who ignited the US disaster by beating
Jan-Michael Gambill Friday, whooped, ``Maybe they'll believe in us
at home now. When we beat India and Zimbabwe at home, everybody
said, `So what? We beat nobody.' But now, to beat the US in the US,
we deserve some credit. Also, it's nice this is the first final
Italy will have at home.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to go back to 1975 to find such a home shocker for
the US: Back then, Mexico, spurred by Raul Ramirez, defeated a host
side led by Stan Smith and Roscoe Tanner, 3-2, at Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   So where does Levering come into this picture? The Stowe, Vt.,
woman took over in February as the first female president in the
USTA's 119 years, and now she must try to sell Pete Sampras, Andre
Agassi, and Michael Chang on the virtues of giving the US a lift
next year.
</P>
<P>
   With them in the lineup this weekend, it's improbable that the
Italians would have soared. But Sampras has avoided the Cup as
though it contained hemlock. And Agassi, who drove the year's two
wins over Russia and Belgium, is incensed that the USTA picked
Milwaukee rather than his hometown, Las Vegas, for the semi. He
remained at home, presiding over a fund-raiser benefitting his
charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Selection of the 1999 captain will also be Levering's choice.
Though she has told a friend that she'll retain Tom Gullikson,
winner of one Cup (1995) in five years, there will be much lobbying
on behalf of John McEnroe, a hero on five Cup-winning teams, and
Brad Gilbert, Agassi's coach. Low key, and admired by his players,
Gullikson has been an ideal leader in this international
competition in which the captain is a US ambassador of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians connected with the US team's appearance at Longwood
Cricket Club next July 16-18 will be praying for Levering's success
in convincing the elite Americans to enlist. It's particularly
important for the US to put its best sneakered feet forward,
because that will be the 100th-year celebration of the Davis Cup,
which was launched at Longwood in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   OK, even though you've never heard of Nargiso or Gaudenzi,
they're big in Naples and Faenza, respectively. Particularly since
Gaudenzi came into the weekend with a gimpy right shoulder, loaded
with cortisone, and Nargiso is under a physician's care, recovering
from hypoglycemia.
</P>
<P>
   They ought to name a Neapolitan alley for Nargiso _ Viale
Nargiso? _ because he deceptively hit so many alleys with passing
shots that startled the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good idea,'' laughed Adriano Panatta, who fired Italy to its
lone Cup in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Nargiso, a slim 28-year-old lefthander who lives for Davis Cup
doubles _ this is his 11th campaign _ almost passed out of the
equation a month ago in collapsing at Bing-hampton, N.Y., playing a
minor tourney. ``I lost my balance, I was dizzy,'' he said. ``They
put me in the hospital for hypoglycemia. Had to correct an
electrolytes imbalance. I'm OK now.''
</P>
<P>
   Very much so. Despite a No. 107 ranking, Nargiso was a
well-balanced performer in the left court, returning cleverly,
moving briskly for poaches and interceptions at the net. ``Gaudenzi
and I are friends; we've played a lot of Cup matches together (now
5-1),'' he said. ``That helps us when things are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemented by togetherness experience, they cruised deep into the
third set, nothing looking tough for them for 2 1/2 hours. Martin
and 21-year-old Gimelstob, debuting as an entry, seemed out of it
as soon as Martin butchered the third game with a double fault and
a pair of ugly errors. ``It was no way to start,'' he said. ``I'm
afraid it set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Gimelstob, who appears to have a Cup future with his fine
doubles instincts, stonewalled in serving out of two match points
to 5-5 in the third, their only distinction was as the loftiest
team ever to represent the US. Gimelstob is 6 feet 5 inches, Martin
6-6.
</P>
<P>
   But that resistance seemed to lift them higher, and the loud and
fervent gathering of 4,200 urged them along a seven-game run to 4-0
in the fourth. The Americans were clicking at last and responding
to the ``U-S-A!'' chants plus the horn-blowing of a woman _
Virginian Renee Rucker _ garbed as Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Gimelstob double-faulted twice to lose serve to 1-3
in the fifth _ ``it was egregious; I panicked'' _ they stormed back
to topple Nargiso. As Martin held to 3-3, the joint rocked and
rattled.
</P>
<P>
   The homeboys' final opportunity came in the next game as they
pushed Gaudenzi to deuce from 40-15, but the Italians countered to
seize 10 of the match's last 11 points. At deuce, Nargiso took
over: first, a poach; then an incredible backhand save of an angled
volley, flicking the ball down the line past an incredulous Martin,
of course into the alley.
</P>
<P>
   His wicked forehand took Gimelstob to the last break point.
There a Gaudenzi return skipped off the tape and beyond the
American for 5-3. Quickly Nargiso served it out and went on a roll
across the court, hugging Gaudenzi.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Gullikson lamented, ``I never dreamed we'd lose three
straight matches. But we were a team with great chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Test tubes aside, however, what he needs is great players. They
exist. Money, though generously dispensed in six figures already,
won't buy Sampras, Agassi, or Chang. It's up to Levering and her
powers of persuasion.

BC IS PERFECTLY AWFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ They came here looking to punctuate a perfect
September. But instead of putting an exclamation point on a 4-0
start, Boston College affixed a question mark to its first loss of
the season after Saturday's dreadful 52-28 setback to Louisville
before 38,231 at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Off to its best start in six years after three consecutive
victories, BC's first loss _ and worst since a 52-20 shellacking at
Notre Dame last year _ gave rise to numerous questions.
</P>
<P>
   How could a BC offense that was so balanced and so efficient
become so turnover-prone (three fumbles, one interception) and so
discombobulated against a Louisville defense that surrendered 801
yards in its opener against Kentucky? How could a BC defense that
was so steely tough in the first three weeks become so Charmin soft
in Week 4 by allowing 52 points and 507 yards total offense?
</P>
<P>
   And, most pressing of all, just how good are these Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't take your first five or whatever possessions we
had and fumble the ball twice like we did,'' said BC coach Tom
O'Brien, citing those factors that led to a ruinous afternoon for
the Eagles (3-1). ``Those are opportunities you can't give a decent
team. Maybe they (Louisville) are better than their (2-2) record,
who knows? I keep telling you guys, who knows who's any good in
September? We're going to start finding out here in the next couple
of weeks who's pretty good, but after our performance, we're not
pretty good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisville quarterback Chris Redman made that abundantly and
painfully clear all afternoon after he dissected BC's secondary by
completing 31 of 47 passes for 362 yards and 5 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just clicking,'' surmised junior free safety Pedro
Cirino, who intercepted Redman in the end zone in the first quarter
before sustaining a deep bruise in the second. ``We didn't cover
anyone and we didn't play well, and they executed to perfection.
When you get those two things combined, it can get ugly on the
scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   And it did.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, a 6-foot-3-inch junior from Louisville, broke a
single-game school record with his five TDs. He connected twice
with his former high school teammate, Ibn Green, on Louisville's
first and last TDs of the game: an 8-yarder that made it 7-0 with
9:34 left in the first quarter, and a 27-yard TD that gave
Louisville a whopping 52-21 lead with 7:12 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we finally hit on all cylinders,'' said Redman, who
helped snap Louisville's 10-game losing streak with a 35-9 victory
at Illinois last week. ``We've been close a time or two, but I knew
we had this in us. I think this win means a lot because Illinois
was a little bit suspect team, but we knew that (BC) was a really
good ball club that had some talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Scott Mutryn, who attempted as many passes as
Redman completed, went 19 of 31 for 230 yards and 2 TDs. He had a
pair of TDs on a 36-yard strike to Dennis Harding that tied the
game, 7-7, with 6:58 left in the first and a 21-yard TD to Anthony
DiCosmo (9 catches, 102 yards) that helped BC pull within 6, 20-14,
with 3:38 to go before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as the Eagles would get after Louisville
capped a 24-point eruption in the second quarter by scoring 11
points in the final 1:30 to take a commanding 31-14 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Redman hit Green with a huge 40-yard strike to set up a 4-yard
TD pass to Rico Williams and then connected with Leroy Collins (27
carries, 97 yards, 2 touchdowns) in the left flat on the 2-point
conversion to make it 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   On BC's next possession, Jermaine Walker committed a costly
turnover when he fumbled for the second time in the game, this time
at the BC 29. It set up Jon Hilbert's 22-yard field goal that gave
Louisville a 17-point cushion at the break.
</P>
<P>
   BC squandered a prime opportunity from the Louisville 3 in the
third quarter when, on third and goal, Mutryn bobbled the snap,
rolled to his right, and tried to force a pass into the end zone
intended for tight end Rob Tardio. The ball was twice tipped by
Cardinal defenders and once by Tardio before Braxton Anderson
intercepted it in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Mike Cloud, the nation's No. 2 rusher who
was held well below his average (184.0 yards per game) after
rushing 21 times for 124 yards, helped BC atone for the mistake
with a 27-yard TD in the third that made it 31-21. But Redman
turned up the heat, firing three more TDs _ a 19-yard pass to
Arnold Jackson in the third; a 14-yarder to Charles Sheffield with
13:52 left, and the 27-yarder to Green _ to cap the Louisville
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Mutryn fumble a snap from center Damien Woody at
midfield, O'Brien benched both his starting quarterback and center
and inserted backup Tim Hasselbeck, who responded by firing a
46-yard TD to Walker with 3:38 left.
</P>
<P>
   But it proved too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Period.

OLSON SAVES BEST FOR LAST, STOPS PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's been a season of second chances for Diamondbacks
pitcher Gregg Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old right-hander came to spring training with
Arizona as a non-roster invitee, hoping to resurrect a career that
had all but disappeared from the baseball map since 1993, his fifth
season of 20 or more saves with the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy with 10 saves,'' Olson said of his
expectations for this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he made it three times that many by earning his
30th in the Diamondbacks' 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres in
front of a sellout crowd of 48,196 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   After a 29-save effort in 1993, Olson had a total of 13 in the
four seasons that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Olson wasn't asking for anything major in 1998. He wasn't even
sure he would make the Diamondbacks, much less be the closer.
</P>
<P>
   He had an opportunity to notch No. 30 on Friday night, but
allowed the Padres to score a run in the ninth. He ended as the
victor, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bad pitches, then I was fortunate to be able to come back
today,'' said Olson, who on Sept. 7 picked up the 200th save of his
career, joining eight others in that elite club.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter did not hesitate to run Olson back out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation, there's no other place in baseball like it,''
Showalter said. ``We have a lot of confidence in Oly.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson wasn't throwing well at the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, you go out and do what you can do. Then things
started to come around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better throwing the ball now than I did then (with
Baltimore). I'm more under control. Before, I just threw as hard as
I could and gave the hitters a barrage of curveballs. Everybody
pretty much knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I go out and locate the fastball, try to get ahead early.
I'm more of a pitcher. I do more thinking, have more of a strategy.
And I don't show my best stuff until I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Saturday's ninth inning was going to follow a
similar path as Friday's.
</P>
<P>
   Olson gave up a one-out single to Wally Joyner. Then Mark
Sweeney, who delivered a pinch-hit single to tie the score in the
ninth on Friday, hit a line drive to right. The Diamondbacks' Karim
Garcia was there to snag it, however. He quickly fired the ball to
Travis Lee at first to double up pinch-runner James Mouton to end
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking double play, but not a line-drive bullet at the
right fielder,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bullet to right field by third baseman Matt Williams as
leadoff man in the sixth that provided what proved to be the margin
of victory. The Diamondbacks (65-96) assured themselves a better
record than the other expansion club, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
(63-98).
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a 3-2 pitch from left-hander Sterling Hitchcock
over the fence in right field to give Arizona a 3-2 lead. Right
fielder Tony Gwynn, who gave the Padres their first run with a
first-inning homer off Amaury Telemaco, jumped and extended his
glove above the fence, but couldn't reach the drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th homer of the season for Williams, and 299th of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Telemaco (7-10) had his best effort since Sept.
4, when he gave up a run on six hits in seven innings to beat
Houston. The only damaging hits were Gwynn's homer (his 16th of the
season) and an RBI single by Greg Vaughn (No. 117) in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I pitched well,'' said Telemaco. ``I came here to a new
team and I'm thankful they gave me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco also made the most of his at-bat in the fifth inning,
when he hit an RBI double to left-center that made it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco gave credit to infielder and fellow Dominican Tony
Batista for showing him the more wide-open stance that Batista has
used this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was swinging a little wild during batting practice,''
Batista said. ``I said that he couldn't do that in a game, that if
he wanted to be serious, he had to get down lower in his stance,
open up a little and be more ready. I guess it worked pretty
good.'' &QL;

68 SPEAKS FOR ITSELF  
 HOME RUN RACE DEFIES DESCRIPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - Going . . . going . . . gone!
</P>
<P>
   Okay, it's trite. Unoriginal. You could say that about any home
run.
</P>
<P>
   How about this then . . .
</P>
<P>
   `` When the white sphere met the bat with a Ruthian crack, all
eyes turned'' ``toward the heavens as if in prayer, a nation
spellbound, mesmerized by the'' ``meteoric flight of a baseball,
rising into the early-fall sky, four-ply gray'' ``wool yarn encased
in cowhide leather, soaring now, rising, becoming smaller'' ``as it
breaks its bond with Earth and continues on its rendezvous with''
``history''. ``''. ``''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Our editors would shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   So what ``do'' you say about Mark McGwire's 67th and 68th home
runs? How do you describe what he did Saturday on the next-to-last
day of this head-shaking, myth-making season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Toledo!'' announcer Jack Buck cried after No. 67, giving
Ohio a plug. ``I think that's going to do it!''
</P>
<P>
   When Big Mac smoked No. 68 and trotted down the first base line,
holding his bat aloft like a scepter, Buck spoke for all of us. ``I
never thought I would see anything like this in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Sammy Sosa, stuck at 66, catch him now?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But if we have learned anything this magical
summer, it is not to underestimate Sosa or count his team out.
</P>
<P>
   For pure entertainment, perhaps the only thing that might match
McGwire vs. Sosa would be a Cubs-Red Sox World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the media are guilty to varying degrees of
overdramatizing The Great Home Run Race. Forgive us our press
passes.
</P>
<P>
   How can you not become emotionally involved? The joy McGwire and
Sammy Sosa have provided runs through baseball like an electrical
current. To be here, to see Big Mac turn on the ball and crush it
435 feet into the center-field seats for his second home run of the
afternoon was a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how they love him here. You should have heard the cheers.
Anyone who doesn't feel ``something'' needs to check for a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has become part of our national consciousness. The
government should put his face on a $68 bill.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have we watched the replays of the Cardinals
slugger uncoiling on a fastball, hello/goodbye, and then dropping
his bat, like a used napkin? Our eyes follow him, step for step _
striding to first, then second, not the mincing steps of Babe Ruth
on the old herky-jerky newsreels.
</P>
<P>
   What would Ruth think of Big Mac?
</P>
<P>
   I like to think he would shake his hand. While reinventing the
long ball this summer, McGwire took time to pay tribute to Ruth and
Roger Maris, the man whose record he broke.
</P>
<P>
   He also tipped his cap to Sosa. All Sosa did this summer was
perform with quiet dignity and define relentlessness in his own
image. Down the stretch, he matched McGwire homer for homer,
heightening the drama and providing delicious suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball hasn't had a story this big since Hank Aaron hit No.
715 and broke Ruth's all-time home run mark. That night in 1974
sportswriters stared at their typewriters, searching for the right
words to do justice to the event.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio booth, Atlanta broadcaster Milo Hamilton felt the
pressure, too. What should he say? How should he describe history?
</P>
<P>
   When Ted Williams hit a home run in his last at-bat in the
majors, Curt Gowdy uttered a brace of repeated sentences. `'It's
got a chance! It's got a chance! And it's gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rizzuto, the Yankee broadcaster, had time to prepare for
Maris' 61st home run, but when the moment arrived he fell back on
his favorite line. ``Holy cow!'' Rizzuto cried. ``That's gonna be
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Author George Plimpton wrote a magazine piece about the night
Aaron hit No. 715. In it he described Hamilton's growing anxiety in
advance of the climactic homer. In the evenings, Milo would sit
alone and let his imagination take over, picturing Aaron's home run
ball as it sailed into the seats. The announcer's lips murmured.
Sentences formed. Milo hoped to prepare some utterance that would
be so perfect, so memorable, that his words might earn a place in
``Bartlett's Famous Quotations''.``''
</P>
<P>
   When history happened, spontaneity took over. In his excitement,
the announcer forgot his planned comparison between Ruth and Aaron.
``It's gone!'' Hamilton heard himself say. ``It's 715! There's a
new home-run champion of all time! And it's Henry Aaron!''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you say?
</P>
<P>
   How do you describe Mark McGwire's heroics? He has done
something no other human being has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``One small step for man . . .'' has a nice ring. ``Holy
Toledo!'' isn't bad, either. &QL;

PRIORITY ON PLAYOFFS  
 CUBS CHANCES ARE REAL, SOSA'S HRS SEC ONDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's time to make official what all Chicago Cubs fans
feel deep in their hearts: The Cubs appear incapable of making
things easy.
</P>
<P>
   After another turbulent turn on an emotional roller coaster that
has taken tens of millions of fans for wild rides, the Cubs appear
on the verge of making just their third playoff appearance since
World War II, a span of 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, baseball's most lovable losers could not close
Saturday's deal without some form of anguish, even if just for a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what happened before the Cubs managed an
edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting 3-2 victory over Houston, which
turned into as wild a finish as the Cubs have seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, the Cubs were on the receiving end of a break
when home plate umpire Eric Gregg ruled that Houston's Dave Clark
ran out of the baseline while trying to avoid pitcher Rod Beck's
tag in the bottom of the ninth inning for the final out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's throw to first base, which hit Clark in the back and
bounced away, did not matter. Brant Brown, who dropped what would
have been the final out of a victory Wednesday afternoon in
Milwaukee, only to see it turn into a three-run error that lost the
game, breathed a tremendous sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's game-tying run did not count. Clark was out, and
the game was over. The Cubs sprinted off the field still tied for
the lead in the National League wild-card race, dead even with
surging San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like taking a free fall,'' Brown said after watching
the final out Saturday. ``You just didn't know what was next for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs next move is the regular season's last game this
afternoon here in the Astrodome. The possibility of the Cubs making
the playoffs is now real.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets, who had the lead for the NL's final playoff
spot in the middle of last week, are one game back of the Cubs and
the Giants with one day remaining in the regular-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Victories by San Francisco and Chicago would force a one-game
playoff Monday afternoon at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Just imagine
what that scene would be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Cubs town,'' first baseman Mark Grace said of Chicago.
``It's starving for a winner. I'm starving for a winner. All the
times you play with a sprained knee or take those long bus rides in
the minor leagues, this is what it's for.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Sammy Sosa's home run tango with Mark McGwire seems
secondary. The spotlight is entirely on the Cubs and their chances
of reaching the playoffs. Nothing else really matters now.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire zoomed past Sosa on Saturday, blasting his 67th and 68th
home runs and pulling two ahead of Sosa, who basically conceded the
race to McGwire after Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was thinking only of the possibility of playing in his
first playoff game. Little else mattered. Even his 132nd run scored
became a topic of conversation in the sardine-like post-game
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've scored so many runs this year, but none have mattered
more to me than (Saturday's),'' Sosa said. ``It was my favorite of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa scored ahead of Grace in the top of the eighth after Gary
Gaetti, picked up off waivers five weeks ago, ripped a two-out
double into the left-center field gap, breaking a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are on the verge of continuing their season. McGwire
and the St. Louis Cardinals know their season is over this
afternoon. Take a guess who is the most jealous between McGwire and
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has not played in the postseason since 1992, would
gladly trade more than a couple of his home runs to swap spots with
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago will place its dreams in the left arm of veteran Terry
Mulholland, who has tangled with Cubs management for most of the
season but insists that will not be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned long ago you have to let external stuff go,''
Mulholland said. ``You have to crawl into a shell when you step out
there. Nothing else matters now, and there's nowhere else I'd
rather be.'' &QL;

COYOTES,  TKACHUK FELT HEAT  
 PRESSURE OF HOLDOUT KEY TO RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The pressure finally got to them. In the end, they all
did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever expected the Coyotes and superstar Keith Tkachuk
to kiss and make up this quickly. Tkachuk, the team's bruising
power forward, had a better chance of winning the NHL's Lady Byng
Award as the league's most gentlemanly player.
</P>
<P>
   How did both sides resolve their bitter differences seemingly
overnight, when Tkachuk agreed late Friday to a restructured deal
and a one-year contract extension worth a total of $16.7 million
through the 2000-2001 season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Bob Murray (Tkachuk's agent) the other day, `If this
thing keeps going the way it's been going, it'll be easy to find
the losers,' '' General Manager Bobby Smith said. ``But you're
definitely going to have a problem finding a winner in this
situation.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, we found a win-win situation that works for both
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk and the Coyotes will attempt to put on a positive spin
of happy-happy, joy-joy and bury their acrimonious past. After
working out with the team on Monday, Tkachuk will appear with Smith
at a feel-good news conference and they both will go back to work,
probably swearing off commenting on the subject any further this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The truth to exactly how and why this dispute finally ended may
never be known.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a theory, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications several weeks ago that Smith, the
Coyotes' third-year executive, was never willing to let Tkachuk sit
out the entire upcoming season, or even any part of it. He would
play hardball with Tkachuk, wait as long as he could while taking a
strong stance publicly, but eventually was prepared to give in to
Tkachuk's demands, within reason.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk didn't get the $40-plus million over five years he had
been seeking, but officially, his pay this season was bumped to
$4.1 million from $2.8 million, he will get $4.3 million the
following year (up from $3 million), and the extra year will net
him $8.3 million, a little less than the $10 million initially
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Smith) could be setting a bad precedent by doing what he
did,'' an NHL source said. ``Now players are going to think it's OK
to sit out _ even if they have a contract _ because teams are going
to start caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not have exactly caved in, but the Coyotes felt like
they had no choice. They couldn't trade him because the teams that
could afford him didn't have enough to offer in return. And they
aren't strong enough to let him sit and collect dust while
struggling to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tkachuk had more than enough reasons to settle for
less cash and take the best offer he could get.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, his teammates were starting to talk. When
training camp opened and Tkachuk was immediately suspended, most of
them all tried to say the ``right thing.'' You've heard it before:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you always want to see a guy get as much money as
he can get. But it's not right for me to say anything. It's a
situation that's between Keith and the team. Hopefully, something
will get worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The more the questions kept coming, however, the more a few key
Coyotes players like Rick Tocchet and Jeremy Roenick felt
comfortable dropping the gloves, as they say. Both of them _ and
others _ said repeatedly that while Tkachuk had the right to do
what he thought best, they were quick to add if they were in his
shoes, they'd honor their contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin said. ``If you
sign a contract, you play by that contract. But that's just me.''
</P>
<P>
   A contract has never had the same hold on Tkachuk. He also
staged a holdout last season _ after just two years of his
five-year contract _ by reporting to camp but refusing to play in
any preseason games. He had contract squabbles in Winnipeg, too,
one that ultimately led to the Chicago Blackhawks signing him to
$17 million offer sheet, which the Jets matched. But by paying
Tkachuk $6 million in the first year of that deal, the team then
had to unload another star player, and a year later Teemu Selanne
was dealt to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this kid isn't careful, he'll play himself right out of the
National Hockey League,'' one NHL executive said recently. ``He's
not doing anything to help his reputation. Trust me, this stuff
follows you.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver Canucks Coach Mike Keenan said as much when asked
about Tkachuk's holdout last week after a preseason game in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's doing the smart thing,'' Keenan said.
``He's the captain of that team and he needs to set an example, in
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The captaincy issue, many believe, also may have played a major
role in Tkachuk getting signed. Perhaps in no other sport does the
team captain carry so much weight. Tkachuk, who had his captaincy
stripped three years ago, needs the ``C'' to feel complete.
</P>
<P>
   Had he continued his holdout, it eventually would have been
taken away again. Only this time, he probably never would have
gotten it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be the same player if it happened to him again,''
one Phoenix player said privately. ``I don't think he could handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure finally got to them. In the end, they all did the
right thing. &QL;

SILENCE OF THE CAMPS  
 NBA TEAMS, PLAYERS STAND FIRM ON KEY ISSUE OF SALARY CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Already, the NBA has put off the start of training
camps and begun slicing into its preseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And with every day that passes without another round of labor
talks between the NBA and the players it has locked out, the
chances of the 1998-99 season beginning on schedule on Nov. 3
dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no progress since the NBA's owners voted to
reopen the collective bargaining agreement and locked out the
players.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has only been one meeting of any substance, and
the group of owners in attendance walked out of it.
</P>
<P>
   While there are a number of issues to be weighed, the dispute
really comes down to one _ whether there will be a so-called hard
salary cap or a soft one.
</P>
<P>
   The owners want a hard cap, which would eliminate the so-called
Larry Bird exception that allows clubs to re-sign their own free
agents with a certain length of service to new contracts without
cap limitations.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason Michael Jordan could earn more than $33 million
last season when the league's salary cap for an entire team was
almost $10 million below that.
</P>
<P>
   NBA Commissioner David Stern has said that half of the league's
29 teams either lost money or broke even last season, and the
skyrocketing salary structure is the reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the union isn't buy ing that.
</P>
<P>
   Players, according to the league, received about 57 percent of
basketball-related revenues taken in by the NBA last season. The
owners wanted that figure below 50 percent to ensure continued
growth. The union believes the owners are making plenty of money,
even with the players getting a larger piece of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different twists and subplots to this,''
said Suns forward Danny Manning. ``I don't want to see a hard cap
or for them to take away the Bird exception. The league just signed
a new television deal that's worth twice as much as the last
contract. NBA coaches are the highest paid in professional sports.
They averaged more last year than the players.''
</P>
<P>
   That new television deal with NBC and Turner Sports is
reportedly worth $2.7 billion over four years. The players also
point to new revenue streams that have opened up for the owners. In
the 1990s, 10 teams have built new arenas or had substantial
renovations done to their old home. At least four other teams are
due to move into new arenas soon.
</P>
<P>
   A state-of-the art arena can be a money-making machine because
of luxury suites and advertising signage. Even the names of the
buildings are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But despite $1.7 billion in league revenues last season, NBA
Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik says the NBA as a whole was not
profitable for the first time in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include the league's drug policy, which doesn't
prohibit marijuana, the rookie salary scale, and the minimum salary
for veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   League sources say that before the owners walked out of the
earlier meeting, Suns President Jerry Colangelo, a member of the
NBA Labor Relations Committee, made a proposal that apparently
asked for player concessions on the drug policy and rookie scale in
return for a compromise on some other economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The proposal apparently piqued the interest of the union but
was not welcomed by some owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on that,'' Colangelo said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The ice might be broken when arbitrator John Freerick, a Fordham
University law professor, issues a ruling on whether the league
must honor its guaranteed contracts during a lockout. If the league
has to pay the guaranteed contracts, it loses much of its leverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's Dan Majerle said it could work the other way because
there are about 190 free agent players who would not get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could split the players if only the guys with guaranteed
contracts are getting paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning believes it will at least mean the resumption of
talks because both sides will then know where they stand. Until
Freerick rules, which is supposed to be by mid-October, neither
said has much incentive. &QL;

OFFENSIVE LINE COACH KEEPS 49ERS ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have enough ex-Cardinals to start an alumni chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Garrison Hearst, strong safety  &UR; Tim McDonald and
left guard  &UR; Ray
 &UR; Brown are starters for the San Francisco 49ers.  &UR; Chuck Levy is the
team's return specialist and backup running back.  &UR; Randy Kirk is
the deep snapper.
 &UR; Chad Fann is the No. 3 tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Only McDonald went to the 49ers' in a free-agent bidding war.
Hearst, Levy, Brown and Fann were cut. Kirk is with his sixth team.
</P>
<P>
   So who said the 49ers were the best team owner  &UR; Eddie DeBartolo
Jr.'s money can buy?
</P>
<P>
   The perennial NFC West champions have gained 500 yards on the
ground in their first two games using a starting line that includes
two tackles who weren't drafted, two guards who were taken in the
eighth round (there isn't an eighth round anymore) and a center who
was a sixth-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the credit should go to offensive line coach  &UR; Bobb
McKittrick, the only person in the 49ers' organization who has held
the same job since  &UR; Bill Walsh took over as coach in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the smartest coach in football,'' said Oakland Raiders
Coach  &UR; Jon
 &UR; Gruden, a former 49ers assistant.
</P>
<P>
   He's also one of the strangest.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick, who will be 63 in December, won't wear a coat, even
if the team is playing in Buffalo in December.
</P>
<P>
   After a game in freezing rain in Chicago during the 1980s, Walsh
had a team doctor talk to McKittrick about his health.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers Coach  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Holmgren, a former 49ers offensive coordinator, said he once tried
to communicate from the press box with McKittrick, who was on the
sidelines. But McKittrick was so cold, Holmgren couldn't understand
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Bobb, you've got to put on a jacket,' '' Holmgren
said. ``His teeth were chattering,'' Holmgren said. ``I was looking
at it from a pretty practical standpoint. He could be out there
naked if he could tell me what (plays) he wanted to do running the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick said he just doesn't get as cold as most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became like &UR; Woody Hayes,'' McKittrick said. ``I got the
reputation, and I enjoyed it. You can't get much reputation as an
offensive line coach. You're pretty anonymous. So, I just didn't
wear (a coat), and it wasn't bad. But other people thought I was
colder than I was.'' &QL; 
Dumb and dumber
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil was willing to overlook
running back
 &UR; Lawrence Phillips' three arrests and the 23 days he served in jail
to consider re-signing him last week.
</P>
<P>
   But team officials stopped it, telling Vermeil they were
dead-set against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also received numerous phone calls from fans
complaining that the team was even considering the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it has created quite a little news thing around
the country,'' Vermeil said. ``I'm sorry I did that. I'm going to
have to start not answering questions honestly when someone asks me
something because it just creates problems. . . . I get ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I like Lawrence Phillips, and I cared about the kid, and I
still do. I recommended him to three other teams. And I couldn't
very well recommend him to three other teams without at least
having him on my mind in some way or another, just as a person, as
a player and a guy that I coached.'' &QL; 
Capital punishment
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos quarterback
 &UR; John Elway has few fond memories of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad place,'' Elway said. ``Just ask  &UR; Bill ( &UR; Clinton).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Elway missed the Broncos' Monday night game in
Washington after becoming ill from eating chipped beef on toast at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Elway bypassed the team's Super Bowl-champion visit
to the White House to have a magnetic resonance imaging on his
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Elway might miss today's game against the Redskins because
of a hamstring injury. &QL; 
Streak continues
</P>
<P>
   It has been 26 years since the Broncos last returned a kickoff
for touchdown, the longest streak in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The last Denver player to do so was  &UR; Randy Montgomery, who had a
94-yard score against San Diego on Sept. 24, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos returner  &UR; Vaughn Hebron said the team became almost
obsessed with scoring on a kickoff last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a joke,'' he said. ``But at the same time, that's
what I look forward to. We're so explosive. If we can take away
half the field, the defense has problems.'' &QL; 
Good aim
</P>
<P>
   When former Washington State quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf got mad at a
Spokane, Wash., reporter three years ago, he fired a pass over the
reporter's head at a practice.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, he swore at ``San Diego Union-Tribune'' reporter
 &UR; Jay Posner after earlier in the day throwing a pass in practice
that just missed Posner.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter was probably lucky Leaf was coming off a 1-for-15
passing performance the previous day in a loss at Kansas City. &QL; 
Down and out
</P>
<P>
   How far have things fallen in Carolina, which reached the NFC
title game two years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The team (0-2) has gone from the model expansion franchise to
team owner
 &UR; Jerry Richardson calling an impromptu meeting in which he lashed
out at the players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly upset Richardson told the team he had spent too much
money in free agency during the off-season to accept such poor
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Some players were stunned by Richardson's actions and considered
his behavior ``inappropriate.'' But apparently they got the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Jeff Brady called today's game against NFC champion
Green Bay a ``must win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think it is, you're crazy,'' he said. ``I don't
care who's coming in here. If any of the guys around here think
it's not urgent, they must not be opening up their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disappointment. We need to play meaner.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings haven't lost a game since San Antonio car
dealer  &UR; Red
 &UR; McCombs brought the team over the summer. McCombs even hollered,
``Seven-and-oh,'' as the players walked into the locker room last
week. The Vikings won all four preseason games and are 3-0 in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has allowed only 22 points, tied for the fewest allowed by
a Dolphins team in the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona State defensive lineman  &UR; Dan Saleaumua, now of
the Seattle Seahawks, on his high school in National City, Calif.,
naming its stadium after Olympian  &UR; Gail Devers: ``A couple gold
medals, big deal. Just name the track after her. They named the
whole football stadium after her. So they said they were going to
name the weight room after me. I like that better.'' &QL;

HOLCOMBE TO GET DEBUT VS. CARDS  
 MESA HIGH GRADUATE TAKES PLACE OF INJURED RAMS RUNNING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Rookie running back Robert Holcombe was in need of a
pep talk because the start of his NFL career had gone much
differently than he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   He was healthy and eager to play, but St. Louis Rams coaches
chose not to activate him in each of the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Down and confused, Holcombe, a second-round draft pick from
Illinois, decided to talk to one of his former coaches at Mesa High
School, Kenny Wantland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him a week ago and he said, `Just keep your head
up,' '' Holcombe said. ``He also said, `I just have a feeling
you'll be out there starting against Arizona.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Holcombe thinks Wantland is ``psychic or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe not only will make his NFL debut Sunday against the
Cardinals at the TWA Dome, he will be the featured back.
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe will be in the lineup because starting running back
Greg Hill suffered a broken leg while getting 158 yards in last
week's victory at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Greg went down, that's something you never want to see,''
Holcombe said. ``I think Greg is a great person, and we developed a
friendship since I've been here. But I do want to play. I want my
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe tried to be patient earlier, but he acknowledged that
it had been frustrating not dressing for games.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he had missed a game was his freshman year at
Illinois, when he suffered a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' said Holcombe, who moved from Houston to
Arizona his junior year of high school to live with his aunt and
uncle. ``I didn't understand it. I don't think anyone else in my
position would understand it. It was a new experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams Coach Dick Vermeil didn't dress Hill or Holcombe in the
season-opening loss to New Orleans, a move for which he was heavily
criticized. Hill played the next week, but it made little sense why
Holcombe, who was No. 2 on the depth chart, wasn't used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that (Holcombe) was ready to be a pure
running back, not ready to be in the total complex of the game, in
third-down situations,'' Vermeil said. ``I've felt all along that
if our starter did get banged up that I would activate him and get
him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm second-guessed tremendously by everybody. But when I tell
you I have confidence in him, I have confidence in him. If starting
him Sunday doesn't prove what I've been telling you all along, then
I'm an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe didn't find out he was starting until Wednesday morning
when running backs coach Wilbert Montgomery interrupted a film
session to make an announcement. He told Holcombe, ``By the way,
Robert, you're going to get a lot of reps in practice this week. As
a matter of fact, you're going to be starting. So I need your
undivided attention on everything we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe said he doesn't expect to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's the NFL, but it's still football,'' he said.
``Once the whistle blows, it's you against them. You are out there
trying to execute assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals hope Holcombe doesn't play in his first victory in
nearly two years. He finished his career with the Illini losing 17
consecutive games, including all 11 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cardinals scouts loved Holcombe, who had 4,015 career
yards and 28 touchdowns at Illinois, and they nearly drafted him in
the second round. But they took defensive back Corey Chavous and
offensive tackle Anthony Clement ahead of him because they already
had traded for running back Adrian Murrell and signed free agent
Mario Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe will be reunited with Cardinals defensive end Simeon
Rice, his former Illini teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the greatest work ethic I've seen,'' Holcombe said of
Rice. ``He's one of the hardest-working athletes I've been around.
He was someone I tried to pattern after. I knew if I could work as
hard as he did, I'd go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe doesn't think it's fate that his first game is coming
against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one of those things,'' he said. ``Stuff like that
happens every now and then in life. But the best thing is my family
in Arizona will get to see me play (on TV). That's very good
news.'' &QL;

WILL MOISES ALOU BE LEAVING AS TROS?  
 FATHER'S FUTURE MAY DETERMINE DESTINA TION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a subject that makes many Houston Astros fans very nervous.
Because
 &UR; Moises Alou was acquired in the middle of a multiyear deal, he
would be within his rights to request a trade after this season. If
the Astros do not comply, Alou could become a free agent on March
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk after the season and see what happens,''
Alou said. ``I like it here, and I like it a lot. But we still have
(more to do) . . . a lot of things can happen between now and then.
Winning is going to make a lot of difference in what I do. If we
win it all, I'll beg to come back to Houston. If we don't, we'll
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see where this team is going. To me, it looks
pretty good. We have a new stadium coming, and I'm sure they would
like to go to the new stadium with a good team. Winning and having
a good team is something I'd like to see if they want me to stay.
But I don't know if they're going to want me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou is owed $15 million over the next three years, a bargain
considering the production he has brought to Houston. In any other
season, he would have a legitimate shot at MVP. The Astros
definitely want Alou roaming left field when they move into the
Ballpark at Union Station in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moises has been absolutely tremendous,'' Astros General
Manager  &UR; Gerry
 &UR; Hunsicker said. ``We hope he will continue to be a part of this
ballclub. But now is not the time to comment on that situation
because it's not an issue right now; certainly not on the eve of
the postseason. We're prepared to sit down after the postseason,
and if that situation presents itself, we'll address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for Houston to tear up the remaining years on Alou's
contract and give him a big raise, probably one that will pay him
around $8 million per season. Of course, if Alou's father  &UR; Felipe
Alou becomes the Dodgers' manager, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my father, and you always want to be with family,'' Alou
said. ``That doesn't mean I want to go play for him next year. I've
always said I want to play for him again. Who doesn't want to be
with his family?'' &QL; 
Realizing a mistake &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The morning after San Diego's players openly criticized their
own organization for putting on an extravaganza, which definitely
went overboard, for  &UR; Sammy Sosa, Padres owner  &UR; John Moores
apologized to his players for the team's role in saluting Sosa, but
not to the club's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screwed up,'' Moores said. ``It was inappropriate. It was
crazy. I didn't like the music or the fireworks. It's just as well
I didn't see (the flashing scoreboard). Anyone who criticizes the
fans for applauding Sosa misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the fans and am thrilled they came and enjoyed.
But the organization made a terrible mistake with our reaction.
Talk about a mixed message. We want to win. For the organization to
cheer a homer that beats us in this situation sends a terrible
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were especially perturbed at the fireworks set off
by the club, as well as the salsa music played over the
loudspeakers and the Padres' cheerleaders dancing and blowing
kisses to Sosa, who had just hit an eighth-inning grand slam to
break a 2-2 tie. &QL; 
The nuclear fallout &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reality has to set in out in Orange County, where Anaheim's
latest September gag exposed the problems afflicting the Angels. At
the top of Anaheim's winter wish list is acquiring a big bopper who
can hit 40 or so home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The one name that jumps out is a certain catcher who made quite
a name for himself in Southern California.  &UR; Mike Piazza, a
potential free agent after this season, would certainly be a boon
for the Angels, who have long lived in the shadow of their Los
Angeles-area neighbor, the Dodgers.  &UR; Mo Vaughn also could be
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels would also love to add a front-line pitcher.  &UR; Kevin
Brown and
 &UR; Randy Johnson, who played college ball at nearby Southern
California, jump to mind. The big question is whether the folks who
also own the Disney empire will loosen the necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
   But acquiring a couple of big-name players is only half of the
Angels' winter plan. The club will apparently do some housecleaning
along the way.
 &UR; Randy Velarde, a fabulous clubhouse presence, does not appear to be
the same player he once was, his defensive skills having
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gregg Jefferies' option will not be picked up, and it appears
unlikely  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Juden and  &UR; Trevor Wilson will be kept around. The biggest shock may
be the Angels making center fielder  &UR; Jim Edmonds available in a
trade. &QL; 
A different kind of streak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third-longest streaks for a player and a pitcher not
appearing in a post-season game will end this week when Cleveland's
 &UR; Travis Fryman and  &UR; Doug
 &UR; Jones each make their first playoff appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had made 718 career appearances through Friday without
being a part of the playoffs; Fryman, who spent his first six years
with Detroit, had played in 1,238 (through Friday) postseason-less
games.
</P>
<P>
   Among pitchers,  &UR; John Franco of the New York Mets, who has gone
829 appearances, and Toronto's  &UR; Dan Plesac (757) have endured
longer postseason droughts than Jones. Franco's could end if the
Mets emerge as the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's  &UR; Dave Martinez is the current leader among position
players, having gone 1,525 games without appearing in the playoffs.
Sosa is next at 1,238. His streak also could end, depending on the
wild-card outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A definite All-Star when it comes to being the bridegroom:
 &UR; Terry
 &UR; Collins has managed five seasons in the major leagues, three with
Houston and two with Anaheim. Collins' clubs have finished in
second place five times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; You want to talk home run king: Negro League great  &UR; Josh
 &UR; Gibson hit 75 home runs in 1931 and 69 in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From the Now It Can Be Told Dept.: The Diamondbacks could have
selected  &UR; Rick Helling, who became a 20-game winner for Texas last
week, in the expansion draft. Instead, they took middle infielder
 &UR; Edwin Diaz from the Rangers with their sixth pick in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (postseason edition): Francisco Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How the NL West was lost: After posting a 4-15 record in their
first 19 home games, the Colorado Rockies entered the weekend 37-23
at Coors Field since that dismal start.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How the AL West was lost: Texas played at Anaheim three times
this week and beat the September Swoon Artists, or Angels if you
prefer, by scores of 9-1, 9-1 and 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Attention baseball junkies: The full-page Baseball Insider will
disappear after this week until next spring. Not to fret; a smaller
edition will appear throughout the postseason and intermittenly
during the off-season. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sammy Sosa's 12 home runs against Milwaukee pitching fell just
two shy of the major league record shared by Cubs'  &UR; Hank Sauer
against Pittsburgh in 1954 and the Braves'  &UR; Joe Adcock against
Brooklyn in 1956. Sosa hit his 12 homers in 12 games. In Sauer and
Adcock's days, teams played 22 games against each other.
</P>
<P>
   With his seven strikeouts Saturday, Philadelphia's  &UR; Curt
 &UR; Schilling joined an elite fraternity that includes just four
pitchers who have struck out at least 300 batters in consecutive
seasons. The others:  &UR; Rube
 &UR; Waddell (1903-'04),  &UR; Sandy Koufax (1965-'66),  &UR; Nolan Ryan
(1972-'73-'74, '76-'77) and  &UR; J.R. Richard (1978-'79).
</P>
<P>
   The last time San Francisco had two players reach 100 RBIs in
consecutive seasons,  &UR; John Kennedy was in office.  &UR; Barry Bonds and
 &UR; Jeff Kent joined  &UR; Willie Mays and  &UR; Orlando Cepeda, who achieved
the feat in 1961-'62.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles'  &UR; Carlos Perez has pitched four consecutive complete
games, two of which were shutouts. The last Dodgers pitcher to
accomplish that was  &UR; Orel Hershiser, who pitched five straight
shutouts during his Cy Young Award season of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The high-octane Colorado Rockies offense went from having four
players with at least 30 home runs the past two seasons to just one
this year in  &UR; Vinny Castilla, who has a career-high 45.
</P>
<P>
   Just like all the players who will participate in the Arizona
Fall League, St. Louis outfielder  &UR; J.D. Drew, ``persona non grata''
anywhere near the Philadelphia city limits, will begin playing in
the Valley later this week. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All-Star third baseman  &UR; Robin Ventura appears to be tiring of
all the peripheral mess surrounding the Chicago White Sox, and the
free agent may decide to leave the south side this winter.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems that Cincinnati General Manager  &UR; Jim Bowden has
fallen behind the other two primary candidates to take over as
Baltimore's GM _ Cleveland assistant  &UR; Dan O'Dowd and Florida
assistant  &UR; Frank Wren.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis may be priming itself for one heck of a flurry of
activity this winter. The Cardinals, whose bank accounts swelled
because of
 &UR; Mark McGwire this summer, may be on the verge of going after
free-agent pitcher  &UR; Kevin Brown and trying to trade for shortstop
 &UR; Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is letting it be known that  &UR; Paul Konerko can be had
in a trade. Konerko, who the Reds believe can only play first base,
will not get that opportunity with Cincinnati because of the
presence of  &UR; Sean
 &UR; Casey.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the Rockies fire Manager  &UR; Don Baylor, look for
them to try to lure  &UR; Jim Leyland to Denver. Also, do not discount
 &UR; Art Howe as a replacement for Baylor. Howe and Rockies owner
 &UR; Jerry McMorris have an excellent relationship. Howe's Oakland
contract is up after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia outfielder  &UR; Ruben Amaro Jr. announced last week he
will retire as a player and join the Phillies' front office as a
special assistant to GM  &UR; Ed Wade. The Stanford-educated Amaro, who
is fluent in Spanish and was the club's bat boy when it won its
only World Series in 1980, plans to hire his father and former
Phillies player, coach and scout,  &UR; Ruben
 &UR; Sr., in some capacity. &QL;

SUNS' OFFICES QUIET; AINGE FRUSTRATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 and BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Normally, with a little more than a week before the
scheduled opening of training camp, Suns officials would be busier
than White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be an especially frenetic period for the
Suns, who have only three players under contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   For two years the club's front office positioned its roster and
its available salary cap room for this summer, when about 190
players became free agents. The Suns were supposed to be retooling
in an effort to once again contend for an NBA title. With players
such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Vlade Divac available,
this off-season held a lot of promise for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, General Manager Bryan Colangelo is in Europe. Coach
Danny Ainge was on a Mormon-history tour last week in the Midwest.
The club's offices are quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frustrating,'' Ainge said. ``I'd like to sit
down with the members of my staff to start planning what kind of
offense and defense we're going to run. But we don't know what our
roster is going to be like yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Suns under contract for next season are guard Jason
Kidd, forward Danny Manning _ who may be back from knee surgery
before the beginning of the year _ and Mark Bryant, who has one
year left on his deal, which became guaranteed when the Suns didn't
waive him before the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The club has a dozen free agents of its own, some of whom it
will attempt to re-sign, including Rex Chapman and Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   And the Suns have to come to terms with their two rookies: Pat
Garrity, who was the 19th pick in the first round by Milwaukee,
then traded to Dallas, then to Phoenix; and Toby Bailey, the 45th
overall pick by the Los Angeles Lakers who also was traded to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a lot of work to be done and not a lot of time to do
it if the lockout continues into October and threatens or cuts into
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs could have as little as 10 days to two weeks to sign
players when the lockout is lifted, especially if it goes into the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a problem for the Suns, who apparently have
interest in Pippen. The perennial All-Star small forward had back
surgery this summer, and there won't be much time to do homework on
him or evaluate his condition. During the lockout, clubs cannot
have contact with players or their agents. So all the Suns can do
is wait. &QL;

LOCKOUT'S END COULD MAKE MESS  
 TOP FREE AGENTS COULD BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Settling the NBA labor dispute might be easier than
cleaning up the mess it leaves behind.
</P>
<P>
   About 190 NBA players are free agents. Another 60 or so were
drafted. Others, like developing players from the Continental
Basketball Association and Europe, also are looking for NBA jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the league's 29 teams have only a handful of their
own players under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the league has said little about what contingency plan will
take effect if the league lockout of its players ultimately cuts
into the regular season, or even pushes up against the Nov. 3
start.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and general managers don't know what roster or
salary-cap rules will come out of the collective-bargaining
process, so they can't do much planning.
</P>
<P>
   How long will they have to put a team together? Will there be
abbreviated training camps? Any exhibition games? What is the point
of no return, after which regular-season games will be lost?
</P>
<P>
   Players don't know how long they'll have to make a decision
about where they will play, or which teams will have the most money
to offer. Agents don't know which teams will end up being the best
situation for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   And fans can just forget about their fantasy league draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us knows what the new system is going to be, so it's
all speculation,'' agent Marc Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But league sources say there probably will be a short window
during which players may sign contracts. It could be as little as
10 days to two weeks, if that will mean saving regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, it's going to be a feeding frenzy,'' Suns
forward Danny Manning said. ``A lot of players are going to have to
make a decision before they explore all their options.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kleine, a former Suns center who is a free agent this summer
after spending last season with the NBA champion Chicago Bulls,
figures the top-echelon free agents _ players such as Scottie
Pippen of the Bulls, Vlade Divac of the Charlotte Hornets and Tom
Gugliotta of the Minnesota Timberwolves _ will get good offers and
sign quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The rest may not find the market so friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably going to be a lot of `Take it or leave it,'
'' Kleine said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning also worries that a lot of players will show up in less
than desirable condition because free agents won't want to risk
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to have something happen like it did to
Christian Laettner,'' Manning said. ``That's a terrible
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner played for Atlanta last season and was considered a top
free-agent prospect. But he suffered a serious Achilles' tendon
injury in a summer pickup game and now has little free-agent value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give some guys a little excuse not to do as much
work,'' Manning said. ``Not all players, but there will be some.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Dan Majerle agreed, and while he's known for his work
ethic, he admitted it's difficult to get motivated. Players are
locked out of league facilities, so they work out at home or in
health clubs. It's tougher to find competitive pickup games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Majerle said. ``Normally, we'd have everybody in
town at the (America West) arena playing every day. Now, you don't
know who is going to show up, or what time you're going to start.
It's like a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleine figures that whatever the system is when the lockout
ends, some teams will have a good plan in place and others will
not. And the players generally have an idea about which
organizations will do it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better organizations will have a timetable and a plan,''
he said. ``They'll go to the first player they want, make an offer
and give them a timetable for a decision, maybe 48 hours. If they
don't have it, they'll go to the next guy on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   So who does that favor?
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it will favor the top-level free agents,''
Fleisher said. ``Normally, teams would start with an offer, then
come back with another offer or maybe two later on. I think the top
free agents are going to get bids quickly and for a lot more money
because teams are going to be afraid they won't get the guy they're
after. They're going to come with their best offer right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second tier also should do well, because teams are
probably going to make offers to more than one player because they
don't know if they're going to get their top guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be somewhat like college recruiting in which top programs
identify three or four players at a position and make an offer. The
first player to make a commitment gets the scholarship. The idea is
to prevent getting shut out completely.
</P>
<P>
   And who gets hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Manning said it will be the players who didn't have a chance
during summer leagues that were canceled, or during a preseason, to
prove themselves and win a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solid veteran players will be signed,'' he said. ``The
stars will be signed. You've got Michael Jordan and that type of
player who has taken the league to a new level of popularity. But
you also have the Steve Kerrs, the Jud Buechlers and the Randy
Browns. Those are the guys who make the league go 'round.'' &QL;

DEFENSE LEADS CHARGE AGAINST UPSTART BEAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Was that a mild breeze snaking through Sun Devil
Stadium on Saturday night, or a collective sigh of relief by
Arizona State fans?
</P>
<P>
   Someone finally woke the sleeping giant. It probably won't be
the Sun Devils' sharpest effort of the season, but it was enough to
put away Oregon State, 24-3, in front of an announced crowd of
59,630.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the defense with the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of this football team,'' ASU Coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``The defense took a lot of hits, criticism,
internally and externally.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense limited the Beavers to nine rushing yards and held
the Pac-10's top running back, Ken Simonton, to 33. ASU gave up the
fewest points since yielding three to UCLA in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the big picture looks more promising. Although the
opportunity for a national title disappeared weeks ago, the Sun
Devils at least appear competitive in the conference again.
</P>
<P>
   They'll know more in the next two weeks when they visit Southern
California and host Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much our schemes as it was our players'
efforts,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder took a different approach with his defense before and
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Practices this week were shortened so the players would have
fresher legs. Indeed, the unit played much more aggressively.
Beavers quarterback Terrance Bryant was pressured much of the game
and sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Sun Devils played with two linebackers _ Adam
Archuleta and Joe Cesta _ and five defensive backs much of the
game. It gave the group more speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they played aggressively up front,'' Beavers Coach
Mike Riley said. ``Give them credit for carrying out their game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, ASU appeared more in sync, although at times it
still lacked the sharpness it displayed during the second half of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers who were the subject of much preseason hype lived
up to their billing.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Tariq McDonald seemed to make every play that came his
way. He caught four passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. Senior
Kenny Mitchell proved that last week's 88-yard, one-touchdown
effort against North Texas was no fluke with three catches for 39
yards.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, J.R. Redmond kept Oregon State's defense off balance.
He finished with 23 carries for 83 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But get this. He wasn't even the leading rusher. Gerald Green,
who spelled Redmond because Davaren Hightower was sidelined because
of a knee sprain, gained 86 yards on 17 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Kealy completed 12 of 27 passes for 173 yards
and two touchdowns. Bryant was 29 of 50 for 198 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond put ASU ahead, 7-0, with 6:23 remaining in the first
quarter on a pitch he took 2 yards into the end zone. Four plays
earlier, he took a pass from Kealy and went 20 yards after putting
a move on the Beavers' Keith Heyward-Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State ate up almost five minutes on its next possession
but could only get a 29-yard field goal by Jose Cortez out of it.
J'Juan Cherry broke up a pass on third and 7 to force the kick.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald increased ASU's lead to 14-3 in the second quarter by
connecting with Kealy on a 17-yard pass play. Creig Spann put the
Sun Devils in scoring position with a 15-yard reception the play
before. Green carried five times for 27 yards during the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Stephen Baker missed a 52-yard field goal, and Oregon
State's Cortez botched a 46-yard attempt late in the second
quarter. The Sun Devils went into the half with an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers committed the most costly penalty of the game in the
third quarter with a roughing-the-kicker call on fourth and 34.
That set up an ASU drive that was capped by Baker's 45-yard field
goal with 3:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was an important possession because it ate up 6:48 minutes.
Snyder wanted to keep the ball out of the Beavers' hands as much as
possible. That drive did.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers had more mistakes in them. Roddy Tompkins fumbled a
punt 12:32 remaining in the fourth quarter, and ASU's Courtney
Palmore immediately jumped on it. On the next play, Kealy hit
Lenzie Jackson for a 19-yard scoring pass to give the Sun Devils a
24-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. The Sun Devils were not without flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ASU is still penalty prone. It committed 12 for 128 yards. The
Beavers had eight for 70.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is revealing a propensity for fumbling, something that
hasn't bothered him until this season. He fumbled twice Saturday to
give him five for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ASU improves to 2-2 overall and 1-1 in the conference. Oregon
State, 2-2 and 0-2, will travel to Utah State on Saturday. &QL;

SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS  
 DEFENSES ATTACK YOUTHFUL QBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Playing quarterback in the NFL never was meant to be
a duck-and-cover exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was it meant to be an entry-level job for a 23-year-old
kid making enough to buy his own HMO, but there are 13 starting
quarterbacks this weekend who are in their first, second or third
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals start one, Jake Plummer, and they face one, Tony
Banks of the Rams, this morning at 10 (Arizona time) at the TWA
Dome in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses are teeing off on them with blitzes, particularly zone
blitzes, where the risk of being burned by a big play is minimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame them,'' said Cardinals left tackle Lomas
Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler. ``Defenses in this league are going
to take advantage of every weakness. If you've got a young
quarterback in there, they're going to try to rattle him, bring as
many looks as they can. It's a league of attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' offense, with Plummer at quarterback, was booed
coming off the field at Sun Devil Stadium last week. That was
before Plummer and the offense scored on their final three drives _
17 unanswered points _ and ran nearly five minutes off the clock to
preserve a victory over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to judge a quarterback early in his career because
the guys around him also have to be up to speed,'' said Cardinals
backup quarterback Dave Brown, who was a starter for the New York
Giants for 4{ seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake is under a lot of pressure. He's got to be team captain,
he's kind of a national hero here in Arizona, and he's also got to
play quarterback. He's done a good job handling that. Now it's a
matter of the collective team playing better to help him out,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The season reaches the quarter mark today. Plummer acknowledges
that the sum of the offense is not the equal of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's just me not responding and being the
athlete that I am and making the plays,'' Plummer said. ``I'm not
pressing. I'm trying to take what people are giving me and allowing
the athletes around me to make plays. But we have definitely not
utilized the talent that is there.'' &QL; 
Rookies struggle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's critics should note that neither Peyton Manning, the
first pick in the draft who is starting for Indianapolis, nor Ryan
Leaf, the second overall pick who starts for San Diego, has sent
defensive coordinators back to the film room to devise new schemes.
Last week, Leaf went 1 for 15 at Kansas City. The Colts, with top
pick Manning at the throttle, are winless.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Lions rookie quarterback Charlie Batch has looked dazed
and confused since being promoted. Bobby Hoying, Philadelphia's
third-year quarterback in his first as a starter, was sacked nine
times by Seattle and knocked out of the game last week by blitzing
Cardinals linebacker Ron McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a learning curve for everybody,'' said Marc Trestman,
the Cardinals new offensive coordinator. ``We've simplified things
to a degree in our nickel and third-down packages to help Jake. For
a young quarterback, that's the most difficult place to be, in a
nickel situation. And we've had a lot of third-and-longs.''
</P>
<P>
   It'snot just a young man's problem. There are older
quarterbacks, playing behind more experienced lines, who have been
devoured by sack-craving defensive wolves. Proven veterans such as
Seattle's Warren Moon, 41, Denver's John Elway, 38, Miami's Dan
Marino, 37, San Francisco's Steve Young, 36, and Minnesota's
Randall Cunningham, 34, have seen it all. Even they are not immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses are bringing more than offenses can handle,''
Trestman said. ``Because of the zone blitz, where they're playing
zone behind it, they're not giving up the big play. They're
bringing the extra guy and they're getting free shots. The blitzing
situation is very unique in the NFL right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Leafs and the Mannings are taking shots, and I'm sure the
league is going to look at it. Teams have made huge investments in
some of these young quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Cardinals are on the right track. He was
encouraged by Adrian Murrell's 101 rushing yards in the fourth
quarter of the win over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest key to beating the zone blitz is running the
ball,'' Brown said. ``Defensive linemen are kind of light in their
stance because they're dropping out into coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to play against (former Cardinals and
Philadelphia Eagles Coach) Buddy Ryan, we knew we were going to get
hit a lot, but we also knew if we hung in long enough, we were
going to get a big play off his man-to-man blitzes. With the zone
blitz, you've got to be more patient. You've got to nickel-and-dime
it. If you can fire out and run the ball like Denver does, you're
going to control the blitzes a lot better.'' &QL; 
Making adjustments &QL; 
Defensive coordinators aren't the only copycats. Offensives are
beginning to emulate the manner in which the Broncos deal with the
zone blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Denver is doing, not only running the ball but by
spreading teams out with five wide receivers and putting Elway back
in the shotgun, is taking teams out of what they want to do
blitzing-wise,'' Brown said. ``Teams that stay bunched up are
really susceptible to the zone blitz because defenses are going to
drop guys to those certain areas, and they can make it to those
areas by the time the zone blitz hits the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing the copycats won't have is Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched film of Denver and Green Bay, teams with guys
who've been around eight, 10, 12 years, it's awesome because it's
almost automatic to them,'' said third-year Cardinals center Aaron
Graham, who is in his first season as full-time starter. ``The
quicker we can get to that point, the better we're going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around the league at the young quarterbacks, and it's
not like Jake is the only guy who ever messed up. Bobby Hoying,
Ryan Leaf, Peyton Manning _ they're all going through the exact
same stuff. With young quarterbacks, it's a race right now to see
who will be the first to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with offensive linemen, and we have a young
line. We're having to make the same reads Jake makes. When we've
had a few sack problems, we're not physically getting beat. It's
mental. The defenses are bringing so many people and we have a
split second to adjust and react. The way for a young offense to
get better is through experience, and I'd be surprised if we're all
not doing things a whole lot better by the middle of the season.'' &QL;

FINE-TUNED SUN DEVILS MIGHT BE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - This was a solid coaching job. A week when Bruce
Snyder earned his money. A game that tempts you to give the man a
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a meaningless coincidence, a quirky phenomenon. But in
the same week that a $45,000 bump in salary clears its last
bureaucratic hurdle, Snyder turned in his best coaching performance
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The kind you expect for nearly $600,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface of a 24-3 victory over Oregon State were two
key maneuvers. For starters, Snyder wisely turned down the volume
in practice, refreshing his sunburned squad. On Saturday, they were
aggressive, fleet and mean, clearly a fresher bunch. And he made a
key tactical adjustment that paved the way for surprising defensive
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with an underachieving linebacker corps that had a hard
time making basic tackles, Snyder switched to three cornerbacks and
two safeties. He took one linebacker off the field. On occasion, he
even threw a dime package at the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a faster football team. A speed-oriented defense
that completely shut down Oregon State's rushing attack. A defense
that completely compensated for a lackluster offense, and where
have we seen that before?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Snyder has a certain Zen-like quality. A certain
eloquence and charm that must work wonders in the living room of
prize recruits. And there's no arguing the turnabout he's
orchestrated in Tempe or the foundation he's laid in leading ASU to
the upper echelon of college football.
</P>
<P>
   But his past six games have been a mix of good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   His players claimed they weren't prepared in last year's
season-ending loss to Arizona. Then came a masterful dismantling of
Iowa in the Sun Bowl, a performance that Athletic Director Kevin
White called one of the best coaching performances he's ever
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Forward to 1998, a season that opened with a poorly coached
debacle against Washington, another game where players blamed a
lack of preparation. Then came the spanking at BYU, followed by an
uninspired victory over North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for fans and media to get sucked in by the sirens
of optimism. It's another thing for a coaching staff to misread its
own talent level and lack of leadership. You expect a little more
from an architect of Snyder's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But to his credit, Snyder accepted part of the blame. It seems
he has finally found the pulse of this team, and on Saturday, both
he and the Devils produced their finest efforts of the season. And,
if the offense ever becomes a consistent force, they might be
giants, after all.
</P>
<P>
   What's disconcerting about this group is the complete lack of
rhythm on offense. One series, they gobble up yardage. The next,
they can't move the chains. One series, Ryan Kealy looks like Jake
Plummer. The next, he looks like Jake the plumber. One series, J.R.
Redmond can't be stopped. The next, he can't stop dropping the
football.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Redmond has fumbled in four consecutive games. Kealy's
radar goes in and out with alarming frequency. The yellow flags
continue to fly. And for all their fearsome weapons, this is not a
riveting, highly-entertaining attack. Boring, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Which would explain why their second consecutive home game
produced another disappointing crowd, but that will change.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lock that no apathy will surround their next home game.
Notre Dame will pay a visit, and no matter how you feel about the
Irish, it was a stroke of good fortune that they rallied to beat
Purdue on Saturday. Bottom line is, the Sun Devils need as many
quality-of-schedule points as they can get.
</P>
<P>
   They also need a big victory. And before Notre Dame, there's a
crucial game at USC. If the Sun Devils can beat the Trojans in the
Coliseum, they will climb back into the polls, back into national
consciousness, back into the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, a half-effort won't get it done. And by now, a
quality team with a top-20 coach should be able to get it right. On
both sides of the ball. &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Receiver  &UR; Lenzie Jackson saw progress from
Arizona State's offense Saturday night, but that doesn't mean he
was satisfied with the Sun Devils' performance in a 24-3 victory
over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ASU lacked an offensive rhythm for much of the game, and the
passing game doesn't appear nearly as good as it was in the season
opener against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Ryan Kealy, who was not available for comment after
the game, completed only 12 of 27 passes for 173 yards. He passed
for two touchdowns and was intercepted once. In the third quarter,
he was 0 for 4 with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually hit those passes in practice,'' Jackson said. ``I
don't think anybody on offense is completely happy with where we
are.'' &QL; 
Cherry bomb &QL; 
Cornerback  &UR; J'Juan Cherry left a trail of yellow flags behind him
in the first half Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry was penalized four times, twice for pass interference,
once for holding and once for grabbing an Oregon State player's
face mask.
</P>
<P>
   The four penalties cost ASU 47 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, a junior, was a backup last season. He earned a
reputation then for his aggressive play, but he also crossed the
line occasionally and was called for several penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry's performance Saturday wasn't all bad, however. He was
instrumental in stopping the Beavers from scoring a touchdown late
in the first quarter. On third and 7 at the ASU 12, Cherry batted
down a pass to  &UR; Tim Alexander that, if completed, would have given
the Beavers a first and goal.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry wasn't alone in his penchant for being penalized. The Sun
Devils were penalized 12 times for 128 yards. One of those included
a late hit by safety
 &UR; Mitchell Freedman, who belted Oregon State quarterback  &UR; Terrance
Bryant after he had run out of bounds. Those types of mistakes are
becoming commonplace for Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the ball &QL; 
ASU running back  &UR; J.R. Redmond fumbled twice Saturday, continuing a
troubling trend for the junior. In four games, Redmond has fumbled
five times.
</P>
<P>
   One of his fumbles Saturday proved costly. In the second
quarter, ASU had a third and 2 at the Oregon State 11 when Redmond
fumbled as he was tackled just short of the first down. The Beavers
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Quick kicks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting sophomore defensive end  &UR; Quincy  &UR; Yancy suffered a mild
concussion in the first half and did not return. His prognosis is

   &UR; Levi Jones, a redshirt freshman, replaced Yancy.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver  &UR; Tariq McDonald, a sophomore, caught four passes, a

for 86 yards, career highs in both categories. &QL;

DEFENSE WAKES UP, PAVES WAY FOR DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Yes, it was Oregon State, but not your older
brother's Oregon State, not the Pac-10 doormat. The Beavers have
become competitive, and their 2-1 record equaled the program's
average number of victories in the 1990s. Now they are merely a
throw rug.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Arizona State's defense was in no position to judge
anyone but itself, and it had been a harsh judgment. Going into
Saturday's game at Sun Devil Stadium, ASU was ninth in scoring
defense and eighth in total defense in the conference. Each of its
three previous opponents, Washington, Brigham Young and even North
Texas, produced many points and/or yards at the Sun Devils'
expense.
</P>
<P>
   So it was of some note if not a sign of progress that on a night
the Sun Devils' best plays on offense came on punts (roughing the
kicker on fourth and 34, and a muff), the defense made the
difference in the 24-3 ASU victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to,'' said linebacker Adam Archuleta, who was in on 11
tackles, recovered a fumble and had a sack. ``We hadn't stopped
anyone yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils put in a slight wrinkle, using two linebackers
and five defensive backs. They swarmed, stuffed and punished a
Beavers offense that is not Nebraska, but not Kansas State's weekly
selection from the pastry cart, either.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers thrived. Archuleta and Joe Cesta had solid
games, their best of the season, with strong support from the front
four and secondary. Cornerback J'Juan Cherry had seven unassisted
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta, a 6-foot, 202-pound junior from Chandler High School,
had the type of performance he was waiting for after laboring in
the shadow of Pat Tillman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest thing has been confidence,'' he said. ``Following
Pat, everyone was saying, `This guy's too small,' or `He has big
shoes to fill.' I was looking for a confidence booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I had the ability. I knew I could play. But it's
hard when you haven't played in this league. I know I'll get
better. But I can't play like a normal, rock 'em, sock 'em
linebacker. Everyone looks at me and and thinks, `Who's this skinny
kid playing linebacker?' Everyone wants Andy Katzenmoyer, not a
little guy like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers' Ken Simonton probably wants no part of Archuleta,
or the rest of the Sun Devils. A fireplug of a redshirt freshman at
5 feet 8, 181 pounds, he came in as the only Pac-10 running back
averaging more than 100 yards a game on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the missing linebacker and four 300-pounders on
his offensive line, Simonton in the first half ran eight times for
five yards, a crisp 0.6 yards per carry. The Beavers didn't get a
first down rushing until the final minute of the third quarter, a
quarter in which Simonton's average rocketed to 1.5. He finished
with 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After it became clear Simonton was going nowhere, Oregon State
Coach Mike Riley placed the game in the hands of his left-handed
quarterback, Terrance Bryant. A junior college transfer, Bryant has
a strong arm, which he often shows off by overthrowing receivers.
He completed an ineffectual 29 of 50 passes for 198 yards, dogged
by the Sun Devils' most forceful line surge of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was telling us we have so much talent on defense,''
said end Erik Flowers, a transfer from Trinity Valley Community
College in Texas, who got his first sack. ``Now it's time to use
it.''  &QL;

MORAN, COOPER HELP NAU COAST TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - Who were these guys and why were they here?
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona came up with the perfect homecoming opponent
Saturday, and the Lumberjacks toyed with Western State en route to
a 28-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The win before an announced crowd of 11,616 over the Division II
school from Gunnison, Colo., with 2,500 students didn't prove a
whole lot, but it gave NAU the opportunity to do a little
experimenting and tinkering, mixing and matching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the other school doesn't matter,'' said NAU safety
Raymond Perryman, who got in some huge hits. ``We regard all teams
highly. We won't step down our tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jerome Souers was able to pick up a few insights along the
way that might prove beneficial when NAU (3-1) returns to Big Sky
play next week. He learned, for example, that versatile David
Moran, a safety who wanted to be a receiver, makes a pretty good
quarterback, and that running back Tavon Cooper is back to full
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Moran played quarterback the entire second half, subbing for
Clay Brown, who suffered a bruised knee. Clay Brown became the
starter two weeks ago when Travis Brown was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Moran has been taking snaps for only 2{ weeks, and his numbers
weren't spectacular. But he threw a touchdown pass and ran for
another, and he made some significant plays at opportune times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what's going to happen next week,'' said Moran, a
transfer from Oregon State who played high school football for
Prescott Valley Bradshaw Mountain. ``I knew I'd be playing a half
tonight. But I love defense, and I like to hit and run up and down
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest contribution came on a fourth and 3 from the Western
State 35. He ran a keeper, got two blocks, and ran for 24 yards,
setting up his own touchdown a bit later, also on fourth down. That
upped the Lumberjacks' lead to 21-3, and they coasted from there.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper got his first full-time action after a shoulder injury,
and the former Peoria High School star ran for 107 yards on 22
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's joy at being able to run without worrying about the
shoulder injury that he suffered in the season opener was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great to be healthy,'' he said. ``Being as competitive
as I am, just sitting on the bench is really hard. I had to go. The
feeling is just awesome. Our line did a great job, and I think this
kind of a game will help us after losing last week.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU scored its first two touchdowns on short runs by Kevin
Shelton and led, 14-0, at the break. They built up a 28-3 margin
before Western closed out the game with a pair of field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers (1-2) managed 225 total yards to NAU's 341. The
NAU defense recorded five sacks, giving it 21 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Souers said the Lumberjacks achieved their goal of better
offensive execution. The opponent, whom he credited with playing
hard throughout the game, came at the right spot in the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was good for us for a lot of reasons,'' Souers said.
``We were missing people, so we had to play a lot of new guys, so
this can really help us play better later. Our guys did a lot of
good things that we are excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to elevate our play . . . and the better we get, the
more fun we will be to watch.'' &QL;

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

   &UR; The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her
American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Fadiman. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13.
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant child's harrowing medical crisis ignites a series
of mutual misunderstandings between decent, well-meaning physicians
in Merced, Calif., and a loving family barely removed from their
tribal roots in Laos. ``This fine book recounts a poignant
tragedy,'' Melvin Konner said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lost Man's River &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Matthiessen. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The author's second novel in a proposed trilogy about the
Everglades is narrated by Lucius Watson, a self-doubting loner who
embarks late in life on a quest to uncover the complicated truth
about his murdered father -- and himself. His research turns up all
sorts of dim facts and slippery memories that gradually reveal a
vast web of kinship involving families whose fortunes and
misfortunes are mirrored in the history of the state. In 1997 our
reviewer, Janet Burroway, called this ``a project of enormous
ambition'' and praised the author's ``perfect ear for the cadences
of Southern speech.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bright College Years: Inside the American Campus Today &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Matthews. University of Chicago, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the author witnessed the full-scale canon wars being
fought at the convention of the Modern Language Association; five
years later, she returned to find the wars over and the academics
for the most part happily defanged. ``Matthews is a good
storyteller and reading this book is marvelously soothing,''
Larissa MacFarquhar wrote in these pages last year. A far gloomier
critique of contemporary university life is found in  &UR; Tenured
Radicals: How Politics Has Corrupted Our Higher Education &LR; , by
Roger Kimball (Elephant/Ivan R. Dee, $12.95), a 1990 call to arms
that has been revised and includes a new introduction. In building
his case that the student protesters of the 1960s have become
today's professors of women's studies, homosexual studies and other
newfangled studies, Kimball ``has dished it out beautifully,''
Roger Rosenblatt said here eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pandaemonium &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Leslie Epstein. St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This Hollywood novel set during World War II is populated by
dreamy European exiles caught between the Old World and the New,
between heaven and hell. Its narrator is a fictionalized Peter
Lorre, once a Viennese esthete but now a B-movie actor living on
drugs and possibilities. In 1997 in these pages, David Freeman
admired the ``exuberant mixture of high art and low comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Louis de Bernires. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In an imaginary South American city, a demon-plagued cardinal
tries to save souls by persuading people to get religion and then
killing them before they have a chance to change their minds. In
1994 in the Book Review, James Polk called this a ``wondrous
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Gay Metropolis: 1940-1996 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Kaiser. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In chronicling the progress of homosexuals in overcoming
prejudice and gaining acceptance, a journalist focuses on New York
City, the main postwar destination for gay people seeking a life
without shame. Last year our reviewer, Phillip Lopate, called this
``a generously stocked'' social history with ``fascinating, curious
side trips.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Chin Kiss King &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ana Veciana-Suarez. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel revolves around a young Cuban-American woman
who turns to her mother and grandmother for support after giving
birth to a handicapped infant. ``Veciana-Suarez's quirky approach
is a great success,'' Jim Gladstone said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited and with commentary by Michael R. Beschloss.
Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyndon B. Johnson who emerges from this selection of
conversations taped during his first nine months in the Oval Office
is a master of flattery, manipulation and insincerity -- a volcanic
presence capable of both large vision and great pettiness. The book
is ``superbly edited and annotated,'' Alan Brinkley wrote in the
Book Review last year.  &UR; Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert
Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade &LR; , by Jeff Shesol
(Norton, $17.95), focuses on the longstanding bad blood between two
feisty figures who sought to control the Democratic Party during a
crucial period. In 1997 our reviewer, David M. Oshinsky, called
this ``a penetrating and richly detailed account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Girls in the Grass: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Melanie Rae Thon. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 tales in this collection revolve around themes of
despair, guilt, pain and desire, typically expressed in the
yearnings of adolescents. ``The reader is swept along not only by
Thon's remarkable characterizations but also by the taut, magic
current of her prose,'' Constance Decker Thompson wrote here in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Secret Book of Grazia dei Rossi &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jacqueline Park. Scribner, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel unfolds in the diary of a daughter of a wealthy
Jewish family in Renaissance Italy who discusses everything from
medicine to mysticism in an age of political corruption and
religious intolerance. ``Park has fashioned a dense, sweeping
narrative,'' Lauren Belfer said here last year.

</P>
<P>
   RIDERS _ WASHINGTON _ In what has become an annual congressional
struggle, Democrats and Republicans, environmentalists and
regulated interests are going down to the wire over ``riders'' that
have been attached to the Interior Department's appropriation for
next year. These amendments would weaken or at least change various
existing environmental laws. Environmental groups hate them and
President Clinton has promised to veto them, with support among
most congressional Democrats and a few Republicans. With fiscal
1999 beginning Thursday, a Clinton veto over environmental riders
could end up shutting down the government, or much of it. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service).

EUROPEANS HAIL KOHL'S HISTORICAL ROLE, EXPRESS CONFIDENCE IN
SCHROEDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-VOTE, GERMANY-REACT, GERMANY-KOHL.) 
(lh) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ European leaders marked the end of an era Sunday,
congratulating both Gerhard Schroeder and Helmut Kohl, the man he
defeated after 16 years as chancellor in Germany's elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France, a conservative like Kohl,
and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose fellow Socialists saw in
the victory of Schroeder's Social Democrats a continuation of a
European trend that brought them and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party to power last year, paid tribute to both in
almost equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   Both hailed Kohl's historic role in consolidating European unity
after German reunification in 1990, and expressed confidence that
Schroeder would carry on in the same tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, in Blackpool, England, for a Labor Party convention,
telephoned Schroeder to congratulate him and told reporters later,
``It's a tremendous thing that we will now see center-left
government in Britain, France and Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay tribute to Helmut Kohl for all of the things he has done
for Europe,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, whose Labor
government was turned out by voters there in 1996, said of Kohl,
``He did an outstanding job uniting Europe and making Germany a
part of Europe instead of the previous attempt to make Europe a
part of Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has its own rules, and it was apparently time to
change guards,'' Peres said. ``I want to express my deepest thanks
to Chancellor Kohl and congratulate Gerhard Schroeder as a friend,
a leader and a man upon whose shoulders rest great
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the conservative government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was confident of continued close
relations with Schroeder as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   A turn by German voters to the left after a generation marked a
historic turning point that was not so much about ideology as about
German self-confidence and assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change has already taken place,'' French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said the other day. ``It's a different Germany from
the one we knew from 1949 to 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant was that, more than half a century after the end
of World War II, Germans no longer feel the need to buy
respectability as partners in the building of Europe. They feel
they have earned it, by their performance as the economic
powerhouse of the continent, as good neighbors to all nine of the
countries on their borders, as allies with the United States and
Britain within NATO, and as supportive partners of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Never before in its history had Germany enjoyed good relations
with all these countries at once, Kohl kept telling voters during
his campaign, and Schroeder did not contest the achievement.
Germany, both men clearly agreed, could now pursue its legitimate
national interests within Europe freed of the complexes that
inhibited it in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, Kohl's government surprised its European partners at a
summit meeting in Amsterdam, Netherlands, last year by announcing
that Germany was no longer willing to be taken for granted as the
rich uncle of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Even with only 15 members, Europe is strained to its financial
limits. But if Poland and Hungary were admitted tomorrow, the
common agricultural policy by which industrial Germany agreed to
support French farmers in exchange for access to the Common Market
in 1957 would bankrupt Europe as it currently operates.
</P>
<P>
   And Germany has made clear it will not go on paying unless the
rules are rewritten more equitably. ``The Germans are still good
Europeans, but they don't give anything away any more,'' Vedrine
said. ``We defend French interests with great energy, as the
British defend theirs, and the Germans are becoming more like us.''
</P>
<P>
   With only Italy among major European states now governed by
conservative parties, there were also those who saw the chance for
a new, coordinated European approach to the intractable problems of
unemployment and instability in global financial markets in
Schroeder's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Schroeder's victory could ge seen as a victory for
European social democracy, Jack Lang, a French Socialist who
campaigned for him in Germany, agreed, adding, ``There's a great
chance to give new dynamism to a Europe that has been a bit in the
doldrums recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria's Social Democratic chancellor, Victor Klima, described
the German election result as a ``historic success'' for Social
Democrats but also ``a success for a Europe of employment, a
success for a Europe with more social justice and a success for a
Europe of social democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, expressed ``respect and thanks to a truly great
European, Helmut Kohl.''

`TWO CITIES': STYLISTIC VIRTUOSITY; DISTORTED HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his previous novels and essays, John Edgar Wideman has
engaged in an extended exploration of that most American of
subjects: racial and personal identity hammered out inside the
menacing margins of urban life. What has also distinguished Wideman
as a voice in American letters is the vigor of his style. This is a
writer of an especially dense and musical quality whose prose is a
harmonic blending of high and low, of the music of the streets and
the music of the spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman's new novel is ``Two Cities,'' a book that strikes many
of the same themes as his earlier work and is written with his
usual stylistic virtuosity. It tells the intertwining stories of
three vividly portrayed characters who grope toward a kind of
familial refuge from the surrounding darkness and degradation of
American life.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Two Cities'' is also an angry and intemperate book, so
focused on that darkness and degradation as to be demagogic in its
effect: exaggeratedly negative in its vision of American life and
therefore politically reductive as well. There is no doubting
Wideman's writerly craft or his remarkable ear for black American
cadences and jive. From those points of view, ``Two Cities'' is a
great pleasure. What is troubling is its use of a kind of distorted
history to substantiate a veritably cultish, mythic vision.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is told in the separate, intercutting voices of three
main characters who alternate with a more conventional narrator in
the telling of what is really a love story. The central figure is
Kassima, an attractive young woman who lives in protective retreat
following the deaths, in a single year, of her husband (of AIDS in
prison) and her two sons (in gang violence on Pittsburgh's
streets). One night, feeling restless and needy, she goes to a bar
where she is picked up by Robert Jones, a ``nice man'' of middle
age who has left behind an earlier family but grown wise with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Kassima, as it turns out, lives in the neighborhood where Robert
grew up, possibly in the same house on Cassina Way in Pittsburgh.
For Robert, in other words, finding Kassima is a homecoming of
sorts, a chance to do things right. But one day, Robert almost gets
into a fight with the .357 Magnum-wielding satrap of a local
basketball court. Kassima is so terrorized by the prospect of
another loss that she abandons her nascent attachment and returns
to protective mourning. ``Won't never be my head on a tray you can
just take with you when you decide to go down,'' she tells Robert
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Kassima has a boarder in her house named Mallory, an eccentric,
aging, unwell World War II veteran who travels around Pittsburgh
with a camera in a shopping bag recording the passing scene. He
emerges as a kind of chorus to the love affair of Kassima and
Robert, a common-man commentator on surrounding events, a
rememberer of the things past that brought matters to their current
bleak state. Mallory and Kassima become friends. When one day he
crawls into her bed and dies, leaving her his boxes of photographs
and negatives with instructions that she burn the lot of them, she
turns to Robert for help.
</P>
<P>
   That is the essential story, but Wideman weaves a tapestry of
American life tightly around it, telling stories reminiscent of the
Homewood trilogy, a set of earlier novels set in the neighborhood
in West Pittsburgh where Wideman grew up. Mallory also provides a
kind of atmosphere, an attitude about the surrounding society
through his experiences. There are encounters with gang members,
who are presented without apology as swaggering terrorists. Mallory
remembers being a soldier in World War II and being almost gunned
down in a racist attack by fellow soldiers after he and a buddy
went on a sensuous picnic with two Italian women.
</P>
<P>
   More important are Mallory's nostalgic memories of John Africa,
the leader of Move, the radical group whose members were killed by
the Philadelphia police in a well-publicized episode of official
brutality in 1985. John Africa, whose real name was Vincent
Leaphart, is seen by Mallory _ and, it would seem, by Wideman as
well _ as a kind of departed saint whose death at the hands of the
authorities was a kind of martyrdom. Wideman's evocation of John
Africa is razor sharp, but it is also where this novel takes on the
feel of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   A first clash between the police and Move was in 1978, resulting
in the death of a policeman and murder convictions for the group's
members who were in the raided house. ``The way the Nazis killed a
hundred hostages for every German soldier the partisans ambushed,''
is Mallory's ill-conceived comparative thought on that incident.
Several years later, police actually firebombed the Move home on
Osage Avenue, killing all 11 people inside, including some
children. ``A span of years, a span of prisoners reaching backward
and forward,'' Mallory thinks, ``one arc of suffering and loss and
the world too small to hold the lamentations.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that the John Africa presented here as a
near- saintly figure seemed in real life to have been something of
a madman, more a cult leader than a civil rights sage. He eschewed
medicine, bathing and electricity. Neighbors complained to the
police about garbage and rodents and the group's practice of
broadcasting anarchist harangues over loudspeakers at night. None
of this background is noted in ``Two Cities.'' The Move members
were also heavily armed.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman's book is, of course, a novel not a history, but it is a
novel that uses history to present his main characters' striving to
carve out a circle of sanity in a landscape of almost total moral
and spiritual debasement. In the final passages in the novel, the
characters are almost destroyed by full-scale gang warfare erupting
in the funeral home where Mallory's body rests.
</P>
<P>
   These final passages, like much else in ``Two Cities,'' are
lyrically rendered by Wideman but they are so lurid as to be
cartoonish in effect. They also represent the deeply demoralized of
American life that is at this novel's heart.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The question stings for the estimated 726th billionth time.
</P>
<P>
   When will historian Edmund Morris publish his epic, authorized
biography of Ronald Reagan, a high-profile project 13 years in
preparation, composed in longhand with a green marbled Eversharp
fountain pen on lined paper and written with such an unconventional
strategy that the book's publishers are loath to reveal details.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the former president's official biographer, calculates
that he has been needled with the question 726,354,925,267 times, a
figure he cites in a personal essay that was published in the fall
issue of Forbes FYI magazine with a subheading, ``His Biography Is
Finished (So Stop Asking!).''
</P>
<P>
   Ask again. The current answer from the book's patient publisher,
Random House, is that the long-awaited biography _ or, more
precisely, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' _ is not finished,
and that the company has delayed October plans to ship copies of
the work it recently promoted as the ``most anticipated book of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really far along,'' said Ann Godoff, the president and
editor in chief of Random House. ``There were just some additions
to the material. It's delayed, but I'm not sure by how much. It
depends on copy editing. The guy has been working on it for 13
years, and it's really a question of getting it exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Morris said, ``The book's been delayed because of the
fanatical perfectionism of the neurotic author.'' He said he was
trimming and polishing the book, which was originally scheduled for
publication seven years ago. ``If I had my druthers, I would spend
the rest of my life perfecting it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he remained eager for publication.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Morris and his publisher have been reluctant to
characterize in great detail the book, a project that traces some
of its early beginnings to an intimate Georgetown dinner that
brought together a group of historians, including Morris, and the
president and Nancy Reagan to ponder the delicate work and role of
biographers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godoff declined to discuss the specific nature of the
manuscript, and so did Robert Loomis, Morris' editor, who through a
spokeswoman said that he was prevented from discussing the contents
because of the company's exclusive contract with Newsweek to run an
excerpt of the book.
</P>
<P>
   But Loomis made obvious hints that the book was not a standard
biography in an appearance in September 1997 on C-Span's ``About
Books'' program when he remarked that he had just finished reading
the last chapter. ``He's got a new idea about how to write this
book, which I don't want to talk about right now, which is
controversial, but it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing to characterize the years of effort, Loomis, a veteran
Random House editor, said, ``It's been not troubled exactly, but
he's worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A person in publishing circles, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that at one point during the long writing process
Morris, 58, inserted himself as an imaginary young contemporary of
Reagan, observing and witnessing Reagan's early childhood in
Illinois. Someone else, who read the manuscript, said Morris had
adjusted his own age within the text in order to surface as an
observer during Reagan's acting days in Hollywood in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview if he had used such a literary technique,
Morris paused and then declined to address the question. ``I don't
think I want to comment about the book,'' he said. ``I feel it's
premature, and it's still being rewritten. The book will explain
itself when it's published, and the book is _ I repeat _ changing
even as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the brief catalogue copy promoting the book simply says,
``Morris has transcended the conventional bounds of biography _
presenting the story through a unique first-person narrative, which
gives this chronicle an almost photographic immediacy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Morris describes the book that has so long
occupied his life as ``simply a memoir of Ronald Reagan.'' He said
that he himself emerges not as a character in the book, but as a
``biographer who had unique access to the subject.'' He added, ``I
don't think there's ever been a presidential biographer who has
been able to see his subject's life happening as a close
eyewitness.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he does appear as an imaginary character in the
president's childhood, Morris replied: ``I'm me, but I'm a
biographer. I'm the biographer perceiving Reagan and the things
that I personally discover. For example, I come across a batch of
his teen-age and student papers, and I'm able to deduce Reagan's
imaginary life and the only way I can convey this is by talking
about the literary detection.''
</P>
<P>
   This technique is a departure from the more traditional
biography of Theodore Roosevelt that won Morris a Pulitzer Prize
and attracted the attention of legacy-minded Reagan administration
officials and supporters who admired the biographer's work and
sought to match him with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for the book for a long time because I think
Edmund is a superb writer,'' said Michael Deaver, a former top aide
to Reagan. ``If you look at his Theodore Roosevelt biography, it's
beautifully written.''
</P>
<P>
   As former members of the Reagan administration recall it, Reagan
and his wife settled on Morris as the official biographer some time
after Mark Hatfield, then a senator from Oregon, was host at a
dinner in the early 1980s at his Georgetown home with guests that
included President and Mrs. Reagan, Morris and three other
presidential historians, including George Nash and Arthur Link.
Over a meal of lemon piccata chicken, the group sat around a dining
room table on a snowy Valentine's Day while each biographer
described his efforts to explore the life of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The historians were not there auditioning as candidates to write
a biography, Hatfield said, but to formally discuss the often
difficult process of documenting the presidency. The authors urged
the Reagans to save every scrap of paper and to remember the
thoughts that led to their actions, Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all very much of the opinion that some kind of time
with a president would have meant so much more to them and would
have been much more helpful to the observation role that they would
play,'' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, Reagan responded to those suggestions, eventually
allowing Morris such unprecedented access that a former Reagan
speech writer, Anthony Dolan, remembered ``looking over at the
senior staff in the morning and Edmund would be sitting there.''
Dolan added: ``And he saw Ronald Reagan for long chats whenever he
wanted, and it was really up to Reagan whether he was forthcoming
in those talks. Edmund got to attend almost every meeting that he
chose.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's latest delay does not particularly faze many former
Reagan administration officials or supporters who enthusiastically
participated in the effort. Deaver, for instance, said it was
probably a difficult task to write a biography of Reagan, the man,
since ``he's such a private person.''
</P>
<P>
   At Reagan's office in Century City, Calif., his chief of staff,
Joanne Drake, said diplomatically: ``We expected it years ago. I
guess we'll see it when we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyn Nofziger, the former Reagan aide, said that his interest
in the book had waned some with time. ``I've had a number of people
ask me whatever happened to Edmund Morris and his book,'' he said,
adding, ``I don't think it's eagerly anticipated anymore because
most people have forgotten about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield, who organized the dinner for the Reagans and the
biographers, said he had stopped asking Morris for status reports
about the book. ``I could tell it was not a question that he
enjoyed commenting on,'' said Hatfield, who added, ``I'm 76, and I
want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate result of the latest delay is that Random
House will miss a peak holiday buying season to sell the book along
with incurring the costs of tying up $3 million in advance money
for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Woll, the president of Cross River Publishing Consultants
and the author of ``Publishing for Profit,'' said that with a
standard contract the interest incurred on a $3 million advance
over 13 years would amount to more than $2.1 million. With the long
passage of time, the publisher has to sell even more books to make
back its money, he said. And in this case, he estimated that Random
House would have to sell more than 800,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have gotten it before Christmas,'' said
Ms. Godoff, Random House's president. ``That would obviously have
made a difference to us.'' But she added: ``With a serious book,
there's always another season, particularly with a book like this
because it's been so long in the doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Morris pointed out, it has taken time to get to know his
subject and to develop understanding. He needed time for writing.
(His wife, Sylvia Jukes Morris, worked 15 years on her biography of
Clare Boothe Luce.) Then there was the rewriting, polishing,
editing. Morris quoted Anatole France to describe the process, ``A
work of art is never finished, only abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he was overly optimistic when he wrote his essay
for Forbes FYI announcing the completion of his project. ``I wrote
the article in the summer, and writers always think they're going
to be finished before they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, he also quotes Ronald Reagan, who gave him a
White House photograph of the two of them shaking hands at some
black-tie affair. Inscribed in the president's hand is a variation
on the same old question that stings: ``What are you doing here?
Why aren't you writing?''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges will press inland Monday, after battering
parts of the central Gulf Coast with wind gusts over 100 mile an
hour and a storm surge resulting in tides more than 10 feet above
normal. Winds and seas will gradually subside later Monday as the
hurricane's circulation weakens over land. Torrential rainfall will
then become the primary threat.
</P>
<P>
   Weak steering currents in the middle levels of the atmosphere
will propel Hurricane Georges at less than 10 miles an hour Monday,
and the storm could even stall for a time. Drenching rains will
fall near and to the east of the hurricane's center. Flooding is
expected as some areas receive more than 10 to 20 inches of rain.
Bands of tropical downpours and bursts of wind will spiral
counter-clockwise hundreds of miles from the center of the
hurricane. Some of these squalls are capable of producing isolated
tornadoes over parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, eastern
Georgia and the Florida panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will move south from the Middle Atlantic states.
Scattered thunder will precede the front from southern Virginia to
the Carolinas. Meanwhile, breezes from the northwest will deliver
cooler and drier air to the Northeast and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of moist air will activate thundershowers over the
central and southern Rockies. Scattered strong storms will also
form in the central Plains. Over California, a meandering pool of
very chilly air near 18,000 feet will sponsor pockets of showers
from the central coast to the northern Sierra. Tranquil weather
will embrace much of the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Storm Surge
</P>
<P>
   While the winds around a strong hurricane can cause considerable
damage, the storm's most dangerous part is water. As the hurricane
nears land, water is pushed toward the coast on the storm's
right-forward flank by fierce onshore winds. As the bottom becomes
more shallow, water being shoved ashore piles up, causing an
abnormal rise in sea level. Called the storm surge, this sudden
rise can reach heights up to 30 feet. Battering waves ride atop the
surge. This formidable wall of water can level houses and small
buildings. Storm surges swell when they occur at the time of normal
high tides.

LOANS BEING ASSEMBLED IN EFFORT TO SHIELD BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also filed in ``i'' news file) 
(mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration and the International Monetary
Fund taking the lead, a package of loans for Brazil, likely to
total more than $30 billion, is gradually being put together to
limit the damage from the Asian crisis to Latin America's biggest
economy. But the bailout plan is a calculated risk: Rather than
save Brazil, it could sink the country into deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for Americans are considerable. The huge Brazilian
economy dominates Latin America, which in turn purchases nearly 20
percent of America's exports and is host to thousands of
American-owned factories, whose sales and profits contribute
significantly to corporate America's bottom line. A sharp cutback
in the flow of all this income, coming on top of a similar blow
from the Asian crisis, might reduce economic growth in the United
States to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Asia and Russia have been flattened, Brazil is suddenly
the new front line in the struggle to halt the spreading financial
crisis, with its power to pull down markets and plunge countries
into recession. If Brazil goes down, then Europe or the United
States would become the next battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear from the statements being made by top
officials in the Clinton administration that Brazil is fundamental
to the system,'' said Desmond Lachman, an economist at Salomon
Smith Barney, a Wall Street firm with money at risk in Brazil.
``There is just no way they can allow Brazil to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole purpose of the proposed loan package is to preserve
the present value of the Brazilian currency _ the real _ avoiding
the steep devaluations that have been so ruinous in Asia. Because
Brazil spends much more on imports and other overseas purchases
than it earns from exports, it must finance these overseas
purchases by continually borrowing money abroad. That is not easy,
given that foreign lenders are increasingly nervous about putting
money into any country showing signs of difficulty. Since
mid-summer, these lenders have gradually withdrawn money from
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the huge loan package will reverse these
withdrawals, particularly if it is combined with austerity measures
already initiated by Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Confidence in the Brazilian economy would revive and fresh foreign
money would enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   But obstacles are looming. The U.S. government, for example,
might participate in the proposed loan package. But rather than ask
Congress for the money, the Clinton administration might ask the
Federal Reserve to make the loan from its resources, or it might
tap the same emergency fund that it used in 1994 to help Mexico
through its crisis. Both possibilities are reported to have arisen
in the preliminary loan discussions. And both are likely to draw
the ire of Republicans in Congress, who challenged the
administration in 1994 for risking taxpayer money without
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Private sector lenders are also being asked to participate, and
some are clearly reluctant. ``Anything that boosts confidence in
emerging markets we would regard as positive,'' said Andrew Tuck, a
Chase Manhattan spokesman. ``But as far as stepping up to the plate
and putting up more money, we have $4.3 billion outstanding in
Brazil already, and we cannot dig into our pockets every time
someone asks for a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed loan package would be openly negotiated only after
next Sunday's presidential election in Brazil, and only if _ as
expected _ Cardoso is re-elected. Nevertheless, a senior Clinton
administration official acknowledged on Friday that active
discussions are already in progress with the Brazilians, the IMF,
other governments and private sector lenders. He added, however,
that ``the speculation about the contents of a package are way
ahead of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary loan package, according to interviews with
people involved in the talks, has taken this form: The IMF would
put up $10 billion or so, borrowing the money itself if its
existing reserve is inadequate. The World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank would add roughly $5 billion
apiece. The governments of the largest industrial countries, or
some of them, would each contribute sizable, but so far unspecified
amounts. And when these loans were in place, the private sector
lenders, as a demonstration of their confidence in Brazil, would
agree to roll over existing loans, and add roughly $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a giant loan package may not be sufficient to save the
Brazilian economy, even if it is combined with the sort of cutbacks
in government spending that Cardoso has already initiated. The
Brazilian real must also be devalued, this argument goes, by 15
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the real is overvalued. An American-made
toothbrush that sells in the United States for perhaps $1, sells in
Brazil for the equivalent of 75 cents, while a Brazilian-made
toothbrush sells in both Brazil and the United States for more than
$1. No wonder foreign goods flood into Brazil, swamping Brazilian
exports. No wonder there is so much demand for foreign loans to
finance the resulting trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more outspoken on this issue than Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard Institute for International Development,
and a persistent critic of IMF practices. The proposed loan package
is fine, he says. So are Cardoso's austerity measures. But neither
will work without a 25 percent devaluation of the real. Many
economists agree with Sachs in principle, but favor a smaller
devaluation, say 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilians are suffering today from slow economic
growth,'' Sachs said, ``in part because they have been trying for
months to defend an over-valued currency.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is interest rates. In the midst of a worldwide
financial crisis, foreign banks and other foreign lenders have
grown increasingly reluctant to put money in a country that might
soon have to devalue its currency. Brazil's hard currency reserves
have dwindled to $50 billion from $75 billion in recent months as
foreign money is withdrawn from the country. And part of the $50
billion could soon depart, as repayment for $49 billion in loans
from foreign banks that have come due this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To keep the money in the country _ and also discourage
Brazilians from converting their reales to dollars and depositing
billions abroad _ Cardoso has doubled interest rates since
midsummer, to more than 40 percent. At so high a level, Sachs
argues, economic activity is discouraged and the already sluggish
Brazilian economy will soon find itself in a severe recession.
Devalue the currency, he says, and interest rates can be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and the Clinton administration are counting on the giant
loan package, along with Cardoso's spending cutbacks and the high
Brazilian interest rates to restore the confidence of foreign
lenders before a recession can take hold. They resist devaluation
on two other counts. It would end Brazil's fixed exchange rate, and
that could frighten Argentina, and even Hong Kong _ two other
countries still keeping to fixed rates.
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, while the real may indeed be overvalued, any
attempt at a limited devaluation could get out of hand in the
current panicky environment. The real would then plunge in value,
bringing the Asian crisis full-force to Latin America.

ADVERTISING: SPRINT'S SUDDEN SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sprint Corp. has unexpectedly dismissed J. Walter
Thompson San Francisco after 17 years and moved most duties for
consumer advertising, with billings estimated at $150 million, to
McCann-Erickson New York.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt change, made on Friday without a review, underscores
the ferment in the telecommunications industry as competition
intensifies among Sprint, AT&AMP;T Corp. and the newly formed MCI
Worldcom Inc., the company that resulted from Worldcom's recently
completed acquisition of MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint shuffle involves work for the long distance and local
telephone divisions, including the well-known campaigns to promote
the Sprint Sense dime-a-minute calling plan. The switch exemplifies
just how suddenly and swiftly many long-term relationships between
big marketers and agencies are ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the midst of planning quite significant changes in
how we handled Sprint,'' said Chris Jones, chief executive of J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC in New York, ``and we
had a presentation locked and loaded in the computer'' to be shown
to Sprint executives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives never saw it, he added, because when they
arrived at Thompson ``they said, `Before you make this
presentation, we've got to tell you something.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the only example on Friday of the fragility of
longtime client-agency relations. At the same time that Thompson
lost the bulk of its Sprint account to McCann-Erickson New York,
McCann-Erickson New York was dismissed by Nabisco Inc. after 12
years of handling advertising for domestic cracker brands like
Triscuit and Wheat Thins. Those duties, with billings estimated at
more than $20 million, were moved _ oddly enough _ to the Chicago
office of Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   For Sprint, the change in consumer agencies comes as the company
undertakes an ambitious effort to redefine itself as a full-service
provider of communications services rather than simply a purveyor
of long distance calling plans, the aspect of its business that
Thompson San Francisco had long promoted in ads featuring Candice
Bergen. Interestingly, Sprint and Ms. Bergen had agreed to end her
endorsement deal on Sept. 18, after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ``helped us build the consumer long distance brand,''
said Tom Kessler, assistant vice president for marketing at the
Sprint consumer services group in Kansas City, Mo., but now ``we're
looking to evolve our advertising in a broader direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've concluded that McCann-Erickson, with their relevant
industry experience and recent proven results for companies such as
Mastercard, Motorola and Gateway 2000, can help us strengthen our
brand position,'' he added, ``as we pursue new markets, achieve new
sales and attract new customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``industry experience'' describes the campaigns
McCann-Erickson created for AT&AMP;T in categories like
business-to-business and wireless advertising. AT&AMP;T dismissed
McCann-Erickson in November to consolidate assignments at its two
other New York roster agencies, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding and Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson is ``thrilled'' to be ``back in the
telecommunications business,'' said Don Dillon, president and
regional director for McCann-Erickson North America, who also
oversees McCann-Erickson New York. The agency _part of the
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of McCann-Erickson World
Group, which is owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. _ has been on a
new-business hot streak, landing more than $2.5 billion in added
billings since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of telecommunications has never been more complex or
more complicated,'' Dillon said, ``and the assumption is that it
will only continue. Every company is being challenged to compete as
never before.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Thompson San Francisco had been the lead Sprint agency,
Sprint executives approached McCann-Erickson early this year for a
project, he added, after ``Sprint asked Draft, our sister agency,
to be introduced to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's reference was to Draft Worldwide in Chicago, which
handles direct marketing aimed at retaining present long-distance
customers for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Another McCann unit, McCann Relationship Marketing, will now
handle direct marketing campaigns aimed at attracting new Sprint
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The project for Sprint ``resulted in some commercial
presentations that never aired,'' Dillon said, as well as a project
for a football spot ``that will run a few weeks from now.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the shift came with no review, he added, ``there was a
long working-together process during which Sprint got a very good
idea of what kind of agency we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint surprise is the second instance in a month of
Thompson's unceremoniously losing a large account to a rival. Dell
Computer Corp. dismissed Thompson Chicago after only nine months
and moved its worldwide brand account, with billings estimated at
more than $100 million, to the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group
.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference'' between the two losses, Jones of
Thompson said, because with Sprint the agency had realized ``that
we were going to have to make changes to keep the account.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely disappointed'' with Sprint's decision, he added,
since it was ``a very, very bad blow for our agency in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 of the office's 200 employees work on Sprint, and
``there will have to be layoffs,'' Jones said. The office, which
also works for marketers like Chevron Corp. and Nestle SA, ``will
not be closing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's New York office will continue to handle broadcast
media buying for Sprint on a corporate basis. Other Sprint agencies
are unaffected by the switch; they include Grey Advertising in New
York, for business-to-business ads, and the Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney
unit of Publicis SA in San Francisco, for the Sprint PCS wireless
brand. The Competitive Media Reporting unit of VNU NV tallied total
Sprint ad spending last year at $274.3 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thompson's bad news from Sprint was somewhat offset by the good
news from Nabisco. The budget for cracker campaigns is expected to
be increased next year to stimulate demand for brands like Ritz,
the nation's best-selling cracker; Premium saltines, and Vegetable
Thins.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nabisco leads the cracker field in market share, unit
sales have been declining for the last 18 months. Thompson ``has a
longstanding history of creating impactful advertising for
packaged-goods firms'' like Nestle, said Ann Smith, a spokeswoman
for Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. in Parsippany,
N.J. ``We believe our cracker portfolio will benefit from their
strength in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   And two key Nabisco executives _ James Kilts, president and
chief executive, and Richard Lenny, president at Nabisco Biscuit
Co. _ worked with Thompson Chicago while they were top managers at
the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris Co.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCann-Erickson New York also lost A.1 steak sauce,
sold by Nabisco Specialty Products Co., after handling that brand
for a year. Billings were estimated at $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   A.1 is being moved to Foote, Cone, a unit of True North
Communications in New York that also handles Nabisco cookie brands;
another Nabisco condiment, Grey Poupon mustards, and overseas
assignments. The shift eliminates McCann-Erickson from the Nabisco
domestic agency roster, though the agency continues handling some
brands overseas.

TECHNOLOGY: STANDARDS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most ominous trends in Washington is a growing belief
that private industry, particularly any technology-based industry,
is better suited to serving the public interest than are elected
lawmakers and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a recent speech on digital television, William
Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
said that the government should encourage industries to set their
own standards and should be involved only ``when arguments are
distorted by the prism of self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, distorted self-interest is a pretty
accurate description of the slow-motion train wreck that has been
the digital television standards-setting process of the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   And for some who took part in the process, the recent spate of
complaints from TV industry executives rings disingenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the adoption of the new digital TV standard,
members of the Advanced Television Standards Committee
(www.atsc.org) _ whose proposals were adopted almost verbatim by
the FCC _ engaged in a long and vicious battle with digital
technology experts over technical features.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, which was heavily populated by
broadcast-industry representatives, argued against making
television more friendly to the display of computer-generated
images and text. In the early days, when the debate was only about
high-definition television, they even debated whether the standard
should be analog or digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even brought in a demonstration of the first Internet
browser back in 1993 or 1994,'' said Richard Solomon, an image
specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped
develop the first HDTV camera with Polaroid. ``The computer people
got it right away, but the TV people just didn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Liebhold, former director of Apple Computer's broad-band
multimedia research group, said his inclusion of educators, print
publishers and medical people in early discussions with the
standards committee ``was characterized as computer industry
interference'' and was ``pretty much ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settled, the TV people appeared to have
won virtually every point. In fact, the announcement of the new
standard on Dec. 26, 1996, noted with pleasure that ``the specific
video formats to be used for digital broadcast television will be
the subject of voluntary industry standards.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``voluntary industry standards'' set by the television
industry are precisely what that industry is now complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   The digital TV standard as proposed by the committee and adopted
by the FCC supports at least 14 different scanning formats, the
technical specifications that describe how a television picture is
created, broadcast and displayed. These formats encompass standard
and high-definition television, as well as what the FCC calls
computer-friendly formats.
</P>
<P>
   But the new digital TV standard does not require programmers to
broadcast any single specific format, as is the case with today's
broadcasts. Neither are equipment manufacturers required to build
receivers that receive any specific format.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, both the television industry and the critics who
accuse the FCC of adopting an overly broad standard acknowledge
that the resulting market chaos will put consumers in an untenable
position. They might have to buy separate receivers to view a wide
variety of programming. In addition, upgrading to more capable
systems is likely to be exponentially more expensive than simply
buying a new television set or set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the key role that television plays in world culture,
critics say, the willful creation of such chaos does not serve the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   William Schreiber, a television and film pioneer who was
director of the Advanced Television Research Program at MIT until
his retirement in 1990, has been active in the digital TV standards
process since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed document (available at
www.nytimes.com/tech/schreiber.html), he describes the problems at
length, including, he says, the domination of the standards process
by television broadcasters and TV-set makers. He also asserts that
the FCC has acted against the public interest by not opening the
process to independent evaluation and selecting a single,
technically superior standard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, the commission's chairman, responds that the broad
range of formats embraces both the computer industry and
broadcasters, ``at least preserving the possibility that the
marketplace might not be dictated'' by any single industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC was caught in the position where Congress had decided
to give away spectrum to existing broadcasters in exchange for them
making the transition to HDTV,'' Kennard said. The spectrum would
remain free, Congress said, only if it were used exclusively for
high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's position, Kennard said, was, ``Who are we to dictate
what this technology should be used for?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Liebhold, Solomon, Schreiber and other critics are
disappointed that the digital TV standard has not achieved their
technical ideals, the television industry ``stopped the train from
barreling down the tracks, and they won, though they may not want
to admit it,'' said an industry insider who spoke in exchange for
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this process,'' this insider said, ``the
broadcasters thought they had it completely locked down. Now either
they will step up to the task or morph into a completely new
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: In a world where the forward march of
technology often serves only to create chaos, is the public
interest better served if standards are set by the government or by
the marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the really important question that has not yet been
answered,'' the insider said. ''If we give broadcasters the
spectrum for free, what does the public get back in return?
Separate from developing new services and products, `public
interest' obviously needs to be redefined. If it's just about
pretty pictures, why bother?''

NEWS AND YOUNG MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children's ears and eyes have not been shielded from coverage of
the scandal enveloping President Clinton. And many parents cringe
at the questions the coverage may have raised in their youngsters'
minds.
</P>
<P>
   To help promote parent-child discussion, Nickelodeon will
televise a ``Nick News Special'' Monday at 9 p.m. Linda Ellerbee,
the host, leads 10 children, ages 10-14, in expressing their
concerns about the president and in questioning Katie Couric of NBC
News and Reid Weingarten, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beforehand, people said to me, `What will you do if the kids
ask explicit sex questions?''' Ms. Ellerbee said. ``But not one of
them did. That's not what they wanted to talk about. They talked
about honesty and the importance of being loyal to your family.
They asked what is censure, what is perjury and what will happen to
the country if Clinton stops being president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they said Congress shouldn't have put the whole Starr
report on the Internet because kids use that as their backyard,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion poll last week, Nickelodeon found that 100
percent of children ages 8-14 had heard about the scandal; 90
percent said they had learned about it from television. When asked
what they thought was the biggest news event right now, 60 percent
of the children named the Clinton-Lewinsky matter. Only 17 percent
named the home-run derby between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission in these specials is to help kids make sense of
the news they're hearing,'' said Ms. Ellerbee, whose company, Lucky
Duck Productions, produces the Nickelodeon news specials. ``Not to
tell them what to think, but to let kids know it's OK to have
questions about these things and OK to discuss them, and to let
parents see that kids do have questions and are thinking seriously
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most children in the Nick News taping thought Clinton should be
punished but not removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid said, `Couldn't we give him a timeout?''' Ms. Ellerbee
said. ``I told him it sounded like a reasonable idea, but the law
didn't provide for that punishment.''

JAPAN'S NEWLY VOCAL OPPOSITION MAY HINT OF A TRUE TWO-PARTY
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Obscured by the mountains of bad debts, by the battles
in Parliament, by the growing international frustration at Japan's
tardiness in confronting its economic problems, something
remarkable is bubbling up in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is a genuine, credible political opposition. In a country
that for half a century has been largely a one-party state, it is
striking to see a vigorous opposition leader _ Naoto Kan, a
tempestuous baby-boomer nicknamed Kan the Irritable _ assailing the
government's policies and forcing it to accept his own instead.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether this is a step toward a two-party system
in Japan or simply another in a series of political dead-ends.
Japan has tried for years to nurture a genuine two-party system, in
hopes of making government more honest and effective, but this has
never happened except for brief periods.
</P>
<P>
   Kan still faces enormous challenges holding his fractious
Democratic Party together, but so far he has managed better than
most people expected in forging a broad anti-government alliance.
He has seized on the economic crisis to embarrass the government,
and he clearly hopes to replace Keizo Obuchi in the prime
minister's residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we aim for the earliest possible dissolution of
Parliament, because the Obuchi government is not the choice of the
people,'' said Kan, noting that Obuchi was not elected but was
installed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party between elections.
``Soon, the time will come when it will be apparent to people that
the Obuchi administration is deadlocked and cannot achieve
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   How soon will that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few months,'' Kan said confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Most other analysts do not see matters quite so clearly. For
starters, general elections need not be held for another two years,
and the Liberal Democrats are so unpopular right now that it is in
their interest to try and delay elections as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Kan has shaken up Japanese politics and is
greatly admired as an individual, he is also untested as a national
leader. His Democratic Party has a poor grassroots organization and
no clear identity, and while voters are fed up with the Liberal
Democrats it is not clear that they would prefer the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and other countries have long hoped for
the emergence of an effective multiparty structure in Japan, for
now the spectacle in Tokyo has not so much inspired Washington as
alarmed it. The wrangling in Parliament delayed any action on
bailing out Japan's crippled banking system, although on Saturday
the ruling and opposition parties agreed _ for a second time _ on a
joint plan for legislation to stabilize the nation's financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   This joint plan is largely based on Kan's proposals, a rare case
in which the political opposition in Japan actually contributed
anything to the decision-making process. And so while the clash of
political parties may slow Japan's economic recovery, some see it
as a milestone in Japan's political development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process may be chaotic and a bit scary, but it's
been very helpful for Japanese democracy,'' said John Neuffer, who
writes a newsletter on Japanese politics. ``This is the first time
in memory that the opposition is looking like a credible
opposition.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For most of the post-war period, the Liberal Democrats presided
grandly over the political scene in Japan, with a token opposition
provided by the Socialists. In 1993, a schism in the Liberal
Democratic Party allowed the opposition to take power briefly, but
opposing politicians never formed an effective party.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kan suddenly appeared on the scene two years ago as a gust
of fresh air, serving as health minister and uncovering a scandal
within in his own ministry. Kan won raves for seeming to be a
take-charge politician who would lead the bureaucrats instead of
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Kan also has a rare sense in Japan of how to use television and
public relations, while Obuchi rarely gives interviews and is
ineffective when he does. Obuchi comes across a bit like the
Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov: both rose in one-party
systems in which the key to success was impressing superiors rather
than charming television audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Kan has been particularly adept at appealing to the resentments
of urban voters (``tax-payers,'' he calls them) whom the government
has traditionally treated as a cash cow to subsidize rural citizens
(``tax-eaters,'' in Kan's terminology).
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of Kan's key tests will be whether he can maintain
the opposition's unity when the subject is no longer the economic
crisis. The opposition is a mosaic of different political hues, and
it will be difficult to forge a common front on issues down the
road such as legislation defining the degree of military
cooperation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a balanced two-party system, but unfortunately,
the opposition parties have lots of divisions and fights and
personality differences,'' said Kazuyuki Hamada, a political
analyst and writer in Tokyo. ``This opposition coalition is very
fragile, with so many competing interests.''

   RIDERS _ WASHINGTON _ In what has become an annual congressional
struggle, Democrats and Republicans, environmentalists and
regulated interests are going down to the wire over ``riders'' that
have been attached to the Interior Department's appropriation for
next year. These amendments would weaken or at least change various
existing environmental laws. Environmental groups hate them and
President Clinton has promised to veto them, with support among
most congressional Democrats and a few Republicans. With fiscal
1999 beginning Thursday, a Clinton veto over environmental riders
could end up shutting down the government, or much of it. (Nesmith,

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLOCIC, Yugoslavia _ First the warning artillery rattled across
the valley at about 8:40 a.m. Friday morning, sending a message
that the Gashi clan instantly understood. They gathered their
children, and from the account of Haziz Gashi, who was collecting
milk at the time, everyone ran for the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, he said, they could see from their vantage
point Serb security forces in blue uniforms enter Plocic village, a
place where the Gashis, ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, have lived
since last century.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke and flames soon rose through crackling roofs, Gashi said.
In a methodical system of destruction repeated many times over by
Serb forces in Kosovo during the last three months, fences and
haystacks were laced with benzene and lit; possessions of value _ a
car, television sets, a satellite dish, an electric oven _ were
vandalized, and storehouses burned.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, many of Plocic's 20 homes were still smoking and a
storehouse was engulfed by fire from a floating spark. The smell of
charred wood drifted through the gardens still flowering with pink
cosmos and yellow dahlias. Surviving cattle rested on ground
covered with ashes.
</P>
<P>
   A few men, like Gashi, 42, and his eldest son Burim, 16, and
some dazed women and children ventured back to take stock of the
toll: ``My two cows and two calves are buried under that fallen
roof,'' said Gashi, staring at a mound of smoking tiles on the
floor of his ruined storehouse. ``I have little food left. I have
no idea where the children and my wife are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government, dominated by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, announced in Belgrade Saturday that the military
offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army, aimed at crushing the
rebels fighting for independence for the Serbian province, had
ended. The declaration came three days after the U.N. Security
Council passed a resolution demanding a cease-fire and NATO said
that Milosevic could face military force if he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground in the Drenica region of central Kosovo _ a
stronghold of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas, and one of their last
holdouts after a crushing three-month offensive by Milosevic's much
better-armed forces _ Belgrade's claims rang hollow.
</P>
<P>
   In Plocic Saturday, tank shelling could be heard about three
miles away and a Yugoslav military helicopter marked with a red
cross flew overhead and then back, apparently on a rescue operation
for wounded soldiers. Pillars of smoke from burning villages
clouded the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Serb offensive turned toward the area west of the
town of Urosevac. Roads were sealed by Serb security police and
tanks were reported to be getting into position for what Western
monitors said they believed was a renewed effort against resistant
guerrillas. Shelling could be heard in the hills west of Urosevac
toward Nerodimlje.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say that the Serbs, with the Yugoslav army at
the forefront, broke the effectiveness of the Kosovo Liberation
army last month. And in hurting the insurgents, Milosevic has
brought devastation to civilians, cowing them back into the sullen
obedience he has imposed with massive police and military presence
and frequent brutality since stripping Kosovo's Albanians of
administrative autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the Drenica area, where villages are considered most
sympathetic to the separatist cause and formed safe havens from
which the rebels could stage attacks, more than two dozen villages
have been virtually destroyed in the past week, according to
Western monitors. This adds to the tally of more than 200 villages
described by European Union monitors as moderately or severely
damaged since the Serb offensive began in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Between 10,000 and 15,000 people have been pushed out of their
homes in the last week, adding to the estimated 250,000 refugees
that already existed, according to the U.N. commissioner for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The action in Plocic appeared to be carefully crafted, designed
to demoralize and dishearten rather than destroy absolutely
everything.
</P>
<P>
   A minimal amount of shelter was left _ a roof intact here, walls
intact there _ so that with some plastic sheeting from humanitarian
agencies, some returning villagers might be able to exist for the
coming weeks. But snow usually falls in Kosovo in the last weeks of
October and it was hard to see how families could live in their
shattered houses during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Qamil Kryeziu, 50, who was a refugee in Plocic, said he had been
forced back to the village at gunpoint by Serb police who found him
in the forest after he fled Friday. He was held for an hour, with
his five children and 70-year-old father, and then ordered to
return, he said. Kryeziu said he would sleep in the one room that
had survived the fire in the house where he had been squatting
after his own house down the road was torched a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Gashis insisted that they were too poor to harbor guerrilla
fighters or provide them with food. Their village had been part of
the Drenica area controlled two months ago by the guerrilla
fighters, they said. It appeared they were punished Friday because
of that geographical position.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of fighting, no spent bullets on the ground,
no pockmarked walls. Rather there was evidence that once the
residents ran away and the houses were torched, the Serb forces
used the village as a staging ground for firing mortar shells
toward the forest. The empty cylindrical packing for about two
dozen 82mm mortars lay scattered on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Because their luck had held so far, the Gashis had hoped they
would escape the disaster that had befallen so many other villages.
Out of fear and a pragmatic decision to prepare for the worst, they
had moved many of their belongings _ wood-burning stoves, beds and
some clothes _ into a gully a mile away, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 20 families who live in Plocic had built flimsy
shelters of plastic and twigs in the gully and commuted between
there and the village when they needed more supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they said, their plastic shelters in the woods were getting
too cold and their homes were ruined.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Gashi clan expressed a fatalistic attitude
increasingly commonplace among the Albanians of Kosovo. All ethnic
Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the roughly 2 million
population of Kosovo, were considered by the Serbs to be members of
the liberation army, said Rizah Gashi, a 35-year-old builder who
returned Sunday to find his two sheep burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Albanian you are a target of the Serbs,'' he said.
``They don't ask if you are a member of the liberation forces. It's
like the sheep. The Serbs don't ask if the sheep are members of the
liberation force, they just kill them.''

 &HT;    Hollywood recycles plots, stars for fall movies
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fall movie season is here.
</P>
<P>
   The fall movie season is here.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well get used to seeing double. It's this autumn's
trend out of Hollywood, where it's no longer just cattiness that's
next to godliness. Now, copycatiness is too.
</P>
<P>
   Mad asteroid movies (``Deep Impact,'' ``Armageddon'') released
mere months apart? Pffft. World War II (``Saving Private Ryan,''
the upcoming ``The Thin Red Line'') times two? C'mon, you ain't
seen nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
   And yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Herein a (twin) peek at how the movies will repeat themselves
this fall. Read it or weep when you find yourself sitting through a
third straight movie about someone who dies in a car crash. (Movie
release dates, in parentheses, are subject to change.)
</P>
<P>
   _ What themes may come: Three things in life are certain
according to the movies: Death, taxes and life after death. First,
Robin Williams searches the afterlife for his wife in ``What Dreams
May Come'' (Friday). Then Michael Keaton returns to his grieving
family as a snowman in ``Jack Frost'' (Nov. 6). And, finally, Brad
Pitt assumes a dead man's identity in ``Meet Joe Black'' (Nov. 13).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hey, Norton! Edward Norton, a '96 Oscar nominee, has two films
out this fall: ``Rounders'' with Matt Damon (in metro theaters) and
``American History X,'' (Oct. 16) in which he co-stars with another
Edward (Furlong), whose ``Pecker'' was released Friday. Are we all
clear now?
</P>
<P>
   _ Give me a large popcorn and a can of Raid: Supposedly, it's an
ant movie, ``Antz'' (Friday), vs. a whole insect world movie, ``A
Bug's Life'' (Nov. 20). But don't kid yourself. It's really a
battle between DreamWorks and Disney to see which studios' computer
animators can squash the other's like a . . . um, a bug.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jones gang: Want to know what it was like to be a World
War II soldier? Catch ``The Thin Red Line'' (January in Atlanta),
based on James Jones' novel. Want to know what it was like to be a
World War II soldier's kid? Catch ``A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries,'' based on a novel by Jones' daughter Kaylie, which opened
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Great, but when will we open presents? Not one, but two hugely
anticipated movies. Not one, but two hugely anticipated movies
starring John Travolta. Not two, but one day on which they both
open. Coming up _ on Christmas of all days _ are ``The Thin Red
Line'' and ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Return to . . . Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix: Co-stars of
August's ``Return to Paradise,'' they co-star again in ``Clay
Pigeons'' (Friday).
</P>
<P>
   _ Return to . . . Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche: Co-stars of
August's ``Return to Paradise,'' they co-star again in ``Psycho''
(Dec. 4).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dying Jung: Two films about dying mothers (Meryl Streep in
``One True Thing,'' in metro theaters, and Susan Sarandon in ``The
Stepmom,'' which opens Christmas Day), the younger women in their
lives (Renee Zellweger and Julia Roberts, respectively) and how
they're forced to come to psychological terms with each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get on the bus: ``Just Write'' is the story of a tour bus
driver's affair with an actress and ``The Cruise'' is the story of
a New York City tour bus.
</P>
<P>
   _ And on a related front, Sir John Gielgud now sings lead for
Def Leppard: Two heavy-metal rock stars are making feature film
debuts. ``A Letter From Death Row'' was written by and stars
Poison's Bret Michaels. ``Dee Snider's Strangeland'' (not to be
confused with 1996's ``William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet'')
stars Twisted Sister's frontman as an Internet stalker.

 &HT;    A common event, miscarriage is an emotional blow
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The news came in the waning minutes of Atlanta radio
station Star 94's morning show: On-air personality Vikki Locke
announced to more than 400,000 listeners she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station's Web site crashed that mid-September day
while processing almost 200 e-mails of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   But three days later, Locke was pacing the bedroom floor of her
home, fighting cramps and a severe backache. She prayed and she
debated going to the emergency room and calling her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   And later, in the silence of the night, she miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the public airways, Locke's husband, Mike Hughes,
cradled her as she cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a part of my soul has been ripped from me,'' Locke
said in her first interview after the miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   She initially worried that she worked too hard _ not only coming
in at 5:30 for the morning show and meeting with clients, but also
attending several evening charity events. In fact, one of the
reasons she decided to tell listeners about the pregnancy in the
first place is because she had been ordered by her doctor to cut
back on her work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to lie about why I couldn't do these events,''
she said. ``So I thought if I just told the truth, people would
understand. And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the miscarriage, her husband and her doctor reminded
her that guilt was not necessary. ``I kept wondering if it was
because I wasn't getting enough sleep, if that had something to do
with it,'' she said. ``And my husband kept telling me I had nothing
to feel guilty about. That I had taken good care of myself as soon
as I had found out'' I was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Since her miscarriage, she has heard from dozens of metro
Atlanta couples who could identify with her very public pain, in
part because the event is so common.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and researchers think about one in four pregnancies
ends in miscarriage. Many women do not even realize they are
pregnant, instead believing they are simply having a particularly
heavy period.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who are aware of their condition _ and desperately
want the child a pregnancy promises _ the event can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   And ironically, better medical care and technology has made the
pain worse.
</P>
<P>
   Old World customs often dictated that cribs and clothes not be
made or bought before the baby was born _ a nod to nature's
harshness toward pregnancies. But better medical care has given
many a stronger sense that humans can control the outcome of
reproduction and birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many young, married couples who have planned out
everything _ when they're going to get pregnant, when they're going
to have their baby,'' said Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an assistant
professor with Atlanta's Emory Clinic. ``And when something like
this happens, it's very hard on them. This wasn't supposed to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents also get attached to a pregnancy much earlier. In
previous centuries, women usually didn't know they were pregnant
until they experienced morning sickness. And the traditional rabbit
test required a missed period, a scheduled doctor's visit and two
days of lab testing before a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a woman can determine whether she's pregnant barely a day
after she's missed her period. And with ultrasounds being performed
earlier, couples often have _ and share _ pictures or videos of
their offspring months before it's born. (For example, Locke,
almost 12 weeks pregnant, had already had two ultrasounds by the
time she miscarried.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that for the couple who truly wants a
baby, a pregnancy equates a child,'' said Dr. Carlene Elsner, a
reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist for
Reproductive Biology Associates Inc. ``When they lose a pregnancy,
it's awful. We witness them go through the same grief process as
parents who have lost a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Most miscarriages are caused by chromosomal defects, but other
factors include uterine deformities, infections and illnesses.
Miscarriages, however, are not typically caused by any particular
behavior by the women.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say exercise, sex, eating certain foods or even having
low-level illnesses, such as a cold, is not going to disrupt a
healthy pregnancy _ and women should not blame themselves for a
miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got patients asking me, `Was it the pesticides and the
bug man?' `Was it because I didn't take all my vitamins' or
`Because my husband and I had sex,''' said Reddy. ``People really
tend to look for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one factor that does contribute to miscarriage is a
woman's age.
</P>
<P>
   In women who are 38 or older, the pregnancy rate drops and the
miscarriage rate increases, a result of ``old'' eggs and
poor-quality embryos, Elsner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in this age group can get pregnant and have a healthy
baby,'' Elsner said. ``But they have to be prepared for more of a
roller coaster ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in medical technology have, however, made it easier
for doctors to correct problems that lead to miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women can have uterine operations to correct such
problems as fibroids. They can take hormone supplements until
pregnancies can be sustained on their own. Women can have blood
tests to check immunity problems or viral infections. And couples
can have chromosomal tests to check for DNA defects.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's no indication that just because a woman has one
miscarriage, she'll have any more. And even if she's had two
consecutive miscarriages, she still has only a one in three chance
of experiencing another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a lot of exciting good news,'' Elsner said.
``Couples are getting better educated about their health and so,
even if they lose a pregnancy, they're taking more time to learn
what they can do the stack the deck in their favor the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   People are also getting more astute on how to handle miscarriage
_ from bosses to grandparents. It's expected that a couple will
take at least three to six months to recover. And in some cases, if
the miscarriage occurred late in the pregnancy, or it's one of
several, the parents may never totally recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep waiting to feel like myself again,'' said Locke. ``I
think, physically, I'm all right. But emotionally, I'm just not to
the point where I can socialize and feel good yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Share Atlanta Inc., a pregnancy and infant loss support group,
runs classes on such topics as grief and the loss of family dreams,
how fathers can help mothers and fears about the safety of future
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors still recommend that prospective parents hold off in
telling co-workers and bosses about pregnancies until they are
clear of the first trimester. But if a couple break the rules and
then face a loss, they are finding many people have also
experienced a similar loss and can garner support.
</P>
<P>
   Although Locke could not talk to her mother about the
miscarriage _ in part because she was worried her mother would
immediately fly into town to be with her _ she faced her listeners
three days after she lost the pregnancy. Her co-host, Steve McCoy,
who has lost a child of his own, scoured her desk for baby clothes
and congratulations cards before she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sept. 16, Locke talked about unplugging the phone and
watching 16 videos over the weekend. By the end of the day, she had
received more than 60 e-mails from people giving support and
revealing their own heartaches.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said one listener's letter particularly touched her: ``It
said, `Consider yourself lucky. You now have your own tiny angel
watching over you forever.'''

RENO HOSPITALIZED AFTER FAINTING IN CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno fainted Sunday morning
during a church service in suburban Maryland and was hospitalized
at Georgetown University Medical Center, where she will be held
overnight for observation, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Donovan, a hospital spokesman, said that Reno was awake,
alert and talking. A Justice Department statement quoted Dr. Paul
Katz, the hospital's chief operating officer, as saying Reno's
vital signs were ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, 60, fainted while standing during services at the Full
Gospel AME Church in Clinton, the Justice Department said. A
physician on the Georgetown Hospital staff, Dr. Rodney Ellis, who
is a member of the congregation, treated Reno and accompanied her
in an ambulance to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department statement said that Reno told aides she
was ``feeling fine.'' She spoke with President Clinton, who called
from Air Force One while en route from Los Angeles to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although apparently unrelated to her fainting episode, Reno also
suffers from a mild form of Parkinson's disease, a neurological
disorder diagnosed in late 1995 that causes a shaking of her left
hand. Reno and her doctors have said that the disease has not
impaired her work or her physical activity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday was not the first time Reno has experienced dizziness in
public. In 1997, she fainted while attending a conference in Mexico
and was later found to have gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, Reno was at the center of several high pressure
decisions on whether to seek an independent prosecutor to
investigate possible illegalities in how Democrats financed
President Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has until November to decide on three 90-day preliminary
inquiries that could lead to an independent prosecutor to
investigate political fund-raising issues.
</P>
<P>
   One inquiry centers on whether Vice President Al Gore was
truthful in his statements about telephone fund-raising
solicitations from the White House. Another centers on whether
Harold Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff, lied
about efforts to help the teamsters resolve a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The third centers on whether Clinton violated the federal
election law during an effort to raise money sent to state parties
to finance political advertising campaigns that benefited his
campaign.

WORLD GRAPPLES WITH WAYS TO EXTERMINTE YEAR 2000 BUG

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   (breaks down)
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Ratcliffe of Pleasant Valley, a disabled former office
worker, can't afford to move. But she's worried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm figuring at least six months of everything being messed
up,'' said Ratcliffe, who's stocking up on canned food and kerosene
lamps. She's worried that those who have prepared will become
targets for those who haven't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm contemplating whether I should get some 2-by-4s to put
bars over the doors and windows,'' Ratcliffe said. ``I'm trying to
decide whether I should buy a weapon.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One expert sees self-interest driving much of the panic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consultants benefit from the year 2000 fear that helps pay their
skyrocketing fees, said Nicholas Zvegintzov, president of Software
Management Network of New York and a programmer for 35 years.
Politicians also benefit from a puffed-up problem they can fix
without much effort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there's no political clout in common sense,''
Zvegintzov said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Bennett, a Utah Republican who coordinates the Senate's
year 2000 efforts, isn't doing anything to add to the national
calm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a July 15 speech to the National Press Club in Washington,
Bennett told journalists to expect electrical brownouts and
regional blackouts. He predicts some banks will go bankrupt and
some water systems will break down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such alarm might actually be good, said Heidi Hooper, year 2000
director for the Information Technology Association of America. She
said the general public could use a serious wake-up call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These huge Fortune 100 companies are spending, collectively,
billions and billions of dollars. I don't think that's hype,'' she
said. ``They are not going to spend that money for no reason. They
know, bottom line, that if they are going to make money they have
to stay in business.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for some businesses to stay afloat, other businesses will
have to drown, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need, unfortunately, is examples of failures,'' Hooper
said. ``That's going to start soon enough in 1999. And the private
sector is not going to share that information, so it's going to
have to be up to the federal government to step in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government is in no shape to provide
leadership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, one congressman gave the federal government a ``D'' on
its most recent year 2000 preparedness report card, up from the
``F'' it received in June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a grade you take home to your parents,'' said Rep.
Steve Horn, a California Republican and chairman of the House
subcommittee on government management of information and
technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Horn predicts the government will not be able to fix a
substantial number of ``mission critical'' systems by 2000. And the
price tag to fix the 24 governmental departments surveyed is $6.3
billion, up $1 billion from the estimate given by the Office of
Management and Budget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive branch has a deadline that cannot be extended,''
Horn said. ``There is no margin for error.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Kansas City is requiring all city departments to
submit contingency plans by October for dealing with the year 2000
problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Will traffic lights work? Will prisoners be
released early if a computer mistakenly thinks an inmate has been
jailed for more than 100 years? Will fire trucks start, and what is
the backup plan if they don't? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to overreact, and we're not,'' said John
Franklin, assistant city manager. ``But there is a real issue here
for public managers that's kind of scary.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Water District No. 1 of Johnson County will spend
$1.56 million to fix 4,109 computer programs and 701,021 lines of
code by the end of next summer. The district says the job is 75
percent complete, and General Manager Byron Johnson said he was
confident the district would be prepared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But experts aren't prepared to declare victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole theme from day one is we need answers,'' said
Yardeni, the Yale economist and managing director of Deutsche Bank
Securities. ``I'm not trying to foment panic. I'm not trying to
create revolution. But you have to be a naive optimist to think
things are going to be pretty relaxed Jan. 1, 2000.'' &QL;

NERVOUS WORLD GRAPPLES WITH WAYS TO EXTERMINATE YEAR 2000 BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Marilyn Allison has spent the last three years
making sure computers at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City
don't fail after the ball drops on New Year's Eve 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Allison is confident Blue Cross has the problem well in hand.
And she thinks most of Kansas City does, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But she still is planning to sock away enough food, water, cash
and firewood to last a couple of weeks in case everything does go
haywire on Jan. 1, 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub of the year 2000 bug, a glitch that could cause
some computers, machinery, medical equipment, utilities and VCRs to
quit working, or spit out bad information, when the 1900s become
the 2000s. Nobody really knows what's going to happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from computer systems and billions of embedded
computer chips that might read the ``00'' in a computer program as
1900 rather than 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, one of the nation's leading economists,
forecasts a 70 percent chance of global recession because of the
bug. Another leading forecaster, David Wyss, chief economist for
Standard &AMP; Poor's, doesn't expect significant disruption. He even
contends the resulting fallout might be fun _ if we keep a sense of
humor about it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But everyone acknowledges something is coming down the tracks,
said Leon Kappelman, a university professor and author who is
spending much of his time these days talking about the year 2000
problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty is whether it's a locomotive or a bicycle,''
Kappelman said. ``And it's difficult to get definitive evidence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now there hasn't been much information to rely on. Some
credit cards with ``00'' expiration dates have been rejected. A
104-year-old Minnesota woman was invited to report to kindergarten,
and a computer docked an Olathe couple $17,800 for insurance
premiums. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But those are just scattered hints of the trouble to come. The
real warning lies in our growing reliance on vast networks of
technology _ a single misfire in the wrong place can sabotage lives
in far-flung places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, when just one satellite malfunctioned in May,
millions of pagers and automated teller machines went out for two
days. An ice storm in eastern Canada knocked out part of the
country's power grid and shut off power to millions of people for
more than a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think if all of that _ and more _ happened on one day: Jan. 1,
2000, a Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American businesses rely on computers to do almost everything.
They run huge manufacturing machines, answer telephones, pay
employees and control alarm systems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal government computers track airliners, generate Social
Security checks, and control satellites in space and missiles on
the ground. Cities use computers to run traffic lights and dispatch
police officers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Utilities use them to operate water and sewage systems. Grocery
stores use them to keep track of stock and place orders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than the software that runs those computers
are the tiny, embedded computer chips buried in the guts of
technological gadgets, heavy machinery, airliners and even
granddad's pacemaker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are 40 billion of the chips, most of them hard or
impossible to test, said Dave Hall, an expert with the CABA Corp.
in Oak Brook, Ill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary on how many of those chips will fail. Hall says 1
percent. Others say failures could go as high as 10 percent _ and
even higher in some medical equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even a 1 percent failure rate means 400 million chips would
fail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kappelman, the University of North Texas professor, thinks the
interrelationships between all those elements will cause serious
disruptions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it's unlikely that America's electric utilities
will be caught unprepared on the last New Year's Eve of the 1900s.
In fact, an industry report released last week said utility
problems seemed to be fewer _ and easier to fix _ than expected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if only a few plants shut down on Jan. 1, 2000, the strain
on the rest of the power grid could trip a cascading failure that
causes widespread brownouts or blackouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This will change the way we see the world,'' Kappelman said.
``We'll see our dependence on technology in a whole new way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if embedded chips are hard to check, the software problem
shouldn't seem too difficult to fix _ on the surface, at least. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, computers have been programmed to recognize dates
using six digits: today's date is 09//27//98. When the calendar
rolls over at midnight on New Year's Eve 1999, computers that
haven't been taught differently will see the year as 1900 or some
other date entirely. If they work at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So solve the problem. Add a couple of numbers to the programming
code. No big deal, right? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's become a very big deal. For Sprint Corp., that small fix
means programmers must pore over 80 million lines of code. The fix
will take two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big business thinks the problem is so significant that fixing it
has become a big business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. is spending $200 million on year 2000 repairs;
Hallmark Cards, $25 million; Blue Cross in Kansas City, $25
million; UMB Bank, $22 million; Yellow Corp., $17 million. Johnson
County taxpayers will pay $17.2 million to fix that county's year
2000 problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All told, the fix in the Kansas City area will easily top the
$400 million mark. Worldwide, the total is estimated at $300
billion to $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Entire companies have sprouted just to deal with the year 2000
bug. More than 140 public companies, ranging from Acceler8
Technology to Zmax Corp., are touting their solutions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where there's a problem, there's a lawyer. Law firms have
established special teams just to handle potential litigation from
the year 2000 problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies that cater to survivalists are hawking canned or dried
food and survival gear to those with year 2000 angst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That type of hype is spreading across the Internet on hundreds
of year 2000 Web sites. A few of the most radical year 2000
worriers already have moved to rural areas to get away from what
they think will be urban chaos when the lights go out and the food
supply chain breaks down. &QL;

JAY NIXON AND KIT BOND DEBATE ABOUT TOBACCO, HEALTH CARE AND
CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (OSAGE BEACH, Mo.) _ Democrat Jay Nixon charged Saturday that
Republican U.S. Sen. Kit Bond is soft on crime while Bond stopped
just short of branding Nixon a liar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Jay Nixon, you just can't trust what he
says,'' Bond said. ``I don't have time to correct all the
misstatements.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of charges and countercharges took place during
an hour-long debate sponsored by the Missouri Bar. Nixon,
Missouri's attorney general, is trying to unseat Bond in the
November election. Both men answered questions from three reporters
in their second of five scheduled debates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon criticized Bond's vote against an anti-crime bill in
Congress and said the senator opposed both the death penalty for
terrorists and gun-free zones in public schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested Bond erred as governor in 1974 when a state
prison inmate convicted of murder was paroled after serving ten
years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner was then hired as a guard at the same prison,
Nixon said, and accused of another killing shortly afterward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kit Bond's record is a lifetime of being soft on crime,''
Nixon said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the debate Bond told reporters any decisions on releasing
inmates were based on recommendations by the state probation and
parole board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the gentleman or the instance he (Nixon) is
referring to,'' Bond said. ``That was only a quarter of a century
ago. I'm sorry my memory is not that good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond also said that when he was governor he worked for
restoration of the death penalty and as senator he has supported
limits on death penalty appeals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have a good record,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond repeatedly blasted Nixon's decision to hire 36 attorneys to
try to settle Missouri's tobacco lawsuit. They stand to make up to
$429 million for less than a year's work, Bond contended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Firms where those attorneys work contributed more than $180,000
to Nixon campaigns, Bond said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scandal,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon countered that tobacco interests have spent more than $1
million in this year's Senate race, partly to benefit Bond, who
voted against an anti-tobacco bill earlier this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon lumped Bond with the ``boys who have been smoking in the
men's room with big tobacco lobbyists.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and Bond also bickered over proposed legislation to
provide medical patients with new rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill Bond backs is seriously flawed because consumers could
not sue their health maintenance organizations, Nixon said,
contending that Bond earlier filed a multimillion lawsuit of his
own in a financial dispute. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be one set of rules for you and another set of
rules for everybody else,'' the attorney general said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the GOP health-care bill addresses concerns from
Missouri consumers while the version Nixon backs is supported by
Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy and would benefit trial attorneys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond also said Nixon's campaign has been riddled with
misstatements. He said Nixon waged one of the dirtiest campaigns in
state history when he was elected attorney general in 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more example of Mr. Nixon living down to his
reputation,'' the Republican said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon promised he would fight for Missouri interests on health
care, Social Security, taxes, crime and education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the fights Kit Bond hasn't made and won't make,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond countered that his longtime experience in public life makes
him more effective today than ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise I will fight for you every day of the year,'' he
said. &QL;

<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Sprint Corp. has not followed the script.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, driven by the bull market and federal
deregulation, the telecommunications industry wound itself into a
frenzy of consolidation. In the excitement, the roster of companies
that agreed to disappear through acquisition grew to include Nynex,
Pacific Telesis, GTE and Ameritech. Just two weeks ago, MCI
Communications Corp. was absorbed by Worldcom Inc. And
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's No. 2 cable television
company, has a pending agreement to become part of AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, no company has generated a higher ratio of
merger-and-acquisition hyperbole to merger-and-acquisition reality
than Sprint. With the exception of BellSouth, Sprint, based here,
is the largest communications company in the nation that has not
been part of a big merger.
</P>
<P>
   So is this what happens when your chairman is a former
investment banker?
</P>
<P>
   William Esrey, Sprint's chairman, joined the company almost 20
years ago from the old Dillon, Read &AMP; Co. When he says that Sprint
has the strategic pieces in place to thrive on its own, he is
credible. Besides being the No. 3 U.S. long-distance carrier,
Sprint has a cash cow in its local phone business. The company also
has strong data communications offerings, an emerging wireless
business and an international strategy that has at least the
potential to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But three things are clear. First, that Esrey is and has been
prepared to sell his company, for the right price. Second, that one
window for doing so has already closed. And third, that Esrey is
convinced that many more chances will come along _ even if not
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   So while he says that selling Sprint is not his plan, he can
certainly come up with many scenarios for doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone asked, `Have you missed the opportunity to hedge
your bets in some way and hook up?' first of all I doubt that very
much,'' he said in an interview in his office here.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the foreign options, for example. Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom, each of which owns 10 percent of Sprint, are not
allowed, by contract, to increase their stakes. But when Esrey
thinks about foreign communications carriers that would want to
expand into the United States, he says, ``There's a lot of other
large companies, though Japan's on its back right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Esrey said, the best strategy would be ``keeping
your powder dry'' and awaiting better merger chances ahead. ``In
the U.S., the Bells can't be into long-distance right now,'' he
said. ``So that opportunity, if you want to call it that, is still
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Esrey's keeping his powder dry, part of that decision has
already been made for him. It turns out that some of Sprint's top
executives were convinced their company would have made an
excellent partner for GTE. A combined GTE-Sprint, the thinking
went, would have had to sell some wireless assets, but other than
that, the companies would have melded beautifully. The deal would
have produced a huge, high-margin local phone business, a fiber
optic network for GTE's growing long-distance business and, because
neither company has the Bell legacy, a minimum of regulatory
hassle.
</P>
<P>
   But a GTE-Sprint pairing was not to be. This summer GTE agreed
to be acquired by Bell Atlantic for $52.9 billion. That deal was
criticized on Wall Street because it did not provide a premium for
GTE's shareholders even while it did provide that Charles Lee,
GTE's chairman, would keep his job in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   GTE did not seriously pursue Sprint, and on Wall Street there
are at least two main lines of thought as to why. One is that GTE
was gun-shy after losing its takeover battle with Worldcom last
fall for MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory on why GTE did not pursue Sprint is that GTE
simply did not want to admit the magnitude of the strategic blunder
it committed when it sold its interest in Sprint in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: US Sprint, the long-distance carrier, was formed in
1986 as a 50-50 joint venture between GTE and United
Telecommunications, an old local phone company whose chief
executive had been William Esrey. But GTE eventually decided that
the long-distance business was not sufficiently attractive and by
1992 had sold its entire interest in Sprint to United for $1.1
billion. At that point, United renamed itself Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, of course, is that over the last few years GTE has
started all over again in the long-distance market. GTE declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint executives have not been as keen about a potential
acquisition by a regional Bell company, at least right now. The
Bells are still not allowed to sell long-distance service to
customers within their traditional regions, but Sprint already
sells long-distance service all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting questions percolating among
telecommunications bankers and analysts has been whether the
regulatory situation makes any potential Sprint-Bell company deal
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound on how an acquisition of Sprint by a Bell could
be structured. The long-distance unit could be put into some sort
of trust, perhaps, until the Bell won entry into the long-distance
market. Or the deal could simply be made conditional on the Bell's
getting long-distance approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Esrey is not a big fan of those scenarios. He does not want
to lock his shareholders into a deal that may never happen. If he
were to sell Sprint to a Bell, he would prefer to wait until the
Bell already had long-distance approval and he could move with
speed and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who, if anyone, comes after Sprint, they are
probably going to have to pay top dollar. As a former banker (and
one who just built a new ranch in Colorado), Esrey is likely to
assign a higher priority to a merger premium than to any continued
role for himself in a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's stock traded around $70 for most of the year, and Esrey
has not done much to dispel the consistent talk on Wall Street and
in the industry that his company could be acquired for around $100
a share.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of the talk of $100 a share has been built around the
widely known fact that Esrey stood to get options for a million
shares of Sprint at the attractive strike price of $47.94 if the
stock reached $95.875. (Sprint's shares ended the week at $77.25 on
the New York Stock Exchange.)
</P>
<P>
   What is not as well known is that Sprint's board recently
changed the terms of those options, so that Esrey could
automatically exercise them in the event of a takeover, regardless
of the stock price at the time. The change would ease a Sprint
takeover by allowing the acquiring company to use an accounting
method known as a pooling of interests, which brings substantial
tax benefits to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the accounting method, any acquirer of Sprint is
probably going to have to face some earnings dilution; Sprint's
stock is now trading around 43 times estimated earnings, much
higher than the earnings multiple of the shares of most potential
acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's high multiple is about to change, at least on the
surface. The main reason that Sprint's stock is trading at such a
premium is that about a third of the company's earnings are being
erased by losses in its wireless venture, an operation that still
requires big up-front investments. But in about six weeks, Sprint
plans to issue a separate tracking stock for its wireless unit,
allowing the market to value that business separately from Sprint's
others.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock, however, would not lower another hurdle to
acquiring Sprint. Almost any domestic company that would be
interested in Sprint would probably not be interested in the whole
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that any of the Bells, for example, would
want the wireless unit, because it would simply duplicate much of
their own existing wireless operations. On the other hand, a big
communications conglomerate that might actually want to expand into
wireless _ say, Worldcom in a few years _ would have little need
for Sprint's long-distance and local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a separate tracking stock, a company acquiring all of
Sprint could still have to sell the part it did not want _ with
sizable tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the same diversification that could make Sprint a cumbersome
company to buy is also an attribute that enables Sprint to go it
alone for now, and allows Esrey to keep his powder dry for a while
longer.

ORGANIZED LABOR BLUNDERS AGAIN, OPPOSES GOP TAX-CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ If you've ever wondered why organized labor keeps
losing market share, so to speak, the AFL-CIO crusade against the
Republican tax-cut initiative helps put the problem in
perspective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has joined forces with the Clinton administration
and congressional Democrats to oppose the pitifully modest
election-year tax-relief bid by launching an ad campaign themed to
Social Security scare tactics. This is the same bogus tactic used
by President Clinton and his economic brain trust. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? The presidency is under siege,
which puts Democrats in Congress at a disadvantage. Meanwhile,
declining membership puts unionism's long-term viability in
question. The curious response by these beleaguered allies is to
oppose a GOP attempt to ease the national tax burden by a piddling
$80 billion over five years. This is less than 1 percent of all the
revenue Uncle Sam is expected to collect over this period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be understandable for some pols to oppose tax cuts, but
why would an organization representing working folks favor the
government's interests over those of its members? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for this opposition is the assertion that the
money for the tax cut would come from budget surpluses owed to
Social Security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently dismissed the whole idea by saying, ``We can
pass the tax cut and then just dismantle the Social Security
system.'' The AFL-CIO ads warn that ``the Republican Congress wants
to spend this Social Security surpluseven as there's talk of
cutting Social Security for future retirees.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are what make the opposition's position bogus.
It's true that this year's budget surplus probably will come
entirely from excess Social Security tax revenues. It's also true,
however, that the federal government cannot save any part of the
Social Security surplus. Most Americans don't understand how the
system works, though, which is why demagoguery of the Social
Security issue is worth a try for desperate politicos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the leftover Social Security receipts aren't returned to
taxpayers, Washington will spend the money just like it spends all
other tax receipts. (Either that or use it to retire maturing
federal debt.) The Social Security trust fund will get its usual
IOU in the form of a nonmarketable security to be redeemed as
needed later by future taxpayers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's important to remember is that not a dime of it can be put
aside for the benefit of current or future Social Security
beneficiaries. All that can be put aside is the IOUs that the
Treasury gives the trust fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for putting the needs of government above the needs of
taxpayers, here is something else that is true: Over the first 11
months of the 1998 fiscal year, federal revenue was nearly 10
percent higher than last year. How many American worker-taxpayers
can boast annual income gains of this magnitude? How many have
gotten raises of even half this much? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats and their handmaidens in organized labor were
politically astute, they'd be bashing the Republicans for their
Scrooge-like approach to tax relief. In fact, the GOP proposal
should be considered an embarrassment to a party that probably
enjoys its congressional majority because of past bold tax-relief
and reform efforts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those making a big deal of opposing it actually make this
pathetic GOP exercise look much more attractive than it really is. &QL;

AN ERA ENDS IN GERMANY AS SCHROEDER DEFEATS KOHL

 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ On Sunday, Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat,
defeated Helmut Kohl to become German chancellor, ending an era in
Germany and opening a new one in Europe where center-left
governments now dominate the continent's politics.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard-fought campaign, the victory was decisive, a clear
expression of the weariness of Germans with Kohl's 16-year rule.
Schroeder swept aside the Christian Democrat chancellor who oversaw
the peaceful reunification of Germany in 1990 and personified the
Cold War's end in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat of Kohl, the last of the European politicians
who were in office when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 has
departed, reflecting the new priorities that confront Europe as it
grapples with the competitive pressures of a global economy,
overburdened welfare systems and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Like other center-left leaders in Europe, including Tony Blair
in Britain and Lionel Jospin in France, Schroeder will now have to
confront a central issue: how to adjust Germany's expensive welfare
system to global competition without dismantling it, and at the
same time create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the post-war republic that Germans
voted a sitting chancellor out of office, and they did so with
gusto, dismissing Kohl's warnings of instability to usher in the
first Social Democratic chancellor of Europe's most powerful state
since Helmut Schmidt in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   When Schmidt left office, the main issue in Germany was the
deployment of medium-range U.S. missiles on German soil aimed at
the former Soviet Union _ a measure of the colossal distance
traveled in Germany and in Europe under Kohl, the longest-serving
German chancellor since Otto von Bismark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have chosen a change of generation,'' Schroeder,
54, declared to a cheering crowd outside the Social Democratic
Party headquarters in Bonn. Schroeder had embodied youth during the
campaign, and a Germany less burdened by its past. It was on this
wave that he rode to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think politics is more psychological than rational, and this
result for us Germans is an injection of energy,'' said Henning
Frase, 20, a student. ``It is ridiculous, in a democracy, to have a
leader for as long as we had Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into poverty, Schroeder came into politics on the leftist
wave of the 1960s. But his outlook evolved toward pragmatism, and
he fought this campaign on an often vague platform of modernization
and renewal under the slogan of ``The New Middle'' and the clear
inspiration of Bill Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl pressed his vision of the rise from the ruins of
Nazism and his view of Germany's place in Europe on his countrymen,
Schroeder talked about jobs. The strategy worked because a new
generation of Germans is tired of history lessons and more
concerned that their society is fraying than they are about
geo-strategic threats.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder and his followers said many things at once _
reassuring businessmen with talk of lower taxes and the need to
reform the welfare system, while reassuring workers with promises
of better benefits and pensions _ and the first months in office
may confront him with wrenching choices between divergent campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining an estimated 41.2 percent of the vote, up from 36.4
percent at the last election in 1994, the Social Democrats
inflicted their most decisive victory ever over the Christian
Democrats, whose vote plunged more than 6 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, under Willy Brandt in 1972, had the Social
Democrats gained more votes than their principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what kind of government Schroeder
would form. Computer predictions suggested he would have a narrow
majority in the 656-member Bundestag, or parliament, in a coalition
with the environmentalist Greens, the party with which he has said
he wants to govern.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such a ``Red-Green'' coalition has never been tried since the
Federal Republic was established in 1949. In what has been a
conservative country, where repeated upheaval has spawned an
aversion to risk, the coalition would mark a radical departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens have, in the past, called for a review of Germany's
NATO membership, causing concern in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, however, vowed continuity in foreign policy. He also
promised to foster reconciliation in a country still divided
between the West and its formerly communist East, and said his most
important goal would be the fight ``against the plague of
unemployment.'' More than 4 million people in Germany, or 10.6
percent of the population, are out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Two central transformations of German society set in motion
under Kohl will now have to be completed by Schroeder: the return
next year of the captial to Berlin, 44 years after Hitler's defeat,
and the abandonment in 2002 of the German mark, symbol of post-war
stability, for a European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not opt for an alliance with the Greens, the
alternative for Schroeder would be a so-called ``Grand Coalition''
with the Christian Democrats, an unwieldy alliance not tried for
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl already has dismissed this possibility, saying the
electorate ``has clearly opted for Red-Green.'' And Kohl's finance
minister, Theo Waigel, said such a coalition would be ``absolutely
the wrong way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared clear that, having suffered an overwhelming defeat,
the Christian Democrats were determined to allow Schroeder to
confront Germany's problems without them, hoping to benefit from
the difficulties he is almost certain to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl made clear in a statement that he would abandon the
leadership of the Christian Democrats. He said he would ask the
next party congress to propose a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that Kohl made a fundamental mistake in
seeking a fifth term himself, rather than passing the mantle to his
deputy, Wolfgang Schauble. Several opinion polls have shown
Schauble to be the most popular politician in Germany, while Kohl's
lack of popularity was driven home by the fact that on Sunday he
lost his home seat of Ludwigshafen to a Social Democrat on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary turnabout for the leader universally
hailed just eight years ago when Germany was reunited. But
unification has proved more costly and difficult than foreseen, and
the tensions it engendered certainly contributed to Kohl's
downfall.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving millions of tons of earth around the Black Thunder coal
mine in Wright, Wyo., has come to resemble playing a video game,
except that the score is kept by military satellites high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cab of each behemoth D11 Caterpillar, a computer
screen displays a little bulldozer plowing through virtual dirt _
red for what needs moving and blue for what needs covering. As a
global positioning system, or GPS, receiver on the roof tracks the
dozer's movement across the screen, the operator's job, explains
Jim Long, the mine's chief surveyor, is to ``push the red to the
blue,'' creating the color green for the desired grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really slick,'' Long said. ``They don't even have to
look out the window _ except to keep from running over somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Thunder, a division of Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, will
produce 47 millions tons of coal this year from this one mine,
about 5 percent of U.S. production. And at a time when coal prices
are at a historic low of less than $5 a ton, the GPS gear, linked
to a computer-designed mine plan, helps the company achieve crucial
new levels of efficiency _ whether building roads across the
nine-square-mile site, uncovering coal seams or reconstructing the
original prairie contour once the coal is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the company first put GPS units on its bulldozers in July
1997, we had some increases of 30 percent in productivity,'' Long
said. ``That's a pretty amazing number. It's not that the guy is
moving any more dirt. He's getting it to the right place the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arch Coal is just one of thousands of U.S. companies putting GPS
to work, appropriating a system originally intended for military
navigation and using it for such commercial purposes as mapping
delivery routes, tracking products all the way from factory floor
to retail shelf, and monitoring the whereabouts of mobile workers.
</P>
<P>
   Available for limited civilian use since 1984 but fully
operational only since 1995, GPS technology has become so important
to industry that many businesses now consider it a utility like the
Internet _ an element of information technology helping fuel
America's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study (infoserv2.ita.doc.gov/ot) released
this month estimates that worldwide GPS equipment sales will reach
$4 billion this year, and will double by 2000 and double again, to
$16 billion, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Japan and Europe, where car-navigation systems
are the main use of GPS technology, the commercial market in the
United States is dominated by mapping and geographic information
systems like that employed by the Black Thunder mine. Even though
GPS gear is installed in virtually all U.S. military vehicles, and
the satellite system is run by the Air Force Space Command in
Colorado Springs, military purchases for GPS now represent just a
fraction of industry sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military uses are swamped by civilian use,'' said Joe Canny,
deputy assistant secretary of transportation and the principal
staff person on the government's Interagency GPS Executive Board,
which sets the nation's GPS policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one has estimated the impact of GPS on the nation's gross
domestic product, but the figure is presumably ``enormous,'' said
Scott Pace, an analyst at the Rand Science and Technology Policy
Institute and a co-author of the Commerce Department study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add up the critical industries _ oil and gas, financial
networks, transportation _ you find that GPS is an embedded
assumption in the functioning in every one of those things,'' Pace
said.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, time.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying atomic clocks that are corrected daily to Naval
Observatory standards, the 24 GPS satellites that orbit the Earth
some 11,000 nautical miles above the Equator are the largest source
of accurate time in the world. Much of the nation's power grid, and
all of its long-distance telephone networks, as well as paging and
mobile phone systems, are kept synchronized via software that
periodically downloads GPS time, said Dennis McCarthy, director of
the Directorate of Time at the Naval observatory in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval observatory's time data is available over the Internet
(www.usno.navy.mil) and from computers around the country that
periodically correct their clocks when an orbiting satellite passes
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   And GPS time has become a crucial component of securities
trading and many other forms of financial transactions. The Nasdaq
trading system, for example, relies on a master clock kept in synch
by a satellite dish in Trumball, Conn., which allows every Nasdaq
trade to receive an official time stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial receiver in 1984 cost $150,000, weighed 100
pounds and was accurate to within 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Today a hand-held GPS receiver costs as little as $100, and the
semiconductor chip sets are small enough that the technology is
finding its way into cell phones. And error-correction techniques
have advanced so that specialized GPS devices can be accurate to
the width of a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Such advances have brought all sorts of new GPS commercial and
industrial uses. Backpack GPS units have revolutionized surveying
of construction sites, power lines and boundaries. Creating
accurate control points for such jobs in 1986, for example,
required two workers: one to hold a marked rod and the other to
site direction and elevation through a transit, at a cost of
$10,000 a point. Backpack units worn by a single worker have
reduced the cost to $250 a point, according to the Commerce
Department study.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, the business trend in GPS has been away from
the navigational question ``Where am I on earth?'' and toward the
more managerial interrogation ``Where on earth are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, for instance, has installed GPS units on its
1,600 long-haul trucks, to track their movements and arrival times.
The trucks' locations are beamed to satellites every 10 minutes,
and computers route that data to destinations so that workers there
can be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Before the GPS units were installed two years ago, Federal
Express made ``educated guesswork,'' according to Charlie Hicks,
who is in charge of ground freight. ``Because of our service
commitment,'' he said, ``it is very important to know when things
are going to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar system, sold by Highway Master Corp. of Dallas for
$2,000 a truck, has been installed on 100,000 trucks around the
nation, including the fleet of Wal-Mart Stores; it can keep track
of average speeds and miles per gallon. The Highway Master system
also incorporates cellular telephones to let fleet operators stay
in even closer touch with their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   GPS is by no means a commercial cure-all. In Denver, where
Yellow Cab, a subsidiary of Stamford Capital, installed a $100,000
GPS-based dispatching system in 1996, at an average cost of $350 a
cab, the company has not yet seen any improvement in dispatching
efficiency, said Michael Brown, the company's director of
information systems. So far, the system mainly just lets
dispatchers know how many cabs are stacked up at Denver
International Airport, Brown said. He added that it probably would
not have much impact on costs and revenues until a related
``closest cab'' dispatcher software program is installed a few
months from now.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver system has had at least one tangible benefit,
however. When a customer tried to steal a cab while the driver was
in a store, the dispatcher radioed the police with the cab's
location and the cab was stopped within two blocks.

   In the Gulf of Mexico, many of the petroleum industry's floating
oil rigs are kept in place over their wells with the aid of GPS
signals. John E. Chance &AMP; Associates Inc., a division of Fegro of
the Netherlands, moves rigs into place using GPS signals, and sets
up on-board computers that keep watch over a rig's precise position
and automatically fire underwater thrusters to move it back into
position if it drifts away.
</P>
<P>
   The labor required to position a rig has been cut in half, said
Jim O'Neal, general manager of Chance's marine group.
</P>
<P>
   Rising civilian and commercial demand for GPS has prompted the
government's interagency board to approve tripling the number of
civilian radio signals coming from the military satellites. The
decision was announced earlier this year, but carrying it out has
been at least temporarily delayed by technical questions, costs and
competition for space on the radio-frequency spectrum. Canny said
the additional signals were expected to be available on new
satellites by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest users of the new signals will be airlines,
employing the Federal Aviation Administration's new Wide Area
Augmentation System. The system is supposed to allow pilots and air
traffic controllers to determine an aircraft's location to an
accuracy of within 25 feet _ enabling planes to save fuel and time
by flying directly between airports rather than along strictly
controlled corridors as they must do now to avoid risk of
collisions. Using existing GPS signals and ground-reference points,
the first phase will be introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood has embraced GPS.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvester Stallone's movie ``Daylight,'' with its climatic
escape from a flooded Holland Tunnel into the Hudson River, the
main characters were shown bursting through the river's surface
from the dark depths below.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Ron Goodman, president of Spacecam, a
special-effects film company in Los Angeles, the river was shot
during the winter without the actors present. A helicopter camera
panned down from the New York skyline as two GPS units, one near
the camera and one on the helicopter's tail, recorded the exact
spatial orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle and orientation were later duplicated over Lake
Casitas near Los Angeles to film two stunt doubles emerging from
the water. Only later did the actors bubble up in a nice warm
studio tank _ leaving the rest to the special-effects magicians.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case of the right talent meeting the right need at the
right time, Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the creators of the
1980s ABC hit show ``thirtysomething'' have concluded a complicated
new television series deal that several participants say may be the
first step in a radically changed approach to controlling
escalating program costs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is unusual in several ways, beginning with the fact
that it involves four series at two networks, ABC and Fox, under
the control of two Hollywood studios, Disney and Fox. But it is the
element of who will own the rights to future sales of the shows _
should they be successful _ that places the deal at the heart of
the issue roiling the entire television industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Bedford Falls, the company owned by Zwick and
Herskovitz, will create at least three new shows for ABC, all to be
produced through Buena Vista Television, the studio owned by ABC's
parent, Walt Disney Co. They will also create at least one new show
for the Fox network, produced through a subsidiary of Fox
Television, the studio owned by the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp.
Thus, in both cases the shows will be partly owned by the companies
that own the networks broadcasting the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, NBC was forced to pay the Warner Brothers
unit of Time Warner Inc. $286 million a year to retain ``ER,''
television's most popular show. In the wake of that, numerous
producers and studio executives have said that NBC, in an apparent
attempt to control future costs, is pressing creators of programs
either to cede some of the ownership rights to the network or else
to sign licensing contracts that give the network exclusive rights
to the show for up to 10 years. Executives at NBC, a unit of
General Electric Co., deny those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, referring to the reports about NBC, Zwick said: ``This
seems to be the trend. In making this deal, we were looking for a
way for the artist to fit into this changing dynamic.'' Herskovitz
added, ``Without a doubt, the ownership issue drove this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a change from conventional practice, Zwick and Herskovitz
will receive more than 50 percent of the syndicated rerun profits
from all the shows they create under this deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal represents what the future is going to be,'' said
Lloyd Braun, chairman of Buena Vista. ``The system as currently
constituted is madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, studios pay established writers
millions of dollars in upfront fees to secure their talents to
create shows. While the studios retain the bulk of ownership
rights, the writers end up with modest profits when or if the shows
are successful. They rarely are.
</P>
<P>
   ``In success, the studios make loads of money,'' Braun said.
``But when the shows fail, they get killed. At what point does it
make sense to limit your costs by giving up a little of the upside
profits? The business is so tough today. It's so illogical that no
one is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Braun joined Disney in March, he learned that ABC had
already made a deal with Zwick and Herskovitz for three series. But
the shows were to be produced through a Fox subsidiary run by Arnan
Milchan, a producer for whom Herskovitz had directed the movie
``Dangerous Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun stepped in to steer the ABC network deal to his studio.
``This kind of vertical integration is coming,'' he said. ``In the
end, the most valuable real estate for us is ABC real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun's pursuit of ownership rights of shows set for Disney's
network dovetailed with a plan hatched by Zwick and Herskovitz and
their agent, Alan Berger, and lawyer, Craig Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both our fathers had their own businesses,'' Herskovitz said.
Zwick added, ``We wanted to be more entreprenuerial.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``thirtysomething,'' the two writers had taken what Zwick
called ``sizable fees'' to produce the show. But while the show
went on to make tens of millions of dollars in syndicated and
foreign sales for its repeats, ``We made tens of dollars,'' Zwick
said. That was because they retained such a small percentage of the
profits from the show.
</P>
<P>
   The experience left the two writers intrigued by the possibility
of taking some upfront risk for the potential of millions of
dollars in future profits. ``We've had creative autonomy,'' Zwick
said. ``Financial autonomy has also been a dream.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Berger and Jacobson said they had pitched to several studios the
idea of forgoing any upfront fees to Zwick and Herskovitz in
exchange for more than 50 percent of later profits _ if there were
any.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fully negotiated deal with another studio with
guaranteed money,'' said Berger, who is executive vice president of
International Creative Management. But when he and Jacobson tried
to rework the deal to eliminate the upfront money in exchange for
bigger rights to rerun profits, the studio balked, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, of the law firm Hansen, Jacobson, Teller &AMP; Hoberman,
said: ``Other studios told us: `We're not in that business; we
spend the money and we get the lion's share in the end.' '' The odd
thing, both men said, was that in the movie side of their business,
studios made similar deals all the time, ceding big percentages of
gross profits to actors and directors in lieu of upfront fees.
</P>
<P>
   With Braun involved, Jacobson said, things began to change.
``First of all, it was made clear to us that the shows Marshall and
Ed did for ABC were going to go to the Disney studio and the ones
for the Fox network to Fox studio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Braun said he saw no reason to insist that all the new
Zwick-Herskovitz shows be controlled by his studio. Other producers
have shows at two networks at the same time. David Kelley, for
example, has ``Ally McBeal'' on Fox and ``The Practice'' on ABC.
Both shows belong to Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of split is less likely to be seen in the future, as
studios hold onto shows for their own networks, Braun said. ``If we
produce a hit show for another network, it is going to take some
pound of flesh from ABC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger questioned how many show creators would forgo the big
initial fees for a chance at much bigger, but much riskier future
profits, as Zwick and Herskovitz did. Zwick said the deal depended
on his and Herskovitz's controlling the shows' production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different type of arrangement,'' Braun said.
``But the business is being driven by insecurity and defensiveness.
People want the safety net of saying, `We got the guy everybody was
going after,' even if it costs $4 million a year to sign him. No
one has looked at the business and said it doesn't make sense to do
things the same way anymore.''

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In an experiment that is half business model and
half populist movement, a small company called Red Hat Software is
charging $50 for an operating system called Linux that anyone can
get free on the Internet, and it is paying programmers decent wages
to write code that it will give away.
</P>
<P>
   While that might seem the most contrarian of business plans, Red
Hat is attracting blue-chip investors to the notion that free can
be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, known alternately as free software and open
source, is built around freely distributing source code, the basic
commands that programmers write. Publishing these instructions
before they are compiled into the binary language of computers
offers other programmers the chance to examine the code and suggest
or actually write improvements.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the movement's proponents say, open source could
harness the collective wisdom of the world's best software
designers for social good, undermine Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
monopoly and propagate an operating system that does not crash.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of their passion is inspired by Linux, a version of
the Unix operating system developed by Linus Torvalds of Finland
and numerous collaborators worldwide. Linux (rhymes with
``cynics'') has attracted a cult-like following among programmers
and systems developers who say it is a more secure, flexible and
economic alternative to Microsoft's industrial-strength operating
system, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of following, the business-model half of the
Red Hat experiment strikes many people as counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young, the chief executive of the three-year-old company
in Durham's Research Triangle Park, insists that open-source
products can make money. And although he has nothing against
contributing to a utopian vision of software development in the
process, his pragmatic focus has lately attracted interest from
venture capitalists and corporate backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry is built on intellectual property,''
said Young, a 44-year-old Canadian who used to run a
computer-leasing business. ``You own your technology, and if you
get it widely disseminated you can coerce your user base into
buying new releases. We give up that control _ and those profits _
but that is exactly what is going to drive our success, because
that is what's best for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Red Hat's potential corporate backers are Intel Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. An announcement is expected as early
as Tuesday, when Young is scheduled to appear with executives from
both companies in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, particularly from Intel, whose close ties to
Microsoft have recently shown signs of fraying, would lend
considerable credibility both to Linux and to Red Hat's plans to
build a business by providing customer service and technical
support for the free operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Recent support for Linux and other open-source projects seems to
suggest a growing acceptance in the software industry of an
alternative to the tradition of proprietary code.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, recently licensed Apache, a popular program
for serving up World Wide Web sites. Like Linux, Apache is a free,
open-source product.
</P>
<P>
   And Netscape last February published the source code to its
Navigator browser for navigating the World Wide Web. Forced to stop
charging for Navigator by Microsoft's free distribution of its
competing browser software, Explorer, Netscape gambled that going
one step further and releasing its code would give Navigator a
competitive advantage over Explorer in the long run by spurring
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source has already radically changed the computer
industry,'' said Tim O'Reilly, whose publishing company, O'Reilly &AMP;
Associates, makes money producing user manuals for free software.
``In the first round, open-source software will not beat Microsoft
at its own game. What it is doing is changing the nature of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds, who wrote Linux in 1991 when he was a student at the
University of Helsinki, licensed it in a way that allows anyone to
submit improved code and redistribute it at will. Since then,
thousands of programmers have volunteered elaborate improvements of
their own design for no more reward than the respect of the geek
subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Submissions to Linux's core code, or kernel, are subjected to
instantaneous electronic peer review, a technological meritocracy
that has so far insulated Linux from the kind of fragmentation that
has befallen other operating systems built around the international
Unix standard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the operating system's reputation for power and
reliability, corporations have been reluctant to use Linux because
nobody owns it. That is why the emergence of companies like Red Hat
and Caldera Systems Inc. _ a Linux distributor with a business plan
based on corporate training, services and support _ is considered
crucial to the success of the free operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bolstered by commitments from companies like Oracle,
Netscape, Intel, Informix and Corel, all of which have announced
plans to support Linux in recent months, Red Hat and Caldera are
getting more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But their business plans are fragile. For instance, since Red
Hat wants whatever code it writes to become part of the Linux
kernel, it must be published under open-source rules. That means
that www.cheapbytes.com can, and does, sell Red Hat's entire Linux
package for $1.99 _ $48.01 less than Red Hat's customers pay.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat's Young estimates that as few as 1 in 10 of the people
who use Red Hat have paid him for it. But that is one of the
paradoxical pillars of charging only for support and services, not
for intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to compete with Microsoft,'' Young stresses.
``It's to lower the value of the operating system market. Microsoft
makes $5 billion in operating system sales. If I get that market, I
automatically make it a $500 million market.''

   A few weeks before last spring's traditional April 18

<P>
   ``How would the boss feel about a staffer dating an intern?''
was a question posed by the Washington newspaper The Hill to staff
members in Congressional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Strom Thurmond &LR; , 95-year-old South Carolina Republican,
met his wife, &UR; Nancy &LR; , when she was his intern. His current position
on staff socializing: ``I don't think it would be a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Ted Kennedy &LR; , D-Mass., renowned socializer, says he has
no official policy.
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Phil Gramm &LR; , R-Texas, said he would be uncomfortable
with a superior dating an underling, but ``I believe in love and
marriage and support them both.'' Senator  &UR; Orrin Hatch &LR; , R-Utah,
was equally sentimental _ ``I don't have a problem with two young
people getting together,'' he said _ but told The Hill he wouldn't
approve of a married man dating one of his interns (apparently
foreseeing no possibility of a married woman dating a male intern).
</P>
<P>
   The strictest rules are in force in the office of House
Judiciary Committee member  &UR; Asa Hutchinson &LR; , R-Ark. ``Any dating
between interns and staff members is strictly prohibited,'' says
his intern policy handbook, ``and will result in the termination of
employment for both involved parties.'' Hutchinson also insists, in

 DURHAM, N.C.: million market.''

<P>
   Skeptics are quick to note that the technology companies lining
up behind Linux, with its estimated 7 million users, have their own
competitive reasons to oppose Microsoft, which has 300 million
users for its Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the skeptics point out, no one knows how long
Linux's labor-of-love development by programmers will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``An operating system is a living thing,'' said Carl Shapiro, an
economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a
co-author of ``Information Rules,'' a book to be published this
week by the Harvard Business School Press. ``Ongoing investment and
upgrades are essential to attract customers. Nice cooperative
thoughts are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, use of Linux is growing by more than 40 percent a year,
according to IDC, a research firm. And a 1997 survey by another
research firm, Datapro, found that Linux scored higher with users
than any other operating system. Dell Computer, which last year
began offering Linux to customers who ordered at least 50 computers
a quarter, said that more interest had been expressed in Linux in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on
Technology, which has encouraged the Justice Department to
investigate Microsoft's Windows licensing deals with computer
manufacturers, said his office had found it impossible to buy Linux
already installed on a PC from a major commercial vendor. But he
managed to install it on his own computer, and he was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've seen an industrial-strength
product developed without a corporation behind it, and we think
it's amazing'' Love said. ``If the operating system is in fact a
natural monopoly, then what could be better than having an
operating system that nobody owns?''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that Linux poses a threat to Microsoft right now.
But at a time when the next version of Windows NT appears
indefinitely delayed by a complexity that has grown unmanageable,
Linux enthusiasts are beginning to find back-door ways to introduce
the operating system into their corporations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Randy Kessel, a manager for technical analysis
at Southwestern Bell, part of SBC Communications, installed Red
Hat's Linux on the 36 desktop personal computers that monitor
network operations in Kansas and Missouri, it was done on something
of a dare.
</P>
<P>
   After poor results testing a memory-intensive application with
Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT, a colleague had asked Kessel
why, if he thought Linux was so great, he did not try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took a mission-critical operation and we deployed a free
operating system there,'' Kessel said. ``And now we spend a tenth
of the administration cost for those desktops that we do for the
rest of the 315 we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he met resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal department says, `When it fails, who do we sue?' ''
he said. ``The IT department says, `It's not a proved product.'
Corporate security says, `It's hackerware.' But it's the only thing
that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent Linux converts include the movie director James
Cameron's special-effects company, Digital Domain, which used the
operating system to help create the illusions in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the city of Medina, Wash., was overwhelmed by documents
_ including the four file cabinets filled with paperwork on the
mansion built by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates _ it installed an
electronic document retrieval system that runs on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jones, president of Archive Retrieval, which installed the
system for Medina, said he was aware of an irony in his choice of
an operating system. But he recalled feeling vindicated when a bug
arose in the scanning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked a question on the Internet, and within a couple of
hours we had an answer,'' Jones said. ``I fixed it myself with
three lines of code. With a commercial product I'd have had to wait
for Microsoft to fix it _ if it ever did. This way, the whole Linux
community benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ewing, 29, who started Red Hat in 1995 because he found
downloading the various pieces of Linux a major headache, said
developing software in isolation _ without public contributions _
``would be like typing with one arm.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet for Linux to ever compete with Windows, it must be
easier to use. Now users must control Linux with a complicated
syntax of arcane commands. So Ewing oversees six programmers
working on a project called Gnome, an effort to hide the nuts and
bolts of the operating system behind the kind of graphical
interface familiar to users of Macintosh or Windows machines.
</P>
<P>
   While they sleep, other groups elsewhere in the world are
getting up to work on Gnome. Often by the next morning, someone
will have translated the code into Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   But Torvalds, who now works for a chip design company in Silicon
Valley, insists that the true strength of an operating system is
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use a Windows machine and the golden rule is: Save, and
save often,'' Torvalds said. ``It's scary how people have grown
used to the idea that computers are unreliable when it is not the
computer at all _ it's the operating system that just doesn't cut
it.''

</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before last spring's traditional April 18
commemoration of the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake, admirers
of Lotta's Fountain began complaining about the condition of the
seemingly abandoned Market Street monument. Money would be
allocated, said city officials, and a six-month restoration project
would begin in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when summer had ended, they said that restoration
costs had been budgeted, and that the work probably will begin in
November, certainly in time for next year's April 18 ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The job is complicated and needs ``a lot of coordinating,''
 &UR; Debra Lehane &LR;  of the Art Commission told Personals. ``The
groundwork is being laid.''
</P>

   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; GETTING ALONG WELL WITH OTHERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``How would the boss feel about a staffer dating an intern?''
was a question posed by the Washington newspaper The Hill to staff
members in Congressional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Strom Thurmond &LR; , 95-year-old South Carolina Republican,
met his wife, &UR; Nancy &LR; , when she was his intern. His current position
on staff socializing: ``I don't think it would be a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Ted Kennedy &LR; , D-Mass., renowned socializer, says he has
no official policy.
</P>
<P>
   Senator  &UR; Phil Gramm &LR; , R-Texas, said he would be uncomfortable
with a superior dating an underling, but ``I believe in love and
marriage and support them both.'' Senator  &UR; Orrin Hatch &LR; , R-Utah,
was equally sentimental _ ``I don't have a problem with two young
people getting together,'' he said _ but told The Hill he wouldn't
approve of a married man dating one of his interns (apparently
foreseeing no possibility of a married woman dating a male intern).
</P>
<P>
   The strictest rules are in force in the office of House
Judiciary Committee member  &UR; Asa Hutchinson &LR; , R-Ark. ``Any dating
between interns and staff members is strictly prohibited,'' says
his intern policy handbook, ``and will result in the termination of
employment for both involved parties.'' Hutchinson also insists, in
writing, that interns are ``responsible for the cleanliness of
their work area.''
</P>

   P.S.  &UR; Adrienne Biggs &LR;  noticed that the online auction house eBay
offers new ``and in mint condition'' White House intern program

HOLLYWOOD STILL EMBRACING CLINTON, SCANDAL AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Madonna dropped in on Saturday night at a
Democratic fund-raiser in Beverly Hills honoring President Clinton.
Barbra Streisand defended Clinton the other day and said that many
of the greatest presidents seem to have had affairs, too. And David
Geffen and other moguls said that Clinton's personal life was his
own business.
</P>
<P>
   They still adore Bill Clinton in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   No president, including John F. Kennedy, has worked the powerful
and rich Democratic establishment in Hollywood like Clinton. While
several Democrats here are privately upset, most of them, at least
publicly, are still firmly behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He outdoes JFK,'' remarked Lew Wasserman, the 85-year-old
former chairman of MCA Inc., and the dominant Democratic mogul and
fund-raiser here since the days of Harry S. Truman. ``He works the
crowd here, and he sees them as friends. They genuinely like him.
There's no decline in support. So he made a mistake. He said he was
sorry. What else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Democrats, Clinton has come to Hollywood in recent
years with hat-in-hand to raise campaign money from the swarm of
wealthy liberal Democrats in the entertainment business. Saturday
night was no exception: He attended a dinner at the mansion of Haim
Saban, co-owner of Fox Kids Worldwide Inc., that raised $1.5
million for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other Democrats, who sometimes privately resent the
posturing of what one top producer here termed ``rich, liberal
do-gooders,'' Clinton seems, by all accounts, to enjoy coming here,
and not only for the money.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hollywood community, at least the Democratic part of it,
seems to see the president as one of their own. Part of it is
generational _ many of the most powerful people are members of the
baby boom, just like Clinton. And, on a personal level, Clinton is
thoroughly identifiable to many people here _ not only his charisma
and star qualities, but his complicated marriage to a powerful
woman, his compromises and, of course, his scandalous behavior with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a set of contradictions, and many of those
contradictions work quite well within the moral structure of
Hollywood,'' said Marshall Herskovitz, a Democrat who was producer
of the television series ``thirtysomething,'' and is now a film
director. ``The scandal is really a referendum on sexual morality
in the country. Those people whose sexual morality accepts the
possibility of complexity and ambivalence in a marital relationship
have not judged Clinton as badly as those who see marriage as a
monolithic simple entity. And in Hollywood, marriage is often not
seen as a monolithic simple entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniel, a producer and activist Democrat, put it more
bluntly. ``Hollywood has seen worse,'' he said. ``When it comes to
private matters, Hollywood has made its peace with far more
scandalous behavior. And there's an understanding here that you can
have a messed-up private life and still do good work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, Clinton's personal tastes and style seem to mirror
(like few presidents) the tastes and style of many of those
executives and even stars, like Ms. Streisand, Tom Hanks, Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Rob Reiner and others, who support
him. Clinton, for example, gave Ms. Lewinsky an Annie Lennox CD,
listens to Sarah McLachlan, the Canadian singer and Lilith Fair
founder, and was the first president to invite a rock musician, Lou
Reed, to perform at a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tinge of show business about Clinton, and people
here recognize that,'' said Larry Gelbart, a Democrat, who created
the television show, ``M.A.S.H.,'' and co-wrote the film,
``Tootsie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His glamour is almost in his ordinariness _ he hasn't got
Kennedy's dash or classic good looks. But there's something about
him that people recognize here. He likes a walk on the wild side.
And he doesn't feel he sullies himself by going around with actors
or glamorous people.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Marty Kaplan, who is former chief speechwriter for
Vice President Walter Mondale, has written screenplays (''The
Distinguished Gentleman'') and is now associate dean at the
University of Southern California Annenberg School for
Communications, said Clinton, flaws and all, was the perfect
Hollywood president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to cast the presidency, they want to cast it
with someone who's idealistic, young and energetic _ and Clinton is
happy to fill that need,'' said Kaplan. ``Sure, people are
privately feeling devastated or betrayed or hurt. Somehow, it's one
part Capra film, one part Michael Douglas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's most fervent high-profile supporters are
unwavering, although one of them, Steve Tisch, a producer and
member of the wealthy Tisch family, said that, for the moment, he
wanted to curtail campaign contributions. ``I've got to respect
someone and the process a lot more before I start writing checks,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said privately that Clinton's support in Hollywood was
actually paper-thin, and that if his favorable poll ratings fall
sharply, the Hollywood community will follow suit. ``If Clinton
becomes an embarrassment, this town will drop him like a hot potato
because Hollywood does not like to be embarrassed; it likes to be
cool, it likes to be with a winner,'' said David Horowitz, a
Republican who is president of the Center for the Study of Popular
Culture, a conservative-oriented group based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But others made it plain that they were far more offended by
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr than Clinton _ and
that their support for the president was resolute. ``People
understand what this whole thing is about _ most people feel
there's a big difference between running the country and one's
private life,'' said Geffen, a co-founder of Dreamworks and a
prominent Clinton supporter who, like others here, have stayed
overnight at the White House. ``Even though his private behavior is
regrettable, his handling of the country is exemplary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streisand said, ``The Republicans want to impeach! Impeach
for what? What they can't stand is that this president disagrees
with their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to say that former presidents, ranging from Thomas
Jefferson to Kennedy, also had extramarital affairs but that the
press no longer ``respected the boundaries between public and
private behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friendships with such figures as Geffen, Spielberg and
Katzenberg, who own Dreamworks, has led to reports and speculation
that the president would one day move to Los Angeles and work at
the company. There have also been reports that Dreamworks and Tom
Hanks were planning to buy a home for the Clintons. Andy Spahn,
head of corporate affairs for Dreamworks, said, ``There's no truth
to any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000-per-person dinner at the home of Saban Saturday night
included such entertainment figures as Madonna, who stayed briefly;
Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown; and Mimi Rogers, the actress.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is in a tough re-election fight, as well as
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, were
among the politicians who also attended the event. Clinton did not
directly discuss the scandal but cited the ``rancor of Washington''
which, he said, ``undermines what we so desperately need in this
country now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton is hardly universally welcomed in Hollywood.
Actor Charlton Heston, a Republican, spoke acidly about Hollywood's
identification with Clinton. ``Hollywood is a fairly active town
sexually,'' he said. ``The community has been overwhelmingly
left-liberal for a long time. They'd be disinclined to turn away
from Clinton or take this sex issue very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Price, a former studio chief who describes himself as
a liberal Republican, said he was dismayed _ but not too surprised
_ at the double standards of Hollywood. Take the V-chip, he said,
which is supported by the administration and designed to restrict
children's access to certain television programming. ``Had a
Republican administration tried to put through something like this,
the cries of outrage in Hollywood would have been deafening,'' he
said. ``With Clinton it was muted.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Lionel Chetwynd, a writer and director who is a
Republican, echoed the views of even the most fervent Clinton
supporters. ``He's an extension of their own personalities,'' said
Chetwynd. ``They're very comfortable with him. His flaws are very
understandable to them and very digestable.''

SENATE MAY VOTE ON MODERNIZING FINANCIAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, efforts to lift Depression-era
regulations on the nation's financial services industry have come
to no avail. But that may end this week, as a measure to modernize
the industry, one long written off as dead, is showing remarkable
signs of life in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services businesses lobbied heavily late last week
and over the weekend, as the Senate prepared to vote this week on
the measure, which would make it easier for banks, brokers and
insurance companies to merge into huge financial conglomerates. By
last count, it appeared that the Senate leadership was close to
corralling the 60 votes needed to cut off any filibuster and allow
for a floor vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, compromises carefully worked out between
insurance agents, consumer groups, Wall Street executives and
bankers appeared to be holding, though some outstanding issues
remained to be resolved. ``The odds are favoring getting the bill
to the floor and it passing,'' said Kenneth Guenther, lobbyist for
the Independent Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would put into law what the marketplace, in large part,
is already doing: It would provide for the creation of huge
financial conglomerates able to underwrite securities, sell
insurance and take bank deposits, all under one roof. It would do
so by overturning the Glass-Steagall Act, written during the
Depression, and the Bank Holding Company Act, written in the 1950s,
that erected walls between commercial and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed this measure by a single vote in May, and its
backers are racing to gain Senate approval before Congress adjourns
in October. ``Time is our main enemy right now,'' a Wall Street
lobbyist said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders are trying to work out as many problems as
possible so the bill can be considered on the floor with few
disruptions. At the same time, the lobbying machine is cranking up:
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is planning radio ads in Washington on the
morning Don Imus program; insurance agents across the country plan
to work on grass-roots telephone banks, and a letter has been sent
by 50 top financial executives to all senators warning of dire
financial consequences if the bill is not passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply must modernize our own financial system,'' the
letter says, ``if America is going to credibly advocate financial
sector reform in Japan, Southeast Asia and other parts of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Those signing it included Jon Corzine of Goldman, Sachs; Harvey
Golub of American Express; Richard Grasso of the New York Stock
Exchange and David Komansky of Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle appears to be Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who
opposes expansion of government requirements that financial
services companies provide low-cost banking services to low- and
moderate-income consumers. He has threatened to ``body block'' the
bill with a filibuster, several lobbyists say, if it is not
modified.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues still in play include a provision that would
prevent savings and loans from being sold to commercial businesses;
Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan, is leading a
battle against this. Efforts are also under way to smooth out a
dispute between banks and insurance agents over the regulation of
bank sales of insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   A big obstacle to the bill's becoming law is a threatened veto
by President Clinton over a provision that favors the Federal
Reserve in the financial regulatory structure at the expense of the
office of the comptroller of the currency, a branch of the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But many say that Clinton will be hard pressed to make good on
that threat because of current global economic turmoil. And amid
impeachment talk, the president needs the support of congressional
Democrats who are behind the measure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the bill clears the Senate, it would land on the president's
desk just about the time a meeting of international central bankers
called by the Fed and the Treasury Department to address the global
financial crisis convenes in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One of its main topics is a push by U.S. officials for other
countries to modernize their financial services industries _ making
it difficult for Clinton to veto a bill to do just that in the
United States. ``How can the president veto the bill while asking
others to modernize their financial systems,'' a banking lobbyist
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It would undermine our
ability to restore world financial confidence.''

THE POST-LEWINSKY WINNER IS THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LISA NAPOLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Longtime users of the Internet often laugh when mainstream media
talk about ``defining moments for the Net.'' To them, it was
defined long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few weeks the Internet has done more than
promote discussion and information about a big news event, as it
did during last summer's Mars Pathfinder exploration or in the
aftermath of the death of Diana, princess of Wales. It has played a
pivotal role in news events _ the release of the Starr report and
President Clinton's videotaped testimony before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Each medium has created its own dynamics, its own archetypes and
behavior. Movies led to the cult of the movie star and the movie
buff, radio to the news broadcast, television to the couch potato
and the talking heads. What hints of the future lay in the coverage
of the Lewinsky matter on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   _ Television Transcends the Den. Video of the president's grand
jury testimony appeared on World Wide Web sites, creating a hefty
new audience: the workplace. Adam Clayton Powell 3rd of the Freedom
Forum in Arlington, Va., said, ``Think of all of the workplace
desks that have PCs but no TVs, and you begin to appreciate a very
large potential audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of several cable channels claim wider online
viewership than their televised components. The Clinton testimony
underscored that the biggest concern for employers may soon not be
the time-wasting employee who makes personal phone calls. And
computer connections are usually faster at the office than they are
at home _ making it easier, for example, to watch the Clinton
testimony on line from the office desk than from the den.
</P>
<P>
   As the power of the traditional networks continues to erode and
competition for viewers increases among cable channels, media
brands are seeking alternate ways to keep their names in the public
eye. The Web is just one of them; CNN Interactive, for instance,
just renewed its deal to provide news headlines to Pager Net, a
beeper provider that has 1.4 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Citizen as Editor. So you didn't kill four hours watching the
Clinton testimony _ either on the television or on your personal
computer. Perhaps you actually had something more important to do.
Perhaps you couldn't stand the commentary. So, in the dark of
night, you signed on to the Web and went to your favorite source.
It might have been a site from a traditional news organization. Or
maybe it was America Online. And you downloaded the bits and pieces
you wanted to see. On the Alta Vista search engine, you could even
type in a key word or phrase and search the entire four-hour video
for it. ``Now,'' promises the site, ``you don't have to watch the
entire four hours of testimony or depend on others to spoon-feed
you sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   With tools proliferating on the Net that allow users to pick and
choose sports scores, stock quotes and stories that are of
interest, the individual has greater control over news consumption
_ and particularly over the time when the consumption actually
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   All this draws attention to the pressure of the 24-hour news
cycle. Tutored by CNN in the early 1980s, viewers learned to expect
news more on their own timetables. The Internet intensifies the
process. Television networks are no longer competing against only
one another, but with expanding offerings on their own and others'
Web sites, including those of newspapers. Newspapers must now
grapple with how to unload information in the course of the day,
rather than hoarding it until the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Digital Water Cooler. Once the cultural Zeitgeist was
reflected in the nightly Johnny Carson monologue or a ``Saturday
Night Live'' weekend sketch. Now, office chit-chat has been
enhanced by digital jabs and jokes that arrive in the e-mail
in-box. Faster than you can say ``Office of the Independent
Counsel,'' jokes about the presidential liaison, in particular,
have been darting across the Net. Some of the recent notables
include a song that mixes Clinton's confessional speech on Aug. 17
with an updated version of an Elton John song; a photograph from
what was described as an ``actual parade in Germany'' in which a
float depicts a giant Clinton figure grabbing the breasts of a
buxom Statue of Liberty; and a video file of Clinton's nose
growing, Pinocchio-style, as his campaign promises are recounted to
the tune of ``My Favorite Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Once cartoons were clipped from the daily newspaper and pinned
on the cubicle wall. Today jokes spread farther and wider by simply
pressing the forward button. ``Look at how much people are
depending on the Net for news,'' said Bob Hirschfeld, a satirist
who posts jabs daily on his Web site. ``The same thing is happening
with topical humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web also proves itself as a great place to spread
disinformation. Last week a flurry of e-mails quoted Kenneth Starr
as saying on a ``60 Minutes'' broadcast in 1987, ``Public media
should not contain explicit or implied descriptions of sex acts.''
The message was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defining Sex. Internet publishers scratched their heads about
how to deal with the salaciousness of the president's testimony. It
raised the larger questions of how _ or whether _ to regulate the
content of the Net and what role news organizations must play
online.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting episode: MSNBC took flak for bleeping out one
section of the testimony involving the now-infamous cigar _ not on
its cable station, but on its Web site. Yet, after the live
broadcast, a Web surfer could log onto the site and pull up the
entire speech, unedited. Why was it all right to provide the
salacious material in one setting but not the other?
</P>
<P>
   Governing what gets said online has been a political hot potato
since the birth of the Net, but the Starr report and the Clinton
testimony may strengthen efforts in Congress to pass bills that
would fine even a news organization for posting content deemed
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what did most people read of the Starr report? The
dirty stuff. One ratings service found that more people read the
sections about sex than those about perjury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ Vox Populi. More each day, it often seems, the media culture
mirrors the surreal universe presented in the movie ``Network.''
There is no vein-popping Howard Beale commanding disgusted
television viewers to throw their television sets out the window,
but that is because with the growing popularity of online chat
rooms, who needs Howard Beale? For that matter, who needs to wait
on the phone to ask a question on ``Larry King Live'' or rant on a
local radio talk show?
</P>
<P>
   As the president's speech rolled, chat rooms on America Online
were filled to capacity and bulletin boards allowing expressions of
opinion there and on news Web sites overflowed. Not every event
elicits such passion, of course, but this one firmly establishes
the Net as the soapbox _ and barroom _ of our times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Triumph of the Nerds. Keep these players in mind:
Broadcast.com &UR;  &LR; and Real Networks, new media creatures that work on
the assumption that a network is not needed to broadcast video.
They present and aggregate video and audio events happening on the
Web, and they also provide technical help to the networks' Web
sites in times of great demand.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of live video on the Net is still primitive at worst
and unreliable at best, yet its sheer availability to anyone with
the proper gear is important. Wall Street clearly thinks so:
Broadcast.com's stock rose 22 percent on the day of the president's
taped broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rise of the On-Line Journalists. Since January, when the
one-man-band pundit and gossip Matt Drudge disclosed that Newsweek
was sitting on the Monica Lewinsky story, journalists have watched
in amazement as he has gained power. Now the host of his own
television show on Fox News, Drudge brags on his Web site that his
name came up six times in the Clinton testimony. He quotes the
president: ``Well, I had a little anxiety the next day, of course,
because of the Drudge Report.''
</P>
<P>
   The online magazine Salon, meanwhile, took heat for publishing a
report of an extramarital affair more than 30 years ago involving
Rep. Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who
is in charge of preliminary action toward impeachment proceedings
against the president. Salon's staff members had to evacuate their
offices because of a bomb threat, and they suffered a new type of
political vengeance. Protesters waged a ``fax attack,'' barraging
the magazine's machines in an effort to break them. And thousands
of e-mails from angry protesters clogged Salon's servers.

 &HT;    Exodus International aims to change gay behavior
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On two Thursdays each month, Les Michael
hurries from his job as a landscaper to a bright pink church on
Conniston Road in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a regular in the support group meetings there for
five years. In rapid bursts loaded with religion and recovery, he
tells the half-dozen men around him of the torment he has endured
through 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael speaks of his daily struggle against temptation and
relapse. He implores all to surrender to a higher power. The men
pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope,'' he says. ``There is a way out, and I have
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael and his group aren't trying to rid themselves of alcohol
or drug abuse. They seek to eliminate a behavior they believe is
just as destructive: homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The word behavior is essential to this meeting of the Worth
Creations ministry. Its followers think homosexuality is a behavior
rather than an orientation decided at birth. Their message is stop
having gay sex, and you stop being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception about us is that we are in denial,''
said Richard Culbertson, the group's director. ``If this is denial,
then that's fine with me because it works, and I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson, 59, said he rejected the gay lifestyle he was living
20 years ago and has been celibate since. In 1985, he formed Worthy
Creations and affiliated it with Exodus International, which for 25
years has served as the umbrella organization for scores of
ministries whose stated purpose is to turn gays straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists argue that there is neither need nor justification
for turning people away from what they are and that the Exodus
movement is intolerant and homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these folks operate on is that there's something wrong
with being the person you are,'' said Rebecca Isaacs of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C. ``For them,
it's not about freedom of choice but repression and brainwashing.
We would never condemn an individual who wants to be who they are.
Why do they?''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson insists that he does not recruit clients from the gay
community. He says Worthy Creations exists only as an option for
those who want to change and offers them a bridge to return to the
traditional church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay community has a lot of legitimate gripes against the
church,'' he said. ``For years, churches have said they've hated
the sin but loved the sinner. Yet they've also said we don't want
them in our churches. Because of Exodus, these people have been
able to find a way back to Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the sexual conversion movement was invigorated by a
national advertising campaign sponsored by the Center for
Reclaiming America, a conservative Christian ministry founded in
Fort Lauderdale by D. James Kennedy. Culbertson has his office in
the Federal Highway building operated by Kennedy's Coral Ridge
Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most exciting time for us I can remember,''
Culbertson said. ``Up until now, we've been the best-kept secret in
South Florida. But with Reclaiming America's help, we're getting
our message out and letting people know that there is hope for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a ``truth in love'' campaign, the Center for
Reclaiming America spent more than $200,000 for full-page ads in
USA Today, the New York Times and the Washington Post. It is the
beginning of a media blitz that is aimed at the fall elections and
has the financial and spiritual blessings of groups such as the
Christian Coalition, Concerned Women for America, the Family
Research Council and the American Family Association.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign grew from criticism leveled at pro football
player Reggie White and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott over
recent statements on homosexuality. Lott likened it to an
addiction; the Green Bay Packers' White referred to it as ``one of
the biggest sins in the Bible'' in a speech to the Wisconsin
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Reclaiming America said it has launched its
counteroffensive in the interest of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone tell you it isn't a homophobic campaign,''
Isaacs said. ``The right saw this as a really good issue to take
into the November elections. They always have to have one major
enemy, one scapegoat. Communism is dead. How about gay people?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McWhorter, executive director of Compass Inc., Palm Beach
County's gay services organization, takes issue with the Exodus
call for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that there's nothing to convert people
to or from,'' McWhorter said. ``But if it's a religious belief,
everyone in this country has a right to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and medical professionals also have voiced opposition
to the Exodus approach. The nation's largest society of
psychologists last year passed a resolution aimed at discrediting
therapeutic practices that attempt to change sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association, by a vote of 106-4,
renounced conversion therapy and endorsed the American Psychiatric
Association position that homosexuality is not a mental illness
that needs fixing. Both groups say conversion attempts are
ineffective and can be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science may be inconclusive,'' Culbertson said. ``But if
you're able to change your lifestyle, then that change is
conclusive for you. For me, this is conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson says he has no statistical evidence on how successful
Worthy Creations has been through its 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the scientific resources to keep tabs on
people,'' he said. ``But I know of dozens of people who have
changed their lifestyle. Some have gotten married, had children and
raised families.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of the people who come to Worthy Creations
meetings are male. Groups meet in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale and
in West Palm Beach at the Lighthouse Christian Center. Those who
attend quote scripture and offer personal testimonies much like a
12-step program. Exodus claims to have counseled 200,000 nationally
since 1976; Culbertson says about 500 people participate in his
ministry each year and that he has reached ``several thousand'' in
its 14-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that women have a much harder time getting out because
of the emotional bonds they form,'' Culbertson said. ``The reason
most people fail is because of a lack of resolve. It is like an
alcoholic in some respects. You get to a point where you want to
change, but you go out and fall again.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond treating homosexuality as a psychological disorder,
conversion ministries also regard it as a moral transgression, a
sin: ``We base our presentation on the Bible, which states clearly
that homosexual behavior is not in God's plan for men and women,''
Exodus states in published literature. ``We're not condemning
anyone. At the same time, it isn't unloving to talk about sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Professing a different theological view is the Universal
Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, a California-based
Christian ministry that embraces gay, bisexual and trans-gender
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scripture Exodus always quotes is from the Old
Testament,'' said Frank Zerilli of Metropolitan's world center in
West Hollywood, Calif. ``Well, you can find people in the Old
Testament condemned for eating shrimp or condemned for eating
oysters or condemned for wearing different color clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is that Jesus said absolutely nothing on the
subject of sexual orientation. If it is so important to salvation,
why didn't he say something about it? He didn't because it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 congregations in 19 countries have Metropolitan
Community affiliation, including churches in West Palm Beach,
Delray Beach and Boca Raton. The church was founded in 1968 and has
grown steadily, drawing followers who felt ostracized by more
conservative ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the church owes the gay community an apology,''
Culbertson said. ``The church has not reached out to them the way
it should have. They are the un-harvested harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl, who asks that his surname be withheld, is a 40-year-old
construction contractor from Lake Worth. He is married with three
children and says he has engaged in homosexual sex before and
during his marriage. For the last six weeks, he has been attending
Worthy Creations meetings in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the church understood or was willing to help me
until I found this group,'' Earl said. ``When I went to my pastor
and told him about my homosexual tendencies, he told me to go out
and have sex with a female prostitute. This way is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael says he went through a decade of emotional turmoil after
he and his wife divorced in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always had homosexual tendencies and urges, but I fell
into the gay lifestyle totally after my divorce,'' he said. ``I did
all the bath houses. I abused alcohol. I nearly overdosed on drugs.
I lost my job. I just wasn't happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sober for 14 years, Michael, a hyperactive man who puts Jesus in
most paragraphs, says he has found a serenity he never had until he
joined Worthy Creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only true fulfillment is in a relationship with Jesus
Christ,'' he said. ``My friends in the gay community think I'm a
turncoat. But this is what I want and what I need. I have never met
a homosexual who was really happy _ really happy in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael says he still has occasional twinges of attraction
toward men but that those have diminished through the years. He
said he has made two attempts to have relationships with women, but
those quickly failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exodus is not for everybody,'' he said. ``You have to want to
change. Once you do, you learn that you can have something that's
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael said he is celibate and hopes to remain so.

<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Could Boulder, the liberal lighthouse of the
Rockies, send a Republican to Congress?
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a quarter century, Colorado's 2nd District has been a
safe seat for Democrats _ and an altar for Republican sacrificial
lambs. The last Republican to run from this district, Pat Miller,
vowed to be the ``voice'' of paramilitary groups in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But now the GOP have fielded Robert Greenlee, a moderate who
favors abortion rights and enjoys a wide following as Boulder's
first Republican mayor since 1971. A self-made millionaire,
Greenlee, 57, has deep pockets to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Mark Udall, who is in his first term as a
state representative, is mounting what appears to be an equally
strong candidacy. An heir to the Udall Western political legacy
forged by his father, Morris, a former congressman, and uncle,
Stewart, who was Interior Secretary as well as a congressman, the
48-year-old Udall enjoys fervent support from local and national
environmental groups. An avid mountain climber in a district where
outdoor recreation is king, Udall directed the Colorado Outward
Bound School for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   No opinion polls have been taken, but among Colorado's six House
races, this one is seen as the only truly competitive race this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two of the most progressive people in state politics
running against each other,'' said Timothy Wirth, a liberal
Democrat who represented this district from 1974 to 1986. ``It's
now going to be an extremely interesting race.''
</P>
<P>
   Both national parties focused on the district immediately after
David Skaggs, the Democratic incumbent, announced last year that he
would not run for re-election after completing his sixth term. A
liberal stalwart of the House, Skaggs has received a near perfect
voting rating from liberal groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans took aim at the seat, noting it was one of only
16 nationwide where Democratic incumbents were not seeking
re-election. The Democrat Party is determined to hold onto the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race we are pretty excited about,'' said Thomas
Eisenhauer, a political strategist from the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, who traveled from Washington to
attend a debate between the two candidates on Wednesday. ``Mark is
a really strong candidate who proved in the primary he can raise
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall was a long shot this year when he won a crowded primary,
defeating better known candidates in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Udall's image is not of a strict Democratic partisan, but much
more of a thinking environmentalist,'' said Floyd Ciruli, president
of a polling and political consulting company in Denver. ``Udall
not only has the cachet of the name, but also the ability to raise
money around the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   That ability is a special asset in this race, said Ciruli, who
predicted that it would be the most expensive House campaign in
Colorado history, costing about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The district centered on Boulder is no longer a safe seat for
Democrats because of several factors. The seven states in the Rocky
Mountain State time zone arguably have become the nation's most
consistently Republican region, with only three Democrats serving
in the House _ Reps. Skaggs, Diana DeGette of Colorado's First
District, which includes Denver, and Ed Pastor of Arizona's Second
District. Republicans also control the legislatures in six of the
seven states, the exception being New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade in Colorado, Republicans have become the
party with the largest number of registered voters, 35 percent to
30 percent. In that time, the Congressional delegation has shifted
from an even balance to 6-2 favoring the Republicans. In the 2nd
District, once firmly Democratic, voter registration gives the
party only a small edge over the Republicans, 32 percent to 30
percent. The rest are independents.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic control of the seat here dates to 1974, when the
party's candidates were swept into office around the nation, riding
a wave of anger over Watergate and President Richard M. Nixon, who
had just resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a parallel, but I don't think that Clinton's
problems resonate in the same way that Nixon's problems resonated
with voting public,'' said Paul Talmey, president of a Boulder
polling company. ``Today, the world is at peace, the economy is
doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong debate between Udall and Greenlee on Wednesday,
and the question-and-answer session that followed, the subject of
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky never came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very good sign,'' Udall said. ``Last night, I was
out knocking on doors, and it came up a few times. Mostly to say,
`We are sick of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate, Greenlee said: ``I don't intend on using it
in my campaign. But it's like a 350-pound gorilla. It's out
there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Addressing a business audience, Greenlee painted himself as an
entrepreneur who had ``started 12 businesses'' and fought
``government regulations.'' He called for overhauling the Internal
Revenue Service, paying down the national debt, instituting a
system in which government vouchers could be used to pay for
private schooling, and giving more opportunities to people in
contrast to the government.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed his success in building two of the Denver area's
largest radio stations and a major restaurant chain. Apparently out
of deference to the religious right, his campaign literature does
not mention that he also is a major investor in Colorado's largest
casino.
</P>
<P>
   In a deliberate appeal to the lesser-known side of the 2nd
District, Greenlee has placed his campaign headquarters not in
Boulder, but in Broomfield, a fast growing suburb where
high-technology companies are setting up shop.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Coloradans are to vote an initiative that would
make Broomfield the state's first new county in 85 years.
</P>
<P>
   Voting registration records in the 2nd District show that more
newcomers are registering Republican than Democrat. Udall, aware
that the district is still dominated by the University of
Colorado's largest campus, called for strengthening public
education.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, Udall came off as a more polished campaigner than
his adversary, who has served on the Boulder City Council for the
last 15 years. While answering questions from the audience, Udall
managed to tip his hat to two locally prominent Democrats attending
the debate, a county attorney and a state senator, and to mention
that his 74-year-old mother, Pat, is a Colorado native and a
resident of Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, without opinion polls, it is unclear who has the
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a lifelong Democrat, but for the first time in my life, I
don't know who I will vote for,'' said Russell Shaw, a systems
theory consultant, who attended the debate. ``They are offering
different philosophies. Udall is trying to fix things. Greenlee is
trying to empower citizens, instead of the government.''

 &HT;    STRUGGLING TO COPE IN AFTERMATH, DOMINICANS LOOK TO 'SAMMY' FOR
INSPIRATION
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO de MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ As Sammy Sosa came to
bat for the final time Sunday, the crowd of about 150 men in what
may have been the only place here, in his hometown with a working
television set chanted: ``Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!''
</P>
<P>
   The pool players stopped their games and crowded around the
large screen over the bar in the pool hall with the unusual name,
``Florimar Car Wash.''
</P>
<P>
   With a flash of his bat, Sosa hit a towering drive deep into
centerfield. The crowd shrieked with excitement, the noise so loud
it made peoples' ears ring. But as the ball sank for a long fly
out, the cheers turned to moans and cries of ``Oh, no!''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the bar, the chance to watch Sosa's bid to catch
homerun king Mark McGwire in the last regular season game for Major
League Baseball -- though unsuccessful -- was a brief respite from
the struggle to put their lives back together since Hurricane
Georges crashed through here Tuesday killing at least 200 people,
and leaving more than 250,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro is on the eastern end of the island of Hispaniola --
which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti -- and bore much of
the brunt of the hurricane. Thousands of trees were toppled.
Buildings were crushed. Shattered signs lay twisted across
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Munoz, 22, had been repairing the roof on his home
with two friends when they stopped to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the hurricane passed, we have been fixing and helping
people ... but this is important,'' Munoz said inside the
sweltering bar. ``A lot of people whose houses were knocked down,
they are here waiting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a sports betting parlor, Juan Richards, 28, listened to
the game intently through a small radio earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Sammy Sosa is doing something grand. He is a hero for
us. He represents hope and success.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, whose house was largely destroyed by Georges, said
listening to the game gave him a chance to briefly put aside his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among all the bad, there is some good, and the good is Sammy
Sosa and this game today,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was frustration too. The electricity was out for the
fifth day and cable television was unavailable even in those
buildings were power was provided by a generator. In the betting
parlor, the men listlessly watched a television set showing a World
War II submarine movie. Florimar's bar had television through the
generosity of a consortium of television stations which provided
two satellite trucks to the town for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Sunday, on the streets of this gritty town of 120,000
life went on. Motorcycles, cars, trucks and an occasional
horse-drawn cart vied for the road. Men shovelled mounds of debris
into overloaded trucks. People gathered at outdoor cafes or sat
beside the open doors of houses and stores. In a plaza where Sosa
once shined shoes and washed cars, shoes were being shined and cars
were being washed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good for the future that God has given (Sosa).'' said
Eduard Torreano, 32, who once shined shoes and washed cars with
Sosa and now does it with others. ``He always comes back. We are
his people, he hasn't forgotten us.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tetelo Vargas stadium ``Home of the Dominican Big Leaguers,''
where Sosa once played baseball, young boys played stickball amid
toppled light towers and a collapsed centerfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is for Sammy,'' shouted an 11-year-old boy as he hit
what he claimed was his third home run of the day against his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they couldn't watch or listen to the game, Sosa was very
much on people's mind.
</P>
<P>
   At an outdoor pizzeria, patrons yelled ``Sammy Sosa,'' when a
couple of American reporters walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to win,'' said Richard Clement, 32. ``Everybody in
San Pedro likes him. We feel good for Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Rice Evanson, 48, sporting a Boston Red Sox baseball cap,
said ``Sammy has a big heart because he is believes in God and
feels for his country. He might live in North America, but he was
born in the Dominican Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered around town were evidence of the people's devotion to
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   On the dirty rear window of a car heading for the city, someone
had written ``Sammy 65.''
</P>
<P>
   A motorcycle bore a sticker: ``Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the window of the betting parlor, Sosa's name was written
with soap.
</P>
<P>
   At the 30-30 Plaza, a small horseshoe-shaped shopping center
which Sosa owns -- named Plaza 30-30, after his first 30-homer,
30-steal season -- a local radio station displayed a banner that
read ``step by step with Sammy.'' In the plaza's center, a small
statue of Sosa -- bat over his shoulder -- stood in a birdbath over
a non-working fountain.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that McGwire finished the season with an astounding 70
home runs -- four ahead of Sosa did not damped his countrymen's
support. Sosa has a final, though improbable chance of catching
McGwire Monday when the Chicago Cubs play the San Francisco Giants
in a sudden-death play-off game for the National League wildcard
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot of pride for Sosa, and I think tomorrow
when he wakes up that he will be able to do it,'' said David Milan
Rodriguez, 36, who was wearing a Sosa jersey. ``I have very strong
faith in Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sosa's 21-year-old younger brother, Carlos, the only member
of the family staying at the home Sosa built for his mother, said
he wouldn't be disappointed if McGwire finished first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always said that McGwire is the man,'' Carlos said. ``He
is a hero here and it's not that important that he break the
record. That's more important to the American press.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sosa said his brother -- who has already said he
would sell his 62nd home run ball to help the Dominican Republic --
cares about and will help his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy can only do so much because the infrastructure and
agriculture have been destroyed,'' the younger Sosa said, adding
that his brother's achievement as the second man to break the
homerun marks of 60 and 61 set by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris,
respectively, has been a tonic to this poor country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a symbol of hope and success.''

 &HT;    STRUGGLING TO COPE IN AFTERMATH, DOMINICANS LOOK TO 'SAMMY' FOR
INSPIRATION
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.

<P>
   SAN PEDRO de MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ As Sammy Sosa came to
bat for the final time Sunday, the crowd of about 150 men in what
may have been the only place here, in his hometown with a working
television set chanted: ``Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!''
</P>
<P>
   The pool players stopped their games and crowded around the
large screen over the bar in the pool hall with the unusual name,
``Florimar Car Wash.''
</P>
<P>
   With a flash of his bat, Sosa hit a towering drive deep into
centerfield. The crowd shrieked with excitement, the noise so loud
it made peoples' ears ring. But as the ball sank for a long fly
out, the cheers turned to moans and cries of ``Oh, no!''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the bar, the chance to watch Sosa's bid to catch
homerun king Mark McGwire in the last regular season game for Major
League Baseball -- though unsuccessful -- was a brief respite from
the struggle to put their lives back together since Hurricane
Georges crashed through here Tuesday killing at least 200 people,
and leaving more than 250,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro is on the eastern end of the island of Hispaniola --
which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti -- and bore much of
the brunt of the hurricane. Thousands of trees were toppled.
Buildings were crushed. Shattered signs lay twisted across
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Munoz, 22, had been repairing the roof on his home
with two friends when they stopped to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the hurricane passed, we have been fixing and helping
people ... but this is important,'' Munoz said inside the
sweltering bar. ``A lot of people whose houses were knocked down,
they are here waiting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a sports betting parlor, Juan Richards, 28, listened to
the game intently through a small radio earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Sammy Sosa is doing something grand. He is a hero for
us. He represents hope and success.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, whose house was largely destroyed by Georges, said
listening to the game gave him a chance to briefly put aside his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among all the bad, there is some good, and the good is Sammy
Sosa and this game today,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was frustration too. The electricity was out for the
fifth day and cable television was unavailable even in those
buildings were power was provided by a generator. In the betting
parlor, the men listlessly watched a television set showing a World
War II submarine movie. Florimar's bar had television through the
generosity of a consortium of television stations which provided

COMMENTARY: WOODROW WILSON LIVES! 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After World War I, President Woodrow Wilson had an
idealistic notion called ``the self-determination of nations'':
National boundaries should be drawn around peoples who have a
common language and cultural heritage. A generation later, in the
face of Nazi aggression, Churchill and Roosevelt made
``self-determination'' a part of the Atlantic Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, but it runs counter to every nation's natural
impulse to hold itself together. The U.S. fought a civil war
successfully to resist secession. Contrariwise, the Soviet Union
lost the power to retain Ukraine and the rest of its empire.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia today wants to hold on to a historic part of its
territory called Kosovo. But nine out of 10 people who live there
are ethnic Albanians. They want to break away from Serbia's
oppressive rule and determine their own political future.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Serbia says no. Branding an uprising there as
terrorism, Serbs under Slobodan Milosevic have driven a
quarter-million Kosovars from their homes; 50,000 are living in the
woods facing the oncoming winter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, world opinion has been demonizing Milosevic. This
is understandable; with his Nazi-style ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia,
he has shown himself to be demoniacal.
</P>
<P>
   But independent Bosnia, which Serbia invaded, is not Serbia's
own territory of Kosovo. The world cannot tell Milosevic to get out
or else. All the world can do is tell him to give more autonomy to
the Kosovars. But he says no, he's putting down an insurrection _
which is undeniable _ and his hard-line resonates with nationalist
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars, under siege, look to the U.N. to provide air cover
for their uprising; the U.N. looks to Europe; the Europeans look to
the U.S., and the U.S. looks around.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen says if Milosevic does not ease
up, NATO will respond ``sooner rather than later,'' a phrase
President Clinton made famous in another context. The Serbs
responded by turning up the heat on the luftetars, or rebels, by
burning villages.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where the age-old power of a nation to put down a
rebellion comes up against this generation's power of unacceptable
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, facing the prospect of television
coverage of tens of thousands of freezing refugees, will ultimately
order casualty-free missile attacks on Serbian bases. If that fails
to deter Belgrade, air strikes will hit Serbian depots and
airfields around Kosovo's main city of Pristina. Milosevic will
then suspend his war on civilians until our attention wanders.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened after our ``victory'' over Saddam Hussein.
Only when we saw the televised human tragedy of the Kurdish people,
with their biblical exodus from threatened extermination by
Saddam's airborne poison gas, did we create a sanctuary for them in
northern Iraq _ in effect, limiting Iraq's sovereignty in that
``no-flight zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with no formal announcement, a new policy is being backed
into by the Western world: If enough civilian lives are in danger
of starvation or massacre, and if intervention by airpower can make
a difference _ and if the U.S. takes the lead _ then an alliance of
nations will reluctantly act to impose a temporary, de facto
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   A courageous journalist from Kosovo came to my office the other
day. Veton Surroi, 37, editor of the independent daily Koha Ditore,
has seen his staff beaten by police, some of their homes shelled by
the Serbian Army. As a result, past U.S. promises of ``no repeat of
Bosnia'' have no meaning to him.
</P>
<P>
   He styles himself as a ``post-pessimist,'' in Bob Dylan's
phrase, because he believes ``Even when your world is crumbling,
you need to create some way ahead.'' He is sensible enough to call
for autonomy rather than independence: ``status cannot be resolved
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Needed now is a new policy of evolutionary self-determination
that time can advance or modify. Some leader must formulate and
sell a new form of shared sovereignty to accommodate insurgencies
and defuse ethnic conflict not just in Kosovo, but in other lands
where there can be no clear winner _ from Iraq to East Timor and
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   History awaits that newly practical and more sophisticated
Wilson, even as we must strike hard now to prevent unacceptable
suffering.

 &HT;    Inside College Football: UCLA, Miami to make up game
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some fallout from the weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ We have it on very good authority that UCLA and Miami will
make up their game, which was postponed last Saturday by Hurricane
Georges. Last Thursday Miami officials said the game was
``canceled'' and might not be played. They didn't count on the
immediate outcry from the football powers that be, who knew not
playing the game could potentially play havoc with the Bowl
Championship Series, especially if UCLA finishes 10-0. Take this to
the bank: The game will be played on Dec. 5, and CBS will get the
right of first refusal to broadcast the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of CBS, it's hard to understand why the network
passed on this week's game between Georgia and LSU, two undefeated
teams, to show Tennessee and twice-beaten Auburn at 3:30 p.m.. But
here's the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the grapevine is that CBS really wanted to do
Florida-Alabama, but when the Crimson Tide crashed at Arkansas,
that plan was scrapped. Since the broadcast will be national
instead of regional, the network gurus went with Tennessee, which
already has big wins over Syracuse and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extremely tough call, but we went with the
highest-ranked team (Tennessee) in a game we feel will be very
competitive,'' said Mike Aresco, the vice president for college
programming at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is the beneficiary of this largess, and will show
Georgia-LSU at 7 p.m. Florida at Alabama, goes to Jefferson-Pilot
at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson and South Carolina are both 1-3 after ugly home losses
to Wake Forest (29-19) and Mississippi State (38-0) respectively.
But here's the real reason why the two coaches, Tommy West and Brad
Scott, are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At Clemson's game, a crowd was generously ``announced'' at
60,000 fans, leaving at least 21,000 empty seats at Memorial
Stadium. And it doesn't figure to get much better as the Tigers are
getting into the meat of their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, only 70,052 fans showed up, the smallest crowd
since Williams-Brice Stadium expanded to 80,000 in 1996. And most
of those were gone by halftime, when the Gamecocks trailed 28-0.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches can survive a lot of things, but not empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning QB: Some things you might have missed
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Couch is talented, but very much in need of a reality
check. Kentucky has won exactly two SEC games _ Alabama and
Vanderbilt last season _ with Couch at quarterback. Still, Couch is
feeling very confident after Saturday's 51-35 loss to Florida. In
fact, he predicted the Wildcats would win the rest of their games
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we made a whole lot of improvement,'' said Couch, who
threw for 406 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, as a football team, we think we are
going to run the table. We think we are going to win the rest of
our games and have a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's bound to make a few bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorado was very lucky to escape with an 18-16 win over
Baylor late Saturday night. The Buffaloes blew a 15-3 lead and lost
quarterback Mike Moschetti to a sprained ankle. Down 16-15,
Colorado rallied behind Adam Bledsoe, Drew's younger brother, and
got a 31-yard field goal with two minutes left to win.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our leading candidate for understatement of the year comes
from Prairie View coach Greg Johnson. Prairie View ended its NCAA
record 80-game losing streak by beating Langston 14-12 Saturday
night. Prairie View's last previous victory was Oct. 28, 1989. Said
Johnson, a former Langston coach: ``It was well overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The best game you didn't see Saturday involved Mississippi,
which rallied from a 22-point deficit with 9:45 left and beat SMU
in overtime 48-41. ``Nine minutes shouldn't be enough time to score
that many points,'' Rebels coach Tommy Tuberville said. ``But
that's the way it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince and Barbara Dooley were among the 22,281 fans at the
Cotton Bowl to view the game. The Dooley's youngest son, Derek, is
an assistant coach at SMU for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia
assistant and player.
</P>
<P>
   _ The second best game you didn't see was the longest in NCAA
history as Bethune-Cookman needed eight overtimes to beat Virginia
State 63-57. It was especially heart breaking for Virginia State,
which rallied from 26 points down.

 &HT;    LSU hopes Dogs have less offense
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia will get a taste of Saturday Night Live
when the Bulldogs travel to Baton Rouge to face sixth-ranked LSU
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because CBS Sports selected Saturday's Auburn-Tennessee contest
to broadcast at 3:30 p.m., ESPN picked up the Georgia-LSU game,
which will start at 7 p.m. Since 1960, LSU has a record of 165-51-4
in night games at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Idaho gain more than 400 yards offense against
the Tigers, LSU coach Gerry DiNardo is hoping Georgia's offense
won't have nearly as much bite.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers improved to 3-0 with a 53-20 homecoming win over
Idaho on Saturday, but LSU surrendered 410 yards, including 192
rushing yards on 43 attempts. The Tigers also lost three of four
fumbles, had an extra-point attempt blocked and botched a snap on a
kick attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that we won, and the team should be glad that we
won,'' DiNardo said. ``But there's no way that we're ready to play
six straight SEC games right now. We have a lot of work to do this
week. We didn't play real well on defense at all. We'll struggle
the next six weeks if we play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU tailback Kevin Faulk set a school record with 268
all-purpose yards and four touchdowns against the Vandals, giving
him 5,397 all-purpose yards in his brilliant career. Faulk had 178
yards rushing, 50 receiving and 40 in returns against Idaho. His
rushing yards came on only 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Herb Tyler is the nation's eighth-ranked passer,
throwing for 551 yards and six touchdowns on 40-of-59 passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really criticial that we tackle well playing against a
back like Faulk and a mobile quarterback like (Tyler),'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said. ``The only way you can do that is to have
more contact in practice. You couldn't do it in a game week, but we
were able to do it with the off-week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is the nation's eighth-ranked passer, throwing for 551
yards and six touchdowns on 40-of-59 passing.

 &HT;    Braves go out on high note; Mets go home
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The overture's last note sounded just as Mike Piazza's
pop-up settled into Tony Graffanino's glove for the 27th out, the
moment on Sunday that signaled the end of the beginning for the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They whipped New York one more time, 7-2, winning for the
seventh straight time, for the 14th time in 16 games, taking the NL
East by 18 games. While their League Division Series opponent is
still TBA, the Braves hung up No. 106 on the season's last day,
signaling the preliminary round is over. Before the sun went down,
the bunting was hung at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preseason is over now,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said.
``We can settle in.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but this regular season cannot pass without mention of
the 11 primary franchise records and three Atlanta records set by
these Braves. Only eight National League teams this century have
reached 106 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he wished he could upgrade for the playoff's second
season, general manager John Schuerholz said, ``Nothing. I like who
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this club,'' said shortstop Walt Weiss,
``especially after the way we played just three weeks ago. I wasn't
too sure what to expect. But we really played well the last 10 days
or so. I definitely feel good about where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta terminated the Mets with a barrage of doubles. They hit
seven on Sunday, 13 during the three-game series. Doubles accounted
for six runs in the final game. That those 13 doubles came from 12
different Braves says something about the way the team enters the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux earned his 18th victory, and while he allowed five
hits and a run before the bullpen took over, he avoided his first
winless month since 1990. He finished the season with an NL-low
2.22 ERA. The pitching staff wound up allowing 15 earned runs in
the last 12 games (1.26).
</P>
<P>
   ``For guys in here, it's pretty special to win more games than
any team in franchise history,'' Jones said. ``But I think everyone
is focused on something further down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   No Braves team since 1900 scored more in a season that this one.
No Braves team ever had better fielding (97 error-less games). No
major league team in 73 years had a more balanced pitching staff.
And they finished the schedule on a dead sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That what this team is all about -- the World Series,''
centerfielder Andruw Jones said. ``I think we have the team to do
it. And if we keep playing like we're playing right now, I think we
will get there.''

 &HT;    1998 Braves not your usual team
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since beginning their run in 1991, the Braves have
annually tossed old paper out of their record book as the club's
performances improved with each season. But season, they have
pulled out hunks of history.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Braves broke 11 franchise record as well as an Atlanta
record and this time, it wasn't about pitching. It was about
everything else. These Braves hit with more power and fielded
better than any this century.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can say the Atlanta Braves this year rely
solely on their pitching or rely solely on their hitting or
fielding or bullpen,'' said John Smoltz, who will start Game 1 of
Wednesday's League Division Series. ''We have a combination that
equated to 106 wins. When we've had guys who contributed things
this year on and off the field, you can't rely on one particular
area to win 106 games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the franchise records to fall:
</P>
<P>
   Runs (since 1900): 826. (Old record: 803 in 1964).
</P>
<P>
   Doubles: 297. (Old record: 284, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   Home runs: 215. (Old record: 207, 1966).
</P>
<P>
   Total bases: 2,483 (Old record: 2,425, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Extra-base hits: 538. (Old record: 489, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   RBI (since 1900): 794. (Old record: 758, 1973).
</P>
<P>
   Slugging percentage: 453. (Old record: 442, 1957).
</P>
<P>
   Most hit by pitch: 61. (Old record: 51, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Fewest errors: 91. (Old record: 108, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Highest fielding average: .985 (Old record: .983, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Most error-less games: 97. (Old record: 90, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta records:
</P>
<P>
   Most runs: 826. (Old record: 799, 1973).
</P>
<P>
   Tied highest batting average: .272. (Set 1983).
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good season,'' said Chipper Jones. ''Everybody had a
good season.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster making
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will not make up the roster for the League Division
Series until late Monday or Tuesday but will wait until the
deadline of 9 a.m. Wednesday to file it with the National League
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no need to (file before then),'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ''It'd be crazy to do it because you can't change it once
it's in. We could go out Tuesday and somebody gets hurt and if
you're already submitted, you're put of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   No rest
</P>
<P>
   Cox didn't order the Braves to work out today. The weatherman
did.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, I'd give them a day off Monday,'' Cox said, ''but
Tuesday with the
</P>
<P>
   rain coming in, there's a great chance we may not get on the
field. We can get on (today) but maybe not Tuesday and maybe not
even the start of the playoffs (Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the club will work out at noon. Plans for Tuesday have
not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's take
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux reached 18 victories for the seventh time in his
career and his 2.22 ERA wound up the fifth lowest he has posted in
his 12-year career. This is the same pitcher who just came out of a
five-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll take some time off,'' said Maddux, who is not scheduled
to pitch until Game 3 of the LDS on Saturday. ''But mentally and
physically, I think I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   While that news rang gladly through the clubhouse, it was not
the best sign that Maddux saw over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to see (second baseman Keith) Lockhart and
(shortstop Walt) Weiss out there at the same time,'' Maddux said.
''That's a big lift for us. Those two guys are a huge reason why we
won a lot of games in April and May, a huge reason. We got them
back together.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lockhart and Weiss started this season, the Braves went
42-16.

 &HT;    Mets needed pinch-hitter in 2nd
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that it was all said and done, there was little
left to say or do, if you're thinking Braves. I did hear somebody
drop this little pearl about Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager who
holds himself in high esteem: ``If Bobby Valentine had known it was
going to be this way, he'd never have invented baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody asked me, but I could have helped the little
genius Sunday afternoon. Last game of the season, one game back of
the Cubs and Giants, one last gasp left. Mets load the bases in the
second inning and the pitcher, Armando Reynoso, coming to bat with
two out. The Mexican from San Luis Potosi has never beaten the
Braves, the team that brought him to the major leagues, and they
already have touched him for a run in the first inning. Pinch-hit
for him. The Mets still had a chance, slim as it was. You need
desperately to win. You need runs. You've got a dugout full of
fresh arms and they've got all winter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso grounds out, three runs die on base. The Braves take him
apart the next inning. They bat around and score six runs, and the
big hit is delivered by Greg Maddux. He scorches one to the center
field wall, drives in a run and wins the ``Silver Slugger,'' a
trophy limited to the private pitching club. When Maddux
punch-bunted a single the next time up, he nailed it down. His
booming average was .240.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have seen why the Mets fell from grace, suppose we
take a look at a crowded Sunday afternoon. Television is trying to
cover Mark McGwire in St. Louis, Sammy Sosa in Houston, an almost
no-hitter by a rookie named Halladay pitching for Toronto,
automobile racing, two golf tournaments, and happily, Bill Clinton
had the day off. It was like a thunderstorm breaking out over your
head.
</P>
<P>
   The screen flashed to St.Louis and McGwire hit another home run,
his 69th. He had tied Joe Hauser, who hit 69 in Minneapolis, and
Bob Crues, who hit 69 in one of those West Texas minor leagues.
Sosa drove in a run for the Cubs with a single, as big as any home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Miko Haakinen won a Formula One race on some side of another
continent. A NASCAR race was roaring on. NFL football scores
flashed across the screen. The despondent Washington Redskins were
getting trumped again. Terry Mulholland, the pitcher, drove in a
pair of runs for the Cubs. (See, Bobby Valentine?)
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit another home run, his 70th. He had passed Hauser and
Crues, but he wouldn't catch Joe Bauman. Joe is the old first
baseman/filling station guy who hit 72 in the Longhorn League. In
138 games. Let McGwire try that. Too bad, so sad for Sammy, as the
home runs fall, but he had bigger fish to try.
</P>
<P>
   Down in his private box, Ted Turner had come to celebrate the
ending of another bumptious season. The Braves were rollicking
along and Bobby Cox was clearing the bench. In the old minor
leagues, some managers would give players a chance to play any
position they wanted to on the last day of the season. Nothing at
stake. Have fun.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte, a Washington farm club then, the catcher had said,
``I can pitch better than some of these guys I'm catching.'' So he
got his chance to pitch on closing day. The game went 22 innings
and Red Barbary, the catcher, not only pitched the distance, he
drove in the winning run. Sadly, he also had thrown his arm away,
and a promising career with it. Clark Griffith, who owned the
Senators, fired the manager. Red Barbary went back to the mill team
in South Carolina, but he lived happily ever after. And still does.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Democrats and the White House, buoyed by polls,
sharpened their attacks against Republicans Sunday, three veteran
politicians said that there would be no deal between President
Clinton and Congress until after the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nonstarter,'' Bob Dole, a former presidential candidate
and Senate majority leader, said on the NBC program ``Meet the
Press.'' ``Look down the road three or four months, who knows, but
now it's a nonstarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's remarks met with agreement from Howard Baker, also a
former Senate Republican leader, and Leon Panetta, Clinton's former
White House chief of staff, who said the election's outcome posed a
more immediate dilemma for Clinton than the specter of impeachment.
All three men have been mentioned as possible mediators between
Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is going to tell us a lot more what happens here
with regards to the impeachment process than the impeachment
process itself,'' Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans win seats, especially in the Senate, ``I
think that's trouble for the president,'' Panetta said. If
Democrats win seats, he said, ``I think there is a much better
chance that this issue will be settled sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Heartened by recent national surveys that show a backlash
against Republicans for their handling of the scandal and for
releasing mounds of documents with lurid detail, Democrats
continued to float alternatives to impeachment Sunday, displaying
relief at the latest turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   His own confidence brimming anew, Clinton has now taken to
lashing out at Republicans for putting ``partisanship over
progress, politics over people,'' as he said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans bristle at the charge, saying they are busy passing
legislation, including tax cuts and spending bills, while Clinton
is off raising money, trying to change the subject and stirring up
partisan animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just more of their pattern of conduct that goes all
the way back to Arkansas, a pattern of conduct that's been
established now by Ken Starr of lying, of covering-up, of
stonewalling, and destroying your enemies,'' Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the Republican whip, said on the ABC program ``This Week
With San Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote in early October on
whether to go forward with an impeachment inquiry. This vote, if
successful, would be followed by a full House vote. If the
resolution passes the House, the committee would begin the
fact-finding and hearing phase of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to avoid impeachment hearings at this
point,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is on the panel, said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue from Clinton, his advisers and supporters
stepped up their campaigns Sunday and challenged Republicans to
make a decision as soon as possible on whether there is enough
evidence to impeach the president. If not, they said, the matter
should be dropped without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has been extremely critical
of the president's behavior, on Sunday gave Clinton her strongest
backing since his controversial Aug. 17 speech and painted the
impeachment proceedings as unjustifiably partisan. Judging from the
evidence so far, Ms. Feinstein said, the president should not be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to me so far that's come out to say that this
reaches the level of impeachment, where affairs of state, matters
of state, public policy are impacted in any way, shape or form by
this,'' Ms. Feinstein said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Carville, Clinton's adviser and most tenacious supporter,
took aim on the same program at the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, and also unloaded a volley of accusations against
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporal Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against
Newt Gingrich,'' Carville said. ``Because Newt Gingrich, this
entire thing has been under the orchestration, supervision and
direction of Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fought back by shifting the focus to the impeachment
proceedings. ``I don't read the polls,'' DeLay said, ``I read the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic offensive, with Clinton and his wife leading
the charge, did not sit well with all Democrats, some of whom
worried about antagonizing the very members of Congress who will
decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said he wished the Clintons had
not chosen to attack Republicans. ``I don't think that was
advisable,'' Kerry said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''

</HEADLINE>

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said on Sunday that the national elections here created
``some room for optimism'' for the future of Bosnia's shattered
society. However, he warned that Bosnian leaders had to make more
progress or risk losing international support.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the highest ranking American official to visit Bosnia
since elections here two weeks ago, said the United States was
pleased by the lack of unrest during voting and by the victories of
some moderate candidates, even though the Bosnian Serb leader
endorsed by America, Biljana Plavsic, lost her bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Poplasen, the leader of the Serb Radical Party who was a
paramilitary official during Bosnia's three-and-a-half-year war,
defeated Ms. Plavsic to become president of the Bosnian Serb
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen's election is widely seen as a setback for Western
efforts to reunite Bosnia. But the Clinton administration has found
promise in gains made by moderates in the Bosnian Serb parliament
and the half of Bosnia controlled by Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Since his victory, Poplasen, whose party calls for a
reunification of Bosnian Serbs with Yugoslavia, has pledged to
abide by the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the fighting in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that the United States is prepared to work with all
of the newly elected officials, as long as they support the Dayton
accords and do so not only with their words, but by their deeds,''
Cohen said during a news conference at the American Embassy on his
first visit to Bosnia's capital as secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before he arrived, under the cover of darkness,
American troops arrested a Bosnian Serb facing charges at the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Todorovic, a former chief of police in Bosanski Samac,
has been wanted by the tribunal for allegedly ordering and carrying
out murders, rapes, torture and other ``inhumane acts'' in his
village during June and July of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nato officials declined to discuss the details of the
operation, Todorovic is now the 37th accused war criminal _ out of
roughly 80 named in public or sealed indictments _ who has either
surrendered or been captured and turned over to the tribunal,
officials said. A year or so ago, there were only a handful in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the top international officials charged with bringing
peace to Bosnia, Cohen told them they had to improve coordination
of the myriad international and nonprofit efforts to rebuild the
country. Cohen saved his toughest public statements for the Bosnian
leaders, calling on all sides to end corruption, to build a
credible, unified police force and to protect refugees trying to
return to homes in areas dominated by other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Without progress, he warned, support would erode for the NATO
operation to help maintain peace in Bosnia.

DEMOCRATIC FAITHFUL RALLY ROUND CLINTON

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Outside, the signs were savage for President
Clinton in the six cities he visited over the weekend to raise
money for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oust the louse,'' said one sign in San Jose, Calif. In San
Diego, protesters held up a banner reading, ``If the dress won't
bleach, you must impeach.'' In Los Angeles, a man showed up along
the president's motorcade route dressed as a 6-foot-tall cigar. In
San Antonio, someone wired to a fence a scarecrow resembling Monica
Lewinsky wearing a blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the millionaires' homes where Clinton spent the
weekend raising nearly $4 million for Democratic candidates, the
reception was much warmer. In Silicon Valley, in Hollywood, in
south Texas, Clinton was embraced and praised by loyal Democratic
donors, who offered the president moral support as they opened
their wallets for the party.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising lunch in San Antonio Sunday afternoon, Ann
Richards, the former Texas governor, offered her own inimitable
endorsement of the beleaguered president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton isn't the first man I've had to forgive, and he
probably won't be the last,'' Ms. Richards said, as Clinton
guffawed.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Mauro, the Democratic candidate for Texas governor for
whom Clinton came here to campaign, offered the president an
unqualified public vote of confidence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bill Clinton, well, he's my friend,'' said Mauro,
the Texas land commissioner, who trails far behind Gov. George Bush
in statewide polls. ``I stand beside this president, I stand behind
his policies and I stand behind him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mauro called the president's affair with Ms.
Lewinsky ``indefensible.'' He said that ``nobody likes to be lied
to,'' but he added that he did not think the president's actions
were unforgivable or worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro then sounded a theme that has animated Clinton and the
White House the past week _ that Republicans in Congress and
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, have overplayed
their hand and turned public opinion against them and in the
president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Starr had just laid out the facts, he might have had a
chance to really hurt him,'' Mauro said. ``Instead, the people just
got mad at him and the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Clinton has emphasized his policy differences with
the Republican majority and essentially presented the American
people with a choice: Stand behind him and what is left of his
political agenda, or support the Republicans as they move toward a
full-scale impeachment inquiry based on Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And, oddly for a man who has lived for nearly six years in the
White House, Clinton is campaigning against ``Washington,'' which
he has begun to use as a code word for congressional Republicans
and the media, whom he accuses of being preoccupied with his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington,'' Clinton said Sunday afternoon, ``people
think, `Things are going well, so why don't we fight with each
other and see who we can hurt?'''
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar point on Saturday at a fund-raising lunch at
the suburban San Diego home of William Lerach, a wealthy trial
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe elections should be about the people that live
outside Washington, not about who's crawling on whom in Washington,
D.C,'' the president said. ``So I ask you, go out there and make
sure that's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, assured reporters that
Clinton's reference to ``crawling'' was a figure of speech for
partisan infighting, and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that many people at the fund-raising events this
weekend had offered him private encouragement and words of solace.
At the lunch Sunday, as on other occasions this weekend, Clinton
acknowledged the support and gave a small signal of the pain he is
feeling. ``You know, it's easy to forget in Washington, but
presidents and their families are still people, and it meant more
to me than you'll ever know, and I thank you for that,'' he said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Clinton's hosts have refrained from discussing the
scandal and the possibility of impeachment. But Lerach felt no such
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's time for Democrats _ fund-raisers, voters,
officeholders _ to roll up their sleeves tonight and go to work and
stand up against an ugly witch hunt to drive from office one of the
best and most popular presidents in history,'' Lerach said,
bringing the crowd at his house to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, my friend, don't have a broken spirit,'' Lerach
added. ``Don't resign. Don't quit. You stay there and you fight.''

UCLA BENEFITS FROM BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So the Bruins got their bye, after all. Strip away
the lost Heisman exposure for Cade McNown and the unrealized
revenue _ approximately $700,000 for an athletic department that
just signed a $19 million deal with Adidas _ and the canceled game
at Miami is just that, a bye.
</P>
<P>
   It's the best thing that could have happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the players and coaches feel differently. They fear the
cancellation will shackle their national championship and Rose Bowl
dreams. And it may, if:
</P>
<P>
   _ They finish 10-0 and Miami has a seven- or eight-win season.
In that case, UCLA's strength-of-schedule rating _ a crucial
component in the formula that determines No.1 vs. No.2 _ would
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   _ They finish in a three-way tie for the Pac-10 title with
Arizona and Oregon, each of which has a 3-0 nonconference record.
(UCLA's is 2-0.)
</P>
<P>
   Both scenarios re feasible, but not probable.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of a bye, however, are myriad.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins would have played without 2{ defensive line starters.
One end, Kenyon Coleman, is out at least another week with a
sprained knee. The other, Pete Holland, wouldn't have played
because of a nagging sprained ankle, and nose guard Micah Webb was
ill on departure day.
</P>
<P>
   The bye provides Webb and Holland a chance to heal before Pac-10
play begins Saturday against Washington State. It's one less game
without Coleman, UCLA's most talented defensive lineman. And it
gives two true freshmen, nose guard Ken Kocher and end Anthony
Fletcher, more time to learn.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary, with three position changes and two first-time
starters, also benefits from the additional practice.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the young, talented Hurricanes, in sweltering heat, in
the Eastern time zone _ the wake-up calls were set for 4 a.m. body
time _ would have been a difficult task for UCLA, which has just
seven senior starters.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the bye should refresh the collective spirit after a
depressing game at Houston. Since their 12-game winning streak
began 54 weeks ago, the Bruins have shown a remarkable ability to
exist in the present. They neither dwell on previous
accomplishments nor drift toward future challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But the 42-24 victory grated on them like no other. Perhaps it
was the arduous playing conditions. Perhaps it was the injuries to
Coleman and Freddie Mitchell. Whatever, the Bruins did not dispose
that game with their usual efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation allowed them to cleanse their psyches _ and do
it under the most opportune conditions. Because it wasn't a
scheduled bye, they were locked and loaded for four days, until
word of the cancellation arrived Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to lose your competitive edge,'' McNown said.
``The fact we didn't know it was a bye was great. We kept our
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a day to slack, Friday was it. Instead, the
Bruins lifted weights at 6 a.m., watched film of Washington State
and cruised through a crisp, physical practice _ the perfect way to
turn their gaze to Pac-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``But they
did a great job.''

EAST GERMANS USED VOTES TO VOICE DISILLUSIONMENT WITH KOHL'S
GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-EUROPE, GERMANY-VOTE, GERMANY-REACT,
GERMANY-KOHL.) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLE, Germany _ Most of the nightmarish chemical refineries in
this eastern German city have been bulldozed since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, along with most of the jobs that went with them.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the former workers are still here and still living
in the grafitti-covered high-rise apartments that the state-owned
chemical industry built for them more than 30 years ago. This is a
neighborhood with old friendships, strong community ties and
meticulous housekeeping, surrounded by overgrown weeds and
crumbling walkways.
</P>
<P>
   It is also one where most people who voted Sunday were
discouraged, disillusioned and desperate for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all unemployed, every one of us,'' said Irena, who came
to vote with her husband, Hans, and two long-time friends who have
been neighbors here since 1966. All were in their 50s and none
would give full names. ``If you are more than 50 years old, you
have absolutely no chance of getting work,'' she said. ``In fact,
it's hard if you're over 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Germany played a central role in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's extraordinary electoral defeat Sunday, largely because of
such frustrations. The East used to be one of Kohl's strongholds,
thanks to his role in re-unifying Germany and pouring hundreds of
billions of dollars into the reconstruction here.
</P>
<P>
   But with 17 percent of East Germans jobless _ and many more in
government-paid workfare programs _ Kohl's time had run out. Early
exit polls on Sunday indicated that Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union saw its share of the Eastern vote plunge from 38.5 percent in
1994 to 28.1 percent. The opposition Social Democrats, led by
Gerhard Schroeder, increased their share from 31.5 percent to 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of just how angry many people here are, the
successor to East Germany's old Communist Party, now called the
Party of Democratic Socialism, saw its share of Eastern votes climb
from 19 percent to 21 percent. For the first time ever, the former
Communists received more than 5 percent of votes nationwide, thus
gaining full status as a minority party in the German Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Halle, people expressed their disillusionment in many
forms. Doris Mey, a 47-year-old schoolteacher who came with her
husband, Harald, said that, for the first time, she would vote for
the former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both employed, and our own lives are not that bad,''
said Mrs. Mey. ``But many of our friends are jobless, many of them.
And I can see the impact that it is having on children at school.
They are disoriented and distracted. They know their parents don't
have work, and they absorb their frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiane Fisher, a physician's assistant who is also 47, said
she would vote Social Democrat after having voted for Kohl in the
past. ``My son is in the military right now, and we're not sure
what he will do when he gets out,'' she said. ``He was a
construction worker, but construction has slowed down so much and
there are so many illegal foreign workers here who work so much
more cheaply. I always thought things would be better, but they
aren't. A lot of things were promised, but it isn't much better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several others here said Sunday that they had voted for the
ultra-right German People's Union, known by its German initials as
the DVU. At a McDonald's fast-food outlet just outside of town, two
workers who would identify themselves only as Lutz and Frank said
they had voted for the right-wing party as a protest against
complacency in Kohl's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The German People's Union is one of three fringe parties on the
right that have alarmed mainstream political leaders, especially in
the west, because they appear to cultivate anti-foreigner hatreds
of younger and more violent workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that I absolutely don't want the DVU to win,''
said Lutz, a 31-year-old bricklayer. ``I'm making a protest vote,
pure and simple, because none of the parties are doing what needs
to be done.'' Four years ago, both men said, they voted for the
Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Had they thought about voting for the far right back in 1994?
``No way, absolutely no way,'' said Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns Sunday indicated that right-wing extremist parties
did not make significant gains, as many had feared they might. The
German People's Union shocked both major political parties in local
elections here in the state of Saxony-Anhalt last spring, when it
defied all expectations and won 14 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But that surge did not replay itself elsewhere in the East, and
the party received only about 3 percent of the national vote.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the billions of marks pumped into eastern Germany
from the west have transformed even the bleak concrete tenements
for the chemical workers. Some of the high-rises have new facades,
with bright paint and sturdy windows. The parking areas are jammed
with Volkswagens and even a few BMWs. And huge suburban shopping
centers are just a 10-minute drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet spiritually and emotionally, many people here say they see
little of the ``blooming landscapes'' that Kohl promised at the
time of German re-unification.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son works as a BMW salesman here, and he drives a BMW
because it comes with the job,'' said Helga, 57, who worked for 14
years at a local bank before being laid off three years ago. ``But
he isn't making any money because he can't sell any cars, so he
always comes over to our apartment for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some people who have good jobs said Sunday that they had
voted against Kohl. Andreas Koerner, a mid-level manager at an
electronics company near Leipzig, said he had cast his ballot for
the Social Democrats because the government simply needed new
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to have some new ideas and more energy,'' he said
as he waited for a train in Leipzig. ``I am concerned about
business, but my vote was partly out of concern for business. There
are a lot of other people who feel that way too.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ As dusk falls on Jhuggi Jhonpri Colony No. 8,
a teeming slum that sprawls along the Yamuna River, a barefooted
parade of fish peddlers, maidservants and rickshaw pullers line up
at the storefront offices of their neighborhood ``doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is a clinic here where a qualified doctor sees
patients two mornings a week, the slum dwellers, too poor to give
up even a morning's wages, usually rely on ill-educated amateurs
who are open for business till 10 every night.
</P>
<P>
   In dingy little shops that swarm with flies, weary people,
illuminated by dangling bare light bulbs, unquestioningly accept
all manner of pills and shots from young men who have never gone to
college.
</P>
<P>
   As the rural poor have streamed into India's great metropolises
in recent years, these men, ``indigenous practitioners'' in the
polite terminology of health experts, have come along with them. As
there is currently no law that explicitly prohibits their work,
they operate with impunity in more than a thousand slum areas,
known as jhuggis, that are home to about a third of this capital
city's 10 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister for the state of Delhi, Harsh Vardhan, is
trying to shut them down but so far he has been stymied. Last year,
with strong backing from the Delhi Medical Association, he proposed
the Quackery Prohibition Act, which would make practicing medicine
without proper credentials a crime punishable by up to three years
in prison. The bill is now languishing in a committee of the local
legislative assembly where it was referred for further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are not qualified to practice medicine are playing
with the lives of the poor and illiterate by prescribing and
injecting medicines,'' he said. ``This is happening all over the
vast country of India on a vast scale.''
</P>
<P>
   But some leading health policy researchers question the wisdom
of Vardhan's idea. In a city where ill-educated medical
practitioners are at least as plentiful as real doctors, and where
the public health care system for slum dwellers is seriously
inadequate, they say it may make more sense to train these young
men to correctly dispense a limited array of medicines than to
simply forbid them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know these people are here to stay,'' said Saroj Pachauri,
regional director for South Asia at the Population Council, a
nonprofit research organization. ``They can't be wished away.''
</P>
<P>
   At J.J. Colony No. 8, a jhuggi where people bathe, wash their
dishes and prepare meals next to open drains filled with excrement
and garbage, ill-educated ``doctors'' have many devoted customers.
They offer something that neither the clinic doctor nor the
government hospital can provide: a caretaker the slum dwellers know
personally who is available seven days a week right in their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Munisa Begum, 40, lives with her extended family across the lane
from the clean, well-lit clinic where Dr. Abha Gupta holds office
hours from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. The four
adults in her household earn less than $100 a month. For 4 rupees,
about 10 cents (an affordable sum for those who live in the
jhuggi), Mrs. Begum could consult Gupta, who works for the
nonprofit group ASHA, or Action for Securing Health for All.
</P>
<P>
   She could also go to the government hospital, but the bus fare
round trip would cost 20 cents and the visit would take more than
half a workday. Then she would have to wait in several lines, only
to see a doctor she had never met.
</P>
<P>
   The man Mrs. Begum trusts to look after her family is around the
corner: Mohammad Gulam Mustafa, 27, who completed only 11 years of
school. The son of a rice farmer, he migrated to Delhi from the
state of Assam thinking he would ``do whatever I got first.'' He
landed a job at the age of 16 in a doctor's office, then opened his
practice when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   He is a friendly man with a kindly face who speaks the language
of the villagers. He can make ordinary aches and pains go away.
When someone has a headache, he gives them tablets of
acetaminophen. If they have a cough, he pours them a small bottle
of syrup.
</P>
<P>
   He also lets customers pay on credit and advises them in their
dealings with an intimidating municipal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have important visitors, we invite the doctor to meet
them,'' Mrs. Begum said respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, Mustafa shone a flashlight into the
throbbing ear of a fish peddler's wife, then sent her on her way
with eight pills wrapped in newsprint. The woman accepted his help
gratefully. She handed over a 10-rupee note, worth about 25 cents,
toward the 60-cent cost of the visit and the medicine. He told her
she could pay the rest later.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell and the streets rang with the clanging bells of
bicycle-rickshaw peddlers returning home from work, Naima, a
vegetable-seller's wife who said she has no last name and does not
know her age, brought in her year-old daughter, Nargis, who had
diarrhea and a skin disease on her back.
</P>
<P>
   For the diarrhea, Mustafa said he had already given the baby
Lomotil _ a medication that pediatricians say can cause dehydration
in young children _ and that night he gave the mother another
medication to try. He also injected the baby with one shot of
gentamicin, an inexpensive antibiotic that doctors say should be
given twice daily for at least five days.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa and others like him said they make about $70 to $100 a
month. His earnings are strongest in the monsoon season, when
diseases fester in the heat and damp. ``Summer is a very good
season for us,'' he said. He readily admits he has no formal
medical education. Much of what he knows about the drugs he hands
out he has learned from the drug company salesmen who daily ply the
narrow lanes of the slum, sample cases in hand, peddling
antibiotics and painkillers and cough syrups in the little shops
like Mustafa's, which are almost as prolific as vegetable stands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The directions on virtually every medication are in English, a
language spoken by fewer than 5 percent of Indians. Mustafa speaks
no English, though he claims he can read the English-only warnings
on the rows of dusty pill bottles that sit on shelves lined with
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salesmen give us free samples and tell us how to use
them,'' he said. ``We only buy them if they work and they're not
too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he said, he prescribes a two-day course of the
antibiotic tetracycline for fever or a seasonal cough _ a practice
that disturbs public health doctors. While individuals treated so
briefly with antibiotics often get better, the bacteria they were
infected with can become drug-resistant for a whole community,
which complicates efforts to treat disease, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa said he was unaware that antibiotics given for too short
a time can lead to drug-resistant strains of bacteria. A patient
who does not get well in a couple of days will simply go to another
informally educated doctor, he said, and nobody would take a
medicine regularly for five days, even if he gave it to them, a
sentiment echoed by other practitioners. More pills cost more
money, they explained. And the jhuggi residents are also just not
in the habit of taking pills regularly on their own.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Mustafa said, he dreamed of being a real doctor,
but could not afford school. He would like to learn to do his job
better, but asks where he can go to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Verghese, program coordinator for ASHA, which operates the
clinic in Jhuggi Jhonpri No. 8, said her group has tried to train
some unqualified practitioners. ``These people give services right
in the slum,'' she said. ``They're there, day in, day out. Even if
you pass a law, people will go to them on the sly.''

TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ARE SEEN AFTER HEDGE FUND BAILOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week's $3.5 billion bailout of the hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management LP could bring closer scrutiny and
tighter restrictions on such funds.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that he had
asked the staffs of federal agencies that are members of the
president's Working Group on Financial Markets _ which he is the
chairman of _ to study the ``potential implications'' of the
operations of hedge funds and their relationships with their
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The group is expected to focus immediately on determining
whether more hedge fund regulation is required, then examine the
lending requirements of commercial and investment banks that lend
money to the funds, some regulators and industry executives said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge fund is a generic term for a category of investments that
have been in existence for more than 30 years. They are private
investment vehicles that have gone largely unregulated on the
assumption that they are meant only for wealthy individuals
presumed to be knowledgeable investors, who are aware of the high
risks that such funds often take on in search of high profits _ and
who are not in need of regulatory protection.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are usually structured as a limited partnership, in
which a general partner manages the fund and determines its
investment strategy. It is open only to accredited or
``sophisticated'' investors who must generally have a net worth of
$1 million or more and an annual income of $200,000 or more in each
of the most recent two years (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse).
</P>
<P>
   The funds maintain a great deal of secrecy and may use a wide
range of investment strategies. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds'
choice of investment tools, the amount of leverage used, their
degree of diversification and detailed reports of holdings are not
strictly regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many hedge funds operate under an exemption in the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The exemption was originally intended to allow
family businesses that invest in securities to avoid federal
regulation. But over the years, the exemption has been interpreted
to include pools of money, including investment clubs, that have
fewer than 100 investors and that do not offer shares to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds can also operate under a 1996 amendment to the
federal securities laws that exempts from regulation funds limited
to fewer than 500 ``sophisticated'' institutions or individuals _
meaning institutions with total investments exceeding $25 million
and individuals with investment portfolios of at least $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC rule allows some employees of hedge funds to also invest
in the pools, even if they do not meet the minimum investment
criteria, said Barry Barbash, director of the SEC's division of
investment management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It limits investment by employees to nonclerical,
nonsecretarial employees who are involved in the management of the
pool,'' Barbash said. ``We drew the line at people who would know
something about investing in the deal.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: TEARING DOWN THE HOUSE AT A JAZZ COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Musicians call it ``getting house,'' working the
audience into a frenzy, and on Friday night at Baird Auditorium at
the Smithsonian Institution here, the 63-year-old singer Teri
Thornton, competing in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz
Vocals Competition, not only got house but large building, zip code
and city. Ms. Thornton, who last released a recording in 1963 and
now lives in the actors' retirement home in Englewood, N.J., won
first prize in one of the best fields of competitors that the Monk
Institute has seen in years. She did it by singing well and by
digging into some of the best aspects of black entertainment
culture, the parts that make audience members and performers join
in the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teri just came out here and said, `This is my stage,' '' said
Nnenna Freelon, a singer and one of the judges for the competition.
(Joe Williams, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Dianne Reeves and Diana Krall
were the others.) ``She just booted everybody else off. I was
waiting for the hair on the back of my neck to stand up. And when
she started singing, I got that tingling feeling you get when real
music is being made.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition, the 12th, featured vocalists, and, as
important, featured new rules. Previously the competition had age
limits _ usually around 30 _ meant to keep the competition spry and
to draw attention to it as a showcase for young musicians. After
the last vocal competition, in 1993, the Monk Institute had to
field about 100 complaints from older singers who felt excluded. In
other years, competition has focused on particular instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' said Shelby Fisher, the executive producer of
the competition. ``So we decided to change the age limits. Singers
take longer to mature than other instrumentalists, so we've
adapted.'' A result was that plenty of music was sung, and a new
level of professionalism infused the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an accident that the older performers were really
making music instead of showing off their technique,'' said Ms.
Fisher. ``The admission of older performers changed the whole
environment of the semifinals and made them much better. When they
sang, they understood what they were saying. They were telling a
story. In the last competition, when a 20-year-old sang
`Sophisticated Lady,' it sounded a bit silly. But when Everett
Greene, 64, sang the blues, you knew that he knew what he was
singing about.''
</P>
<P>
   The semifinal round, with 15 singers chosen from some 300
applicants and held at Washington's best-known jazz club, Blues
Alley, on Thursday, was rife with elders turning their performances
into exhibitions of experience. Greene, a large man, sang in a
nearly forgotten baritone style that had the women in the audience
talking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to dream about angels,'' he sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhhhh,'' responded the women.
</P>
<P>
   Greene smiled.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Thornton came out, the house erupted in applause, and
she sang of love and longing and her abilities resonated through
the club.
</P>
<P>
   But singing was nothing compared with her performance for the
finals. Ms. Thornton, who won $20,000 for her trouble, came out,
said that the performance was dedicated to her sister, the singer
Betty Carter, who was sick with cancer. (Ms. Carter died on
Saturday at her home in Brooklyn.) Ms. Thornton then talked a bit
about how she herself had recently beaten cancer _ but she didn't
say that she had summoned the strength to perform just last week _
and then she began to wreck the house.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton started with a standard, then dismissed the pianist
Norman Simmons from the piano. She sat down, began an Afro-Cuban
piano figure and started singing ``I've Got You Under My Skin,''
all the while laughing with audience members and turning on the
piano bench to face them. She finished, received her standing
ovation, got up and said, ``Well, this isn't politically correct,
but too bad,'' and began a jump blues of her own, using a dry voice
and plenty of humor _ ``I'm going to call out the posse and have
him brought back to love'' _ that sealed her fate. She received
another standing ovation, this time with roars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not allow an opportunity of this magnitude to escape
without doing my very best,'' said Ms. Thornton, who left her
career behind until recently to bring up her children. ``The stage
is my great love, and I like to entertain, and it's good to feel
that the love is reciprocated.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which left the second-place winner, 20-year-old Jane
Monheit, from New York, in a tough spot. She had to follow Ms.
Thornton and clear away the wreckage, which she did by singing the
ballad ``Detour Ahead'' in a pure, clear and cool voice. Ms.
Monheit sounded honest, talented and controlled, and her
performance had the record company executives and agents in the
audience rustling around in their briefcases for spare contracts to
sign her up. Ms. Monheit, at her young age, has so much promise
that the executives were already trying to figure out how to frame
her talent, how to make her more than just a jazz singer. Jazz
records don't sell much anymore.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've been to about 10 of the contests,'' said Jeff Levensen,
vice president for jazz at Columbia Records. ``And this one is one
of the best I've been to in a long time, with a really high level
of competitors. But I'm worried that so few of the performers were
interested in advancing the craft. While the older performers were
gifted, I was hoping for something new, somebody that knew the
past, but was ready to move forward. I didn't hear it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of the three finalists showed vanguard tendencies, it was
Roberta Gambarini, an Italian singer with flawless American diction
and a tremendous ability to scat. She opened the finals with a
performance of ``On the Sunny Side of the Street'' that set the
level for the rest of the show. First she sang Sonny Rollins' solo
on the piece, then Dizzy Gillespie's solo, then ended her rendition
with Sonny Stitt's improvisation. It had the band smiling.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception afterward, good cheer permeated the
conversations. There was the sense that something good had
happened, and the record executives were there figuring out the
right tack to take with Ms. Thornton and Ms. Monheit. Should they
pounce now or wait until next week in New York? Others weren't
thinking that way. ``I'm really proud to be a link in the chain,''
Ms. Freelon said. ``This contest made me proud to be a singer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were so many different ways of singing, and
thinking, too,'' she continued. ``This was a good crop. I don't
think jazz singing is leaving us anytime soon.''

ALBRIGHT PUSHES PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS ON STALLED ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pushed on
Sunday for agreement on pivotal details of a long-stalled peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, with American
officials saying the White House hoped to announce concrete
progress in the peace talks when President Clinton meets with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that an overall settlement
was not imminent despite Albright's meetings in New York this
weekend with Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
Both men were here to speak before the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the White House was still eager to
announce at least some progress in the Israeli-Palestinian talks at
Monday's meeting in Washington, if only to show that American
foreign policy has not been hobbled by the scandal surrounding
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great interest in showing that we're not being
sidetracked by the circus in Washington,'' said an American
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We want to lock in
key elements of this agreement while all of the parties are still
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu suggested that he and
Arafat were still far from agreement on several issues, most
importantly the security arrangements for areas of the West Bank
that Israel would cede to the Palestinians under a new peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't have yet is the whole Palestinian side of this
equation,'' he said. ``How do they assure us the areas that we hand
over to them and have handed over to them do not become bases of
terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed that Clinton's ability to focus on foreign
policy _ and specifically on the Middle East peace effort _ had
suffered because of the scandal in Washington, Netanyahu replied,
``Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months without visible progress in the peace
process, Israel and the Palestinians are reported to be close to a
deal under which Israel would turn over 13 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians, with 3 percent designated at nature reserves
to prevent Palestinian settlements. But several details remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Time for further negotiations on American soil has nearly run
out. Netanyahu is expected back in Israel Tuesday evening for the
Yom Kippur holiday. Albright met separately with both the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders here late Saturday night and was scheduled
to meet them again late on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a deadline for the talks: May 4 of next
year, when the Oslo peace agreements that provided a framework for
the peace talks expire. Arafat has said that if there is no
settlement by then, he will declare the creation of a Palestinian
state, a move that would outrage Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of a speech scheduled for delivery on
Sunday in New York, Arafat was prepared to repeat the pledge.
Without an agreement by next May, ``We will have no choice but to
unilaterally declare the establishment of the Palestinian state,''
it said. ``We do realize the implications and consequences of this
on Palestinian-Israeli relations as a whole and also on
Arab-Israeli and international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what may have been a concession to Israeli sensitivities
and a response to pressure from the United States, those lines were
dropped from the speeches delivered, and Arafat referred only
cryptically to the significance of a deadline next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community, all peace-loving people, must
exert every possible effort to insure the implementation of the
agreements by May 4, 1999,'' Arafat said in his speech to the
Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a private
group. ``It just cannot come and go like any other day.''
</P>
<P>
   American and Israeli officials are waiting anxiously to hear
what Arafat will say when he addresses the General Assembly on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Arafat have not attempted to dampen speculation that he
will use the speech to criticize Netanyahu's government harshly and
to solicit support for his plans to declare statehood. Netanyahu
has warned that a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state
could scuttle the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Sunday, Arafat accused Netanyahu's government
of ``procrastination and evasion'' in the peace talks. ``This
Israeli government,'' he said, ``began to export blame to the
Palestinians and to export fear to Israelis in an obvious political
attempt aimed at undermining its obligations and agreements.''

BETTY CARTER, INNOVATIVE JAZZ VOCALIST, IS DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a
composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for
generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene
section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction,
her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly
inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as
well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material _ she
began a solo recording career in the mid-1950s _ her light, pure
voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes.
It was immediately noticeable that she was after something
different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there
to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz
musician first and a singer second.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter
refined her originality into a style that became the template for
modern jazz singing. On ``Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms.
Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in
her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists
like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she
recorded ``My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with
Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great
leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most
articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever
controlled tempo the way she had; woe to the young musicians in the
band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or
keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping
fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back
to the practice room, chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted
some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't
afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while,
singing against piano, or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other
instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of
emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic
environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of
the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional
power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to change my material to keep the musicians
interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York
Times. ``What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change
things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played
with were so good they could do what was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940s and 1950s was
a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some
of the best musicians of the time.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of
New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter
sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her
nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she
began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the
vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York,
she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the
female part for King Pleasure's version of ``Red Top,'' singing a
vocal version of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.
</P>
<P>
   In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic
Records and generally taking in the city. In 1957, she recorded
with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly
because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because
she tried to avoid the abusive working situations that have plagued
jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album,
``Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Charles; it features the
pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ``Baby,
It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Charles from 1960 to
1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an
orchestral album for Atco Records.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s Ms. Carter struggled with her career,
recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960s, during which the
avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an
older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her
own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she
released her albums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that
included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording
of a series of new albums. That same year she released ``Look What
I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album,
``Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave
Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the 1980s Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her
innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded
duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded
musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni
from the 1980s and the 1990s were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut,
Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis
Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired
Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis
Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National
Medal of Arts award last year, given by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.
This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said
in the interview with The Times. ``The survival of this culture
depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys
playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else.
There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But
it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on
their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It
wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''

MOCKING THE DOUBTERS WITH TEASING VAMPS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a story that Sam Cooke, at the height of his
gospel-singing career, could make a crowd detonate simply by
choosing the perfect moment to smile. In some rarefied chamber
beyond professionalism, a musician can transmit power with the
merest gesture. A performer is lucky to find this magic zone every
once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the artist formerly known as Prince at a packed Madison
Square Garden on Friday night, it was easy to feel that he had a
complete mental map of his music, and accessing the zone was as
simple as finding a dot on that map.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made the chosen moment surreally significant with a
single action: thrusting a leg, grinding a bump, singing a trill,
running, jumping, mimicking the curve of a funk line with a limb or
his shoulders, rolling a guitar line over and under, playing a
chord on the piano or performing a pelvic thrust atop it.
</P>
<P>
   He did it again and again during Friday night's 100-minute
greatest-hits set, with a light show to follow what seemed like his
every whim. ``Before we go on,'' he announced at one point, ``this
light _ it don't match my suit!'' He snapped his fingers, and the
spotlight blinked from yellow to deep red.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he came through town, touring with Chaka Khan and
Larry Graham, the artist played a show at which he appeared only in
the company of his supporting acts. The Madison Square Garden
concert was a different animal: a tightly scripted, proper
three-act show called the 1998 New Power Soul Festival, with the
same supporting acts, Larry Graham and Chaka Khan, each given an
opening set.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was decked with the artist's groovy bywords _ flags
atop the stage announced ``Faith,'' ``God,'' ``Patience,'' ``Joy.''
Representing his earthier side, an enormous prop in the shape of a
pair of women's legs flanked the stage, beginning at the ceiling
and ending in ankle-strap heels down by the floor. The glyph
signifying his name flashed in gold lights between the giant legs;
at one point he posed in victory underneath the sign, a potent
propaganda image for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of his newfound business autonomy _ he has released his
last three albums on his own label, NPG Records, and bypassed most
chain retailers _ he mocked the doubters who claimed he couldn't
sell out the Garden, and introduced ``I Could Never Take the Place
of Your Man'' by boasting, ``This is from my most unsuccessful
album.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally proud of his domestic partnership, he had his wife,
Mayte, emerge for a stylized belly-dance during ``The One,'' from
the newest album, ``Newpower Soul''; it was lighted so delicately
and framed so lovingly within the show that it could have been a
soft-focus sequence of a film. At its climax, he coyly turned to
the audience to utter, ``Excuse me'' before giving her a deep kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The revuelike procession included a few dismal excesses: The
smooth-jazz saxophonist Candy Dulfer, now part of the touring band,
performed a solid-schmaltz version of ``Summertime,'' and rapper
Doug E. Fresh came out for some crowd-nuzzling, as well as to rap
anticlimactically over ``Erotic City'' and ``Pop Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But certain kinds of excess are just the artist's speed. Amid
medleys, vamps and teasing single verses, one of the few numbers he
played extensively was ``Purple Rain,'' and in it he performed a
super-expressive power-ballad guitar solo; it could have been the
finest of its kind. How can it be described, except that it worked
gradually from a few sculptured notes to many, that each note
counted and that the journey was fully realized?
</P>
<P>
   This solo had sex appeal and a hair style and expensive shoes
and feelings; it was oversized and pained and martyrizing, and it
was what arena concerts in pop are for.

SPOTLIGHT ON REPORTERS AND SOURCES IN LAWSUIT AGAINST `60
MINUTES'

 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is shortly before the end of a tough ``60 Minutes'' report on
the U.S. Customs Service in San Diego, and a memo flashes on the
screen, with telling phrases highlighted. The document seems to
support the report's basic thrust: the southwestern border is a
sieve through which huge drug cargoes pass with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem. The internal memo, the Customs
Service says, is a hoax. Rudy Camacho, the director of the Customs
Management Center in San Diego, contends he approved no such thing.
He has sued CBS, the ``60 Minutes'' correspondents Mike Wallace and
Lesley Stahl, and the report's producer, Lee Zeidman, for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Libel suits are an occupational hazard for investigative
reporters. What makes this one interesting is the fifth and final
defendant, Michael L. Horner; he is not one of the network's
journalists, but one of its sources. Horner, a former customs
inspector who has long maintained his work was thwarted by corrupt
superiors, provided ``60 Minutes'' with two copies of the disputed
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   If, as customs and Camacho contend, the memo is a forgery and no
trace of it can be found on customs computers, a highly respected
television news magazine has been snookered. But, Wallace points
out, the evidence of a hoax comes from customs itself. ``The fact
is they've undertaken the investigations and say, `We've proved it
to ourselves,' '' he said. ``Well, the fox is proving it to the
chickens.'' Horner, on the advice of his lawyer, has declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Camacho lawsuit opens a window into the complex relationship
between reporters and their sources. In such relationships, there
is a tug of war between trust and skepticism. Motives are always
open to question _ particularly when, as here, there is a knot of
feuds in a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists trying to unravel such knots, a good source is
priceless. And Horner seemed to be that rarest of journalistic
treasures, a man with reliable inside knowledge of official
wrongdoing, a passion for justice and the guts to put his name
behind his accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Horner is hardly the only source who has made allegations about
records disappearing from customs computers or adjustments in
customs procedures that could make life easier for drug smugglers.
But he has been particularly active. Since he left the Customs
Service in 1992, Horner has been cited as a source in
border-corruption reports by at least five news outlets, including
The Los Angeles Times and the TV news magazine program ``Dateline
NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   This has left a bad taste with customs officials. But even
without Horner, there had been reason to explore the rumors
swirling around the border. At least 46 federal, state and local
law-enforcement officials were indicted on or convicted of
drug-related corruption charges from 1994 to 1997 in Arizona,
California, New Mexico and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also strong evidence that the ``60 Minutes'' memo,
shown on April 20, 1997, was forged. The effect of the memo was to
encourage customs agents to process trucks owned by a company that
``60 Minutes'' said had links to Mexican drug cartels ``as quickly
as possible.'' Customs officials can demonstrate the disputed June
1996 memo is filled with titles and bureaucratic coding that had
been changed and updated the year before. They said that all hard
disks on agency computers were checked for traces of the memo, in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   Horner also provided a former aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., with at least two affidavits from customs inspectors
saying they had seen the memo. When asked, these inspectors said
their names had been forged. The aide, Susan Kennedy, could not be
reached for comment, but had passed the sworn disavowals to a
Customs Service spokesman, Pat Jones, who confirmed this account.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters still swear by Horner. Jamie Dettmer, a reporter
for Insight magazine, a sister publication of The Washington Times,
worked with Horner and said ``any information he supplied to us
almost always turned out to be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Other journalistic and professional allies of Horner have become
wary. ``I believe Mike was an honest broker early on,'' said Tom
Isbell, a customs inspector, who, with Horner, told federal
investigators years ago about what he regarded as suspicious
practices within the service. ``But he became enamored of all this
publicity,'' Isbell added.
</P>
<P>
   When a series of federal investigations _ including a grand jury
inquiry into some of Horner's accusations _ ended inconclusively in
the last two years, Isbell said, ``Mike was terribly, terribly
disappointed.'' He added, ``When the grand jury investigation was
not conclusive, Mike just seemed to fade into the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scholl, a producer for ``Dateline NBC'' said, ``Mike
was a very well-intentioned man who generally provided accurate
information _ up until a certain point.'' Scholl worked with Horner
on a 1995 report, but canceled a follow-up, he said, after
documents provided by Horner proved to be fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point where the accurate information flow from Mike
stopped was after the grand jury's investigation ended,'' Scholl
said.

 UNDATED: Scholl said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grand jury investigation was still in full swing in the
early spring of 1996 when Zeidman, the producer, was assigned to do
the piece, according to Wallace. The Washington Post had, on Feb.
20, published an article that focused on a 1990 cocaine seizure at
the San Diego border and a shortcut inspection program that could
make the task of drug smugglers far easier.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on The Post, Zeidman got in touch with Horner,
according to Wallace. Zeidman, who in a 25-year career has covered
the Olympic Games and has done investigative pieces for various CBS
programs, declined to talk about the events related to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, in a series of recent interviews, said that Horner was
far from the only source for the broadcast, but had been helpful.
``I was skeptical to begin with,'' said Wallace, who flew out to
the border and met with Horner in the spring of 1996. ``Then I
spent some time with him. Reporters can be had, but I didn't feel
that I was being had. Zeidman was spending so much time out there
and developing such a variety of sources that 95 percent of the
story was beyond question.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace added that he felt that Horner ``was genuinely
interested in vindication for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' segment used Horner on camera sparingly,
focusing most attention on a former head of a federal investigative
agency; on Feinstein, who has been interested in the issue of
border corruption; and on Jeffrey Weitzman, an officer with the
Customs Service's canine branch.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzman's account, which has never been publicly contradicted,
describes the 1990 attempts of a customs inspector to block
inspections of a gas tanker truck holding nearly four tons of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former reporter who is now the Customs Service's chief
spokesman in Washington, said he met Zeidman for lunch in the
spring of 1996 ``and that began roughly a nine-month period where
Lee Zeidman and I were in constant contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones refused to grant the ``60 Minutes'' team an
interview with the service's commissioner, George Weise. ``This was
going to be one of those `60 Minutes' deer-in-the-headlights
interviews.'' Jones said. ``The show was already going to be
negative. Why make it worse?''
</P>
<P>
   The report was blocked out in rough form by the summer of 1996,
but was shelved after Wallace talked to his former producer, Lowell
Bergman, who had reported on the border on and off for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked out Horner with Bergman,'' Wallace said. ``Bergman
tried to wave me off Horner. Obviously I listened. But we did our
own homework with Horner and some of the other people there in San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the report remained suspended until February 1997, when
The New York Times published an extensive article about border
corruption. Soon afterward, Wallace said, Zeidman went back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later in 1997, Zeidman stated in legal papers, Horner
provided him with a copy of the disputed memo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, according to an affidavit that Zeidman filed in the
case, Zeidman called a source on the customs inspection force and
asked him to open a ``Tanker Operations and Procedures Log'' to a
certain page. The source read Zeidman a text identical to the memo
that Horner had provided.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Zeidman say they tried repeatedly to reach Weise and
Camacho. Jones, however, said that no interview request mentioned
the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho said he got no such message in 1997. ``There was nothing
on my voice mail, nothing on my staff assistant's voice mail,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho filed his libel suit in April, a year after the
broadcast, dissatisfied that ``60 Minutes'' had not done enough to
disavow the memo. Informed of customs' findings, the program's top
editor had the correspondent Lesley Stahl read a simple ``update''
reporting the results of the Customs Service's investigation. No
formal correction has broadcast.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is she a national role model as first lady? The
president's top crisis manager determined to rescue his legacy? Or
a traumatized victim deserving of America's embrace?
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day, five-state fund-raising tour on behalf of
Democratic candidates for Congress, Hillary Rodham Clinton was
analyzed and lionized, criticized and beatified on each of these
points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, she stayed the course, smiling opaquely and
assuring old friends and political allies that she was ``Just
fine!'' as she thickly larded her speeches with praise of the
president and criticism of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Her steadfast fans could not stop themselves from gushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of like our American Princess Di,'' said Lawrence
Johnson, 30, a front desk clerk at Seattle's Westin Hotel who
caught a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton as she swept in for an evening of
fund raising on Thursday. ``They ought to leave her husband alone.
And she should be our next president!''
</P>
<P>
   With elections just a few weeks away and concerns that the
president's sex scandal may inhibit Democrats from voting, Mrs.
Clinton is getting many standing ovations as she asks audiences to
empty their pockets and get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was speculation that Mrs. Clinton might be
withholding full support from her husband as she sorted out her own
feelings, she put it to rest during her sweep through New York,
Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   At times she seemed to be campaigning even more for Clinton than
she was for the Democratic candidates, tirelessly promoting him as
the president who turned around the economy, reduced crime,
furthered educational reform and balanced the budget for the first
time since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any objective measure, by any fair assessment, our country
is so much better off because of my husband's leadership,'' she
told a crowd of several hundred at a fund-raising dinner for four
congressional candidates in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates said little about the president, and in
some cases they appeared relieved that she, not he, was around.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mrs. Clinton sits at the innermost circle of the
president's crisis-management team, drafting hardball responses to
the Lewinsky scandal and the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit _
and to the Republicans who have attacked the president because of
them. Mrs. Clinton's loyalists believe that she is a first lady
with a future, no matter how the Clinton presidency weathers the
impeachment debate, no matter whether the White House strategy, to
which she has contributed so much, prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction of Mrs. Clinton is that she focuses on the
issues rather than the distractions swirling around Washington,
D.C.,'' said Jay Inslee, who is running for Congress in Washington
state. ``The president is a distraction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Democratic candidates to focus
attention away from Clinton's woes and toward issues like child
care, education, Social Security and the environment, the
president's troubles kept intruding, often in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   At a re-election fund-raiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer in the grand
ballroom of the San Francisco Hilton Hotel on Friday night, actress
Frances Fisher of ``Titanic'' fame read excerpts from Mrs.
Clinton's best seller, ``It Takes a Village,'' telling the
$250-a-plate audience of 1,100 supporters how children are ``a
moral touchstone amidst the complexity and contentiousness of
modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the sidewalk outside the hotel, 8-year-old Carolyn Ahr
carried a poster that she had drawn with a sad face and the words,
``The president lies and should be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton is a setback for American women,'' said Catherine
Ahr, 37, a homemaker and Carolyn's mother. ``I've never protested
in my life _ and I even went to Berkeley. But this time was
different. What kind of moral message does this whole thing send to
our children?''
</P>
<P>
   In none of her child-related events did Mrs. Clinton answer that
question. None of the candidates did either.
</P>
<P>
   At Portland State University in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton appeared in
front of a big poster that read, ``Kids first'' with David Wu, a
Yale-educated lawyer and candidate for Congress whose main pitch is
education and who praised his guest as ``our nation's foremost
children's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a conflict between Mrs. Clinton's focus
on children's needs and the difficulty parents are having in
explaining her husband's behavior to their children, Wu said, ``I
will have to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So much was said in code and fraught with double meaning on Mrs.
Clinton's campaign tour that it was often hard to sort out what the
real message was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising dinner in Seattle, Mrs. Clinton mocked what
she called ``the other Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the way to look at it,'' she said. ``It's like
a parallel universe and sort of exists out there somewhere in outer
space.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said that the American people do not get enough
political news, and throughout her trip described politics as a
noble calling, exhorting her audiences to ``persuade people that
politics matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first lady, Ms. Boxer, whose daughter is married to
Mrs. Clinton's brother, said flat out in her speech at the
fund-raiser in San Francisco that, ``The president has problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never said what they were. And she blamed the
``extraordinary atmosphere we are living in'' for making it
impossible to get the media to focus on serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just the media that were focusing on sex. There
was also Art Torres, the chairman of the California Democratic
Party, introducing Ms. Boxer and explaining how her Republican
opponent in 1992, Bruce Herschensohn, was ``the family values guy
on every day except Friday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we found out,'' Torres continued, ``he did other
things in his spare time.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience groaned. Some people even cursed their chairman.
(In 1992 the Democrats turned up evidence that Herschensohn had
frequented a nude bar in Hollywood called The Seventh Veil and
bought girlie magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to do that!'' a woman said, referring to
Torres' remarks. ``This is not the time to bring this up.''
</P>
<P>
   As in San Francisco, there were competing demonstrators in
Denver, where Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Thursday for two female
Democratic candidates: Dottie Lamm, Colorado's former first lady
who is running against Ben Nighthorse Campbell for the Senate, and
Gail Schoettler, lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton shook hands with children in front of Fort Logan
Elementary School outside Denver, Ilona Smith, 41, a mental health
worker, shouted, ``Hang in there, Hillary,'' as protesters down the
block chanted, ``Jail Slick Willy.''
</P>
<P>
   One handmade sign read, ``Lyin' King and the Queen of Denial.''
Another read, ``It Takes a Village to Raise an Idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really inappropriate forum for what these people are
doing,'' Ms. Smith said. ``It's rude, it's ill-mannered, it's
embarrassing to Colorado. It's Hillary that's here, not Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke to safe, friendly audiences. No journalists
were allowed to travel on her plane, and she has avoided situations
in which journalists could question her.
</P>
<P>
   She was tireless in raising money and stingy with the chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, posing with her for a picture cost $2,500. She took
a quick hello-and-thank-you approach. ``I told her we support her
and the Democratic agenda,'' said Arun Bhagat, a consulting
engineer. ``She thanked us for coming. Everyone was very tactful.''
His daughter Lavina, 21, apologized to Mrs. Clinton for the bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   At a $200-a-head private reception for 200 people in Denver, ``A
lot of people were doing the two-handed shake, saying thank you for
what you're doing for Gail and Dottie,'' said Laurie Zeller, 38, a
mother of two. ``Nobody made reference to the current crisis in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Support is what Mrs. Clinton needs these days, said Brian Baird,
a clinical psychologist who lost a congressional race in Washington
state in 1996 by fewer than 900 votes and is running again. ``There
was something different in the applause tonight,'' said Baird of
the fund-raiser in Seattle. ``There was a sort of effort to send
some love Hillary's way. We want to help her during this trying
time, in a healing way, to give her a respite from all this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, who teaches psychology and treats cancer patients and
other patients, said that he thought Mrs. Clinton was ``doing
well.'' But then, he added, ```Well' is a relative word.''

<P>
   THE RACE BY LAPS:
</P>
<P>
   The First 100:
</P>
<P>
   After pole-winner Ernie Irvan led the first 14 laps, Ricky Rudd
and John Andretti swapped the lead over the next 90, setting a
blistering pace that only Andretti could maintain. It didn't help
the race momentum when Brett Bodine spun in turn two on lap five,
bringing out the first of many caution flags for five laps.
Attrition was almost immediate following Bodine's spin. Rusty
Wallace made an early pit stop and lost 18 laps. Dick Trickle went
in for a vibration problem and emerged 36 laps later. The pace of
the race was such that only 21 cars were on the lead lap after the
first 100. Among those who were lapped was Dale Earnhardt, who
finished 22nd, five laps down. Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin could
not make a move toward the front early. Martin dropped from 13th to
19th in the first 100 laps, while Gordon labored around ninth.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Ernie Irvan (14), Ricky Rudd (49), John Andretti
(37)
</P>
<P>
   RETIRED: Kenny Wallace, overheating
</P>
<P>
   UNDER CAUTION: 4 laps
</P>
<P>
   The Second 100
</P>
<P>
   Andretti continued his charge, pulling to five car lead on lap
101, but he crashed into the front stretch wall on lap 105, caused
by a tire going down. He returned for a lap, then returned to his
pit for a sway bar adjustment and lost 25 more. Over the next 80
laps, Sterling Marlin and Rudd swapped the lead three times. Gordon
lost track position to Martin on lap 117 and 118. On lap 143, the
field appeared satisfied to race nose-to-tale, with passing at a
minimum, saving the brakes for when they would need them down the
stretch. They took the first 100 laps to see who had what, then
rested. Jimmy Spencer brought out the third caution, looping his
car in turn three on lap 174. The tempo increased on the restart as
Martin passes Gordon for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Sterling Marlin (100)
</P>
<P>
   RETIRED: NONE
</P>
<P>
   UNDER CAUTION: 15
</P>
<P>
   The Third 100
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's day ends on a sour note when his motor quits running
on the backstretch on lap 298. He would not return. Gordon and
Martin take turns swapping positions, and drivers are beginning to
complain about the slick track. Again, there was more nose-to-tail
racing than side-by-side. Cars were sliding through the corners.
The heat began to take it's toll. Ted Musgrave sought relief and
got it from, Steve Grissom. ''I didn't expect the track to be this
hot,'' Musgrave noted. Spencer makes things even hotter, spinning
again in turn three, bringing out another caution. In all the
smoke, Rudd slipped under Marlin to take the lead, now with only 20
cars on the lead lap. At the race's halfway point, it was an odd
top five - Marlin, Rudd and Wally Dallenbach, followed by Gordon,
Jarrett and Martin. Things got scary on lap 267 when a tire comes
off the car of Geoff Bodine. It bounced of pit wall into middle of
the track, barely missing the cars of Johnny Benson and Joe
Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Sterling Marlin (87), Ricky Rudd (13)
</P>
<P>
   RETIRED: Dale Jarrett, motor; Geoff Bodine, handling
</P>
<P>
   UNDER CAUTION: 25 laps
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth 100
</P>
<P>
   ''I came down the front stretch and it started making a funny
noise. that was it,'' Jarrett said after pushing his car from pit
road to behind the wall on lap 302. Following a caution on lap
325-330, Rudd pulls away from Marlin, Martin and Gordon. It's a
short ride. Caution: Mike Skinner and Kenny Irwin get together
going into turn two rather aggressively, bringing out another
caution. Words, not nice ones, are exchanged over the team radios.
On the restart, Rudd gets great start before Skinner, again, and
Spencer touched, setting off another spin around midway the
backstretch, bringing out caution No. 8. In the middle of this
comes Jeff Burton, passing Gordon for fourth, Martin for third and
Rudd for second. He then runs down Marlin and takes the lead on
turn three on 387. It doesn't last.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Ricky Rudd (51), Sterling Marlin (33), Jeff Burton
(16),
</P>
<P>
   RETIRED: Jeff Bodine, handling
</P>
<P>
   UNDER CAUTION: 19
</P>
<P>
   The Final 100
</P>
<P>
   Burton slows and Rudd regains the lead on lap 410. A new face
appears. Bobby Hamilton, who won here in the spring, was 15th on
lap 312 and moves to second on lap 410. Burton slips to third.
Caution slows things when Marlin stalls on the back stretch. Rudd
beats the field out on the restart, followed by Gordon, Rick Bickle
Burton and Martin. Hamilton falls to seventh in the run back to the
start-finish line. Rudd pulls away to 12-car lead just before
Hamilton and Irwin spin in turn four on lap 439, bringing out
caution No. 11. Gordon made a most efficient move through the
smoke, running down pit road and holding on to second place. On the
restart, Rudd was off to three-car length lead and Gordon was
losing ground to Martin in third. As the laps led down, Rudd
maintained his three second lead, with a lapped car between him and
Gordon, and took the checkered flag, for his 16th victory,
maintaining his consecutive victory streak.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Jeff Burton (10), Ricky Rudd (90)
</P>
<P>
   RETIRED: John Andretti, handling.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER CAUTION: 13
</P>
<P>
   WHO WAS HOT
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd. Won from the pole, leading four times for 148 laps
to extend his 16-year record of winning at least once this year.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WAS NOT
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett had his motor quit on lap 291, finished 42nd. He
now trails Jeff Gordon by 470 points in the NASCAR Winston Cup
championship race.
</P>
<P>
   POINTS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   After 27 races, Jeff Gordon, 4297; Mark Martin, 4098; Dale
Jarrett, 3827; Rusty Wallace, 3716; Bobby Labonte, 3553.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A friend of Yigal Amir, the assassin who gunned down
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three years ago, was sentenced Sunday
to nine months in prison for failing to prevent the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Margalit Har-Shefi, 23, stood silently eyes as the
sentence was pronounced. Her lawyer said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In imposing the sentence, Judge Nira Lidski said that had Ms.
Har-Shefi ``taken reasonable measures to prevent the crime, this
despicable murder might never have been committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Har-Shefi, who attended law school with Amir, was convicted
three months ago of failing to report Amir's warnings that he would
kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Har-Shefi on Sunday described Amir's threat as ``sounding so
imaginary and so unrealistic then'' that she did not believe it. &QL;

 McGWIRE ENDS SEASON WITH RECORD-SETTING 70 HOME RUNS  
(sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His seasonlong performance so surpassed any
individual performance major league baseball has ever seen that,
Mark McGwire said, ``I'm in awe of myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing that performance with a flourish, McGwire clouted two
more home runs on the last day of the regular season on Sunday,
raising his record total to an unheard of 70. Like a long-distance
runner with an explosive finishing kick, McGwire sprinted away from
the guy next to him, Sammy Sosa, by hitting five home runs in his
last 11 times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who remained at 66 home runs after hitting none on Sunday,
is not finished playing. The Cubs, the team he has carried all
season, will meet the San Francisco Giants in Chicago Monday night
to determine the fourth and final team, the wild-card team, in the
National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa will be hard-pressed to catch McGwire, the
larger-than-life superstar who has imbedded himself in the hearts
of St. Louis and has captivated the rest of the country with his
performance and his demeanor. A player has hit four home runs in a
game only 12 times in major league history, none for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck,'' McGwire said earnestly long distance to the man
who has become his ally in home runs and understanding of what he
has gone through the past six months. ``We've been going back and
forth. It's been a tremendous ride for he and I.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 at
Busch Stadium on Sept. 8 with a line drive over the left field
fence, trailed Sosa only twice this season, each time for less than
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa slugged his way into the lead last Friday night by hitting
his 66th home run in Houston, but 45 minutes later McGwire tied
him, then didn't look back. He socked a pair of home runs against
Montreal pitchers Saturday and connected against two Expos' rookies
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He lofted one of his patented towering fly balls against Mike
Thurman in the third inning that descended gracefully into the
left-field stands for No. 69. Then, an hour and 9 minutes later, he
swung at the first pitch he saw from Carl Pavano and lined it over
the left field fence for No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I did it; can you?'' he said at a post-game
news conference that had become as much a part of his day as
hitting home runs. ``It's absolutely amazing. It blows me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting five home runs in the span of 11 at-bats is incredible
even for the hitter who finished the season with a record low ratio
of one home run every 7.27 at-bats. McGwire had registered the
previous low ratio of 8.13 in 1996, when he hit 52 home runs,
surpassing Babe Ruth's record 8.48 he achieved in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said hitting home runs is getting pitches to hit,
keeping your stroke intact and working hard,'' he said, discussing
his fantastic finish. ``Home runs aren't easy to do. When you work
as hard as I've worked the last few years to really work on my
swing and get full extension, it's paid off.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is she a national role model as first lady? The
president's top crisis manager determined to rescue his legacy? Or
a traumatized victim deserving of America's embrace?
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day, five-state fund-raising tour on behalf of
Democratic candidates for Congress, Hillary Rodham Clinton was
analyzed and lionized, criticized and beatified on each of these
points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, she stayed the course, smiling opaquely and
assuring old friends and political allies that she was ``Just
fine!'' as she thickly larded her speeches with praise of the
president and criticism of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Her steadfast fans could not stop themselves from gushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of like our American Princess Di,'' said Lawrence
Johnson, 30, a front desk clerk at Seattle's Westin Hotel who
caught a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton as she swept in for an evening of
fund raising on Thursday. ``They ought to leave her husband alone.
And she should be our next president!''
</P>
<P>
   With elections just a few weeks away and concerns that the
president's sex scandal may inhibit Democrats from voting, Mrs.
Clinton is getting many standing ovations as she asks audiences to
empty their pockets and get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was speculation that Mrs. Clinton might be
withholding full support from her husband as she sorted out her own
feelings, she put it to rest during her sweep through New York,
Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   At times she seemed to be campaigning even more for Clinton than
she was for the Democratic candidates, tirelessly promoting him as
the president who turned around the economy, reduced crime,
furthered educational reform and balanced the budget for the first
time since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any objective measure, by any fair assessment, our country
is so much better off because of my husband's leadership,'' she
told a crowd of several hundred at a fund-raising dinner for four
congressional candidates in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates said little about the president, and in
some cases they appeared relieved that she, not he, was around.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mrs. Clinton sits at the innermost circle of the
president's crisis-management team, drafting hardball responses to
the Lewinsky scandal and the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit _
and to the Republicans who have attacked the president because of
them. Mrs. Clinton's loyalists believe that she is a first lady
with a future, no matter how the Clinton presidency weathers the
impeachment debate, no matter whether the White House strategy, to
which she has contributed so much, prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction of Mrs. Clinton is that she focuses on the
issues rather than the distractions swirling around Washington,
D.C.,'' said Jay Inslee, who is running for Congress in Washington
state. ``The president is a distraction.''

</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Democratic candidates to focus
attention away from Clinton's woes and toward issues like child
care, education, Social Security and the environment, the
president's troubles kept intruding, often in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   At a re-election fund-raiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer in the grand
ballroom of the San Francisco Hilton Hotel on Friday night, actress
Frances Fisher of ``Titanic'' fame read excerpts from Mrs.
Clinton's best seller, ``It Takes a Village,'' telling the
$250-a-plate audience of 1,100 supporters how children are ``a
moral touchstone amidst the complexity and contentiousness of
modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the sidewalk outside the hotel, 8-year-old Carolyn Ahr
carried a poster that she had drawn with a sad face and the words,
``The president lies and should be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton is a setback for American women,'' said Catherine
Ahr, 37, a homemaker and Carolyn's mother. ``I've never protested
in my life _ and I even went to Berkeley. But this time was
different. What kind of moral message does this whole thing send to
our children?''
</P>
<P>
   In none of her child-related events did Mrs. Clinton answer that
question. None of the candidates did either.
</P>
<P>
   At Portland State University in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton appeared in
front of a big poster that read, ``Kids first'' with David Wu, a
Yale-educated lawyer and candidate for Congress whose main pitch is
education and who praised his guest as ``our nation's foremost
children's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a conflict between Mrs. Clinton's focus
on children's needs and the difficulty parents are having in
explaining her husband's behavior to their children, Wu said, ``I
will have to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So much was said in code and fraught with double meaning on Mrs.
Clinton's campaign tour that it was often hard to sort out what the
real message was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising dinner in Seattle, Mrs. Clinton mocked what
she called ``the other Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the way to look at it,'' she said. ``It's like
a parallel universe and sort of exists out there somewhere in outer
space.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said that the American people do not get enough
political news, and throughout her trip described politics as a
noble calling, exhorting her audiences to ``persuade people that
politics matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first lady, Ms. Boxer, whose daughter is married to
Mrs. Clinton's brother, said flat out in her speech at the
fund-raiser in San Francisco that, ``The president has problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never said what they were. And she blamed the
``extraordinary atmosphere we are living in'' for making it
impossible to get the media to focus on serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just the media that were focusing on sex. There
was also Art Torres, the chairman of the California Democratic
Party, introducing Ms. Boxer and explaining how her Republican
opponent in 1992, Bruce Herschensohn, was ``the family values guy
on every day except Friday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we found out,'' Torres continued, ``he did other
things in his spare time.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience groaned. Some people even cursed their chairman.
(In 1992 the Democrats turned up evidence that Herschensohn had
frequented a nude bar in Hollywood called The Seventh Veil and
bought girlie magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to do that!'' a woman said, referring to
Torres' remarks. ``This is not the time to bring this up.''
</P>
<P>
   As in San Francisco, there were competing demonstrators in
Denver, where Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Thursday for two female
Democratic candidates: Dottie Lamm, Colorado's former first lady
who is running against Ben Nighthorse Campbell for the Senate, and
Gail Schoettler, lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton shook hands with children in front of Fort Logan
Elementary School outside Denver, Ilona Smith, 41, a mental health
worker, shouted, ``Hang in there, Hillary,'' as protesters down the
block chanted, ``Jail Slick Willy.''
</P>
<P>
   One handmade sign read, ``Lyin' King and the Queen of Denial.''
Another read, ``It Takes a Village to Raise an Idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really inappropriate forum for what these people are
doing,'' Ms. Smith said. ``It's rude, it's ill-mannered, it's
embarrassing to Colorado. It's Hillary that's here, not Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke to safe, friendly audiences. No journalists
were allowed to travel on her plane, and she has avoided situations
in which journalists could question her.
</P>
<P>
   She was tireless in raising money and stingy with the chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, posing with her for a picture cost $2,500. She took
a quick hello-and-thank-you approach. ``I told her we support her
and the Democratic agenda,'' said Arun Bhagat, a consulting
engineer. ``She thanked us for coming. Everyone was very tactful.''
His daughter Lavina, 21, apologized to Mrs. Clinton for the bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   At a $200-a-head private reception for 200 people in Denver, ``A
lot of people were doing the two-handed shake, saying thank you for
what you're doing for Gail and Dottie,'' said Laurie Zeller, 38, a
mother of two. ``Nobody made reference to the current crisis in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Support is what Mrs. Clinton needs these days, said Brian Baird,
a clinical psychologist who lost a congressional race in Washington
state in 1996 by fewer than 900 votes and is running again. ``There
was something different in the applause tonight,'' said Baird of
the fund-raiser in Seattle. ``There was a sort of effort to send
some love Hillary's way. We want to help her during this trying
time, in a healing way, to give her a respite from all this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, who teaches psychology and treats cancer patients and
other patients, said that he thought Mrs. Clinton was ``doing
well.'' But then, he added, ```Well' is a relative word.''

EVEN IN DEFEAT, GERMAN CHANCELLOR KOHL MAKES HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-EUROPE, GERMANY-VOTE, GERMANY-REACT) 
(js) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was characteristic that even when Helmut Kohl was finally
ousted in Germany's national elections, he scored a first _ this
time as the first post-war German chancellor to be voted out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a first Kohl relished, to be sure, nor one he likely
worried about. For all his extraordinary firsts and records, both
political and physical _ the first chancellor of a re-united
Germany; the longest-serving German chancellor since Otto von
Bismarck; and, at 6-foot-4 and somewhere around 300 pounds,
indisputably the largest leader in modern Europe _ Kohl has not
spent much of the past 16 years pondering his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hell with history,'' he once snapped at an aide who raised
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   His medium was politics, and it was a medium in which he was
master, even if in the end he failed to recognize when the moment
came to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Kohl attracted an unending stream of
unflattering jokes, and was often perceived by German intellectuals
as something of an embarrassing provincial pol. But nobody ever
questioned his total control of his own party, the Christian
Democratic Union, nor his skill in guiding his nation through the
Byzantine politics of post-war and post-Communist Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If he disdained talk of his ``place in history,'' Kohl bridled
when his opponents accused him of lacking vision. His was as
concrete as it was consistent: to unify his people in the context
of a unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has a better vision here in the Federal Republic?'' he
declared in 1990, on the eve of German re-unification. ``I know no
better concept than the one I represent _ European unification _
because in 10 years we will write 2000 and not 1900, and this
country and this continent will have a chance in the year 2000, and
beyond, only if they are united. OK, there is the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of unity as a ``compass'' in his politics. ``My compass
also says, to an almost emotional degree, friendship with France,
friendship with the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If his formulation lacked the eloquence of a Helmut Schmidt or a
Willy Brandt, Kohl never deviated from his compass, even when his
decisions ran against the political tide.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, his determination to maintain West Germany in a
U.S.-led NATO by allowing the deployment of Pershing II missiles
prompted massive and brutal protests, yet he persevered.
</P>
<P>
   And once the disintegration of the Communist world made the
dream of re-unification possible, he managed the Herculean task of
gaining the acquiescence of the skeptical leaders of the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, and then physically
reuniting the Germanys, within 11 months of the collapse of the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement proved considerably more painful than Kohl
promised, and it was the enormous cost of reunification that
eventually led to Kohl's political fall. But not many politicians
or historians have argued that Kohl erred in his decision to press
ahead with reunification as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn't
been?'' Kohl mused in the spring of 1994 _ one of the many times
when the polls predicted prematurely that his era was coming to an
end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet more than his vision or even his political skills, Kohl's
longevity was probably due to the degree to which he represented
his generation of western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   What his adversaries often perceived as an uncanny political
antenna was rooted in the degree to which he represented a
generation of Germans struggling to reconcile the stigma of their
history with their remarkable economic and political revival.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen when the war ended, Kohl was old enough to know
first-hand the horrors of Nazism and the war, but young enough to
claim what he called ``the absolution of late birth'' _ a notion
that irritated some listeners, but was shared by many of his and
younger generations.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the hinterlands of the Roman Catholic Rhineland, he,
like many West Germans, learned to balance a quiet patriotism
against a constant awareness of how others perceived his people.
Although his insistence on hosting President Ronald Reagan at a
cemetery where some SS soldiers were buried created a furor in
1985, many of his visits, most notably to Poland and to Israel,
became milestones of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   A man who relished quintessentially German foods like stuffed
sow's belly and plum pie, who never shed his provincial Rhineland
accent and commuted regularly to his home town of Ludwigshafen to
mingle with its respectable, hard-working, heavy-eating, prosperous
burghers, Kohl was the image of what his CDU represented. He was
what one writer described as ``the cross-section of the good German
citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in the party almost from the time of its founding after
the war, Kohl rose rapidly, scoring ``first'' at every step: at 30
the youngest member of his state legislature; at 33 the youngest
floor leader; at 39 the youngest state premier; at 43 the youngest
chairman of the Christian Democratic Union; and finally, in 1982,
at the age of 52, the youngest chancellor. He came to control every
facet and every leader of the party, shaping them into a personal
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at every step along his career, critics spoke of his
``luck'' and predicted that he would go no further. His first
speech as a legislator was so terrible that his colleagues wrote
him off. In 1976, the legendary head of the Christian Social Union
in Bavaria, Franz Josef Strauss, declared that Kohl was ``totally
incapable.'' And when Kohl did become chancellor in 1982, his
adversaries noted, it was not through an election, but because the
small Free Democratic Party shifted support from the Social
Democrats to Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kohl never did fare well in polls, usually gaining
office by being at the head of his party's list rather than through
a direct victory. In Sunday's voting, he was defeated in his home
constituency of Ludwigshafen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so often did he defy his challengers and foes that stories
of his revivals became political cliches. When this election came
along, it was a measure of Kohl's reputation that nobody predicted
his loss with any certainty, even when all the polls pointed to it.

 &HT;    McGwire praises fans after establishing HR record
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He had homered in five of his last 11 at-bats, and
his last two hits cleared the fence. But Mark McGwire wasn't
through with business on Sunday. He had a rather large group to
thank.
</P>
<P>
   So after his 70th home run was in the record book, McGwire
walked to the plate and tipped his cap to the 46,110 fans at Busch
Stadium, following the Cardinals' 6-3 victory over Montreal. With
tears rolling down his cheeks and a smile on his red-bearded face,
McGwire pointed to the home crowd and said, ``This probably
wouldn't have happened this season without you.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans went berserk one final time.
</P>
<P>
   Those fans and a baseball nation on Sunday witnessed a perfect
curtain call for a seemingly perfect season for baseball and
McGwire. After hitting two homers on Saturday to break a 66-all tie
with Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa, McGwire nailed his name to the
record with Nos. 69 and 70. McGwire had trailed Sosa for 45 minutes
on Friday night before tying the race at 66 with an fifth-inning
homer. He now leads by four.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa gets one final chance today, when the Cubs and Giants play
each other to determine the NL wildcard spot. But it is unlikely
that he can overcome McGwire's feat. No player in major league
history has ever hit five home runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stranger than fiction, what this man has done,'' St.
Louis manager Tony LaRussa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a season I will never forget, ever forget, and I hope
nobody in baseball ever forget it,'' McGwire said. ``It's over
with, right? I'm absolutely exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a September to remember for baseball. The highlight came
on Sept. 8, when McGwire passed Roger Maris, who had set a record
of 61 in 1961. His two-homer performance on Sunday was the 10th
time this year that he has hit more than one in a game.
</P>
<P>
   His first came on his second at-bat in the third inning on a 1-1
pitch from Expos rookie Mike Thurman. It landed 377 feet away in
the left-field stands. McGwire was walked on four pitches in the
fifth. In the seventh, on the first pitch from reliever Carl
Pavano, he drove the ball 370 feet over the left-field fence for a
three-run shot that broke a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he hits 75 next year so people will forget I gave up
No. 70,'' Pavano said.
</P>
<P>
   The last homer was caught by a Washington University research
scientist, who said he is not sure what he will do with the ball.
Maybe he can compute distances, as in 70 homers that traveled
29,598 feet. That's 5.6 miles of home runs, about 400 feet higher
than Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God the season's over or he would hit 80,'' Expos
manager Felipe Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire led the home run race for all but 103 minutes of the
1998 season. Sosa took the lead twice. Each time McGwire hit home
runs on the same night, two on Aug. 19 to go back ahead of Sosa and
then one on Friday to tie him. Since then it has been all McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also drew his 162nd walk on Sunday, which tied him for
the second highest total in major league history with Ted Williams
(1947 and 1949). McGwire now has 180 homers in his last three
seasons and 94 in 206 games with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis certainly benefitted. Despite finishing 19 games out
of first place, the Cardinals drew almost 3.2 million fans and sold
out their last 14 games. McGwire's contract stipulates that he gets
$1 for every fan over 2.8 million mark, so he received an extra
$395,021 to his $9.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who finished with 147 RBIs, now heads back to his home
Southern California, to relax and reflect with his 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never even thought about it, dreamed about it,'' McGwire
said, when asked about passing Maris. ``It's absolutely amazing. It
blows me away.''

 &HT;    Unexpected sophomore a standout in win over UNC
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Harvey Who?
</P>
<P>
   After the loss of Harvey Middleton and Derrick Steagall,
compounded by the injuries to Mike Sheridan and Jon Muyres, Georgia
Tech's 1998 receiving unit was supposed to be a patchwork job.
</P>
<P>
   So then what was that going on up at North Carolina on Saturday
night? Who was on the other end of quarterback Joe Hamilton's 303
yards passing and three touchdowns in a 43-21 win against the Tar
Heels?
</P>
<P>
   Dez White, for one.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore wideout was a star on Saturday night with six
catches for 171 yards and two touchdowns, all career highs. Those
171 yards were good for the seventh best single-game receiving
output in Tech history and most of them came with two-time
All-American cornerback Dre Bly on his tail.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play from scrimmage, Hamilton found White all alone
20 yards downfield. White dropped to his knees and pumped his fists
like he was celebrating with some bicep curls. He was in that same
pose in a photo that ran in newspapers from Raleigh to Atlanta
Sunday showing his reaction to a 56-yard touchdown catch in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   White, who spent his freshman season dropping passes all over
the practice field, caught all but two balls thrown his way on
Saturday, including two deep balls, the game's most important
touchdown on a 20-yard reception early in the second quarter, and
three passes to convert third downs. His only drop came on a corner
route in the end zone when he apparently lost the ball in the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   White doesn't appear to be resting on any progress he's made
over the early part of this season. He stayed after practice last
Thursday to throw and catch a ball tied to a fence by an elastic
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing that on his own,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said
Sunday. ''That's why he's getting better. He's one of the hardest
workers on the team. He's still making some mistakes, but he really
has improved from last year doing the little things receivers do.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Rogers is starting to show how much he can add at slot
receiver. He was Tech's second-leading receiver on Saturday with
three catches for 63 yards. David Powell caught one pass for a big
gain (38 yards) and tight end Russell Matvay made his only catch
count on a fourth down conversion for an 18-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan was back from a knee sprain on Saturday night but
wasn't really needed. He caught one pass for no gain. Muyres didn't
make the trip because of his foot injury. Still, O'Leary knows Tech
needs both those guys fullspeed and active for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still never have enough playmakers,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   MUYRES UPDATE: An MRI last Thursday confirmed that Muyres has
plantar fasciaitis, inflammation of a tendon extending from his
achilles to the bottom of his foot. Muyres had rested for three
weeks when he tried to come backto practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said Muyres will see a specialist on Tuesday to
determine what else can be done. Muyres, a junior, has not taken a
redshirt year and that is an option, though not one he or O'Leary
wants to exercise at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to have Jon Muyres in there,'' O'Leary said. ''The
kid wants to play. It's a tough position to play when you're not
100 percent healthy. Basically we want to make sure we've tried
everything, that there's nothing more we can do.''

CLINTON AIDES PAVING WAY FOR A JONES SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-HILLARY-POLITICS,
CLINTON-HOLLYWOOD, CLINTON-POLITICS, CLINTON-STRATEGY.)

 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior aide to President Clinton sought Sunday to
prepare the public for a possible settlement of Paula Jones' sexual
misconduct lawsuit, saying that it should not be taken as an
admission by the president that Mrs. Jones' accusations are true.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, one of Clinton's
closest confidants, told reporters in San Antonio, where he is
traveling with the president, that the negotiations between lawyers
for both sides ``have nothing to do with wrongdoing on anybody's
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey suggested that the efforts to settle the lawsuit were
merely an effort to get rid of a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits are settled all the time,'' he said. ``People made a
determination that the costs of settlement are less than the costs
of going forward.'' He said that the president had already paid
dearly in lost time because of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But other White House advisers have acknowledged there are other
reasons Clinton is suddenly eager to settle. Although the president
and his lawyers have derided the lawsuit for years as an outrageous
legal fraud, they say they believe that a settlement would help
them battle impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers said Sunday they would not budge very much
from their demand that Clinton pay $1 million to settle her
lawsuit, a position based on a calculation that the president's
need to end the matter is greater than hers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lawyers have already offered $500,000 for
her to withdraw the lawsuit that led to his current impeachment
problems. Both sides said they believed a settlement was possible
and could be reached sometime this week. The Jones camp had earlier
set a deadline of Tuesday morning for negotiations but that has
already been relaxed, lawyers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones filed suit against Clinton in 1994, contending that
three years earlier, when he was governor of Arkansas, he had her
summoned to his hotel suite in Little Rock and, when alone, made a
crude sexual proposition. In a deposition taken in January, Clinton
testified under oath to Mrs. Jones' lawyers that he had not engaged
in ``sexual relations'' with Monica Lewinsky. He has since admitted
that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had intimate contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones lawsuit was dismissed last April and, while it is
exceedingly rare for a party to pay to settle a lawsuit he has
already won, Clinton's advisers have said that they feared that an
appeals court would reinstate the case.

   Clinton has always denied Mrs. Jones' accusation, and previous
settlement negotiations had foundered on her insistence that he
provide an apology or some form of acknowledgment that he had
behaved badly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have dropped the demand for an apology,
saying that Clinton's admission of a liaison with Ms. Lewinsky has
made such a concession unnecessary. ``We think by now everyone
knows that Paula was telling the truth,'' John Whitehead, one of
Mrs. Jones' lawyers said in an interview.

 &HT;    Cowboys' Garrett played like the backup he is
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys came up just short. About 13
laterals and a trombone player short. That's if you really thought
Dallas had a chance on Oakland's final free punt to duplicate the
University of California's madcap, highlight-reel kick return
through the horn section of Stanford's band to stun the Cardinal
more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they were a quarterback short _ a true starting
quarterback anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Blame this 13-12 loss to the Raiders on the fall of Troy two
weeks ago at Mile High Stadium. When Troy Aikman broke his left
collarbone against Denver, forcing Jason Garrett into the starting
lineup, the Cowboys got exactly what they paid for: a backup
quarterback making near the NFL minimum, giving maximum effort with
minimal skills.
</P>
<P>
   This is no knock on Garrett. He is what he is. A super guy, a
solid player, a cerebral guy (read: he can't air it out 60 yards),
a backup guy. He went to Princeton for a reason, and he's been
Dallas' second-string quarterback for six seasons for another
reason. He does not have the arm of Aikman or the experience of
Aikman or the savvy of Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   He cost Dallas the game, but he was not supposed to be in a
position of having to win the game in the first place. That is not
his job description, as outlined by boss Chan Gailey, who prefers
that Garrett play smart and not make crucial mistakes. On Sunday at
Texas Stadium, he made crucial mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a drive-killing interception in the Oakland end zone
when Michael Irvin went left and Garrett threw right. He had a
false-start penalty and failed to connect on a third-down pass to
Chris Warren before Richie Cunningham misfired on a usually
makeable, 37-yard field goal. He misread double coverage and forced
a deep ball to Billy Davis that was easily picked off by safety
Eric Turner within 91 seconds remaining, effectively ending the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett knew he did all those things and readily accepted the
blame. Irvin, however, stewed privately, dressing in private
quarters and leaving without a comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the miscommunication with Irvin, Garrett said, ``Michael
turned the thing inside, and I threw the ball outside. I made a
poor throw. It was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the final throw to Davis, Garrett said, ``Obviously, it was a
poor decision.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can ever say Garrett doesn't have class. The contrast
between his first two starts was striking in their similarities. In
the Cowboys' dramatic 31-7 trouncing of the New York Giants on
Monday night, he threw for 222 yards. On Sunday, he again threw for
222 yards but had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, however, Garrett was simply part of a
machine that scored on a punt return and an interception return and
got suffocating defensive play that held New York to 56 yards
rushing. On Sunday, Garrett was asked to win the game because
Emmitt Smith was held to 59 yards and a 2.8-yard average while
Oakland chewed up yardage and precious clock time with 129 yards
rushing, most of them from Napoleon Kaufman, who averaged 4.8 yards
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett was hardly the sole factor behind Dallas' loss. Davis
had a pivotal drop on the second play of the half on what would
have been a big gainer. There was the rare Cunningham missed field
goal. Tight end David LaFleur was close to a touchdown on a post
pattern until cornerback Eric Allen tipped away the ball. But why
didn't the Cowboys go back to that play or ever look for LaFleur
again? He's had two catches for eight yards in four games, making
him the biggest draft bust since Shante Carver.
</P>
<P>
   True, Oakland lucked out on its one big offensive play of the
game, a 75-yard, off-the-shoulder-pads, off-the-hands,
off-the-Sears-Tower touchdown catch by James Jett. But it played
fire-eating run defense and tackled punt returner Deion Sanders
before he ever made the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The loss could cost 2-2 Dallas home-field advantage down the
line but probably not more. Remember, somebody has to win the NFC
Least. Garrett will play .500 ball as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason did some good things and some things you wished he'd
done over,'' Gailey said. ``I don't have a magic formula. I can't
sprinkle any magic dust around.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Garrett was to blame, but he had company. And his 3-1
career record is still better than anyone could expect from a
clipboard technician (the NFL Players Association insists on
respectful euphemism). You don't see Trent Green saving the
Redskins or rookies Ryan Leaf or Peyton Manning perching their
teams on the Super Bowl's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   There's a learning process at work here, and Dallas was just
reminded of that painful lesson. Garrett's a perennial backup
quarterback for a reason. Now the Cowboys should back him up with a
stronger supporting cast.

HAITIANS FAIL TO PREPARE AFTER MANY FALSE ALARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONT SONDE, Haiti _ When it became clear last Monday that
Hurricane Georges would hit Haiti, Jean-Claude Delice, a
development official here in the Artibonite Valley, went on the
radio begging residents to evacuate their homes and sent a team of
his people with bullhorns to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But few people in this farming area about 60 miles from the
capital, Port-au-Prince, paid attention. Similar warnings issued
before past storms had proven unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody took us seriously,'' Delice said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, torrential rains and high winds from
the hurricane hit the area, forcing residents to flee in haste.
</P>
<P>
   Homes, livestock and crops were swept away by the flooding that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, entire villages were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Delice sent his men out again, this time in large trucks to
remote villages to rescue stranded residents.
</P>
<P>
   Delice said his organization was operating three shelters for a
total of about 1,500 people who were receiving a daily ration of
bread, milk, rice and beans, and water. But his supplies are
running perilously low as more homeless people flock to shelters
every day seeking help, Delice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't have the means to feed all of these people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm and flooding killed at least 94 people, with 60 still
missing. Hurricane Georges also destroyed much cropland in this
region, a fertile crescent of huge rice patties and banana
plantations that is considered Haiti's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials face the problems of providing immediate relief to
the stricken farmers and restoring crops and livestock production.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the destruction wrought on this country, the poorest in
the Western Hemisphere, there is a pervasive feeling here that the
damage could have been considerably worse, that the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola, took the brunt of
the storm's force.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, officials and residents here blamed the
severity of the flooding on the government's failure to stop the
deforestation of Haiti's mountains by people felling trees for
charcoal. The denuded mountains absorb little rainwater, increasing
runoff and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has not done anything to combat erosion,'' said
Sen. Rvelt Chery, an agronomist and a member of President Rene
Preval's party. ``Are we going to wait for another natural disaster
to do something?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday in Pont Sonde, at a gymnasium turned into a makeshift
shelter, scores of people crowded around the courtyard and told in
chilling details how they barely escaped death, and mourned
relatives and friends who were not as lucky. Some said they had
paddled to safety in canoes, many hopped aboard trucks and others
climbed up trees.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Augustin said she was sleeping when she suddenly
sensed that she was under water. Her husband went into the next
room and grabbed their two children. They made it to safety aboard
a pickup truck. As they drove away, their possessions streamed
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' said Mrs. Augustin, clutching her
children, Alfred, 7, and Dieudonne, 10. ``The whole town was like
an ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Florisia Jean said that when the flood came, her first reaction
was to grab her five children and whisk them away to safety.
``That's all I have left,'' she said pointing to the blue skirt and
white T-shirt she was wearing. ``We are in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week after Hurricane Georges left its path of
destruction, makeshift shelters at schools, churches and civic
centers here and across the country have been overwhelmed as
hundreds of people continue to fill them daily. So far there are
more than 150,000 people left homeless, officials in the capital
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims live in far-off areas that are difficult to
reach even under normal conditions. And while it has not rained in
Haiti in several days, many villages and towns remain heavily
flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to differentiate between land and sea,'' said Elange
Theodule, a father of three children who was forced to flee his
hometown of Seguin, a coastal hamlet near here. ``My first priority
was saving my family.''
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the hardest thing was the loss of their
livestock. In rural Haiti they are a kind of savings account for
farmers, who use them to pay for events like first communion,
baptisms and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sleeping on trees like our animals,'' Clovis Daniel, a
cattle rancher who lost his entire stock of 15, said, referring to
sleeping quarters that he shared with about a hundred other people.
``Next time, we will listen. We know the realities of a storm.''

 &HT;    Georges to kick into Gulf Monday
 &HT;    (EDS: CQ Tchoutacabouffa River and D'Iberville.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAVELAND, Miss. _ Charles &AMP; Ramona's Lounge was feeling the
punch Sunday from tidal surges and heavy rains kicked up by the
approach of Hurricane Georges, the most dreaded visitor since
Camille flooded this bayou town nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The churning waters of the Mississippi Sound rushed across Beach
Boulevard before noon Sunday, long before Georges' expected
landfall today, a frightening omen for the low-lying southwestern
tip of Mississippi where thousands fled for higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get kicked royally,'' said Orville Ferrell,
47, a construction worker drinking Bud Light at Charles &AMP; Ramona's.
</P>
<P>
   Three blocks from the Waveland waterfront, the cinderblock pool
hall filled with four feet of water when Camille, the century's
most powerful hurricane, struck in 1969 with winds topping 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Georges' 110-mph winds aren't nearly as strong, but the broad,
plodding storm is forecast to dump torrential rains for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Gulf Coast is also positioned to be battered by
Georges' most punishing northeastern winds and tidal surges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not scared, you need to be scared,'' said A.J.
Holloway, mayor of Biloxi, the waterfront gambling town under a
curfew extending along much of the Gulf Coast since Sunday night.
``It is severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Hurricane Elena in 1985 has the Mississippi Gulf Coast
suffered widespread hurricane damage. Since then, billions have
been invested in coastal development spurred by casino gambling's
arrival in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 coastal casinos were closed, including the Copa Casino, a
refurbished cruise ship in Gulfport. Emergency preparedness
officials wanted the vessel to be towed to open waters, but it
waited too long and the Coast Guard would not let it leave, Switzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulfport area is bracing for ``as much as 30 hours of
hurricane-force winds and 60 hours of gale-force winds,'' said C.T.
Switzer, president of the Harrision County Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be something different than what we've had in
the past,'' Switzer said. ``Usually hurricanes have come through
here with six or seven hours of wind and rain, and we're through.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gulfport, a roadside sign at St. Andrew Church of God in
Christ in Gulfport admonished, ``Be sure your anchor holds to the
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rural community of Pineville, near Long Beach, Billy
Bell, 53, positioned his fleet of dump trucks facing northward so
that debris blowing from the south wouldn't shatter the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it would be going somewhere else,'' he said, smoking a
cigar and contemplating whether to evacuate to a shelter. ``I'll
decide when the winds get up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, winds in advance of Georges forced water into the
bayous that threatened houses and mobile homes along the Jourdan
River. Captains seeking refuge for their vessels anchored them on
the Tchoutacabouffa River near I-10, west of D'Iberville.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities closed all draw bridges, which prevented other
vessels from moving into inland rivers to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Plywood covering doors and windows marred the stately historic
homes along the Mississippi Sound in Pass Christian and Bay St.
Louis. Newspapers lay in driveways Sunday morning, suggesting that
homeowners had already evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay,'' said 80-year-old Charles R. Johnson,
retired pastor of Christ Episcopal Church in Bay St. Louis. He
stood with his daughter-in-law and six grandchildren beneath a
sweeping live oak tree with branches sculpted by decades of winds.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Georges wouldn't be as bad as Camille, which
flooded the rectory where he lived and forced him to tread through
waist-deep water to another house.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, though, the house where he now lives with his
family has a second floor.
</P>
<P>
   In Long Beach, homeowners filled bags from a huge pile of
grayish-white sand. Ric Williams, 33, figured he'd try to block
water from entering his front and back doors.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``If the water gets high enough, all the sand bags
in the world will not make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Some emergency shelters near the coast filled rapidly, and
late-comers were instructed to travel to shelters hurriedly opened
farther inland.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson County, officials opened four more shelters Sunday.
``That has put a strain on our manpower and our supplies, but I am
not going to turn anybody away,'' said Joe Rosa, manager of the
American Red Cross shelter at St. Martin High School near Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross estimated that more than 3,500 people were already
in shelters as far away as Vicksburg, Jackson, and Meridian, with
the number steadily climbing. The Mississippi National Guard opened
Camp Shelby, south of Hattiesburg, to evacuees. Officials said
facilities there could house as many as 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer said about 250 shelters were open along the coast. He
said the county would do everything possible to provide food but
that people ought to be prepared for up to three days in the
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   From the second-level deck of the Patio Apartments in Long
Beach, Joe Bergeron, 46, watched the rising sound creep toward U.S.
90, the four-lane highway that runs along Mississippi's 26 miles of
beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect deck for a hurricane party,'' he said. ``But
I'm staying sober in case I have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Highways heading northward were busy, as were the few businesses
that remained open during mandatory evacuation orders in Harrison,
Hancock and Jackson counties.
</P>
<P>
   Waffle Houses strung along I-10 were packed, including the one
in Diamondhead. Motorists waited nervously for seats, as cooks
scrambled to keep up with orders before items, including bacon and
hamburger buns, ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The Flying J Travel Plaza near Gulfport finally closed its doors
around noon and shut down its gas pump, leaving people waiting in
line to buy fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the Hampton Inn in Ocean Springs urged guests to
fill their bathtubs with water, as an emergency supply for drinking
and flushing toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard closed ports at Pascagoula and Gulfport to
commercial shipping traffic late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's barrier islands _ Petit Bois, Ship and Horn _ were
evacuated Friday, when Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice declared a
state of emergency. The state's four deep-water ports were also
evacuated.

 &HT;    Gulf residents, visitors keep nervous eye on Georges
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ In downtown Mobile, which sits on the
northwestern end of Mobile Bay and uses name like Canal and Water
for its streets, staff at the Radisson Admiral Semmes Hotel started
stacking sandbags outside the building's glass doors around 6 p.m.
Sunday. By then, gusts stirred by Hurricane Georges had picked up
and rain fell harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting,'' said the hotel's gift shop owner, who
identified herself only as Donna. ``We have a lot of out-of-town
guests, press and insurance agents. We had some people here from
Lousiana who got stuck here because the airport closed.''
</P>
<P>
   On its way to an expected landfall near New Orleans, Georges
lashed beaches east of here, knocking down a pier at Orange Beach,
and sending 25-foot waves crashing against concrete barriers
protecting buildings at Gulf Shores.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening Sunday the normally busy Perdido Beach
Boulevard through Gulf Shores and Orange Beach was deserted of all
but emergencyt vehicles, as officials
</P>
<P>
   Pat Jackson, with the Mobile/Bay Area Red Cross, estimated that
nearly 1,000 people had gone to eight shelters opened in Baldwin
County, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies stood at the Florida-Alabama state line
turning back motorists attempting to flee Georges' feeder lines
striking the Florida Panhandle around Pensacola. Officials said the
storm was even more intense along the Alabama coast.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Davis, 81, was one of the guests at the Radisson hotel in
Mobile about eight blocks from his home. ``I'm here at the
insistence of my daughter,'' said Davis, who lives alone and went
through Hurricane Frederic, which struck here in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just usuallty go to bed and sleep through them,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dauphin Street, Mobile's version of New Orlean's Bourbon
Street, businesses were shut down, their plateglass windows covered
with plywood or masking tape. The aptly named ``Monsoons'' tavern
was closed but its white and purple neon sign burned brightly in
the gloomy dusk.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, 11,000 residents near Mobile _ most of them on
the barrier islands _ had lost electricity. Minimal hurricane gusts
of 75 mph blew across Dauphin Island around 6 p.m. Sustained
measurements clocked at 60 mph grew steadily through the night. For
those with power who watched the local Fox affiliate, they saw
WALA-TV broadcast storm coverage in a split-screen that showed the
Atlanta Falcons-San Francisco 49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobile County Commission declared a state of emergency late
Sunday afternoon as some residents ventured out of their homes to
sightsee during lulls between feeder bands.

   BONN, Germany _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, defeated
Helmut Kohl Sunday in the race to become chancellor, ending an era
in Germany and opening a new one in Europe where center-left
governments now dominate the continent's politics.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard-fought campaign, the victory was decisive, a clear
expression of the weariness of Germans with Kohl's 16-year rule.
Schroeder swept aside the Christian Democrat chancellor, who
oversaw the peaceful unification of Germany in 1990 and personified
the Cold War's end in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat of Kohl, 68, the last European leader in office
when the Berlin wall came down in 1989 has departed, reflecting the
new priorities that confront a continent grappling with the
competitive pressures of a global economy, overburdened welfare
systems and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have chosen a change of generation,'' Schroeder,
54, declared to a cheering crowd outside the Social Democratic
Party headquarters in Bonn. He had embodied youth during the
campaign, and a Germany less burdened by its past, and it was on
this wave that he rode to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Born into poverty, Schroeder came into politics on the leftist
wave of the 1960s. But his outlook evolved toward pragmatism, and
he fought this campaign on an often vague platform of modernization
and renewal under the slogan ``the New Middle'' and the clear
inspiration of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl pressed his vision of the rise from the ruins of
Nazism and his view of Germany's place in Europe on his countrymen,
Schroeder talked about jobs. The strategy worked because a new
generation of Germans is tired of history lessons and more
concerned that their society is fraying than worried about their
geo-strategic status.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder and his followers said many things at once,
reassuring businessmen with talk of lower taxes and the need to
reform the welfare system, while reassuring workers with promises
of better benefits and pensions. The first months in office may
confront him with wrenching choices between divergent campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think politics is more psychological than rational, and this
result for us Germans is an injection of energy,'' said Henning
Frase, 20, a student. ``It is ridiculous, in a democracy, to have a
leader for as long as we had Mr. Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other center-left leaders in Europe, including Blair and
Lionel Jospin in France, Schroeder will now face a central issue:
how to adjust Germany's expensive welfare system to global
competition without dismantling it and at the same time create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the post-war republic that Germans
voted a chancellor out of office, and they did so with gusto,
dismissing Kohl's warnings of instability to usher in the first
Social Democratic chancellor of Europe's most powerful state since
Helmut Schmidt in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   When Schmidt left office, the main issue in Germany was the
deployment of medium-range U.S. missiles on German soil aimed at
the Soviet Union _ a measure of the colossal distance traveled in
Germany and in Europe under Kohl, the longest-serving chancellor
since Otto von Bismark.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining an estimated 41.2 percent of the vote, up from 36.4
percent in the last election in 1994, the Social Democrats
inflicted their most decisive victory ever on the Christian
Democrats, whose vote plunged more than 6 percentage points to 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, under Willy Brandt in 1972, had the Social
Democrats gained more votes than their principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what kind of government Schroeder
would form. Computer predictions suggested that he would have a
narrow majority in the 656-member Bundestag, or parliament, in a
coalition with the environmentalist Greens, the party with which he
has said he wants to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ``Red Green'' coalition has never been tried and would be
a radical departure for a conservative country with an aversion to
risk.

 BONN, Germany: to risk.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Greens have in the past called for a review of Germany's
NATO membership, causing concern in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, however, vowed continuity in foreign policy. He also
promised to foster reconciliation in a country still divided
between the west and its formerly Communist east, and said his most
important goal would be the fight ``against the plague of
unemployment.'' More than 4 million people, or 10.6 percent of the
population, are out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had a close relationship with Kohl, said in a
statement that he looked forward to working closely with Schroeder.
``Germany is one of America's closest allies,'' he said. ``As
always our two governments will be fully engaged in a comprehensive
policy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Two central transformations set in motion under Kohl will now be
completed by Schroeder: the return next year of the German capital
to Berlin 44 years after Hitler's defeat, and the abandonment in
2002 of the beloved German mark, symbol of postwar stability, for a
European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not opt for an alliance with the Greens, or if his
majority proves too slim to make that partnership workable, the
alternative for Schroeder would be a ``grand coalition'' with the
Christian Democrats, an unwieldy alliance not tried for three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder declined to discuss possible coalitions until Monday,
saying he wanted to savor his victory. But he met late Sunday with
Joschka Fischer, the leader of the Greens, who has said he would
like to become deputy chancellor and foreign minister. The Greens
took 6.7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl dismissed the possibility of a grand coalition, saying the
electorate ``has clearly opted for Red-Green.'' Kohl's finance
minister, Theo Waigel, said such a coalition would be ``absolutely
the wrong way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared clear that having suffered an overwhelming defeat,
the Christian Democrats were determined to let Schroeder confront
Germany's problems without them, hoping to benefit from the
difficulties he is almost certain to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl made clear that he would abandon the leadership of the
Christian Democrats. He said he would ask the next party congress
to propose a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that Kohl made a fundamental mistake in
seeking a fifth term himself, rather than passing the mantle to his
deputy, Wolfgang Schaeuble. Several opinion polls have shown
Schaeuble to be the most popular politician in Germany, while
Kohl's lack of popularity was driven home by the fact that on
Sunday he lost his home seat of Ludwigshafen to a Social Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary reverse for the leader universally
hailed just eight years ago as Germany reunited. But unification
has proved more costly and difficult than foreseen, and the
tensions it engendered certainly contributed to Kohl's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many promises were made by Kohl, and nothing happened,''
said Uwe Terhorst, a disillusioned supporter of the Christian
Democrats. ``Workers were frustrated, taxes were up, and people had
lost faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In the former east, where one in five people of working age is
out of work, the level of disenchantment was revealed in a strong
vote for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the
East German Communist Party. It gained an estimated 5 percent of
the national vote, virtually all of it in the former East.
</P>
<P>
   Under German electoral law, a 5 percent score or a direct
victory in at least three districts is the condition for entering
parliament. As the party won four districts, it was assured of
entering the Bundestag.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's majority with the Greens _ perhaps 334 seats of a
total of 656 _ would have been much greater if the former
Communists had failed to qualify and their votes had been
redistributed, increasing the seats of the parties that did make it
into parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, premier of the northern state of Lower Saxony, will
become only the seventh chancellor of the postwar republic. He has
vowed not to govern in a coalition with the former Communists. It
is a measure of Germany's sensitive history _ marked by Hitler's
fascism and more than four decades of Communist rule over East
Germany _ that even today a coalition with the Party of Democratic
Socialism is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, the situation is different. In France,
Jospin governs in coalition with the Communists, and in Italy,
Romano Prodi relies on the support of the former Communists.

<P>
   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ Under a blazing
Caribbean sun that made him squint as he worked, Rafael Dennis
began trying to rebuild his mother's little wood-frame house Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was not going to be an easy job.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of thousands of people here in the Dominican
Republic whose homes were blown down or damaged when Hurricane
Georges struck last Tuesday, Dennis, in one of the hardest hit
areas, had almost nothing to work with. No lumber, no roofing
materials. Not even nails.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with much of the wreckage of the storm cleared away, Dennis
and many of the others were salvaging rusty nails, unbroken boards
and anything else they could find to piece their homes back
together. In every neighborhood, it seemed, men were up on ladders,
balanced on roofs with hammers and saws flashing in the sun, as the
country struggled to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis and some of the others said they hoped the government
would send trucks with corrugated tin for roofs. But they also knew
that the authorities had been preoccupied with opening roads,
restoring electricity and searching for missing people.
</P>
<P>
   And although relief supplies have begun to arrive from abroad,
many of the country's 8 million people have yet to receive any
help. Moreover, people who have tried to buy supplies say some
merchants have doubled their prices.
</P>
<P>
   For some Dominicans the worst of Hurricane Georges is still not
over. Adriano Tejada, the chief spokesman for President Leonel
Fernandez, said that at least a handful of towns and villages north
and west of the capital were still cut off by flood waters. The
government shipped food to a staging point near some of those
places, but it was not clear whether it reached the final
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have reported 201 deaths, mainly from
flooding and mudslides, but Hugh Parmer, a Texas lawyer who is now
in charge of humanitarian aid for the U.S. Agency for International
Development, said in an interview here that as many as 200 more
might be dead.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dominican government has not yet issued an estimate of
the cost of the destruction, Parmer said he expected it to run to
about $3 billion, or about $500 million more than the nation's
entire operating budget for this year. Officials have estimated the
hurricane damage in Puerto Rico at $2 billion. One reason losses
there were lower, Parmer said, was that Puerto Rico appeared to
have been better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.S. representatives, led by Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., the
chairman of the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, flew in
from Puerto Rico Sunday afternoon to talk with Fernandez and other
officials and to visit a shelter for storm victims. As they were
leaving a few hours later, Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said he would
support an increase in aid for the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer said the United States had already spent about $500,000
in the relief effort here so far, and it expected to spend up to
several million dollars altogether.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dominican newspapers have reported that the hurricane caught
many Dominicans by surprise and the newspapers have criticized the
government, saying that it failed to issue adequate warnings.
Sunday morning, one of the leading newspapers, Listin Diario,
quoted Nicolas Cardinal de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez as saying the
government's lack of preparation had contributed to the nation's
losses. Responding earlier to the newspapers, Elpedio Baez, the
Dominican Civil Defense director, said he believed that the
criticism was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer said Dominican officials had privately conceded to him
that they ``just underestimated the impact'' of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 20 years since they've had a bad storm like this,''
he said. ``It's human nature that when something happens that long
ago, you forget.''
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro de Macoris, overlooking the Caribbean, 32 miles west
of the capital city of Santo Domingo, had the misfortune of being
directly in the path of the hurricane as it steered a deadly course
along the southern coast before veering inland and tearing across
Haiti, the Dominican Republic's neighbor on the island of
Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro is a city of more than 100,000 people, mostly poor and
working class, dominated by sugar mills and dreams of big league
baseball. It is the home of Sammy Sosa and scores of other baseball
stars. Even in their misery, nearly everyone seemed to be thinking
Sunday of the Chicago Cubs slugger as he battled to become the home
run king.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great to see a fellow Dominican with such stature,''
said Efrain Vasquez, a 29-year-old factory worker, as he sat on a
stone bench in the small plaza known as Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane jabbed and punched at this entire city. But the
most crippling blows fell on the poorest people whose homes, like
those of Dennis and his mother, had been fine shelters from the sun
and the usual tropical downpours, but were no match for the
110-mile-per-hour gusts of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Garcia lives in a neighborhood of small wood and
concrete-block houses, Barrio Blanco, along the eastern bank of the
Higamo River. She and her six children figured they would ride out
the storm in their two-room concrete-block house. But as the winds
began to shake the house, they ran to a neighbor's bigger house,
higher up the bank. When the winds died down, all that was left of
Ms. Garcia's house was the front wall and half of another wall.
</P>
<P>
   At the white-washed, colonial-style Cathedral of San Pedro,
homeless families have set up house in the pews. And they are
pretty much on their own. Miguelina Contrera, a widow who ran to
the church when the calm eye of the storm passed over, after the
windows in her house had been blown out and the roof torn off, said
that neither the government nor the church had offered the refugees
anything but shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the clothes she and her daughters, ages 2 and 9, were
wearing, they had only a garbage bag with two thin blankets and a
couple of shirts. Beside them was a yellow plastic motor oil jug
with water that Ms. Contrera said was not fit to drink.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's industrial park, where row after row of low-rise
factories produce things like clothing and simple medical
equipment, tractor-trailers still lay on their sides Sunday as
workers patched roofs and tried to coax drenched machinery to work.
</P>
<P>
   Working on his mother's home Sunday, Dennis said he was not sure
where or when he would get his hands on the lumber and roofing
supplies he needed. But, he said, he thought he had salvaged enough
to finish at least a single room so she could stop living with
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do this,'' he said. ``I feel bad because she's lost
everything.''

POTENTIALLY BIG SECURITY FLAW FOUND IN NETSCAPE SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A potentially serious security flaw has been
discovered in the programming language used in the Navigator and
Communicator software of the Netscape Communications Corp., with
the defect possibly allowing an outsider to read information on a
personal computer user's hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness, which was disclosed in Usenet online discussion
groups on Friday by Dan Brumleve, a 20-year-old independent
computer consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif., can be exploited by the
Javascript programming language, which is widely used by World Wide
Web page developers for a variety of common tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Brumleve said that he had tested the attack on a range of
Navigator and Communicator programs, up through the most recent
test version of Communicator, 4.5, and found the flaw in all of
them. The vulnerability does not affect the Microsoft Explorer
browser and e-mail program, Brumleve said.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to take advantage of the vulnerability by writing a
30-line piece of Javascript code that is able to capture and copy
information automatically from the so-called cache, or temporary
storage area, on a PC's hard disk. The captured information can
reveal which Web sites a computer user has recently visited.
</P>
<P>
   The captured information could also include data that a computer
user might have created when communicating with a Web site _
including personal data typed in when registering at a site or
conducting a retail transaction. Credit card information, however,
would not be revealed, because it is protected by separate security
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me, because it means that a high-traffic Web site
might use this to find out what other Web sites their visitors are
going to,'' Brumleve said in a telephone interview Sunday. He said
that the flaw could also be used by an employer to see if employees
were searching for pornography, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no evidence that the security flaw has
actually been exploited by someone with harmful intent, the gravity
of the threat was noted by other computer security specialists.
They noted that a user's vulnerability extends beyond visiting a
hostile Web site that might exploit the flaw. The flaw could also
be exploited through e-mail received using Netscape's software,
they said, by sending an intended victim an e-mail message that
would secretly force the user to run an illicit Javascript program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty scary,'' said Richard M. Smith, president of
Phar Lap Software Inc., a software development company in
Cambridge, Mass. ``In some sense the cache on your computer tells a
lot about your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy of personal information on the Internet has become an
increasingly sensitive issue in recent years as many Web sites have
begun systematically collecting demographic information on Internet
users. But this newly discovered flaw could enable an unscrupulous
person or organization to basically read a person's full Web
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge privacy issue and it goes directly to the
current lack of adequate technical standards to protect privacy on
line,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a public policy group in Washington. ``There's
even a question of a company like Netscape might be liable for the
improper disclosure of private information.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape said Sunday that it was still assessing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a look at the bug, which appears to have privacy
implications,'' said Eric Byunn, a Netscape product manager. He
said that the company would make an announcement soon about its
plans for responding to the flaw.

 &HT;    Meet the new Falcons, same as the old Falcons
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nothing changes around here. Little cable cars
still race halfway to the sky. That golden bridge hasn't ceased
sparkling across the bay. Oh, and the San Francisco 49ers continue
to make the Atlanta Falcons look absolutely pathetic whenever they
visit Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the new Falcons. These were the old Falcons, minus
Charles Dimry. Then again, Dimry was around in spirit Sunday at
3Com Park during the Falcons' latest Bashing by the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the Falcons' rush near the end to squeeze the final score
to a tolerable 31-20. Said 49ers safety Merton Hanks, ``It was a
combination of them playing hard in the second half and us shutting
it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the 49ers lost interest after they rolled to the
easiest of 31-7 leads at halftime to expose the Falcons' 2-0 start
as a fraud. But the good news for the Falcons is that they don't
have to play the 49ers every week in a league filled with
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the bad news was delivered to the Falcons by their
exceptional hosts, and that is the Falcons remain a long ways from
reaching the elite any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a long ways,'' said Falcons president Taylor Smith,
echoing the words of Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who declared, ``As
you can see, we're definitely not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many around the Falcons' locker room agreed, but they really
hadn't much of a choice. ``Let's face it,'' said Falcons safety
Eugene Robinson, shaking his head, before telling nothing but the
truth. ``That first half for us was horrid. We did nothing. We did
absolutely nothing. I mean, they just beat the crap out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum. And did we tell you that the drive down the coast to
Monterey remains quite lovely this time of year?
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who don't remember Dimry, Jerry Rice certainly
does. Once, Rice advanced his legend as the NFL's deadliest
receiver by torching Dimry in the Falcons' secondary for five
touchdowns. This time, Rice finished with only two, but he powered
his way to 162 yards on eight catches.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had help, too. In fact, with Dimry's spirit running deeply
for the Falcons' defensive backs in general and cornerback Juran
Bolden and Robinson in particular, nobody wearing a Falcons uniform
has yet to tackle anybody wearing a 49ers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, while the Falcons' pass rush was allowing 49ers
quarterback Steve Young to count the number of seagulls in the sky
whenever he dropped into the pocket, Falcons quarterback Chris
Chandler was wondering if he'd leave town with his fingers and
toes. He was sacked seven times, but it seemed like 70 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum. This sounds like last year, and the year before that,
and each of the four years before that. Only the final score to
these blowouts changes when the Falcons dare to meet the 49ers
around here.
</P>
<P>
   On this soggy afternoon, it took the 49ers only 43 seconds after
the opening kickoff to race toward making history repeat. That's
when (who else?) Young fired a 66-yard touchdown pass to (who
else?) Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we came back in the second half, `` Robinson said,
``there are no moral victories in this league. It was just a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum.
</P>

 &HT;    49ers' dominance over Falcons continues with 31-20 win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Atlanta Falcons may have improved in
relation to where they were this time one year ago, but one thing
hasn't changed a bit. They can't win in San Francisco's 3Com Park,
where the 49es beat them 31-20 Sunday. It was the seventh straight
time the Falcons have lost here.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, there was significant improvement. Atlanta came in
having lost six straight games in San Francisco by an average score
of 43-16, so it closed that margin down.
</P>
<P>
   But the final score was misleading. The 49ers piled up 538 yards
of offense, including 394 in a first half that saw them take a 31-7
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (2-1) made it close by winning the second half, but
the 49ers (3-0) turned a bit conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said all week going in that this was going to be a
measuring stick to see where exactly we are, and as you could see
we're not there yet,'' said Falcons coach Dan Reeves, whose team
had won eight of its previous 10 games after a 1-7 start last year.
``We aren't there. But I like our football team from the standpoint
that they didn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons tried to make a run at the 49ers behind Jamal
Anderson, who ran for 91 of his game-high 123 yards in the second
half, including a career-long 42-yarder that set up his 4-yard TD
with 13:11 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, quarterback Chris Chandler hit Terance Mathis on a 31-yard
TD pass _ the second TD connection of the game between those two _
with 7:23 left. The point-after attempt was blocked though, leaving
the score 31-10. The Falcons hopes ended with 3:19 left, when
Chandler threw his third interception of the game by missing
running back Gary Downs down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler completed 16-of-38 passes for 254 yards, two TDs and
the three interceptions, but some of that wasn't his fault.
</P>
<P>
   There were multiple dropped passes, including what should have
been a 58-yard TD pass to Tony Martin. An offensive line with
rookies Ephraim Salaam at right tackle and Bob Hallen at left guard
(starter Calvin Collins left after the first series when he
re-aggravated an ankle sprain), allowed seven sacks. And when
Chandler wasn't going down, he was often running for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a ways to go,'' said Chandler, wincing in pain has
he had ice on a sprained wrist, and his ankle in a bucket of ice
water. ``The young guys have got to start playing like veterans. A
lot of things got exposed today, areas that we have to improve
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   This one started ugly for Atlanta, when 49ers quarterback Steve
Young hit Jerry Rice for a 66-yard touchdown pass on the second
play of the game. Rice beat cornerback Juran Bolden as he crossed
from left to right. San Francisco then scored on its next three
possessions, and four of five in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Young completed 28-of-39 passes for 387 yards, three TDs, and an
interception. Rice caught eight passes for 162 yards and two TDs.

PURSUING A DIFFERENT VISION AT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times, which in the last decade has experimented
with a variety of strategies for covering the sprawling megalopolis
around the city, is swiftly moving toward a major reorganization.
The move is likely to give the newspaper a higher national profile
and significantly alter its signature regional coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at the paper said a loss of 50 to 75 positions, mostly
on the paper's large regional editions, was likely. But
redeployments and attrition may lessen the likelihood of layoffs,
they said. Still, a recent staff notice announcing the push to
develop ``cost-efficient models'' for regional editions has created
anxiety in a newsroom that vividly recalls the layoffs of more than
150 colleagues three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These changes come at the end of a year that has seen the start
of five local supplements _ sections circulated one, two or five
days a week in highly localized areas _ which offer close-in
coverage of everything from local school sports to local civic and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And next month the newspaper plans to begin a new national
edition. In the last year it has added at least 10 business
reporters and expanded education coverage, according to Leo
Wolinsky, the newspaper's managing editor for news.
</P>
<P>
   The new moves, and the Sept. 18 notice that heralded them,
reflect the well-publicized vision of the Times' iconoclastic
publisher, Mark Willes, at the end of his first year in that job.
Willes, who is also the chief executive of the Times Mirror Co.,
the newspaper's parent company, hopes to show that newspapers can
make more money and provide better coverage by reinventing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   His commitment to having the editorial and business departments
join forces was evident in the way the notice was drafted, over the
joint signatures of its business leader, Kathryn Downing, the
newspaper's president and chief executive, and Michael Parks, the
editor and executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also raised warning flags about the newspaper's
revenue, particularly from classified advertising. It warned that
``national and classified revenues are not growing at the rates we
anticipated, and overall we are not achieving our anticipated
revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror's stock price, like that of most newspaper
companies, began to drop this summer shortly before the market
decline. It peaked at $65.8125 on June 10, and closed Friday at
$52.6875.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sept. 18 staff notice enumerated eight ``principles,''
described as ``the foundation for the Times vision work now under
way.'' The first of these states: ``We hold that journalistic
quality, integrity and independence are essential.'' Other
principles make reference to improving ``the performance of our
communities,'' achieving 5 percent revenue growth annually and
increasing circulation ``by 500,000 on our way to increasing it by
1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations,
for March 31, showed the Times' circulation had reversed a long
decline, going up slightly to 1,095,007 daily, and 1,385,373 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the top editors and business executives of the Times'
regional editions in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County, to
the north of the city, are scheduled to present recommendations for
streamlining and perhaps consolidating what have been
semiautonomous organizations. The third and largest regional
edition, based in Orange County, to the south, is not immediately
effected.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County and San Fernando Valley editions of the
newspaper were created in the mid-1980s, and the Ventura edition in
the early 1990s, with independent staffs of reporters and
photographers, to offer their regions distinctive versions of the
Times geared to their regional interests.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, according to editors who have worked in
those sections and spoke on condition of anonymity, as many as 20
pages, including the front page and much of the metropolitan
section, are assembled and reassembled two to four times. The new
reorganization is likely to streamline this process, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be undergoing change for many years to come,''
said Wolinsky, adding that the paper was becoming ``a kind of
newspaper laboratory.'' He added, however, that ``the essence of
The Los Angeles Times isn't going to change; authority and
credibility are all we have to sell, and you can't start messing
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the ``Our Times'' supplements, with their separate
staffs and micro-local orientation, is taken by some regional
reporters as a sign that their work may be seen as superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of the paper are trying to sell it to us as a
supplement to our local coverage,'' said a reporter for the Valley
edition, who insisted on anonymity. ``But the writing on the wall
is that it will be a substitute.''  &QL;

ISRAELI ARABS AND ISRAELI POLICE CLASH IN NORTH ON LAND PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a disturbance reminiscent of scenes from the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli riot police
officers clashed with Israeli Arabs in northern Israel on Sunday,
wounding scores with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets as youths
hurled rocks and set road blocks on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The melee was provoked by the Israeli Army's plan to confiscate
acres of olive groves in the Israeli-Arab town of Umm Al-Fahm and
use the area for a firing range. When the border police evicted
protesters from a tent on the site on Sunday, a call went out over
mosque minarets for residents to defend their land.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation intensified during the afternoon and continued
into the late evening, even after an army decision to allow the
fields to be harvested for six more months. Rocks littered the
roads, a bonfire raged at the town's entrance and ambulances took
the wounded, including at least eight police officers, to nearby
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising, were
indisputable as the story played out on Israeli television Sunday
night. There were familiar images: rock-throwing youths covering
their faces with their shirts, helmeted police firing water cannons
and rifles. But in this case, the clash was between Israeli
soldiers and Israeli citizens, inspiring bitter reaction from
Israeli-Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of the police and border guards toward citizens
of Israel reminded me very much of what went on in the West Bank
and in Jabalya camp'' in Gaza, said Hashem Mahameed, a member of
the Israeli Parliament. ``I was wondering whether Israeli security
forces were reconquering Umm Al-Fahm. Is this an occupation?''
</P>
<P>
   The regional police commander, Alik Ron, blamed the Israeli
Islamic Movement, whose leader is the town's mayor, for using the
land dispute as ``a platform'' to incite the population. ``If they
continue with what you're calling an intifada,'' he said, ``there
will be more wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a hospital bed, the mayor, Raed Salah, said he
believed that the army's land confiscation was part of a ``hidden''
plan to seize land to set up a Jewish settlement town. Salah said
he had been punched in the stomach by a police officer during the
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Since July the army, which had already confiscated hundreds of
acres of farm land in a region whose population is about 50,000,
began negotiating with local leaders to seize more for a gunfire
practice zone. After a protest tent was erected in the zone three
weeks ago, the police told leaders it was unsafe and demanded that
they take it down. On Sunday, they moved in in force.
</P>
<P>
   According to several demonstrators, the eviction was aggressive.
One protester, who gave his name as Ahmed Awada, 25, said the
police stormed the tent during prayers and quickly used clubs to
beat people. Awada, who wore a bandage over a gash on his head,
said he and his brother were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli-Arab member of Parliament, Abdel Wahab Saraushe, said
the conflict was the expression of a greater frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm warning the prime minister of Israel, the minister of
defense and the minister of the interior to start treating us as a
culture,'' he said, ``to put an end to this problem before it
ignites the Arab streets.''

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hurricane Georges, rampaging again after earlier
devastating Caribbean islands and the Florida Keys, slammed into
the hunkered down seaside cities and resorts of the Gulf Coast on
Sunday night with rain-packed winds of up to 110 mph and a sea
surge of 10 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Recharged after a three-day, 10-mph wander across the Gulf's
tropical waters, the storm first began to move ashore in early
evening with it's 50-mph perimeter winds, then as the night wore
on, began to follow up with increasingly strong winds that near its
eye were consistently blowing harder than 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that the storm, one of the most dangerous to
hit the vulnerable, low-lying Gulf region in many years, might
stall and not immediately move well inland should it collide with a
wall of high pressure air lying to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In such case, disaster experts said, there was the possibility
of almost catastrophic damage from drawn-our pounding by wind, rain
and surf of the affected coastal strip, which stretched 300 miles
from just west of New Orleans to just east of Panama City in the
Florida panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the stretch, at ground zero for the storm's
eye, was the city of Biloxi, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region is only a few feet above sea level. And New
Orleans, which is surrounded by levees, lies an average of six feet
below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Early damage reports made no mention of deaths or injuries, but
they indicated that the marshes and barrier islands in the path of
the storm had suffered a major battering and that behind them, in
the hours that followed, cities, towns, and resort strips were
suffering too, with extensive power outages, large numbers of trees
down and widespread damage to windows and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   On the northeast side of New Orleans, the storm surge in Lake
Ponchartrain was pushing water up against some levees and now and
again a rogue wave would crest over.
</P>
<P>
   The city has many pumps to handle accumulations of water in its
streets and open spaces, including major accumulations of rain
water. But the pumping system was not designed to handle a huge
accumulation made up of a massive over-topping of levees by Lake
Ponchartrain and a drawn-out hurricane downpour that could exceed
20 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any reports of deaths or injuries was testament, in
part, to the early warnings given coastal residents that the storm
was coming. &QL;

WASHBURN PITCHES ANGELS PAST A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The Angels looked to the future Sunday, and it seems
pitcher Jarrod Washburn will be in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, subbing for Chuck Finley on the final day of the
season, pitched the Angels to a 4-2 victory over the Oakland A's
before 22,819 at the Oakland Coliseum. Washburn gave up two runs
and three hits in 62/3 innings to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finished the season 85-77, one game better than last
year's 84-78 mark.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Washburn nearly became an Oakland Athletic. It was
Washburn and center fielder Jim Edmonds who were ticketed to
Oakland last July in a trade for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The trade never happened, McGwire hit 70 homers and the Angels
were left to hope Washburn's career will make fans forget what
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn went 6-3 with a 4.62 ERA in 15 games this season. He
pitched into the sixth inning in nine of 11 starts and into the
seventh inning in seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think coming into the season I had a very good chance
of getting called up, unless it was as a September call-up,''
Washburn said. ``But because of injuries I got a chance. I think I
showed them I could pitch. I don't want to pitch in the minor
leagues ever again. But if they think I need to go down and work on
something, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me a little bit of (Tom) Glavine (of the Atlanta
Braves),'' said Angels manager Terry Collins. ``He uses his
fastball and changeup, and his breaking pitch is his third pitch.
That's the way Glavine is. He makes pitches with his fastball. He
doesn't overpower you. He lives with command.''
</P>
<P>
   While Washburn won't throw a fastball past anyone, his demeanor
on the mound seems to make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is not intimidated by anything,'' Collins said.
``That probably has impressed me as much as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Chuck (Finley), Kenny (Hill), Omar (Olivares),
hopefully we'll sign (Steve) Sparks. We've got some guys and
hopefully Jarrod will be in the mix. You want options because you
never have enough pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels staked Washburn to a 1-0 lead in the first inning,
when they got three consecutive singles to begin the game. Edmonds
drove in Orlando Palmeiro for the first run of the game, Edmonds'
team-leading 91st RBI of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The A's evened the game at 1 in the second, after Mike Blowers
doubled and went to third on a groundout to second. Scott Spiezio
walked and tried to steal second. He stayed in a rundown long
enough to allow Blowers to score.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's solo homer (No.15) gave the Angels a 2-1 lead
in the fourth, and Randy Velarde's two-run double made it 4-1 in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Doubles by Matt Stairs and Ben Grieve in the bottom of the
seventh cut the Angels' lead to 4-2 and knocked Washburn out of the
game. Pep Harris, Mike Holtz and Shigetoshi Hasegawa (fifth save)
closed out the win.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice way to end the season for the Angels, but it
hardly outweighed the disappointment felt throughout the clubhouse
from not making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed. We're not happy about it,'' Collins said.
``I know we fought threw a lot of problems, but we won't use that
as an excuse for not getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll think about everything over the next few days and this
team will go down as one of the teams I'm most proud of. I'll tell
you what, it's too bad a lot of managers don't have the players I
have. They've grown up and gotten better.''

U.S. LOOKS FOR LESSONS IN DAVIS CUP DRUBBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (js) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Already beaten before they had even stepped onto the
court, the U.S. Davis Cup team and the U.S. Tennis Association
officials who ran this star-crossed event went through the motions
of completing their demoralizing semifinal against Italy. After
all, the cheapest seats in the house had sold at $90 for a
three-day package, and on Sunday their occupants were owed a pair
of singles matches, meaningless or not.
</P>
<P>
   Italy had sealed the victory in the three-of-five-match
competition on Saturday when a five-set doubles loss by Todd Martin
and Justin Gimelstob gave the Italians a 3-0 edge. The match ended
at 4-1 after the teams split singles matches Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, a nation of tennis underdogs whose top player,
37th-ranked Andrea Gaudenzi, needed a cortisone shot in his aching
right shoulder to survive his weekend anchor duties, moves into the
final. Italy will be host to the defending champion, Sweden, which
blanked the United States by 5-0 in last year's final. Sweden
defeated Spain, 4-1, in Stockholm in their semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians snapped the United States' decade-long home winning
streak at 18 rounds and cast further aspersions on the relationship
between Davis Cup officials and the top U.S. players, all of whom
elected to be elsewhere this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got skunked, and I can't say we're happy about it,'' said
Julia Levering, the incoming USTA president, who will inherit the
conundrum of staffing a Davis Cup squad for 1999, the centennial
year of this international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at this loss as an investment in the future,''
she said. ``Because we didn't have our top players in Milwaukee, it
gave the new guard a chance to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The current president of the USTA, Dr. Harry Marmion, refused to
indict the losing semifinalists or the captain who recruited them,
Tom Gullikson, who is also the USTA's director of coaching for its
entire development program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team as presently constituted represented the best
of the American players who made themselves available to us,''
Marmion said. ``Playing for your country is very relevant to this
group, and I think Tom is almost the perfect coach. He has their
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marmion conceded that neither he nor Gullikson has had the
ear of Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi or Michael Chang, who along with
Jim Courier arguably represent the best generation of players the
United States has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never have this situation again, where the top players
don't understand what it means to play for their country,'' Marmion
said. ``We let this generation of players get away without
inculcating them, and that's our fault, not theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmion said that had the Americans handled the Italians, he
would have urged Gullikson to stick with this same group for the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sampras has his own agenda and already said he didn't want to
play, Chang has been more neutral but seemed not to be available
either, and as for Agassi, while it's true he puts fannies in the
seats and has won some big matches for us, the world does not
revolve around Andre Agassi, despite what he may think,'' Marmion
said. He was referring to Agassi's contention that had the USTA
staged this round on the West Coast, he would have sandwiched his
own duties as host at a charity gala in Las Vegas, Nev. between
singles matches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sampras and Agassi were conspicuous by their absence, while
Jan-Michael Gambill and Gimelstob, neither of whom had an iota of
experience inside the Davis Cup pressure cooker, were conspicuous
by their presence. Each lost his debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in situations we haven't been in before,'' Todd
Martin said at Thursday's bare-bones draw ceremony. Martin, forced
into his role as team leader by the vacancies left by Sampras and
Agassi, acknowledged that he would be ``the goat'' of the
proceedings if the weekend experiment flopped. It did, and after
losses to Davide Sanguinetti in Friday's singles and the doubles
loss to Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso, Martin opted out of his singles
assignment Sunday and was replaced by Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   As he had been throughout the weekend, Courier was relegated to
the sidelines, a decision of Gullikson's that, as the round wore
on, was subject to second-guessing. As was his court selection.
</P>
<P>
   The hardcourt installed inside Milwaukee Arena at Gullikson's
behest, which was supposed to stump the clay-loving Italians,
instead played so slowly that it was the Americans who felt as if
they had stumbled onto an alien surface.
</P>
<P>
   While Marmion refused to fault Gullikson for his team picks, he
did leave his captain culpable for the court selection. ``The court
was Tom's responsibility; he knows it, and he blew it,'' Marmion
said. ``But I don't think the court is why we lost. I think the
time has come when we're going to have to learn to live with some
younger teams. There's going to be some lean years; but maybe it's
good for our soul to lose once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Match Points
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's matches, Gianluca Pozzi of Italy defeated Justin
Gimelstob, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill of the United
States defeated Davide Sanguinetti, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Broadening its counterattack against possible
impeachment proceedings, the White House has coordinated a strategy
with congressional Democrats to turn the tables and investigate the
investigators by examining how Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, came to look into the Lewinsky matter, Clinton
advisers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Democrats in the House and Senate, the White
House is trying to obtain from Starr an accounting of how he
persuaded the Department of Justice in January to authorize him to
broaden his inquiry to include President Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic effort to do just that failed in a strict
party-line vote in the House Judiciary Committee on Friday. ``That
was defeated, but it's going to come back in many different ways,''
one senior Clinton strategist said Sunday, speaking on condition of
not being named. ``This is a coordinated, strategic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Starr issued his impeachment report on the Lewinsky matter
to Congress on Sept. 9, the White House has tried to put its
critics on the defensive by attacking the report as incomplete and
slanted against the president. The president's allies now hope to
take that assault a step further by arguing that Starr was so eager
to embarrass or drive Clinton from office that Starr relied on weak
and perhaps faulty evidence to persuade Janet Reno, the attorney
general, to recommend that he widen his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's allies have long argued that he pursued the Lewinsky
matter because he believed it conformed to a pattern of obstruction
of justice that he had seen in his other investigations of the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the public learns about how Starr's jurisdiction was
expanded would have no bearing on the substance of the accusations
against the president, Clinton allies acknowledge. But they believe
it might further weaken public support for impeachment proceedings
by making Clinton look like the victim of a political assault.
</P>
<P>
   The new line of inquiry by Democrats into Starr dovetails with
an increasing focus by the White House and congressional Democrats
on the role of Linda Tripp, the former confidante of Ms. Lewinsky
who tape-recorded their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation was expanded partly because of evidence
gathered by Mrs. Tripp that Ms. Lewinsky had prepared a false
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. Mrs.
Tripp's recordings suggested that Ms. Lewinsky had promised to deny
a sexual relationship with the president in exchange for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky later testified that Clinton had not asked her to
lie, and that she had made no deal for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The president's strategists and congressional allies plan to
portray Mrs. Tripp as a tainted witness who broke the law to tape
the conversations and manipulated Ms. Lewinsky _ and perhaps Starr
_ in an effort to entrap the president.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic assault on Mrs. Tripp is based on documents
released last week, including testimony from Ms. Lewinsky stating
that it was Mrs. Tripp who pushed her into actions that
subsequently damaged Clinton. Ms. Lewinsky said that Mrs. Tripp
urged her to save the dress stained in a sexual encounter with the
president, suggested that she seek help from Washington lawyer
Vernon Jordan Jr. to get a job in New York, and urged her to delay
signing her affidavit in the Jones case until the job came through.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton adviser said Sunday that the Democrats hope to learn
whether Starr informed Reno that Mrs. Tripp might have broken
Maryland law by tape recording her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky,
and that Mrs. Tripp had an ``obvious bias'' against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, the independent counsel's spokesman,
described the evolving White House strategy as ``a further effort
to mislead the public and shift attention away from the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the independent counsel's office ``did not find out
about any issue concerning the tapes until well into the
investigation,'' and that Starr's report to Congress made that
point clear. ``We continue to investigate it,'' Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors receive information from many sources and then
test the credibility of that information,'' he said. ``That
practice was followed here. We received information from Linda
Tripp, then we questioned her and got our own corroborating
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after that information was brought to the attorney general
did the commission overseeing the work of independent counsels
grant permission to expand Starr's investigation, Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's congressional allies are focusing on Mrs. Tripp
partly in anticipation of the release this week of many more
documents from Starr's investigation. Edited transcripts of Mrs.
Tripp's taped conversations with Ms. Lewinsky and her grand jury
testimony are among the materials expected to be released, perhaps
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As they try to strengthen the president's political position,
the White House and congressional Democrats are zeroing in on the
events of Jan. 12 to Jan. 19. That was when Starr learned of Mrs.
Tripp's conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. On Thursday, Jan. 15,
Starr approached the Justice Department to expand his inquiry. He
received permission on Friday, the same day that his prosecutors
swooped down on Ms. Lewinsky in a failed initial attempt to get her
to cooperate in their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Mrs. Tripp met with the Jones lawyers, who the
next day questioned Clinton about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky in his deposition in the Jones case. Starr's prosecutors
have said that they were angry to learn that Mrs. Tripp had
contacted the Jones lawyers, but the president's camp is trying to
learn if Mrs. Tripp in fact was trying to set a perjury trap for
Clinton, with Starr's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress continues to weigh impeachment, the White House is
hoping to strike a deal with Republicans that would permit Clinton
to remain in office after some sort of congressional reprimand,
such as censure and a fine. Looking ahead to such bargaining, the
president and his team are now focused on strengthening his
political hand. ``Now's not even time to talk about a deal,'' one
senior Clinton adviser said. ``Fight for political advantage, and
the deal will come.''

 &HT;    Baseball's treat to fans: a finish worth remembering
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yogi was mistaken. After one of the most riveting
Sunday finales in baseball history, it ain't over even when it's
over.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the regular season, the Cubs and Giants lost
dramatically within a minute of each other. Moments after the
Astros beat Chicago 4-3 in 11 innings in Houston, Neifi Perez
homered off Robb Nen in the bottom of the ninth to complete
Colorado's remarkable 9-8 comeback in Denver. That left the Cubs
and Giants at 89-73 and tied for the NL wild card spot, which
they'll decide tonight in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field
(8:07, ESPN). The winner opens the NL Division Series Wednesday in
Atlanta (4:07).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Tom Glavine said after the Braves' 7-2 victory
denied the Mets a three-way tie for the wild card and gave Atlanta
its 106th win of the year. ``You don't know who to prepare for,
what to prepare for. It's a state of limbo. I don't think anybody
likes to be in a state of limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to anybody who we play,'' Glavine said of
the Cubs (6-3 against Atlanta this season after winning the last
five games) and Giants (2-7 versus the Braves). We'd just like to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three best-of-five first-round pairings are set. The
Indians and Red Sox, the AL wild card, open the post-season Tuesday
in Cleveland at 1:07 p.m., the first of two afternoon affairs
before that series shifts to Boston. The AL East champion Yankees,
who won their 114th game Sunday, host the Rangers Tuesday and
Wednesday nights (8:07).
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central champion Astros open the other NL series Tuesday
at home against San Diego (4:07 p.m.). After an off day Wednesday,
the series resumes in the Astrodome Thursday afternoon before
shifting to San Diego Saturday and, if necessary, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Cubs and Giants meet tonight in the NL's first
one-game playoff since 1980, when Houston beat Los Angeles to win
the NL West. On Sunday, the Astros prevented the Cubs from
clinching their first post-season berth since 1989. Trailing 3-1,
Houston scored twice in the eighth inning before Carl Everett
tripled in the 11th and scored on Richard Hidalgo's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa didn't homer Sunday and fell four home runs behind
Mark McGwire, who hit Nos. 69 and 70 in St. Louis. But Sosa still
has a shot at the post-season, courtesy of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 7-0, the Rockies scored six runs in fifth inning and
took an 8-7 lead on Vinny Castilla's two-run homer in the seventh.
Jeff Kent's solo in the eighth tied it, but Perez homered off Nen
to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe somebody is looking out for us,'' Cubs shortstop and
ex-Brave Jeff Blauser said. ``What would somebody with a death-row
reprieve say? Whoopee. We've got another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a 30-second swing between them losing and us
losing,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker. ``We are happy going to
Chicago. We could be going home to paint the garage.''

METS LAY THEIR FINAL EGG, AND AWFUL TASTE LINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The final indignity of the Mets' 1998 season did not
come when Mike Piazza popped out Sunday to short right center field
for the final out of a 7-2 defeat to the Atlanta Braves in what
might have been the All-Star catcher's final game as a Met.
</P>
<P>
   That the Mets, who lost their last five games to finish with
exactly the same amount of victories (88) as they had last season,
had just been eliminated from the National League wild card race
was painful enough. But before they boarded their plane to New
York, they were subjected to one final reminder of how badly they
had collapsed in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of one another, Chicago lost in Houston and San
Francisco lost in Denver, and all the Mets had to fly home with was
a sinking feeling, knowing that had they won Sunday _ or any time
since last Sunday _ they would be playing at Shea Stadium on Monday
afternoon, their playoff hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both going to lose, aren't they?'' Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips remarked shortly before leaving Turner
Field, his voice choked up with emotion, as if the full realization
of what had been irretrievably lost had just sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had dropped a game behind the Cubs and Giants in the
wild card race Saturday night. After they fell 5 runs behind Greg
Maddux (18-9) and the Braves after two innings Sunday afternoon, it
was only a matter of time before their season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against the teams we should have beaten, we didn't do it,''
Piazza said. And he was not talking about the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday evening, the Mets had led the wild card race by one
game over the Cubs and four games over the Giants. New York and
Chicago had five games to play, San Francisco seven. And even
though it is the Cubs who are known for their ill-fated history, it
turned out to be the Mets who lost all five, two of them at home to
the lowly Montreal Expos before the Braves finished sweeping them
out of their season here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Manager Bobby Valentine, the most positive person in the
organization, appeared to be resigned to his team's fate as he
quietly spoke with reporters before Sunday's game. And afterward,
as Valentine sat glumly in his office, he searched for
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   After managing so splendidly for most of the season, Valentine _
who has never been to the playoffs in a career that has spanned
three decades in the major leagues _ was cursed with a sort-of
reverse Midas touch the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said Valentine, who was gracious
in defeat. ``If I knew, I would have done something about it.
That's my frustration about it. Everything I tried didn't work.
There should have been something. There should have been
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Valentine second-guessed himself for not starting Hideo
Nomo instead of Armando Reynoso. The decision seemed to be a
no-brainer. Nomo had struggled all season and had not pitched since
Sept. 8. And Reynoso had been one of the major reasons why the Mets
had rallied back into wild card contention, beginning in late July.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynoso was 0-6 lifetime against Atlanta with a 6.37 earned
run average coming in. And Nomo, who was 2-0 with a 2.13 ERA
against the Braves over his career, had been throwing well on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   When Reynoso (7-3) allowed 5 runs in just one and two-thirds
innings _ including a two-out double to Maddux in the bottom of the
second that opened the door for a 4-run outburst _ another of the
manager's moves had backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo eventually did pitch. Not only that, in his first major
league relief appearance, Nomo pitched well, delivering four
scoreless innings of 3-hit ball, while the Mets rallied for a
third-inning run.
</P>
<P>
   And when Piazza stepped up to the plate with one out in the top
of the seventh, runners on first and third, and a run already in,
the Mets, who trailed 5-2, were very much in the game. The stage
was set for another of the miraculous comebacks that had
characterized their season.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza _ who was the Mets' most valuable player this year,
even though he was not acquired until May 22 _ was struck out for
the second time in three days by Dennis Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was on three pitches, the last of them leaving
Piazza arguing a called third strike. Then, John Rocker came on and
struck out Brian McRae on a full count to leave two more runners
stranded. And, after six more outs, the Mets' season was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we just ran out of gas,'' said Lenny Harris. ``And
there were no gas stations open. They all closed down as soon as we
got to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the Mets face an offseason of uncertainty in which they
could lose their best hitter, Piazza, and their best pitcher, Al
Leiter, to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said Phillips, who had gambled part of
the organization's future for a shot at the post-season when he
acquired Piazza from the Marlins. ``My hopes were grander than just
getting to the playoffs. But I'm also excited about putting a team
together for 1999. And that's what's getting me through today.''

CUBS AND GIANTS TIE; SOSA, 4 BEHIND, GETS LAST SHOT AT MCGWIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs walked off the indoor
carpet, slump-shouldered losers in the home run race and the
wild-card race. They had blown a lead again, losing 4-3 in the 11th
inning of the last game of their overachieving season. The only
home runs in the Astrodome had been on video, with Mark McGwire
hitting Nos. 69 and 70 on the giant video screen above Sosa's head
in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fate of the Cubs was undecided on the scoreboard, to be
judged by a game in Denver that was tied 8-8 in the ninth inning,
at least for one long minute. As the Cubs trudged up the wooden
stairs to their lockers, they heard the clubhouse boy screaming,
``We play tomorrow!'' The San Francisco Giants also had blown a
lead, losing to the Rockies, 9-8, on a home run in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   So the two races that have captivated baseball, and America,
live for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was homerless Sunday, knocking in the first run but stuck
at 66 home runs. In St. Louis, McGwire tacked on a pair, besting
Roger Maris' 37-year-old record by a once unthinkable cushion of 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To tie McGwire, Sosa needs four home runs Monday night in
Chicago against the Giants. The winner of the Giants-Cubs game will
occupy the last seat in the National League playoffs, traveling to
Atlanta on Wednesday to begin a five-game series against the
Braves, who put the New York Mets out of their misery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the games ended, thousands of Cubs fans had
surrounded Wrigley Field in Chicago, buying tickets for the final
game of a magical season.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was upbeat after the game, despite losing to the Giants and
falling behind McGwire. He congratulated McGwire and contemplated
his own happier travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire's going to the beach,'' Sosa said. ``I'm going to go
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a No. 66 cap, Sosa conceded that the home run race was
over. In the entire history of major-league baseball, only 12
players have hit four home runs in a single game. But that's a lot
more than have hit 66 or more home runs in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   Any home runs that Sosa hits in the one-game wild-card playoff
will count in individual statistics for the regular season; home
runs in later playoff games and the World Series will not. The
extra game gives the Cubs 163 chances, the same as McGwire's
Cardinals, who replayed a suspended game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about the home runs any more,'' said Sosa,
who finished the day 2-for-5 with a stolen base and an RBI. ``I'm
really happy for Mark, and say, he's the man. One hundred years
from now, when they mention McGwire's name, maybe they'll mention
me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitcher for the Cubs in the wild-card playoff game
will be Steve Trachsel (14-8), who beat the Giants on Aug. 12 but
has been pummeled in three starts since he gave up McGwire's
record-breaking 62nd home run in St. Louis on Sept. 8. The Giants
are scheduled to start Mark Gardner, 13-5, who had a no-decision in
his only start against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he would have to make a point of saying hello this
winter to his fellow Dominican, Neifi Perez, who hit the home run
that beat the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to shake his hand,'' Sosa said. ``We're still alive.
That's the only thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The late-inning failures by the Cubs and Giants raised
scoreboard watching to a high art Sunday. The day began with the
Cubs and Giants tied for the National League's wild-card
consolation prize, and the Mets one game behind. The first game was
decided in Atlanta, as the Mets collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Astros, who are headed to the playoffs against the
San Diego Padres, the Cubs took a first-inning lead when Sosa
knocked in a run with a line drive single to center with two
runners on base. The Cubs didn't send Mark Grace home from third,
where he was stranded by a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sosa could bat again, McGwire hit his daily home run in
St. Louis. The announcement was withheld until after Sosa struck
out in the second inning. As he was walking out to right field, a
gigantic McGwire appeared above him, hitting No. 69 on video.
</P>
<P>
   The hitting and pitching hero for the Cubs was Terry Mulholland,
who has seen pressure before. He started a World Series game and an
All-Star game as a Phillie. Sunday, the grim-faced Mulholland mowed
down the Astros, striking out nine in eight innings. A bloop hit
tied the score for the Astros in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs went ahead 3-1 in the fourth inning, after the Astros'
second baseman, Craig Biggio, made ``the dumbest play of my
career,'' dropping a routine ball trying to turn a double play _
when there were already two outs. Mulholland then knocked in two
runs with a line-drive double over the head of center fielder
Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa came to bat in the fifth, the scoreboard showed the
Giants leading, 3-0, and the Mets falling further behind, 7-2. On
the first pitch to Sosa, the 51,916 Astros and Cubs fans roared
when he hit the ball, but this was no souvenir, falling harmlessly
into Hidalgo's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs blew their lead in the eighth, when the Astros scored
two runs on three hits.
</P>
<P>
   From the ninth inning, the closers took over: Billy Wagner vs.
Rod Beck. Wagner held Sosa to a soft fly ball to center in the
10th, and Sosa walked back to the dugout, pantomiming the swing he
had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard showed the Giants falling behind in Denver, 8-7,
when the Astros rallied in the 10th inning here. Beck stranded
Derek Bell at third base. As Beck was being congratulated in the
Cubs' dugout, the scoreboard showed the Giants scoring to tie the
game, 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, Beck's high wire act fell to the Astroturf. Former
Met Carl Everett tripled off the wall in right field as Sosa shied
away from the wall. Beck walked Biggio intentionally, and Cubs
Manager Jim Riggleman brought in an outfielder as a fifth
infielder. Hidalgo hit a fly ball to deep left-center field, and
Everett trotted home.

 &HT;    Rudd holds off Gordon to win
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Nothing could derail Ricky Rudd from winning
Sunday's NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville Speedway. Not the
sweltering heat that penetrated the gloves on the wheel or the cool
suit that turned hot seat, leaving him sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a long time coming,'' said Rudd of the victory he
needed for his team and to extend to 16 the number of years with at
least one victory. It also was his third victory at Martinsville
and first here since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The hot seat was one he could have done without. He considered
at one point to give it up and turn things over to Hut Stricklin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most dominating victory of his career. He led 198 of
the 400 laps and took the checkered flag by .533 seconds ahead of
runnerup Jeff Gordon. Mark Martin was third.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett had the week he'd rather have done without. His
motor gave out on lap 291 and he was through for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such a great car, I didn't want to give it up,'' said
Rudd, who hadn't won since the 1997 Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.
``We were pretty fast on the speed chart and qualified second. But
lately, we'd qualify good and fall backwards at the start of the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was others who did the falling back. Neither Gordon
nor Martin led a lap, though finishing second and third. His
primary competition was Sterling Marlin, who led four times for 231
laps, but finished four laps down to Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car just wouldn't come in when I needed it to,'' said
Marlin, who led none of the final 110 laps. ``It's hard to win a
race here. He's won each year for a number of them in a row, so my
hat's off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it was Gordon he feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming. He had a fast car and I could see him in my
mirror,'' Rudd said. ``They're famous for that last race charge.
Sterling was really the car to beat, but he faded away. Once we got
even on our tires, though, we were pretty good. I was pretty
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Gordon or Martin's day. Gordon started third and
finished second. Martin went from 13th to six. Neither led a lap, a
first since Phoenix last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it any way I can get it,'' Rudd said. ``This win is
just as big as Indianapolis to me right now. The first half this
year was the toughest I've been through. Maybe that's why we dug
down so deep to make it happen today.''

 NEW ORLEANS: was coming.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it formed in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa a
couple of weeks ago, and started to blow west, the hurricane has
caused more than 300 deaths, most on the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola, and has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
Damage estimates range in the billions of dollars, with about $1
billion of that occurring in hard-hit Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a devastating storm,'' said James Lee Witt, head of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, as his teams prepared to move
into the Gulf Coast area once Hurricane Georges moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of coastal residents fled northward in the
hours before the storm blew ashore, so many that on many highways,
cars, vans and trucks were bumper to bumper for miles on end.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others took refuge in schools, public buildings and
other shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Orleans, some ten thousand people were housed in the
hallways and corridors of the massive Superdome, many spreading
their blankets on the concrete and doing what they could, with
their books and puzzles and bags of chips, to make the best of a
bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before for football games, but this ain't no
game,'' said Demetrius Moody, an oil rig operator, as he slumped in
an end-zone seat in the sports arena, which can hold 69,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   In places along the coast where there were no levees to protect
people and property, emergency officials ordered residents to
evacuate. Most moved to higher ground with few, if any, complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And even in areas where evacuation was not mandatory, thousands
left anyway, heeding the words of Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans,
whose repeated pre-storm warning was: ``Our recommendation to
people is to go. We're in a state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter of downtown New Orleans _ where the
unofficial motto is ``Let the Good Times Roll!'' and whose streets
are normally packed with noisy partygoers _ was nearly abandoned in
the hours just before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Bourbon Street was empty of jazz, strippers and tipplers with
only a few dogs wandering about sniffing the garbage.

STEWS HIT THE SPOT AFTER THE WEATHER TAKES ITS AUTUMN TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like a steaming bowl of hot stew to warm your
insides when it's dank and gray outside.
</P>
<P>
   Food cooked in a single bubbling pot makes for some of the most
basic meals, and cultures around the world feature stews.
</P>
<P>
   From her homeland of Northern China comes Judy Fu's Land and Sea
Stew, a specialty of the house at her Snappy Dragon restaurant in
Seattle's Maple Leaf neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people like it during the rainy season or winter
because it's hot _ and very good,'' said David Fu, who manages the
restaurant for his mother. ``It's a warm-tummy meal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't only cold climates that inspire stews. The callaloo
that chef-owner Greg Caldwell of BarBaCoa in Greenwood prepares as
an entree stew takes its cue from the Caribbean, where variations
of callaloo soup appear on different islands. The dish gets its
name from a green grown in the region, but Caldwell substitutes
collard and mustard greens.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, another warm-weather locale, is the source of tagine, a
stew distinguished by its North African seasonings and inclusion of
fruits and nuts. At the Capitol Club, a Middle Eastern restaurant
on Capitol Hill, chef Michael Felsenstine prepares a version with
lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their origins, stews are inherently flexible and
forgiving. Different combinations of meats, seafood and vegetables
may be substituted for the ingredients specified in these recipes,
depending on what's at the market _ or in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Fu's Land and Sea Stew
</P>
<P>
   Group 1:
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken breast, about 6 ounces, sliced into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces flank steak, sliced into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   6 shrimp balls (available in Asian markets)
</P>
<P>
   Group 2:
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup prawns, deveined
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup scallops
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup squid steak, cut into 1-by-2-inch pieces and scored
</P>
<P>
   1 16-ounce package medium-firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Group 3
</P>
<P>
   1 1.7-ounce package mung bean threads (bean vermicelli), soaked
in warm water for 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Napa cabbage, shredded 1/2-inch wide
</P>
<P>
   3 sliced fresh button mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   3 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in water, then sliced
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup canned mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Group 4:
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Steamed rice
</P>
<P>
   Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a large wok or pot. Add each
group of ingredients in succession, pausing slightly after each of
the first two groups to ensure that the chicken and seafood are
fully cooked. When all ingredients have been added (except the
rice), remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a full-bodied chili sauce, such as Lan Chi brand
black bean chili paste. Serve with individual bowls of steamed
rice. Diners traditionally choose morsels of stew, one by one, to
accompany their rice; when the rice is finished, the broth may be
poured into the empty bowls and supped.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   From Judy Fu, Snappy Dragon, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Callaloo BarBaCoa
</P>
<P>
   For the prawn stock:
</P>
<P>
   Shells from 30 large prawns
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces butter
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces garlic, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, quartered lengthwise, then chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half quarts water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups white wine
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup fresh-squeezed lime juice
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-quart sauce pan, saute the garlic briefly, then add the
onions and continue to cook until the onions are limp. Add the
prawn shells and pepper and continue to saute until the shells are
fragrant and almost beginning to burn. Add the wine to loosen any
residue from pan bottom; scrape if necessary. Add water and let the
mixture come to a full boil for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid into
another pan and reduce by one-half over medium heat. Remove from
the heat and stir in the lime juice. Let the stock cool and
refrigerate up to two days.
</P>
<P>
   The greens:
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches red chard
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches collard greens
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch mustard greens
</P>
<P>
   1 cup prawn stock
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Wash the greens, remove the stems, ignore the ribs and cut in
narrow shreds. Pour olive oil into a large, heavy pot with a
close-fitting lid and saute garlic, uncovered, over medium heat
until it begins to turn amber. Add the shredded greens and continue
to saute until the greens become very limp. Add 1 cup prawn stock.
Cover the pot and cook over low heat until the thickest ribs are
tender. Remove from heat and let cool, then refrigerate one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Callaloo:
</P>
<P>
   30 prawns
</P>
<P>
   2 poblano peppers, cut in one-quarter-inch dice with seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 habanero peppers, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red bell pepper, cut in one-quarter-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Yukon gold potatoes, cut into one-half-inch dice (enough to make
60 dice)
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken bouillon cube
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Slice the potatoes into wedges,
eight to a potato; crumble a chicken bouillon cube into some olive
oil and coat the wedges. Roast the potato in the oven for 30
minutes. Let cool and dice (potatoes may be prepared in advance and
refrigerated).
</P>
<P>
   Sear the prawns in a dry, non-stick pan over high heat until
they begin to char; don't cook completely, as they will finish
cooking in the stew (prawns may be cooked a day ahead if
refrigerated immediately).
</P>
<P>
   Heat the peppers in a large, dry, non-stick pan until they begin
to brown. Add the prawns and continue cooking for 1 minute,
agitating the pan. Add the potatoes and prepared greens and
continue cooking for 5 minutes with constant agitation. Remove the
prawns and place them in serving bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining prawn stock to the cooking pan and bring the
mixture to a boil. Remove from heat and ladle the broth into the
bowls. Serve with cornbread and tropical fruit salad.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

RECIPE FOR A SIMPLER WORLD AND A BREAKFAST FIT EVEN FOR BILL
GATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, I own a Toshiba Satellite with Intel inside, Xywrite III,
WordPerfect, Microsoft Windows and a Megahertz modem.
</P>
<P>
   I have likely violated 37 anti-trust laws before I've finished
breakfast and I am not allowed to plead ignorance because I own the
complete Data for Dummies collection from IDG Books.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to get any help from Bill Gates. He's in big
trouble, too, for trying to simplify my life.
</P>
<P>
   Don't whisper this confession to the feds, but I desperately
need a simpler life.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Monday I discovered we were missing one of the four little,
round plastic thingies that go on the bottom of the toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   No problemo.
</P>
<P>
   I raced to a nearby home supply store that is three times the
size of Boeing's largest hangar. The clerk directed me to an aisle
where approximately 173 different toilet seat thingies were on
display. It took me only 87 minutes to determine that none of them
matched my plastic thingies.
</P>
<P>
   I decided I would either have to buy a set of two different
thingies or sell my house. Isn't it a step backward, if I remove
and discard the three perfectly good thingies that remain under the
seat? Would that not only encourage thingie manufacturers to
produce toilet seat cushions in an additional 173 different styles,
sizes and shapes?
</P>
<P>
   Mulling this philosophical dilemma, I wandered over to another
department in the home supply store, approximately a quarter mile
away. I needed to replace the little paper sack that catches the
dirt in my Dustbuster Classic hand vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   I had delayed making this purchase in a one-person consumer
revolt after discovering that three replacement sacks cost as much
as a bottle of good Scotch. Never mind trying to find an economical
bargain brand. If they exist they won't fit. So I was prepared to
bite the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what I learned? The store was still selling Dustbusters,
but no longer carries the little sacks that go inside.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the truth, Janet Reno! Wouldn't the world be a better place
if Bill Gates also manufactured little paper sacks and plastic
thingies?
</P>
<P>
   What did I tell you? I haven't eaten breakfast yet and I'm
probably already in trouble. Well, I might as well make this a good
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast for Bill
</P>
<P>
   3 cups frozen shredded potatoes, thawed
</P>
<P>
   canola oil spray or butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced ham
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup diced green pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup milk
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the thawed potatoes on paper towels and blot to dry. Dump
the spuds into an ungreased nine-inch pie plate. With your hands,
press the potatoes to form a crust covering the bottom and sides of
the plate. So far I think everything is perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you can spray the potato crust with canola oil or,
if you want to live like a Microsoft millionaire, drizzle the crust
with a third of a cup of melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the crust in a 425-degree oven for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile combine the ham, cheese and pepper. In another bowl
beat together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper. You can use egg
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   When the crust is cooked, spread the ham-cheese mixture over the
bottom, then slurp on the egg mixture. Reduce oven temperature to
350 degrees and continue to bake the ``pie'' for 25 to 30 minutes,
or until a knife stuck in the middle comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into four wedges and serve for breakfast or brunch with a
fresh fruit cup and muffins or toast.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on the a.m. cooking time, I have baked the potato
crust the night before, then filled it and finished cooking in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   I have also been known to eat bean soup for breakfast and I'm
pretty sure there is a federal law against that. But the attorney
general might not prosecute if she tried a few slurps of this:
</P>
<P>
   Trust-buster Bisque
</P>
<P>
   4 stalks celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 medium carrots, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried basil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned white beans
</P>
<P>
   Combine the first five ingredients in a saucepan and simmer 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the canned beans, then puree this mess in your blender, in
two batches. Reheat and add salt and pepper to taste. This will
make two large or four small bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: If you ever lose the rubber ring that goes inside your
blender, you may have to buy a new kitchen.

 &HT;    Cubs get a break when Rockies beat Giants
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Chicago Cubs have suffered for a long time, so
what's another minute to professional sports' most celebrated
losers?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anything, really. The Cubs, 4-3 losers to Houston in 11
innings on Sunday, were in danger of having their grip pried off
the National League wild-card ticket to the playoffs. But less than
a minute after Richard Hidalgo hit a sacrifice fly to beat the
Cubs, Colorado defeated San Francisco 9-8, creating a tie for the
wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and San Francisco will play tonight at Wrigley Field,
with the survivor heading to Atlanta to begin the playoffs. The
Cubs have not reached the postseason since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to run to the clubhouse to watch on TV,'' Cubs
catcher Scott Servais said. ``We didn't make it that far when we
found out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, meanwhile, didn't need a victory on Sunday, but one
sure can't hurt their confidence for the playoffs, where they will
open against San Diego. The best-of-five series begins Tuesday at
3:05 p.m. at the Astrodome. The Astros finished with their best
record ever, 102-60.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Sammy Sosa had a chance to catch St. Louis' Mark
McGwire in the home-run record competition. But Sosa failed to hit
one Sunday, and McGwire slugged two, setting the record at 70. Sosa
needs to hit four home runs today to catch McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him, but he's probably gonna go to the beach
tomorrow, and I'm going to play,'' Sosa said. ``I hope I hit two.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone did hit a big home run for the Cubs, though _ Colorado
shortstop Neifi Perez. His ninth of the season in the bottom of the
ninth inning won the game against San Francisco, which led 7-0
before the Rockies scored six runs in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs might consider sending Perez a thank-you note. He
bailed them out after a difficult day in the field for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored the winning run on Hidalgo's fly ball to center
after pinch hitter Carl Everett hit a line drive over Sosa's head
in right for a triple. Sosa seemed to get caught in between
strategies. First he slowed down, losing any chance of making a
difficult catch. Then he failed to stop and play the ball quickly
off the wall, which would have limited Everett to a double.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it bounced away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky it didn't go over the fence,'' Sosa said. ``Only
Superman could catch that one. I'm not Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was not nearly as wasteful as the Giants. The Cubs blew
only a 3-1 lead, but they did it in a manner befitting the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, leading off the eighth for the Astros, hit a low
line-drive to left. Jose Hernandez, who had just moved from
shortstop to left field, charged in and missed the ball, turning a
single into a double. Jeff Bagwell drove Hidalgo home with a
single. Bagwell scored from first when Sean Berry hit a fly to
center that dropped between shortstop Jeff Blauser and center
fielder Lance Johnson, the latter stopping in his tracks instead of
taking charge of a ball that was easier for him to catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took their 3-1 lead during the fourth inning in an
unlikely way. With two outs and a runner on first, Servais hit a
grounder to short. Ricky Gutierrez scooped up the ball and flipped
it to Craig Biggio at second. Biggio, winner of the NL Gold Glove
Award for second basemen the last three years, dropped the ball.
Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland followed with a double to right
center, driving in only his second and third runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   That 3-1 lead stood until the Cubs' defensive foibles in the
eighth inning. But today they have a chance to atone.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman understands that everything his team
does at this time of year is magnified and placed in historical
perspective, a result of the franchise's futility. The Cubs have
not won a World Series since 1908 and have not played in one since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such history is an unfair weight to carry through a
season, Riggleman said, ``It probably is. It's like (Cubs
President) Andy MacPhail said a couple of years ago, not a day goes
by that someone doesn't mention 1908 and 1945. We carry part of
that burden.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Astros, they begin the playoffs as a popular choice
to win the National League championship and perhaps the World
Series, a vote of confidence that Manager Larry Dierker accepts
philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right with me,'' Dierker said. ``Unless you're a
Braves fan or a Yankees fan, you're looking for a team that has
some appeal. And there's this team down in Texas that no one
thought about, and that's pretty exciting. In my mind, the Braves
are still the favorite in the league, but we're pretty even with
the Braves and the Padres. And even a lesser team can win a
five-game series. It's a tremendous amount of pressure whether you
are a favorite or not. You play a 162-game season, and then you
have a five-game playoff.''

GOLDMAN, SACHS SAID TO DELAY GOING PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. is likely to announce this week
that it will not go public this year, according to people who work
at the Wall Street investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The delay would be an acknowledgment that Goldman's plans to
sell shares in what is now a 130-year-old private partnership have
been derailed by global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   People who work at Goldman said that its senior partners, Jon
Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr., have scheduled a telephone meeting
for Monday with the firm's 189 general partners around the world.
Corzine and Paulson, who are joint chairmen and chief executives,
are expected to tell the partners that the firm's six-person
executive committee has decided to delay the offering until market
conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   If the full partnership, which originally authorized the initial
public offering in June, agrees with the executive committee's
decision, a general announcement will be made Tuesday, the people
who work at Goldman said. A Goldman spokesman could not be reached
for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's public offering would probably have been one of the
largest in history, with the firm aiming to raise $3 billion by
selling a stake of 10 percent to 15 percent. Partners originally
envisioned that the firm's market value _ and their own net worth _
would increase by three or four times after the offering. But the
sharp stock market decline has slashed the share prices of
Goldman's main rivals by about half from peak levels in July,
reducing the incentive to go public now.
</P>
<P>
   Like other firms on Wall Street, Goldman has had a drop in
operating profits in this year's third quarter. The company
reported that it earned $754 million for the period, down by a
fourth from the second quarter. With world stock and bond markets
still weak after a severe summer sell off, Goldman said that it
foresees smaller profits in the last quarter of the year as well,
making the autumn an inauspicious time to issue shares.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is also a leader of the consortium of banks and
brokerage houses that committed $3.65 billion last week to the
bailout of Long-Term Capital Management, the speculative hedge fund
whose huge bets on international bond markets turned sour. Goldman
committed $300 million to that effort, nearly 5 percent of its
partners' total capital.

MCGWIRE SHIFTS FOCUS TO HIS TAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Two police officers poked their heads out of a side
door to the Cardinals' clubhouse. All clear. A hulkish redhead
ducked into the dank corridor beneath Busch Stadium and began to
run.
</P>
<P>
   With two officers at his side, the drained slugger legged out a
sprint to a gray BMW, making a mad dash for a life closer to normal
almost two hours after his unfathomable season came to an end with
a day as thrilling and bizarre as a David Lynch plot.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, Mark McGwire. California, here he comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm white, white,'' McGwire said. ``I don't have a tan.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe at some point this week, he will dust off the sand,
recline on a couch and savor the satisfaction of achieving the
unthinkable: hitting 70 home runs. Maybe he will even watch the
video that has been stashed away, the one marked Sept. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He has never replayed the moment he broke Roger Maris' record of
61 home runs, a night forever remembered by an elation so deep,
McGwire nearly forgot to touch first base on his historic trot.
McGwire seemed to feel that indulging himself with his greatness
would have been too distracting. For an entire season, he displayed
the concentration of a man who defuses bombs for a living. The
crush of pressure never cramped his swing.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of this but grateful for an end to a hot and humid
day. Only someone like McGwire was capable of producing chills as
he sent a thank you to the fans by doing something no one had
thought possible before: He willed himself to hit his 69th and 70th
home runs of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew me away,'' McGwire said. ``I think it'll take a little
time to come down from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after 5:15 p.m., as his getaway car roared out of Busch
Stadium, two crestfallen fans emerged from an office across from
the clubhouse. The two, Philip Ozersky, 26, and Kerry Woodson Jr.,
22, wanted desperately to meet McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   An hour or so earlier, Ozersky had come up with McGwire's 70th
home run ball, while Woodson had uncovered No. 69. After Woodson
and his parents were hustled into a side room by the police, the
parents were told to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a gun, and I had a camera,'' Woodson's mother, Bobbie,
said in a half-serious tone. ``So we left.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room, which lacked only a naked light bulb in this
surreal scene, the police stood by as a team official tried to
broker a deal: a signed jersey and bat for the baseballs. Plus, a
chance to meet McGwire. Woodson and Ozersky wanted to think about
their decision, and show their baseballs to their friends. Neither
said they were interested in selling them right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure to decide what to do,'' Ozersky said. ``It
was like, Mr. McGwire has a flight, and he needs to know now. It
was either give it up, or Mr. McGwire was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As this hour-long ordeal began for Ozersky and Woodson, McGwire
was in the locker room, hugging friends before he hit the shower.
He had already packed his duffel bag before the game although there
was still a cartoonish can of spinach and a stick of deodorant to
tuck away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time for McGwire to laugh with his teammates, and
embrace Manager Tony La Russa, who, at times, has wanted a home run
title for McGwire more than the player he watched sprout up from
his rookie season with Oakland. As McGwire signed the bat he hit
his 70th home run with for the Hall of Fame, he was greeted by an
elderly gentleman, wearing a sport coat and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I sat down with your dad,'' said
Rod Dedaux, the coach who recruited McGwire at the University of
Southern California. ``Good to see `ya.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's face lit up in a day filled with hellos to old friends
and good byes to the new ones he has made this season. He was
polite, and gracious until the end. Perhaps Ozersky and Woodson
left disappointed, but no one else did on a day that shocked the
imagination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he delivered his 69th and 70th home runs, an effort that
seemed ripped from a page of fiction, not even McGwire believed how
this final day was unfolding. ``I can't believe I did it,'' McGwire
said. ``Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   No one could, near or far. Just seven blocks away, at the
TransWorld Dome, the Arizona Cardinals were playing the Rams. When
McGwire hit his 70th home run, the fans carrying radios relayed the
action, and the dome exploded. In turn, the Rams were socked with a
5-yard penalty as a result of the excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame the Ram fans? The ones packing Busch Stadium
understood the elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everyone's in a trance when he comes up to hit,''
said Mike Bisch, a project leader for Bausch &AMP; Lomb who came up
with his season tickets by winning an airline promotion. ``No one's
in the aisle, no one moves. It's like he's hit a home run before he
hits one.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole country absorbed each blast. And the city of St. Louis
took notice. McGwire's day was far from over when the game ended. A
few minutes after the game, he popped out of the dugout wearing a
hat with a ``70'' on it, a surprise that was prepared and waiting
in his locker when he left the game in the ninth inning. He was
ready to receive the St. Louis Award that was described as an honor
given to a man ``for lifting the spirits of a community and a
nation.'' Almost 40,000 remaining fans couldn't stop cheering.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was visibly moved. He swallowed, took a deep breath and
let out a brief thank you. He parted the crush of cameras that have
been following him for weeks and trotted up the tunnel and into a
closed-off clubhouse. His good friend, Tom Lampkin, was waiting for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so happy for him,'' Lampkin said. ``No one can
understand what this has been like for him. What a way to end it.''

 &HT;    Smith a victim again in loss to Raiders
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For much of his career, Dallas cornerback Kevin
Smith has been a victim. If he isn't being whistled for pass
interference, he often is getting dusted by an opposing receiver.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Smith simply was a victim of dumb luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders used a 75-yard touchdown reception by James
Jett to beat Dallas 13-12 before 63,544 fans at Texas Stadium.
Every highlight reel captured Jett catching a ball that deflected
off Smith's left shoulder on a deep route in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's only touchdown of the steamy afternoon was all the
Raiders needed to beat the mistake-prone Cowboys on enemy turf.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Smith always seems to be the Cowboys defender who is
tagged with such misfortune. And he's sick and tired of being
singled out as the player who busted a play.
</P>
<P>
   When someone mentioned that Smith seemed to have good defensive
position on Jett's score, Smith countered, ``Is that what you're
going to write in your story?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Smith seemingly had good coverage when Oakland
quarterback Jeff George threw a spiral down the right sideline. But
Smith did not see the ball until it hit his shoulder pad. Jett,
running in stride, caught the carom and ran easily to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jett runs the 40 in 4.1 (seconds),'' Smith said. ``There's
nothing to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett's touchdown catch was symbolic of Oakland's victory. In a
game filled with big plays, the ball always seemed to bounce in the
Raiders' direction.
</P>
<P>
   The George-to-Jett play was the most significant part of
Oakland's victory. By most accounts, Smith played well, but one
critic noted that the veteran from Texas A&AMP;M did not see the ball
quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jett's touchdown with 1 minute, 14 seconds left in the second
quarter gave Oakland a 10-3 halftime edge. It was a lead the
Raiders never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coverage was good,'' Dallas Coach Chan Gailey said. ``I
wish he had looked up a half-second earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett, meanwhile, could not believe his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was a little short and (Smith) overran it,'' Jett
said. ``Once it hit him, I just grabbed the ball and started
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (2-2) made a valiant comeback late in the game, but it
wasn't enough. With the Cowboys trailing 13-10 with less than 2
minutes remaining, Jason Garrett's desperation throw to Billy Davis
at the goal line was intercepted by Oakland safety Eric Turner.
</P>
<P>
   That was the final straw in an ugly game for the home team.
Garrett passed for 222 yards for the second straight game, but he
made enough mistakes to keep the Cowboys from winning.
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn locker room, no players had more to ponder than
Smith and Garrett, Sunday's scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to put ourselves in a position to win, and we didn't
do that enough today,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   One week after leading Dallas to an easy win over the New York
Giants, Garrett resembled a second-string quarterback who needs
more polish. He threw an untimely interception to Oakland's Charles
Woodson, made countless other bad decisions, and ended the game
with his poorly thrown pass that Turner picked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get into position to win the game, we have to close
the deal,'' Davis said. ``We played on our heels in the red zone
and we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the mistakes, penalties and mental miscues, Dallas
still had a chance to win when it received the ball on its own 20
with 3:15 to go. Trailing 13-10, Garrett hit Michael Irvin with a
critical 17-yard pass and later found Davis on the right sideline
for 14 more.
</P>
<P>
   But on a first-and-10 play from the Oakland 43, Garrett decided
to throw to Davis deep. It was easy to second-guess his decision
after Turner outran Davis and made the easy interception.
</P>
<P>
   For Oakland (2-2), it was the most important defensive stop of
the young season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big win for our football team,'' first-year Raiders
coach Jon Gruden said. ``We will celebrate on the ride home. We set
some goals before the season and one of them was to improve, and
we've been able to do that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was able to stay alive with a solid running game, led by
running back Napoleon Kaufman. He kept the Cowboys busy, dodging a
tackler for 116 yards on 24 carries. The entire Dallas rushing
attack produced only 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to come in and beat the Cowboys,'' said Oakland
defensive tackle Russell Maryland, a former Cowboy. ``For us to
leave here at 2-2 is a pretty good accomplishment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis set up Dallas' only touchdown with a 55-yard catch in the
closing minutes. Emmitt Smith scored on a 1-yard run to slice
Oakland's lead to 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas concluded the scoring when Oakland punter Leo Araguz
purposely ran out of the end zone with two seconds left in the
game, giving the Cowboys a meaningless safety. With the victory
Oakland has a 4-3 series lead against the Cowboys.

ACTIVISION TO MAKE `STAR TREK' VIDEO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Activision Inc., the video game maker, is going Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to announce this week that it has licensed
from Paramount Pictures the exclusive rights to make ``Star Trek''
video games.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows one in July in which Activision licensed the
rights to make six video games based on Walt Disney Co. movies,
including the forthcoming ``Bug's Life,'' ``Tarzan'' and ``Toy
Story 2.'' It also recently became the distributor in Britain and
45 other foreign countries for Lucasarts Entertainment, the video
game company.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kotick, chairman and chief executive of Activision, which
is based in Santa Monica, Calif., said that appealing to the
legions of Disney, ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Wars'' fans would
broaden the market for his company, which had sales of $260 million
and net income of $5.8 million in its last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having recognizable franchises is, in my mind, as important as
the product quality itself,'' he said. The ``Star Trek'' games
alone could bring $600 million in revenues over 10 years, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But video games based on movies, even hits, can flop. Experience
has shown that consumers care much more about the game's quality of
play than about its film connections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only two of the 20 top-selling games for the Nintendo
64 and Sony Playstation machines were tied to movies. And Hollywood
studios themselves have had only mixed success at best in the video
game business. That is one reason that Disney has decided to let
Activision develop Disney-based games instead of doing it itself.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which is owned by Viacom Inc., has already been
leaving game development to game companies. But it has had several
licensees for Star Trek games, which sometimes tripped over one
another in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Having a single licensee will allow for better coordination,
said Andrea Hein, president of Viacom Consumer Products, the
licensing arm of Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deals have not been disclosed. But Activision is
thought to have paid Disney and Paramount tens of millions of
dollars each as guarantees against future royalties.

 &HT;    Sosa gains extra game to pad 66
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mark McGwire now can take his 70 home runs on a long,
well-deserved vacation. The other player in this summer's longball
festival, though, has more work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, (McGwire) will probably be going to the beach, and
I've got to go play,'' said Sammy Sosa, who seemed more pleased
with his alternative.
</P>
<P>
   With tonight's extra game between the Chicago Cubs and the San
Francisco Giants to decide the National League wildcard, Sosa has
an additional opportunity to pad his home run total of 66. That
would be the only benefit of the Cubs' 4-3 loss to Houston on
Sunday that necessitated this one-game playoff.
</P>
<P>
   He'd need four to catch McGwire, who knocked out two more Sunday
as a parting gift to baseball. Mr. Sosa would like to declare the
home run race officially over.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I'm not thinking about home runs anymore. I just want to go
out there (tonight) and play a good game,'' he said. ``I've got to
make contact, get some RBIs and score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's Sunday was wrapped up in concerns other than his chase of
McGwire. As it went the day before, he saw McGwire add two more
homers to his staggering total on the big screen in the Astrodome.
And, as it went Saturday, Sosa was trying to help out the Cubs in
ways that didn't involve one, big swing.
</P>
<P>
   His first-inning single drove in Jose Hernandez, giving Chicago
a quick 1-0 lead. He singled and stole second with one out in the
eighth, but did not score. Sosa also had the dubious distinction of
chasing Carl Everett's 11th-inning shot all around the Astrodome's
right-field reaches. It was a hot drive to the wall _ ``Only
Superman could get that one,'' Sosa said _ that ricocheted hard off
the fence. It eluded Sosa long enough to earn Everett a triple.
From there, he scored the game-ending run on a sacrifice fly by
Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   The play didn't prove fatal, as the Giants also lost in the last
at-bat at Colorado, maintaining their wildcard tie. Sosa goes home
to Wrigley for at least one more game tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Whatever happens, I'll have a lot of great memories,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for smashing Roger Maris' single-season home run record but
still finishing second to McGwire, Sosa said, ``I hope they
remember me, too. Pretty much all year long, I stayed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as a power-hitter, Sosa showed himself to be a
clairvoyant. After McGwire hit two home runs Saturday to take a
68-66 lead in the race, Sosa declared that his friend likely would
hit two more Sunday and finish with an even 70. That's exactly how
it all played out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can hit two more tomorrow, too,'' he said. No, Sosa
hasn't completely forsaken the home run.

KOHL ERA COMES TO END IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The political career of Helmut Kohl, among the world's
most enduring statesmen, came to an abrupt, resounding end Sunday
as Germans opted for a younger, more charismatic leader, Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Running on his accomplishments of overseeing reunification and
closer European integration, the 68-year-old Kohl had asked voters
to return him for an unprecedented fifth four-year term as
chancellor. But anxious over high unemployment and the difficulties
of implementing reunification, voters threw out a sitting
government for the first time since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour after polls closed, a somber Kohl took to the
stage at the Bonn headquarters of his Christian Democratic Union
party and stunned his supporters by conceding defeat and announcing
his retirement. The speech, remarkable for its swiftness and lack
of emotion, marked the end of one of the century's longest
political careers.
</P>
<P>
   As Kohl was conceding, a jubiliant Schroeder flashed the victory
sign to cheering supporters from his Social Democratic Party, which
will take control of government for the first time in 16 years.
``The era of Helmut Kohl has come to an end,'' said Schroeder, 54,
with his fourth wife standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder called cutting unemployment ``the most important
goal,'' and vowed to improve the living standards for eastern
Germans, who eight years after reunification complain that they are
treated like second-class citizens. He said he would form an
alliance of industry and union leaders to create a strategy for
making Germany's economy, the world's third-largest behind those of
the United States and Japan, more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   While the final tally is not expected until Monday, exit polling
and initial results suggested that the environmentalist Green Party
will be the junior member of the coalition led by Schroeder. Such a
``red-green'' coalition could be a volatile mix, as the fringe
elements of those parties are far removed from the so-called ``New
Center'' consensus politics that Schroeder touted.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the BBC, however, Schroeder said he would not rule
out a ``grand coalition'' between his party and Kohl's Christian
Democrats, even though leading Christian Democrats were ruling it
out as they began to ponder who would replace Kohl, party leader
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the unexpectedly strong showing by the Party of
Democratic Socialists, composed of former Communist Party members
from the former East Germany, potential coalition partners were not
doing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has ruled out any pact with the former Communists, who
polled especially well in their eastern Germany base and in East
Berlin, where they are known as the Roten Socken, or Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results suggested that Schroeder's party will win about
40 percent of the vote, and Kohl's party about 35 percent. The
Greens were expected to receive about 6 percent, meaning that they
and the Social Democrats would get about 330 seats, one more than
the 329 needed for a majority in the Bundestag, the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But that majority may be too thin for Schroeder's liking, and he
could seek to form a broader coalition, a prospect that leaders of
the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats will discuss
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the longest-serving leader of any modern democracy, Kohl is a
giant figure in Germany, in Europe, and on the world stage. By
contrast, Schroeder, governor of Lower Saxony, one of Germany's 16
states, is unproven on anything but a provincial stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, voters appeared more concerned about domestic issues,
particularly unemployment, than they were about Kohl's clout as an
international statesman. About 4 million Germans are out of work,
almost 11 percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   The economic uncertainty was underscored by polls showing that
despite the ubiquitous campaign posters and unrelenting media
attention, up to a third of Germany's 60 million voters had not
made up their minds until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   History may judge Kohl as important a statesman as Winston
Churchill or Charles de Gaulle. But he, like them, had to be pushed
out rather than leave on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Polls had shown that most Germans would have preferred that
Kohl's deputy, Wolfgang Schaeuble, be his party's candidate for
chancellor, and that Schaeuble could have beaten Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent television interview, Kohl explained his
determination to run rather than retire by saying he wanted to see
through the implementation of a single European currency and German
reunification. But he also betrayed a selfish reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all,'' Kohl said, ``I want to show all those who have
written me off that I am still there, standing firm.''
</P>
<P>
   He had asked voters for the chance to finish guiding the country
into the Euro and to make good on his 1989 promise, made after the
Berlin Wall fell, that he would provide ``flourishing landscapes''
in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But many in western Germany complained that Kohl had mostly
squandered $750 billion in the east, while many easterners
complained that reunification and the free market had cost them the
jobs and the housing guaranteed under the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Schroeder had a double-digit lead in the
polls. But Kohl, who has traditionally been underestimated by his
opponents, campaigned ferociously during the last month, whittling
the lead to a few points.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl stressed his accomplishments and tried to exploit the
tendency of many Germans to avoid risks, Schroeder offered what he
called a new way to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Following the examples of Bill Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair,
to whom he is often compared, Schroeder was vague on how he intends
to steer Germany toward the future in ways fundamentally different
than Kohl's.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment for change proved overwhelming. Interviews
with voters in Berlin, where 3 million of the country's 80 million
people live, suggested that many had voted strategically, not for
Schroeder as much as against Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I would vote for the Greens, and I have a problem
with Schroeder. But we need a change,'' said Zeph Uwe, 33, a city
planner, who voted for Schroeder's party.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Schulz, 56, a former member of East Germany's Communist
army and normally a Green Party supporter, said he voted for
Schroeder simply to get rid of Kohl. ``He promised us flourishing
landscapes, but nothing has changed,'' Schulz said.

A PROVINCIAL PLAYER STEPS UP TO THE WORLD STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In 1980, shortly after he was elected to Parliament,
Gerhard Schroeder was heading home after a night on the town when
he suddenly told a friend to pull over at the entrance to the Bonn
home of Germany's chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get in there!'' Schroeder screamed, rattling the
iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, a more mature, more subdued Schroeder is
poised to take his seat as chancellor because he was able to
channel, some would say suppress, the impulsive anger that once
drove him.
</P>
<P>
   By unseating Helmut Kohl, chancellor for 16 years and Europe's
longest-serving and most important leader, Schroeder has become a
giant-slayer, thrust onto the world stage without experience or a
net.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from his provincial post as governor of Lower
Saxony. Yet it seems a fitting climax to a political career that
began with a searing idealism that was gradually subsumed by a
pragmatism born of a determination to obtain and exercise real
power.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has a fondness for cigars and wives. He has been
married four times. And yet while Kohl's supporters tried to make
the divorces an issue, few here seem to begrudge Schroeder's
marital record.
</P>
<P>
   He has been compared to Bill Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair,
in that he took his traditionally left-wing Social Democratic Party
toward the center in a calculated move to seize power from
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   These days, given the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Schroeder
probably would prefer being compared to Blair. And yet Schroeder is
more like Clinton, not only because he has risen to international
prominence from governing an obscure, provincial backwater. More
tellingly, Schroeder's thirst for respect and power is, like
Clinton's, a product of growing up poor.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1944, just three days before his father, a German
soldier, was killed on the eastern front. His mother, now 84,
worked as a cleaning woman, and he cared for his four sisters. They
lived for many years on welfare, an experience he has cited as
shaping his empathy for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he got a job at a china shop in his hometown of Lemgo. It
was a revelation to Schroeder, because behind the counter he was
somebody. ``Power fascinated me from the moment that I stood behind
a counter as an apprentice, with no educational qualifications and
no prospects,'' he wrote in his autobiography. ``I wanted to get
out of there, to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to law school and married his high school sweetheart.
The marriage lasted only three years, and soon he was married
again, to a student activist. As a lawyer, he made a name for
himself defending radicals and terrorists, and ran for Parliament
in 1980. Divorced again, he met and married Hiltrud Hampel, a
political scientist known as Hillu.
</P>
<P>
   They became Germany's first political power couple. While Kohl's
wife stayed at home and baked him saumagen, or pig's stomach, Hillu
Schroeder was an outspoken environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder's idealism seemed to shrink even as that of his
third wife grew. He drifted away from her and his party
apparatchiks and began associating with the rich and famous,
including Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder took up with Doris Kopf, a magazine journalist 20
years his junior. She has only improved his cozy relations with
most elements in the German media.
</P>
<P>
   But his third divorce proved bitter, especially when Hillu went
public and accused her former husband of being vain, stingy, and
opportunistic. She said he had forced her and their two daughters
to move to a smaller apartment, and had refused to pay for their
dog's surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, unflappable as usual, replied by saying his third
wife was a ``fanatic,'' prone to bursting into his Cabinet meetings
while ranting that he and his colleagues were not doing enough to
save bats. In a futile attempt to convert him to vegetarianism, he
said, she refused to allow meat in their home.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some who agree with Hillu's chief complaint about
her former husband: that he sacrificed his principles in a
head-long pursuit of power.
</P>
<P>
   Once an outspoken opponent of the Gulf War, Schroeder now
condemns Saddam Hussein as a dictator who must be crushed. Once a
dyed-in-the-wool leftist, Schroeder waffles on what to do about
reforming the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Harrold Schmidt, Germany's answer to David Letterman, says that
if Schroeder were the Titanic, it never would have sunk because it
never would have left the harbor, unable to choose a direction.
Then again, he says, if the corpulent Kohl was the Titanic, ``the
iceberg would have sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's point seems to have set in. Many Germans thought Kohl
seemed tired and old. Schroeder, who dyes his hair, is a youthful
54, with a young, attractive wife.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Schroeder was prone to outbursts. Now he is more
likely to use his piercing blue eyes to emphasize a point. His
supporters say he has matured and will serve Germany, and Europe,
well on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Schroeder offers bland populism, trying to be all
things to all people. Schroeder calls it the ``New Center,''
flexible politics not bound by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders always have derided Social Democrats as
liberals who have weakened Germany's competitiveness by creating
overly generous fringe benefits for workers and a welfare state
that provides little incentive for people to take entry-level jobs.
Conscious of this, Schroeder recruited as his economic adviser Jost
Stollman, a Harvard Business School-educated entrepreneur who made
millions in the computer industry. Stollman, often described as
Germany's Bill Gates, is Schroeder's trump card against claims that
he is antibusiness.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, business moguls are among Schroeder's best friends,
including Gates. Some party strategists privately complain that
Schroeder spends more time with his rich friends than with them.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder shrugs off such criticism, saying his private life is
separate from his public one. Now, he and Doris Schroeder rival
Tony and Cherie Blair as the power couple of Europe, and, given the
problems at the White House, perhaps the world.

PATENTS: INVENTOR OF WINDSURFING FINDS HIS PLACE IN THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 70-year-old retired sign painter, S. Newman Darby, might still
be living in obscurity in Jacksonville, Fla., if an odd couple of
sorts _ a windsurfing industrial engineer and an archivist at the
Smithsonian Institution _ had not decided to champion his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the archivist, Alison Oswald, finished installing a
small exhibit honoring Darby's role in the invention of windsurfing
at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oswald, who specializes in acquiring collections of
inventors, had never heard of Darby until the summer of 1997, when
Chad Lyons, a windsurfer who lives in Connecticut, made an
impromptu call on her at the museum while he was in town on
business _ trying to promote his own patented invention, a new type
of medical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad Lyons came by and said, `You ought to look into who the
real inventor of windsurfing is,''' Ms. Oswald recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Two Californians had been widely credited with inventing
windsurfing, a sport that is a cross between surfing and sailing
and that has been an Olympic event since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Drake, an aeronautics engineer, and his partner, Hoyle
Schweitzer, received U.S. patent 3,487,800 for a sailboard _ what
Schweitzer later trademarked as a Windsurfer _ in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But that is five years after Darby says he first maneuvered his
sailboard around the Chesapeake Bay, in 1965. Later that year,
Darby published an article about his new form of sailing in Popular
Science and advertised his invention in the back of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although that particular issue of Popular Science had a
circulation of about 6 million, Drake and Schweitzer did not list
the article as part of their ``prior art'' _ evidence of related
inventions that is supposed to be filed along with a patent
application.
</P>
<P>
   But why didn't Darby obtain a patent back in the mid-1960s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, we couldn't afford to do the patent,'' he said.
``I was trying to raise a young family and to make a living as a
sign painter and an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Darby did go into the sailboard business with his brothers,
Ronald and Ken, manufacturing an estimated 160 boards and selling
about half of them for $295 apiece, from 1965 through the next few
years. Their company is still in business, but no longer makes
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons was teaching windsailing when he first heard of Darby
through a student who decided to start a business manufacturing and
selling his own sailboard design.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyons' student, as well as other sailboard manufacturers,
were sued by Schweitzer's Windsurfer company for patent
infringement, Darby's name emerged during the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   So when Lyons was asked in the early 1990s by the U.S.
Windsurfing Association to help collect artifacts of the sport for
a proposed museum, he looked up Darby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great record-keeper,'' Lyons said of Darby, who kept
early boards and sails as well as notes and photographs, including
an 8-millimeter home movie that his wife, Naomi, who also sewed the
sails for her husband, shot of Darby sailboarding in the summer of
1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a quandary,'' Lyons said. ``I was afraid that
bringing up Newman might divide this tribal community we call
windsurfing, which pays tribute to these California guys. So I was
going to keep a lid on Newman until I got him into the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   But financing fell through and the museum never materialized.
Then, in 1996, American Windsurfer, a glossy quarterly magazine
based in Gilford, N.H., published an article titled ``Origins of
Windsurfing,'' featuring two extensive interviews with Drake and
Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons called the editor and publisher, John Chao, and urged him
to send a copy of the issue to Newman Darby. Darby sallied back
with a letter and a three-hour home video chronicling what he
contended was his role in the development of board surfing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the magazine published a two-part interview with Darby.
``The photographs and the film footage were so complete and so
compelling that we were stunned that such evidence existed and we
didn't know about it,'' Chao wrote. ``Suddenly what we prided as
the definitive article on the `Origins of Windsurfing' became
embarrassingly incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian recently took possession of many of Darby's
artifacts, including one of his early sailboards.
</P>
<P>
   Chao said that neither Drake nor Schweitzer had written or
called to comment on Darby's claims that he was the rightful
inventor of sailboarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really quite interesting how there was an absence of
response or denial,'' Chao said in a telephone interview. ``If I
had invented something and someone else claimed otherwise I would
have been very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Drake nor Schweitzer could be reached for comment. In
his original interview in American Windsurfer, however, Drake did
not claim to be the inventor of the universal joint _ the pivoting
joint that attaches the sail to the surface of the board, which is
a key feature of a sailboard _ but rather said that he could more
accurately be described as its ``re-inventor.''
</P>
<P>
   Darby never made any money off sailboarding. But neither did
Drake reap the enormous profits that his erstwhile partner did.
Schweitzer bought Drake's patent rights for $36,000 in 1972.
Hundreds of thousands of boards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lyons says he does not want to minimize the role
that the two Californians played in starting the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Drake and Schweitzer, we would have never had this
popular sport,'' Lyons said. ``It's not clear that Newman would
have ever come up with the idea of a wishbone boom or other
technical refinements. And Schweitzer was far more firm in his
convictions that this could be a popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``Newman probably doesn't agree with me
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 (Eds.: Adds 24 grafs to end of story) 
McGWIRE ENDS SEASON WITH RECORD SETTING 70 HOME RUNS  
(sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His seasonlong performance so surpassed any
individual performance major-league baseball has ever seen that
Mark McGwire said, ``I'm in awe of myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing that performance with a flourish, McGwire clouted two
more home runs on the last day of the regular season on Sunday,
raising his record total to 70. Like a long-distance runner with an
explosive finishing kick, McGwire sprinted away from the guy next
to him, Sammy Sosa, by hitting five home runs in his last 11
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who remained at 66 home runs after hitting none on Sunday,
is not finished playing. The Cubs, the team he has carried all
season, will meet the San Francisco Giants in Chicago on Monday
night to determine the fourth and final team, the wild-card team,
in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa will be hard-pressed to catch McGwire, the
larger-than-life superstar who has imbedded himself in the hearts
of St. Louis residents and captivated the rest of the country with
his performance and his demeanor. A player has hit four home runs
in a game only 12 times in major-league history, none for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck,'' McGwire said earnestly long distance to Sosa, who
has become his ally in home runs and understanding of what he has
gone through the past six months. ``We've been going back and
forth. It's been a tremendous ride for he and I.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 with a
line drive over the left-field fence at Busch Stadium on Sept. 8,
trailed Sosa only twice this season, each time for less than an
hour. Sosa slugged his way into the lead last Friday night by
hitting his 66th home run in Houston, but 45 minutes later, McGwire
tied him, then did not look back.
</P>
<P>
   He socked a pair of home runs against Montreal pitchers on
Saturday and connected against two Expos rookies on Sunday. He
lofted a towering fly ball against Mike Thurman in the third inning
that descended gracefully into the left-field stands for No. 69.
Then in the seventh inning, an hour and nine minutes later, he
swung at the first pitch he saw from Carl Pavano and lined it over
the left-field fence for No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I did it; can you?'' McGwire said at a
post-game news conference that had become as much a part of his day
as hitting home runs. ``It's absolutely amazing. It blows me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting five home runs in the span of 11 at-bats is incredible
even for the hitter who finished the season with a record low ratio
of one home run every 7.27 at-bats. McGwire had registered the
previous low ratio of 8.13 in 1996, when he hit 52 home runs,
surpassing Babe Ruth's record 8.48 achieved in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said hitting home runs is getting pitches to hit,
keeping your stroke intact and working hard,'' he said, discussing
his fantastic finish. ``Home runs aren't easy to do. When you work
as hard as I've worked the last few years to really work on my
swing and get full extension, it's paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cardinals' first six games against the Expos, McGwire hit
one home run. Then came the deluge. In his last 11 at-bats, he hit
a home run, singled, struck out, struck out, hit a home run, flied
out to center field, hit a home run, grounded out to third base,
singled, hit a home run and (after walking) hit a home run. His
last two swings of his already legendary season produced home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' said Orlando Cabrera, the Expos' rookie
shortstop. ``Everything he hits goes out.'' Cabrera, who hit a home
run of his own in the third inning, congratulated McGwire as the
Cardinal slugger passed him in the seventh inning. ``I'll be able
to tell my kids I hit a home run the same day as McGwire hit his
70th,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thurman nor Pavano, the rookie pitchers, was distraught
over his contribution to baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, a 25-year-old right-hander, said he threw McGwire a
breaking ball, ``a bad breaking ball that most guys don't hit, up
and in.'' He added: ``Most guys take it or pop it up. He just
muscled it out. That's why he's so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman said he was not particularly happy about giving up the
home run. ``But to be part of something that's special is a good
feeling,'' he said. ``It's something I'll look back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman faced McGwire again in the fifth inning and walked him
on four pitches, the fourth making the 6-foot-5-inch batter duck as
the ball sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely out of gas,'' Thurman said. ``I think
everyone knows I wasn't trying to hit him. No one felt worse about
it than I did, coming in with a 3-0 fastball at his head. It could
have been pretty ugly. Fortunately, he got out of the way. I hope
he knows I wasn't doing it on purpose.'' It was, McGwire said, ``no
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went to bat in the seventh inning, the game was tied,
3-3, runners were at first and second, and Pavano was pitching.
Pavano, acquired from Boston last November in a trade for Pedro
Martinez, was making his first relief appearance of the season
after 23 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to pitch; I could've said no,'' the 22-year-old
right-hander said. ``It was my decision. If I had said no, I'm
done, they wouldn't have pitched me. But I said I could do it. I
don't have any regrets doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had never faced Pavano and decided to take a cue from
J.D. Drew, who batted just ahead of him and singled to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea how his ball moves,'' McGwire said. ``J.D. swung
at the first pitch, so I might as well be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would this veteran of 456 home runs, 69 this season, borrow
from a rookie who became a major leaguer the night McGwire broke
Maris' record?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to amuse yourself sometimes when you play this
game,'' McGwire said. ``I said if he's going to be aggressive, I
might as well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano threw a fastball up and in. ``I was going right after
him,'' Pavano said, then added, smiling, ``He came after me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said: ``I hammered down and got a lot of top hand on it,
and it carried just enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Like No. 62, it took off on a line rather than soaring high into
the sky, but it traveled about 30 feet farther than No. 62, an
estimated 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano knew instantly he had just given up McGwire's last home
run of a record season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' the pitcher said. ``I knew he didn't have any
at-bats left.'' Then he said: ``If you're going to give up a home
run, you might as well give it up to him. What he's accomplished
for baseball is unbelievable. I could see if he was cocky and had
an attitude about it, but he's so genuine. You can't be nothing but
happy for the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' 14th consecutive sellout crowd of 46,110 roared
and roared and roared some more after each home run, but especially
the second. Pavano noted that McGwire had fed off the fans. He also
profited financially from them.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance bonus in his contract _ $1 for each ticket sold
over 2.8 million _ provided McGwire an extra payday of $395,021.
But that is one bonus the Cardinals will be happy to pay.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was asked whether he thought someone would break his
record, assuming it remains the record after Sosa's bonus game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will stand for a while,'' he said. ``I know how
grueling it is to do what I've done this year. It will be broken
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Might he break it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to break my own record,'' McGwire said.
``I think I'd rather just leave it as is.''

BAKER, DOLE SUPPORT IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two respected Republican elders eyed by the White
House as possible brokers for an expedited impeachment or censure
deal said Sunday that it is far too early to seek a negotiated
agreement and that the House should open an impeachment inquiry in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by moderate Republicans Bob Dole and Howard Baker,
coming amid Republican congressional recalcitrance toward any deal,
could prove devastating to White House efforts to broker an
agreement before the House launches a full-bore impeachment
proceeding next week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he supported a deal between the White House and
congressional leaders that would allow President Clinton to receive
a rapid impeachment vote or stay in office, Baker, a former Senate
majority leader, presidential candidate, and chief of staff to
Ronald Reagan, said simply, ``No.'' He added: ``Impeachment
hearings are necessary. The system has to work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dole, Clinton's Republican rival in the 1996
campaign and a former Senate majority leader, said no agreement was
feasible or even wise until after the November congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that it's way too early to even speculate about
that,'' Dole said, speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``The
Democrats would love that to happen. It has to go through the
process. Get the process started, let the elections happen, come
back and get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had privately offered to have Clinton testify
before the House Judiciary Committee and admit to significant
wrongdoing if the House would agree to hold a quick vote on his
fate. Some Clinton strategists had envisioned a powerful team of
statesmanlike Republicans and Democrats prevailing on the Congress
to cut a deal for the sake of the institutions involved.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection by Baker and Dole also occurred on the same day
that lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones publicly confirmed they are
involved in talks with Clinton's attorneys on a possible settlement
of her sexual harassment case, which had been thrown out of court
by a judge in April but remains on appeal. One Jones lawyer, David
Pyke, described himself as ``very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and political strategists would like to settle
the case for a variety of reasons, the foremost being that if the
suit were resolved, Clinton could then admit to Congress as part of
any impeachment settlement deal that he lied in his January Jones
deposition without facing further legal repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also fear that the federal judge in the Jones
suit, Susan Webber Wright, could still hold Clinton in contempt for
lying in the deposition, and that the appellate court may now be
more likely to rule in favor of Jones because of Clinton's
admission of his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they realize that there are very significant risks
of contempt and other sanctions that either the appeals court or
the trial court could impose upon Mr. Clinton that would lead to a
victory in our case,'' said Donovan Campbell, a Jones lawyer, on
ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also said he plans to take action on evidence that
another woman filed a false affidavit in the Jones case denying
that Clinton had harassed her. In the report sent to Congress this
month by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, a woman identified
in the Jones case as Jane Doe 5 told prosecutors that a Jan. 2
affidavit filed for Jones's lawyers denying that Clinton had made
unwelcome sexual advances was ``false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just wondering how much perjury and false evidence can
the federal court system stand before something is done?'' said
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton continued on a campaign and fund-raising trip
in California, and some key Democrats continued to press toward a
congressional deal on an expedited impeachment process or a
censure. Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry, conceding that the
prospects were diminishing, said Republicans may face voter wrath
for prolonging any impeachment proceeding with lengthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political process, yes, but it's a process that is
supposed to reflect the American people,'' Kerry said on CBS's
``Face the Nation.'' ``Congress should listen to the American
people on this one. The American people know what this case is
about, and they want us to handle this in a mature and a dignified
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, though, with little apparent impact, warned Clinton that
he must not continue attacking Republicans as he has for the last
several days, saying he doesn't think such a strategy is
``advisable.''
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes after Kerry spoke, Clinton strategist James
Carville appeared on ``Meet the Press'' and declared ``war'' on
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, saying he will soon be ``rolling into
battle.'' In an apparent reference to Gingrich's 1996 ethics
problems, Carville described him as a ``sanctioned, certified,
adjudicated, and confessed liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most crowded place in Washington is Newt Gingrich's hip
pocket, because it has got every member of the Republican Caucus in
it,'' Carville said. ``They are scared to death. He came out and
unilaterally said, `I am the person that decides that there's not
going to be any deal.' Well, I've got news, Newt Gingrich, I'm
meeting with people all over Washington this week, and we're going
to mount an attack to tell the truth about what's behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole warned Republicans again not to push too far too hard in
their investigation for fear of inspiring the wrath of the public,
which still offers strong support for Clinton's job performance in
most public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for everyone to take a deep breath _ all the
American people, Democrats, Republicans, the White House,'' said
Dole. ``It's not going to happen before the election. It's probably
not going to happen until next year. Don't be overzealous. Let the
process work. Be fair to the president and everyone else.''

REAL NETWORKS IN PACT WITH AMERICA ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a risky step when Rob Glaser, chairman of Real
Networks &UR;  &LR; Inc., appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in
July, joining a chorus of Microsoft bashers. He complained that
some of Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp.'s latest software refused to work properly
with his company's so-called streaming programs, which deliver
audio and video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser is no garden-variety Microsoft adversary. He is himself a
former Microsoft executive, and Microsoft holds an 10 percent stake
in his fast-growing Seattle company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his public dispute with Microsoft has certainly not hurt
Glaser's business so far. There are no signs of retaliation from
his giant neighbor, former employer and investor in Redmond, Wash.
Meanwhile, people in increasing numbers _ now more than 30 million
_ are using his software.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, Real Networks plans to announce that America
Online &UR;  &LR; Inc., the online leader, has chosen its technology as the
main way for users to play streaming media on the new version of
the service, AOL 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   That word comes as America Online begins its own marketing drive
Monday for AOL 4.0 _ not only an upgrade for its 13 million current
subscribers, but also an effort to lure the millions of other
people who will be sent America Online disks in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The America Online agreement is a marketing coup for Real
Networks. ``It is piggybacking on AOL's powerful distribution
network,'' said Jae Kim of Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates, a research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, in Glaser's view, is on its way to becoming a
mainstream mass medium for receiving the recorded voice and
television-style videos. Already, 85 percent of the Web sites that
offer streaming media make use of the technology from Real
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   And if anything, he says, the spat with Microsoft over his
Senate testimony seemed to help, with the volume of daily downloads
from the company's site (www.real.com) rising by nearly 20 percent
immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heard and read about streaming media,'' Glaser said,
``and wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.''

COMING THIS WEEK: A WEB HAIR TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (js) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the company that brought the first live broadcasts of
childbirth and open-heart surgery to the World Wide Web comes the
latest opportunity for medical rubbernecking: a live Webcast of a
hair-transplant operation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many people will decide to tune in for
the event (www.ahn.com), which will take place on Wednesday at
Baptist Hospital in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sometimes poor picture quality and frequent
busy-server signals, nearly a million people managed to log in at
some point during the morning of June 16 to see a 40-year-old woman
named Elizabeth giving birth to a 7-pound, 8-ounce boy. And in
August, nearly 600,000 people caught part of a live Webcast of a
48-year-old Texas woman's quadruple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from America's Health Network, the cable TV company
based in Orlando, Fla., that produces the shows, insist that the
Webcasts are not merely aimed at raising brand awareness for the
network but are also intended to educate the public.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Fetherling, the network's president, said he hoped the
hair-transplant show would appeal to some of the 30 million people
_ nearly a third of them women _ who he said had some degree of
so-called male pattern baldness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet,'' he said, ``offers people a confidential way to
watch the procedure and ask questions about hair transplantation _
often a very sensitive subject.''
</P>
<P>
   During the procedure, the network's
physician-turned-color-commentator, Dr. Walt Larimore, will call
the action as a Nashville, Tenn., plastic surgeon removes a patch
of skin from the hairy part of the patient's head and then inserts
more than 1,000 hair grafts in the bald part of his scalp. The
operation will take four to five hours, accompanied by an online
chat session in which viewers can discuss the surgery and ask
questions.
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network intends to make medical Webcasts a
monthly event. October will bring an online breast-cancer surgery
and November an eye operation.

   ST. LOUIS _ When Mark McGwire had taken his final swing on
Sunday, when most of the fans had stopped cheering and left Busch
Stadium, one sign of this great baseball season remained in huge,
bright numerals on the big screen in center field.
</P>
<P>
   70.
</P>
<P>
   With two home runs in Sunday's last game of the regular season,
McGwire finished with an unbelievable 70 home runs, nine more than
Roger Maris, who held the previous record of 61 for 37 years.
McGwire finished with four more homers than Cubs outfielder Sammy
Sosa, who watched McGwire's four homers on the final two days of
the season effectively end the race.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will get one more chance tonight, when the Cubs play the
Giants in a game that will decide the National League wild card
participant in the playoffs. Home runs in that game will be added
to his regular-season total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might never happen again,'' McGwire said. ``I'll never let
this season go.''

NEW ORLEANS BRACES FOR GEORGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hurricane Georges, with sustained winds of more
than 110 miles per hour, menaced the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the
heavily populated New Orleans area last night while hundreds of
thousands of residents fled the most powerful storm to threaten the
region in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it appeared Georges was moving away from a direct
hit on the mouth of the Mississippi River and metropolitan New
Orleans, the US Weather Bureau said it was on the verge of a
Category 3 rating, an intensity that could cause great damage
across a wide swath of land from the Florida Panhandle to the bayou
country of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Storm surges of up to 20 feet were predicted, a rise in the
normal level of coastal and marsh water that would overwhelm the
area. With plenty of warning, occupants of the area began boarding
homes and departing as early as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate highways, which had been filled with thousands of
motorists seeking higher ground, were closed by authorities Sunday
afternoon. The New Orleans International Airport was shut all day
as ominous clouds gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary wind gusts topping 50 miles per hour hit New Orleans
late Sunday, and higher levels were reported along the Gulf Coast,
with the eye of the hurricane still lurking off-shore.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, which is about 6 feet below sea level, was
particularly in peril. The city, wrapped by the Mississippi River,
the Gulf Coast, and Lake Pontchartrain, was swamped by nearly 20
inches of rain from tropical storms earlier this month, and
meteorologists say there is no room for more rain.
</P>
<P>
   There were predictions of 25 more inches of rain, coupled with a
storm surge that could drive millions of gallons of water up the
Mississippi River toward the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the best city in America,'' Mayor Marc Morial said.
``But this may not have been the best place 300 years ago to place
a city.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential problems, Morial declared: ``We are
prepared.'' Pumps, which deliver water overloads from city streets,
were primed and hundreds of members of emergency crews were in
place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid fears that much of the city could be under 6 feet of water,
residents searched frantically for high ground on which to park
their cars. By noon Sunday, virtually every high-rise parking
garage was full.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of New Orleanians left of their own volition,
evacuations were ordered in low-lying parishes outside the city.
Curfews were imposed across the region, disrupting the tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, the storm washed over US Highway 90 along the
Mississippi Gulf Coast. The casinos that have popularized the route
have been shut down since Friday and much of the usual flow of
people had already disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   As far north as Birmingham, Ala., about 260 miles from the
coast, there were no vacancies left in motels along the major
evacuation routes.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet prevailed in other endangered places in Louisiana, even
though some shelters were so crowded that new locations had to be
opened to accommodate the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   The city opened what is probably the largest hurricane shelter
ever: the Superdome. Long lines of people carried blankets and
pillows, and registered for entry. Rising water could flood the
playing field and lower-deck seats. The nearly 10,000 people at the
stadium were directed to higher decks.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana State Police reported
early last night that waves were topping the levees along Lake
Pontchartrain. ``The worst is yet to come for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous French Quarter of New Orleans was reduced to a quiet
neighborhood. Restaurants were boarded and streets were deserted.
Even Harry's Bar, an around-the-clock, 365-days-a-year, emporium,
was shut down. National Guardsmen patrolled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A rock concert in City Park, expected to attract more than
25,000 spectators this weekend, was canceled by city officials, and
smaller events, such as the annual William Faulkner literary
conference, were terminated, leaving hundreds of tourists to seek
flights before the airport closed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Gulf Coast have watched the approach of Georges
with apprehension for more than a week since it seemed to be aimed,
laser-like, at the area from the time it developed in the South
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The storm raked the Caribbean last week, with a death toll of
more than 300, as it swept across Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, and Cuba. In recent days, it has meandered through
the Gulf of Mexico, building strength over the water after leaving
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the area have a long, unhappy experience with
stormy autumn weather.
</P>
<P>
   Seawalls were destroyed, homes swamped and miles of trees
leveled by a hurricane in 1947, before names were attached to
storms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, New Orleans suffered serious flooding after being hit
by Hurricane Betsy. Four years later, the Gulf Coast was devastated
by Hurricane Camille, one of the strongest storms in history, which
resulted in more than 250 deaths and billions of dollars in
property damage.

EDITORIAL: FAIRNESS FOR HAITIAN REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has included in its Treasury-Postal appropriations
bill a provision to allow 40,000 Haitian refugees who have been in
this country since 1995 to stay permanently. The House, which has
not included similar language in its bill, should accept this
measure when the conference committee meets to produce a compromise
bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress amended the 1996 immigration act, which had
made it much harder for Central Americans who fled civil wars and
persecution to fight deportation even though many had lived in the
United States for years. As a result of that correction, 150,000
Nicaraguans and 5,000 Cubans were granted permanent residency.
Salvadorans, Guatemalans and some Eastern Europeans were also
allowed to apply for residency under more lenient rules. But
Haitians who fled their country under comparable circumstances were
left out.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton moved quickly to shield the Haitian asylum
seekers from immediate deportation by an administrative directive,
giving Congress an opportunity to correct its omission. About a
third of these Haitians were allowed into this country after
authorities determined that they had credible fears of persecution
if returned to Haiti. The rest filed asylum petitions at least
three years ago, and many are still awaiting the outcome of their
cases. Allowing this group to stay would not signal an opening of
doors to all illegal aliens. Indeed, tens of thousands of Haitian
boat people were shipped back in the early 1990s because they could
not make claims of persecution. The Haitians who would benefit from
the proposed measure have rebuilt their lives and developed
community and family ties here. Compassion and fairness dictate
that they be given the chance to stay.

   `Death of a Salesman' Revival
</P>
<P>
   Still 63, Willy Loman has his shoes shined and his bags packed
for another bout with life. Monday night the Goodman Theater in
Chicago begins its 1998-99 Mainstage season with a revival of the
Arthur Miller classic, ``Death of a Salesman,'' which opened in
1949 and won a Pulitzer Prize, a Tony Award and the Drama Critics'
Circle Award. In the production, continuing through Nov. 7 and
staged by Robert Falls, Willy is portrayed by Brian Dennehy; Kevin
Anderson plays his son Biff, and Elizabeth Franz plays Willy's
wife, Linda. Information: (312) 443-3800.

   NEW YORK _ Tapping two of the world's foremost repositories of
drawings for 120 works by artists like Rubens, Matisse, Picasso,
Rembrandt, Daumier, Bernini, Modigliani, Poussin and van Gogh, the
Morgan Library has begun the exhibition ``Master Drawings from the
Hermitage and Pushkin Museums.'' Many of these works, from the 15th
to the 20th centuries, have never been shown outside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan will be the only site of the exhibition, running
until Jan. 10. The show is part of a yearlong celebration of the
library's 75th anniversary as an institution open to the public.
The library began as the private collection of financier J.P.
Morgan. Information: (212) 685-0610.

<P>
   Unique is not a word to be used lightly, but the 60 ceramics by
Picasso that went on display Sunday at the Tacoma Art Museum in
Tacoma, Wash., bear that designation. All the sculptures, vessels
and tiles are from the artist's private collection. And though many
of his ceramics were produced by the hundreds, these are described
as one-of-a-kind. The ceramics were inherited by Marina Picasso,
the artist's granddaughter, and few have been displayed in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Ceramics From the Marina Picasso Collection,'' running
through Jan. 10, the museum will show Picasso prints and drawings
elaborating on themes in the ceramics. This part of the exhibition
features preparatory drawings for Picasso's ``Guernica'' from the
Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. Information:

McGWIRE ENDS SEASON WITH RECORD SETTING 70 HOME RUNS

 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His seasonlong performance so surpassed any
individual performance major-league baseball has ever seen that
Mark McGwire said, ``I'm in awe of myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing that performance with a flourish, McGwire clouted two
more home runs on the last day of the regular season on Sunday,
raising his record total to 70. Like a long-distance runner with an
explosive finishing kick, McGwire sprinted away from the guy next
to him, Sammy Sosa, by hitting five home runs in his last 11
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who remained at 66 home runs after hitting none on Sunday,
is not finished playing. The Cubs, the team he has carried all
season, will meet the San Francisco Giants in Chicago on Monday
night to determine the fourth and final team, the wild-card team,
in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa will be hard-pressed to catch McGwire, the
larger-than-life superstar who has imbedded himself in the hearts
of St. Louis residents and captivated the rest of the country with
his performance and his demeanor. A player has hit four home runs
in a game only 12 times in major-league history, none for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck,'' McGwire said earnestly long distance to Sosa, who
has become his ally in home runs and understanding of what he has
gone through the past six months. ``We've been going back and
forth. It's been a tremendous ride for he and I.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 with a
line drive over the left-field fence at Busch Stadium on Sept. 8,
trailed Sosa only twice this season, each time for less than an
hour. Sosa slugged his way into the lead last Friday night by
hitting his 66th home run in Houston, but 45 minutes later, McGwire
tied him, then did not look back.
</P>
<P>
   He socked a pair of home runs against Montreal pitchers on
Saturday and connected against two Expos rookies on Sunday. He
lofted a towering fly ball against Mike Thurman in the third inning
that descended gracefully into the left-field stands for No. 69.
Then in the seventh inning, an hour and nine minutes later, he
swung at the first pitch he saw from Carl Pavano and lined it over
the left-field fence for No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I did it; can you?'' McGwire said at a
post-game news conference that had become as much a part of his day
as hitting home runs. ``It's absolutely amazing. It blows me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting five home runs in the span of 11 at-bats is incredible
even for the hitter who finished the season with a record low ratio
of one home run every 7.27 at-bats. McGwire had registered the
previous low ratio of 8.13 in 1996, when he hit 52 home runs,
surpassing Babe Ruth's record 8.48 achieved in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said hitting home runs is getting pitches to hit,
keeping your stroke intact and working hard,'' he said, discussing
his fantastic finish. ``Home runs aren't easy to do. When you work
as hard as I've worked the last few years to really work on my
swing and get full extension, it's paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cardinals' first six games against the Expos, McGwire hit
one home run. Then came the deluge. In his last 11 at-bats, he hit
a home run, singled, struck out, struck out, hit a home run, flied
out to center field, hit a home run, grounded out to third base,
singled, hit a home run and (after walking) hit a home run. His
last two swings of his already legendary season produced home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' said Orlando Cabrera, the Expos' rookie
shortstop. ``Everything he hits goes out.'' Cabrera, who hit a home
run of his own in the third inning, congratulated McGwire as the
Cardinal slugger passed him in the seventh inning. ``I'll be able
to tell my kids I hit a home run the same day as McGwire hit his
70th,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thurman nor Pavano, the rookie pitchers, was distraught
over his contribution to baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, a 25-year-old right-hander, said he threw McGwire a
breaking ball, ``a bad breaking ball that most guys don't hit, up
and in.'' He added: ``Most guys take it or pop it up. He just
muscled it out. That's why he's so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman said he was not particularly happy about giving up the
home run. ``But to be part of something that's special is a good
feeling,'' he said. ``It's something I'll look back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman faced McGwire again in the fifth inning and walked him
on four pitches, the fourth making the 6-foot-5-inch batter duck as
the ball sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely out of gas,'' Thurman said. ``I think
everyone knows I wasn't trying to hit him. No one felt worse about
it than I did, coming in with a 3-0 fastball at his head. It could
have been pretty ugly. Fortunately, he got out of the way. I hope
he knows I wasn't doing it on purpose.'' It was, McGwire said, ``no
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went to bat in the seventh inning, the game was tied,
3-3, runners were at first and second, and Pavano was pitching.
Pavano, acquired from Boston last November in a trade for Pedro
Martinez, was making his first relief appearance of the season
after 23 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to pitch; I could've said no,'' the 22-year-old
right-hander said. ``It was my decision. If I had said no, I'm
done, they wouldn't have pitched me. But I said I could do it. I
don't have any regrets doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had never faced Pavano and decided to take a cue from
J.D. Drew, who batted just ahead of him and singled to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea how his ball moves,'' McGwire said. ``J.D. swung
at the first pitch, so I might as well be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would this veteran of 456 home runs, 69 this season, borrow
from a rookie who became a major leaguer the night McGwire broke
Maris' record?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to amuse yourself sometimes when you play this
game,'' McGwire said. ``I said if he's going to be aggressive, I
might as well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano threw a fastball up and in. ``I was going right after
him,'' Pavano said, then added, smiling, ``He came after me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said: ``I hammered down and got a lot of top hand on it,
and it carried just enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Like No. 62, it took off on a line rather than soaring high into
the sky, but it traveled about 30 feet farther than No. 62, an
estimated 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano knew instantly he had just given up McGwire's last home
run of a record season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' the pitcher said. ``I knew he didn't have any
at-bats left.'' Then he said: ``If you're going to give up a home
run, you might as well give it up to him. What he's accomplished
for baseball is unbelievable. I could see if he was cocky and had
an attitude about it, but he's so genuine. You can't be nothing but
happy for the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' 14th consecutive sellout crowd of 46,110 roared
and roared and roared some more after each home run, but especially
the second. Pavano noted that McGwire had fed off the fans. He also
profited financially from them.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance bonus in his contract _ $1 for each ticket sold
over 2.8 million _ provided McGwire an extra payday of $395,021.
But that is one bonus the Cardinals will be happy to pay.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was asked whether he thought someone would break his
record, assuming it remains the record after Sosa's bonus game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will stand for a while,'' he said. ``I know how
grueling it is to do what I've done this year. It will be broken
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Might he break it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to break my own record,'' McGwire said.
``I think I'd rather just leave it as is.''

`RUSH HOUR' COMFORTABLE IN WEEKEND BOX OFFICE DRIVER'S SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Action-comedy ``Rush Hour'' continued to speed
past rivals on its way to dominating the nation's box office with
an estimated $21.4 million at 2,643 theaters during the
Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend of the Chris Tucker-Jackie Chan vehicle
performed better than expected, particularly given competition from
Major League Baseball's regular season finale and the home-run
record drama between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-best weekend single-film take ever during
September-October _ usually one of the year's slowest moviegoing
periods _ following last weekend's record-setting $33 million
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. said ``Rush Hour'' has
succeeded because it meets audience expectations. ``When you hit
the genre right, you can make a lot of money,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' has taken in $64.4 million in 10 days and will
wind up with a final U.S. gross of $105 million, said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service, who
noted that the film took in an impressive $9.4 million on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty hefty number with so much interest in
baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Line distribution executive Al Shapiro said ``Rush Hour'' is
generating significant repeat business. ``It is performing well in
all markets and to all demographics,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' took in nearly the combined gross of its two
nearest rivals _ MGM's debut of spy thriller ``Ronin,'' with $12.3
million at 2,487 theaters, and Sony's opening of the latest
teen-screamer ``Urban Legend,'' with $11 million at 2,257 sites.
Analysts said both roll-outs performed in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Ronin' did pretty well considering that similar movies have
done poorly recently and all of MGM's financial problems,''
Bucksbaum said. ``The studio had a very solid marketing campaign
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Urban Legend,'' in which college students are menaced
by a serial killer, it became another success in the red-hot genre,
beloved by studios because of its low cost and solid returns.
``Urban Legend,'' with a $14 million price tag, follows the two
``Scream'' movies, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
``Halloween: H20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say `Urban Legend' certainly hit its target
audience,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the rest of the slate was comedy blockbuster ``There's
Something About Mary,'' now in its 11th week, with $4.5 million at
2,470 theaters. It lost only 20 percent from the previous weekend
despite direct competition from ``Rush Hour.'' Its overall take has
hit $153.3 million, making it the 56th-highest domestic grosser
ever after ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' edged the second weekend of Universal's family drama
``One True Thing,'' which took in $4.4 million at 1,625 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Simon Birch'' came in sixth, with
$2.7 million at 923 theaters, topping DreamWorks 10th weekend of
``Saving Private Ryan,'' with $2.6 million at 2,203 sites, and the
third weekend of Miramax's fast-fading ``Rounders,'' with $2.5
million at 2,188 sites. ``Saving Private Ryan has grossed $181.9
million after 66 days and is now the 32nd-highest domestic grosser
after ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's sixth weekend of ``Blade'' finished ninth with $2
million at 2,232 theaters, followed by Fox's ninth weekend of
``Ever After,'' with $1.3 million, and Disney's 13th weekend of
``Armageddon,'' with $875,000 at 1,128 theaters. `Armageddon'' has
a domestic gross of $197.1 million and ranks 26th on the all-time
U.S. list after ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine Line's limited opening of ``Pecker'' _ offbeat director
John Waters' look at a teen-age photographer who becomes the toast
of the New York art world _ generated lukewarm interest with
$555,000 at 184 theaters. Gramercy's debut of the comedy-thriller
``Clay Pigeons'' took in a solid $173,000 at only 19 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is near $5 billion and 12 percent ahead of
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' may lose out next weekend to DreamWorks' Oct. 2
opening of its computer-animated ``Antz,'' which has attracted
strong initial reviews. Also generating solid early interest is
Paramount's debut of its comedy ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' while
PolyGram has been promoting the opening of ``What Dreams May Come''
with Robin Williams for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like October will be very solid,'' Bucksbaum said,
noting that Disney's ``Beloved'' and New Line's ``Pleasantville''
should also perform well later in the month.

EDITORIAL: END OF AN ERA IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-EUROPE, GERMANY-VOTE, GERMANY-REACT,
GERMANY-KOHL.) 
(js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 28:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A German politician once said of Chancellor Helmut Kohl that if
he had been the Titanic, the iceberg would have sunk. So it seemed
for 16 years as Kohl barreled over one opponent after another to
lead Germany for longer than any man since Otto von Bismarck a
century ago. But the Kohl winning streak was broken Sunday, and
with it ended one of the most eventful and fateful periods in
postwar German and European history.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl deftly directed the peaceful re-unification of Germany,
helped fashion the political architecture for a united Europe and
led the way to economic cooperation on the continent and the
adoption of a common currency. In Germany itself, he instilled a
sense of confidence and accomplishment that helped overcome the
burden of Germany's role in World War II and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   German unification was Kohl's singular achievement, even if it
turned out to be one of the causes of his defeat. It is easy now to
look back on the absorption of East Germany as a smooth, peaceful
process. But as the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended in the
late 1980s, re-unification seemed fraught with peril for Germany
and for Europe. With the assistance of Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow
and George Bush in Washington, Kohl reunited the two Germanys
democratically and made his country the anchor of peace and
prosperity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The financial cost of propping up eastern Germany was far
greater than Kohl expected, and the sluggish growth and high
unemployment it produced in recent years fanned dissatisfaction
with Kohl. But after four terms, Kohl, who is 68, was defeated less
by specific complaints than by a desire for new, younger
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's departure portends no great change in Germany's relations
with Europe, the United States and the rest of the world. It may
not even mean much alteration in domestic policy, though power will
now pass to a more left-leaning government led by Gerhard Schroeder
and the Social Democratic Party. A radical student leader in the
1960s, Schroeder, 54, long ago found his place in the German
mainstream and campaigned as a pragmatic centrist.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest challenge will be to deal with the economic drag
produced by Germany's generous social welfare programs. Kohl
tinkered with the system by curtailing a few benefits, but
Schroeder showed no inclination during the campaign to reform the
long annual vacations, extended sick leave and other programs that
Germans consider to be their birthright. Schroeder also ought to
make Germany's immigrants feel more welcome and make it easier for
them to become citizens, an area in which Kohl often played to
nationalist sentiments. Political and financial power in Germany is
passing to a new generation. It will be measured against the Kohl
legacy.

ALBRIGHT PUSHES PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS ON STALLED ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd &AMP; 3rd grafs to add info on newly scheduled
Arafat-Netanyahu-Albright meeting; 9th graf, corrects percentage of
West Bank lands to be designated as nature reserves to 25 percent
from 3 percent; tightening and polishing throughout.)  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pushed on
Sunday for agreement on key details of a long-stalled peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and U.S. officials
said the White House hoped to announce concrete progress in the
peace talks when President Clinton meets with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that while an overall settlement is not imminent,
there had been sufficient progress to allow Albright to schedule a
joint meeting late Sunday night with Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, who are both in New York for the U.N.
General Assembly. It would be the first such three-way meeting in
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met separately with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
late Saturday night and again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the White House is eager to announce at
least a degree of progress on Monday, if only to show that U.S.
foreign policy has not been hobbled by the uproar over the
president's sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great interest in showing that we're not being
sidetracked by the circus in Washington,'' said a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We want to lock in key
elements of this agreement while all of the parties are still in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu suggested that he and
Arafat were still far from agreement on several issues, most
importantly the security arrangements for areas of the West Bank
that Israel would cede to the Palestinians under a new peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't have yet is the whole Palestinian side of this
equation,'' he said. ``How do they assure us the areas that we hand
over to them and have handed over to them do not become bases of
terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed that Clinton's ability to focus on foreign
policy _ and specifically on the Middle East peace effort _ had
suffered because of the scandal in Washington, Netanyahu replied,
``Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months without visible progress in the peace
process, Israel and the Palestinians are reported to be close to a
deal under which Israel would turn over 13 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians, with a quarter of that designated as nature
reserves to prevent Palestinian settlements. But several details
remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Time for further negotiations on U.S. soil has nearly run out.
Netanyahu is expected back in Israel Tuesday evening for the Yom
Kippur holy day. Despite the time constraints, diplomats involved
in the talks did not rule out the possibility that Arafat would
travel to Washington to meet with Netanyahu and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a deadline for the talks: May 4, when the
Oslo peace agreements that provide the framework expire. Arafat has
said that if there is no settlement by then, he will declare a
Palestinian state, a move that would outrage Israel. Netanyahu has
warned that a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state could
scuttle peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of a speech he delivered Sunday in New
York, Arafat was prepared to repeat the pledge. Without an
agreement by next May, ``We will have no choice but to unilaterally
declare the establishment of the Palestinian state,'' it said. ``We
do realize the implications and consequences of this on
Palestinian-Israeli relations as a whole and also on Arab-Israeli
and international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what may have been a concession to Israeli sensitivities
and a response to pressure from the United States, those lines were
dropped when Arafat delivered the speech, and he referred only
cryptically to the May deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community, all peace-loving people, must
exert every possible effort to insure the implementation of the
agreements by May 4, 1999,'' Arafat said in his speech, at the
Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a private
group. ``It just cannot come and go like any other day.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials are waiting anxiously to hear what
Arafat will say when he addresses the General Assembly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Arafat have not attempted to dampen speculation that he
will use the speech to criticize Netanyahu's government harshly and
to solicit support for his plans to declare
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Sunday, Arafat accused Netanyahu's government
of ``procrastination and evasion'' in the peace talks. ``This
Israeli government,'' he said, ``began to export blame to the
Palestinians and to export fear to Israelis in an obvious political
attempt aimed at undermining its obligations and agreements.''

SENATE CANDIDATE URGES REPUBLICANS TO TAKE LOW-KEY APPROACH TO
SCANDAL

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Taking a more moderate approach than most
Republicans, California State Controller Matt Fong said the GOP
should proceed cautiously against President Clinton to avoid a
potential backlash among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, with polls giving him a slight lead over Democratic U.S.
Sen. Barbara Boxer in their Nov. 3 election, said Sunday he also
would have preferred that the House Judiciary Committee had not
released so much information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans should exercise some prudence and judgment
or there could be an impact,'' Fong said, following a speech to the
California Republican Party convention. ``It could be very
difficult on all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I obviously am not there, I would have liked to see the
tapes (of President Clinton's grand jury testimony) go to members
of Congress first before it was made public. I recognize it could
have been leaked, but I would have taken that extra step.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong said that during his speeches he has tried to remain away
from the controversy involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not running against Bill Clinton,'' Fong said. ``I'm
running against Barbara Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he did not hesitate to use the issue in an attack on Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of her hypocrisy,'' Fong said. ``She's an
attack dog when it comes to those she opposed. When it came to
Republicans, like (Supreme Court Justice) Clarence Thomas or
(former Sen.) Bob Packwood, she was relentless. But when it comes
to her friends, there is a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Boxer has said she condemns Clinton's actions with
intern Monica Lewinsky and his failure to admit to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr said her campaign was not surprised by
Fong's comments Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, Matt Fong has shown the only thing he has to offer
the people of California is to be a sex critic,'' Behr said. ``He
clearly knows if he was ever to talk about the issues, he would
lose this election. He can't talk about choice, education or the
economy, because he's out of the mainstream on all those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong waged a strong attack against Boxer during his speech
Sunday, calling her ``an example of the 1960s liberal,'' as he
characterized himself as a ``21st century Republican looking to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her vision is bankrupt,'' Fong said. ``She is resorting to the
politics of fear. As we move to the next century, the Republican
Party will be about unity and hope in the state and the country. We
are not Asian-Americans or African-Americans. We are all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong said he and Boxer had different views on everything from
education to national defense, as he again proposed an expansion of
a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer dismisses this as `Star Wars,' '' Fong said.
``Well, this is not a movie with Darth Vader as the enemy and a
Death Star as a threat. This is about having a defense system than
can stop ballistic missiles fired by a terrorist or a rogue
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has questioned the need _ and cost _ for such a system at
a time when the Cold War has ended.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Fong, many Republicans feel encouraged about the
election because of Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Mike Schroeder said the party has $1.85 million to
spend on its get-out-the-vote efforts and has recruited some 80,000
volunteers around the state to work on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Fong was reluctant to criticize Clinton or Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor, Schroeder was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray Davis is attempting to embrace the money tree but not get
spattered by the stench from the White House,'' Schroeder said,
referring to Davis' use of Clinton's fund-raising prowess even as
he has mildly criticized the president.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Schroeder said the party needed to be aggressive this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never have as good an opportunity to win as now,''
Schroeder said.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hurricane Georges, rampaging again after earlier
devastating islands in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, slammed
into the seaside cities and resorts of the Gulf Coast on Sunday
night with rain-packed winds of up to 110 miles per hour and a sea
surge of 10 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Recharged after a three-day wander at 10 mph across the Gulf of
Mexico's tropical waters, the storm first began to move ashore
early Sunday evening with 50 mph winds at the leading edge. As the
night wore on, the winds grew stronger, blowing twice as hard near
the eye of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that the storm, one of the most dangerous to
hit the vulnerable, low-lying gulf region in many years, might not
move immediately inland if it collided with a high-pressure area to
the north. In that case, disaster experts said, there was the
possibility of catastrophic damage from a lingering pounding by
wind, rain and surf along the coastal strip that stretches for more
than 300 miles, from just east of Panama City in the Florida
Panhandle to just west of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the coastal region here is only a few feet above sea
level. And New Orleans, which is surrounded by levees, lies an
average of 6 feet below sea level. In the middle of the stretch, at
ground zero for the storm's eye, is Biloxi, Miss., a resort city
from which thousands of residents and visitors fled over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Early damage reports made no mention of deaths or injuries, but
they indicated that the marshes and barrier islands in the path of
the storm had been battered and that in the hours that followed,
cities, towns, and resort strips were already suffering, with
extensive power failures, large numbers of downed trees and
widespread damage to windows and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   On the northeast side of New Orleans, the storm surge in Lake
Ponchartrain was pushing water up against some levees, and now and
again a rogue wave crested over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The city has many pumps to handle water accumulated in its
streets and open spaces, including rain water. But the pumping
system was not designed to handle a huge amount, including a
massive overflow of levees by Lake Ponchartrain and sustained
downpours that could exceed 20 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any reports of deaths or injuries from the storm was
a testament, in part, to the fact that coastal residents were given
early warnings of the storm and told that those who could should
batten down or evacuate. An 86-year-old woman, however, died on
Sunday while being evacuated from a nursing home in Baton Rouge,
La., The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since it formed in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa a
couple of weeks ago, and started to blow west, Hurricane Georges
has caused more than 300 deaths, most in the Dominican Republic,
and has left more than 150,000 people homeless in Haiti. Damage
estimates range in the billions of dollars, with $2 billion of that
occurring in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a devastating storm,'' said James Lee Witt, head of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, as his teams prepared to move
into the Gulf Coast area once the hurricane moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of coastal residents fled northward in the
hours before the storm blew ashore, so many that on many highways,
cars, vans and trucks were bumper to bumper for miles on end.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others took refuge in schools, public buildings and
other shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Orleans, some 10,000 were housed in the hallways and
corridors of the Superdome, many spreading their blankets on the
concrete and doing what they could, with their books and puzzles
and bags of chips, to make the best of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before for football games, but this ain't no
game,'' said Demetrius Moody, an oil rig operator, as he slumped in
an end-zone seat in the sports arena, which can hold 69,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   In places along the coast where there were no levees to protect
people and property, the emergency authorities ordered residents to
evacuate. Most moved to higher ground with few, if any, complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And even in areas where evacuation was not mandatory, thousands
left anyway, heeding the words of Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans,
whose pre-storm mantra was: ``Our recommendation to people is to
go. We're in a state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter of downtown New Orleans _ where the
unofficial motto is ``Let the good times roll!'' and where the
streets are normally packed with noisy partygoers _ was nearly
abandoned in the hours just before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Plywood sheets covered windows and doors on Bourbon Street.
There was no whiff of Creole cooking, no pungent smell of coffee.
Most telling of all, even the bars that sell that most lethal of
alcoholic concoctions, the hurricane, were battened down.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR YANKS, ONLY 125 VICTORIES WILL DO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their spectacular season of 114 victories, the
Yankees were so talented, so deep, so much better than any other
American League team, it was as if they were on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, they need to be in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   They need what Manager Joe Torre calls ``the extra fire that
burns when it's important,'' beginning Tuesday night at Yankee
Stadium in the opener of their three-of-five-game American League
Division Series with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of never really having a crucial series or even a
crucial game, the Yankees now need to win three crucial series and
11 crucial games if they are to win 125 games and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If not, these Yankees will be remembered for not winning the
World Series (or not winning the AL Championship Series or not
winning the division series) rather than for winning the AL East
title. If not, their 114 victories will be remembered as a footnote
to a flop.
</P>
<P>
   For these Yankees, it's not that any one game is a must now. For
these Yankees, 125 victories are a must.
</P>
<P>
   History is ominous. After the 1906 Chicago Cubs won a record 116
games, they lost the World Series to the Hitless Wonder White Sox
in six games. After the 1954 Cleveland Indians won 111 games for
what was then AL record, they lost the World Series to the New York
Giants in four straight.
</P>
<P>
   In other sports, history has been kinder to dominant teams.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1972 Miami Dolphins streaked through an undefeated
season, they went on to win Super Bowl VII for a 17-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls won a record 72 games, they went
on to win their fourth of six championships in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Yankees need to go on to win what would be a
major-league-record 125 games. As if winning crucial games were a
light switch on a wall, can they suddenly turn it on now that the
playoffs are here?
</P>
<P>
   Torre, naturally, thinks his Yankees can turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was mentioned that the Yankees had not had a crucial
series or a crucial game all season, the manager remembered when
the Yankees won two in Seattle after losing four of their first
five games at Anaheim, Oakland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those wins in Seattle were a good signature for us,'' Torre
said, ``and then the way we came back in some games. Against the
Phillies when Tino Martinez hit two homers. Darryl Strawberry's
grand slam against Oakland. It showed we don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were isolated games against assorted opponents, not a
playoff series against a quality opponent like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win the West the way the Rangers did and not feel
good about yourself,'' Torre said. ``They beat the team they had to
beat, the Angels, five straight times. That's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre also remembers how the Rangers, with the slugger Juan
Gonzalez earning his Senor Octubre nickname, battled the Yankees in
their 1996 division series before losing, three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pitch,'' Torre said, ``Texas is going to score a
lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching matchups are David Wells-Todd Stottlemyre Tuesday
night and Andy Pettitte-Rick Helling on Wednesday night. When the
series resumes at the Ballpark in Arlington on Friday night, David
Cone will go against Aaron Sele, with Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez against John Burkett on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a fifth game on Sunday at Yankee Stadium, it would
presumably be Wells against Stottlemyre again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first round always scares me,'' Torre said, alluding to
last year's first-round loss to the Cleveland Indians. ``I felt
good last year with a 2-1 lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, who had qualified for last year's playoffs as
the wild-card team, were knocked out in five games.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees played a sloppy game in Tampa Bay recently,
Torre warned his players that they can't suddenly ``turn it on''
when the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game in Tampa,'' the manager said, ``we were doing things
we aren't supposed to be doing _ throwing to the wrong base, not
thinking out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees can't afford to do that now. That's why Torre is
already looking to how Wells and the Yankees perform early in
Tuesday night's opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we have a 1-2-3 first inning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, a 1-2-3 sweep of the division series.

KANELL IS NO LEAF, AND LEAF'S NO KANELL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It is all about relativity in the National Football
League, a week-to-week proposition, the ongoing search for someone
in a more vulnerable position than yourself. All things considered
Sunday, Danny Kanell could have been Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been faced with the burden of grand,
second-pick-of-the-draft expectations, along with a persistent pass
rush in front of opportunistic defensive backs. He could have set
himself up for ridicule the previous week by publicly conducting
himself like a jerk. He could have thrown four interceptions and
wound up being benched for someone named Craig Whelihan, a
development that drew a convulsive roar from the home-team crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, conversely, had one of those games when he plays well
enough, shows just enough, to make people believe the Giants can
dream on with him as the starter. Relative to Leaf, Kanell was the
epitome of poise and experience as the Giants defeated the San
Diego Chargers, 34-16, at Qualcomm Stadium by utilizing their, in
Kanell's words, ``formula for success.'' Just six days after
doomsday at home versus Dallas, a turnover-inducing defense plus
313 yards of adequate, balanced offense equaled a 2-2 record and a
share of first place in the extremely forgiving NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   As we said, this is week-to-week, particularly in the case of a
Giants offense that features Kanell. It is going to be a while, if
ever, before he isn't considered as good as his last series of
downs.
</P>
<P>
   What we can definitively say about Kanell is that he has thrown
no obscenity-laced tirades with inquisitive reporters, or footballs
at their heads, which Leaf was known for in college. This is what
passed for football talk here, following two rookie run-ins last
week by Leaf with local sports journalists, the first of which
produced apologies by Leaf and the Chargers. Somehow, after three
professional games, Leaf had managed to estrange himself from a
typically docile audience that had welcomed him to town as the
quarterback who would be king.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations are almost impossible for him to live up
to,'' said Kanell, one young quarterback empathizing with another.
``I know everything he's going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Leaf's double-edged sword is one Kanell has not had to
juggle, under Jim Fassel's protective cocoon. No one, least of all
his coach, has demanded eminence from this 1996 fourth-round draft
pick who last season made everyone happy by simply relieving Dave
Brown, the Giants' own failed quarterback savior. ``Manage the
game,'' became Fassel's mantra regarding Kanell, one he has, at
times, carried a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who had said they were determined to come in here
and establish a running game for the first time this season, more
or less abandoned that line after their opening three-and-out
series. Next time out, Kanell threw the ball, incomplete, on first
down, but proceeded to drive the Giants 70 yards for a touchdown.
Of particular note, he completed three third-down passes for first
downs, two of them for a combined 36 yards to the slippery Ike
Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the second quarter, Kanell had hit Chris
Calloway for a 25-yard touchdown and driven the Giants 61 yards for
another touchdown and a 21-0 lead. Leaf, meanwhile, had thrown
interceptions on three straight possessions, the last two setting
up the Giants' second and third touchdowns. One came in the teeth
of a ferocious rush. Another ball was tipped at the line of
scrimmage. The Chargers, two season-opening victories
notwithstanding, are not very good. But then, cocky young
quarterbacks with big-money contracts are supposed to work magic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Leaf permanently took his team out of the game,
telegraphing a third-quarter pass across the middle that the
Giants' free safety, Percy Ellsworth, picked off and returned 20
yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride, who summoned
Whelihan from the bullpen. The fans cheered, louder when Whelihan
threw a touchdown on his first series. Later, they booed a
commercial with Leaf on the large viewer screen. Then they booed
Leaf's public service announcement during the fourth quarter, by
which time he was on the sideline being consoled by an offensive
guard named Aaron Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan's learned a lot this last week,'' Taylor said. ``I think
he's ready to accept responsibility and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, at least, ready to seek a more humble place than he did
last week, when he completed one pass for 4 yards against Kansas
City, and didn't want to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of feels like somebody rips your heart out of your
chest,'' he said. ``I wanted to succeed so much, and then I went
out and lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sad-eyed, contrite. ``You've got to look at yourself and
kind of wonder if you're good enough to play at this level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is a strapping kid, 6 feet 5 inches, who did throw some
very good balls. Peyton Manning has not exactly torn up the league
either. It is very early, and maybe this embarrassment was a good,
hard lesson that will lead Leaf to a better place. Kanell was much
better Sunday, but don't make the Giants answer the question of
whether they would trade Kanell for Leaf, attitude and all. They
know nice guys don't necessarily finish first in the end.

BATTING TITLE FOR WILLIAMS, WITH FREE AGENCY AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams came into the season fearful that his
impending free agency might be a distraction. It appears to have
been more of a motivation. Williams went 2-for-2 Sunday, improved
his batting average to .339 and won the American League batting
title.
</P>
<P>
   Williams began the day leading Boston's Mo Vaughn by only .33602
to .33553. Before the Yankees' game started, Vaughn grounded out in
Boston's home game against Baltimore, lowering his average to
.3349.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn homered in his second at-bat, singled in his third at-bat
and made an out his fourth time up, leaving his average at .3366;
it was determined that Vaughn would have to play into extra innings
to catch Williams, who had two singles and a sacrifice fly. ``I
really made a great effort to try to not let it bother me,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this information was relayed to Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, who then decided to remove Williams in the bottom of the
sixth inning. Once the Yankees made their move, Vaughn was taken
out of the Red Sox lineup, a concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great, absolutely,'' Williams said. ``It's such a
great feeling when you add your name to the list of players who've
accomplished this feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre Announces Roster
</P>
<P>
   Torre finalized his division series roster after Sunday's game,
telling Darren Holmes he had picked Graeme Lloyd for the 10-man
pitching staff instead of Holmes (who did not wait to speak to
reporters). The other pitchers: David Wells, Andy Pettitte, David
Cone, Orlando Hernandez, Hideki Irabu, Mike Stanton, Mariano
Rivera, Jeff Nelson and Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, too, was told he was on the team, after he
pounded his third grand slam in 10 days. After Spencer homered
Sunday, he had seven home runs in his last 26 at-bats, and he
appeared stunned by his binge. ``That'll probably never happen
again,'' said Spencer, whose three grand slams match the career
total for Torre, who played 18 seasons. ``Just to get the chance _
I was pretty excited this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is torn by his choices for a starting left fielder. He
could go with experience, Darryl Strawberry or Tim Raines. Or he
could go with his hottest bat, Spencer. Torre may wait until
Tuesday before he decides. ``I'm not sure,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Yankees' position players: catchers Joe Girardi and
Jorge Posada, infielders Tino Martinez, Derek Jeter, Chuck
Knoblauch, Scott Brosius, Homer Bush and Luis Sojo and outfielders
Paul O'Neill, Williams, Chad Curtis, Spencer, Raines and

UNDERACHIEVING DODGERS SAY GOOD-BYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They promised they would stay in touch, but after
looking at each other for the past eight months, the Dodgers
players sensed something much more final than just the end of a
long season.
</P>
<P>
   So they dressed quickly after Sunday's 2-1 victory over the
Milwaukee Brewers, leaving behind a few bats and wrist bands for
the clubhouse guys and a trail of disappointment for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In the splendid summer of Sosa and McGwire, the Dodgers finished
83-79, which doesn't sound so bad unless you factor in the gross
underachievement of a team with a $61 million payroll. If not for
the seemingly daily off-field turmoil, or a blockbuster trade for
the ages, the Dodgers might not have been heard from at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a bright side, it is knowing that a season like
this will never happen again,'' first baseman Eric Karros said.
``We can go into next season knowing that the team won't be sold
and the front office won't be overhauled. I'd say right there we're
off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   By beating the Brewers on Sunday, Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park
won a career-high 15th game. The Dodgers also finished over .500
for the fifth consecutive year. To do it, they went 15-9 in
September when the games didn't matter, although they weren't
officially eliminated from the National League wild-card race until
Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed eight hits and one run in six innings, struck out
seven and walked two. Roger Cedeno hit his second home run on the
homestand, but don't be fooled into thinking he will be anywhere
near the Dodgers starting lineup next year. Those were his only two
hits in 24 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard, who needed to go 3 for 3 on Sunday to reach
.300, went 1 for 4. But his double to open the sixth off Brewers
starter Bill Pulsipher (3-4) led to the eventual winning run. He
scored on a sacrifice fly by Mark Grudzielanek, who established
himself as the Dodgers shortstop after coming over from Montreal on
July 31 with Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   It was moves like that trade and the Mike Piazza deal that were
expected to jump start the Dodgers in 1998. Instead, the team was
25-27 after the trade with Montreal. Interestingly, the Houston
Astros, who won the NL Central, went 37-16 after acquiring Randy
Johnson from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Park's victory didn't convince anyone that the Dodgers don't
need to acquire a No.1 starter next season who can help stabilize a
young rotation. Johnson is a free agent. So is the Padres' Kevin
Brown. And offensively the team was last in the National League in
on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Those are issues that will be addressed this winter by new
general manager Kevin Malone, who must maneuver with $53 million
already guaranteed to 12 players next season.
</P>
<P>
   Another is closer Jeff Shaw, the midseason acquisition who
pitched the ninth inning Sunday to record his 25th save with the
Dodgers and 48th overall. He can demand a trade because he came
from Cincinnati in the middle of a multi-year contract. Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest faces Sunday belonged to manager Glenn Hoffman and
his coaching staff, whose fates will be decided within the next few
days. Hoffman is not expected to be back. The Dodgers went 46-41
after he replaced fired Bill Russell on June 22, but with the quick
front-office moves by Malone the past few weeks, it seems Hoffman
never was expected to be more than a caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been difficult season for everyone,'' Hoffman said.
``But you have to look at the positives. We got to see Adrian
Beltre. Pitchers like Chan Ho and Brian Bohanon stepped up. And I
will never have anything bad to say about the effort these guys
gave me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers never seemed to recover from the May 15 trade
that sent Piazza and Todd Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Gary
Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich.
Bonilla still was not recovered from offseason surgery and Johnson
did not play up to his All-Star status. Sheffield was an impressive
offensive player, but like Piazza, was not a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade also acted as an escape hatch in the clubhouse. As
San Diego was running away with the National League West, there was
the booming voice of Bonilla saying: ``You don't understand what a
trade like this can do to a team. It takes time to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, it never did.

YANKEES' GLITTERING REGULAR SEASON IS A MERE PRELUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Videotaped memories from the 1996 World Series filled
the refrigerator-sized television screen in the players' lounge
Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium: Jim Leyritz hitting the pivotal
home run, the large dark eyes of Yankees manager Joe Torre glazed
with tears after the final out. Two years later, the Yankees will
pursue another World Series title, which would be the
organization's 24th.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is the same, but the stakes are higher: the Yankees
will play for their place in history. They thumped Tampa Bay, 8-3,
Sunday and finished the regular season with 114 victories and 48
defeats. Only one other team in one other year won more
regular-season games, the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who compiled a record
of 116-36.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs lost the World Series that season. Should the
Yankees get past Texas in the division series that starts Tuesday,
win the American League Championship Series and then the World
Series, the title would follow one of the greatest regular-season
performances. They could be called baseball's best team. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose in the playoffs or the World Series, however, they
will be forgotten, in the same way time has forgotten the 1969
Baltimore Orioles, the 1954 Cleveland Indians, the 1988 Oakland As
_ all exceptional regular-season teams that did not win in October.
Losing in the World Series, Reggie Jackson suggested two months
ago, reduces any great regular season to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the World Series, Torre said Sunday, ``would add on to
it, when you can add on to what we've done already.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would be a terrific disappointment to lose,'' he said.
``But you have to understand something: We're going in with 114
wins, Texas is going in with less than that. Either one of us who
doesn't go beyond this first round is going to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner: ``Now
we've got to get ready for the war. We've just been in a battle up
to now. I think there's a quality about this team. They're
warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the other day that regardless of what occurs in the
next four weeks, the Yankees' regular season had been filled with
achievements and moments that would not be forgotten. Bernie
Williams went 2-for-2 Sunday and clinched the batting title with a
.339 average, and Shane Spencer, the Yankees' late-season comet,
hammered his third grand slam in 10 days. It was his seventh homer
in 26 at-bats. David Wells pitched a perfect game in May, Scott
Brosius drove in 98 runs, Derek Jeter accumulated 203 hits, David
Cone won 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees opened with three consecutive losses but finished
with seven consecutive victories. In between, Cuban defector
Orlando Hernandez wept at the end of his long journey to the big
leagues and then won 12 games, Darryl Strawberry revitalized his
career, and the Yankees brawled with Baltimore. They wrapped up a
playoff spot earlier than any other team, and on that day, they did
not realize they had clinched. When they stumbled in September,
Torre angrily challenged them to push themselves, and the Yankees
responded.
</P>
<P>
   They led the league in runs scored, allowed the fewest runs,
ranked third in fielding percentage, second in stolen bases. Ten
players, including Spencer, hit 10 or more home runs, tying a
major-league record. The Yankees' record was 102-1 when they are
leading after eight innings, a reflection of their bullpen. They
won the AL East by 22 games, the largest margin in club history.
</P>
<P>
   They played hard. They always did.
</P>
<P>
   Their postseason will define what is remembered 50 years from
now. After six months and 162 games, four weeks of playoffs will
determine what is remembered about the '98 Yankees. Success in the
postseason, Williams said, ``is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we've been looking forward to since we got to spring
training,'' he said. ``We never knew how far we were going to get _
we knew that if we played hard, we'd get into a position to be
where we're at. Although it's been a very special year for me, and
the team individually, we're still looking ahead. We still have
some work we need to do, and we're looking forward to the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Tessmer is 26, a longtime minor-league pitcher, soft-spoken
and earnest, a native of Meadville, Pa. The Yankees' early season
rainouts and late-summer injuries created a need for a right-handed
reliever, and Tessmer was promoted from Class AAA to make his
major-league debut on Aug. 27. He remembers Mike Stanton welcoming
him to the bullpen that night, telling him to simply concentrate on
what he did well, encouraging him; and he remembers how, when he
was credited with the victory that day, all of the veterans
congratulated him warmly, as if he had been around the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this club's legacy belongs to Tessmer, but that
legacy will be shaped in the playoffs. He knows he will probably
not pitch in the postseason, and preparing for his likely
departure, he packed an equipment bag Sunday, saving a space for
his Yankees jersey, No. 62. ``I want my jersey,'' he said, laughing
a bit. ``I don't know if I have to pay for it, but I'm taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has thought about the days when he can hand a framed picture
of the 1998 Yankees to one of his grandchildren and point to that
serious-looking young man with the protruding ears standing in the
second row of the team picture, between David Cone and Luis Sojo.
That was me, Tessmer might say. That is me.
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer, Williams, Cone. They all could live forever in their
own corridor of history. The stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 49,608 attended the final regular-season game at
Yankee Stadium on Sunday, giving the Yankees a total attendance of
2,949,734 _ a club record, but short of the 3 million figure George
Steinbrenner said would prompt discussions about the team staying
in the Bronx.

 &HT;    Clinton speaks for Mauro at candidate's fund-raisers

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ A friend in need turned to a friend in deep
turmoil on Sunday, as a Democrat fighting for a chance teamed up
with a Democrat fighting for his job.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro, in deep need of campaign
cash for his uphill race against Republican Gov. George W. Bush,
and President Clinton, who saw roadside signs of discontent along
the motorcade route here, made stops in San Antonio and Houston to
raise about $1 million for the Mauro campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the old friends, it was a mixed reaction kind of day. At the
homes of wealthy lawyers in the two cities, Texas Democrats rallied
to support their beleaguered president and underdog gubernatorial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Clinton and Mauro saw a Sunday afternoon
display of discontent. As they drove to Frank Herrera's house for
the San Antonio event, they passed hundreds of protesters and
supporters. The former far outnumbered the latter.
</P>
<P>
   At one corner, a lone Mauro sign was encircled by scores of
anti-Clinton placards, including one that said, ``Liar, liar, pants
on fire'' and another that said: ``Pervert. Go home to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Don Free of San Antonio tried to calm a crying infant on
his back as the leader of the free world approached. ``Shhhh,''
Free told daughter Maria. ``Here comes the bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro knew sentiments might run high, but said he never had
second thoughts about bringing Clinton to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from my friends,'' he said while awaiting Air
Force One. ``He's a friend. He's a friend when he is up in the
polls. He's a friend when he is down in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   At Herrera's home, former Gov. Ann Richards put it more bluntly.
``Bill Clinton isn't the first man I've had to forgive, and he
probably won't be the last,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, laughing, retorted, ``I want to thank my friend Ann
Richards for finding ways to say things that no one else can say to
make the point no one can misunderstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 200 and 300 people showed up at Herrera's home,
including 40 who paid the top price of $5,000, according to Mauro
spokesman Billy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also found friendly faces along the route. After the
event, the motorcade stopped twice near Herrera's home so Mauro and
the president could pose for photos with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By showing up Sunday, Clinton showed he is standing by a friend
not at the zenith of his political career. The most recent Texas
Poll, completed in August, gave Bush a 47-point lead, an edge
almost as remarkable as the fundraising margin he enjoys. In
mid-July, the most recent reporting deadline, the Bush campaign
said it had $14 million on hand. Mauro's campaign said it had
$220,000.
</P>
<P>
   At Herrera's home, Clinton drew an enthusiastic response with a
speech heavy on national-level issues and devoid of any mention of
Bush, a top contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened with a personal note.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, many of you whom I've already met have said some
wonderful things to me about my family, and I thank you for that,''
said Clinton. ``You know, it's easy to forget in Washington, but
presidents and their families are still people, and it meant more
to me than you'll ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Mauro must battle a general attitude, fueled by a
strong economy, of ``well, things are going well, why do
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our enemy is not adversity,'' said the president. ``Look at
this crowd. Feel your own enthusiasm. Remember what many of you
said to me today. Adversity is our friend. It forces us to dig
deep, to ask ourselves what we believe in, what kind of people we
are, what kind of people we want to be, where we want to go and
what we want to do with our lives. Adversity is our friend. Our
enemies are complacency and cynicism. Those are our enemies, and
don't misunderstand it.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Clinton, Mauro blasted Bush as a do-nothing
governor. ``George Bush hasn't done squat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes insisted the governor has done
squat. ``The vast majority of Texans know better and will show
Garry Mauro that on Nov. 3,'' she said of the challenger's charge.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time on the campaign trail, Mauro launched a
mild salvo at Bush's past, a past that the governor has said
involved a period when he was ``young and irresponsible.'' Bush
said he quit drinking in 1986 after a 40th birthday party that
convinced him alcohol was getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is a decent man from a decent family, but George
Bush thinks life begins at 41,'' Mauro said. ``Except for throwing
out a few baseballs at Rangers' games, he's been coasting all his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the events, Mauro said the prepared line was based on
Bush's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just joking about how he talks about he was young and
irresponsible, and you never know exactly when the cutoff is. And
all he ever talks about is he quit drinking at 40, so I guess
that's when he stopped being irresponsible,'' said Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   The joke was not appreciated by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before (age 41) he graduated from college, graduated from
business school, flew fighter jets, built and oil and gas business,
assembled partners and bought a baseball team,'' said Hughes. Bush
served as managing general partner of the Texas Rangers prior to
running for governor in 1994.

his back as the leader of the free world approached. ``Shhhh,''
Free told daughter Maria. ``Here comes the bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro knew sentiments might run high, but said he never had
second thoughts about bringing Clinton to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from my friends,'' he said while awaiting Air
Force One. ``He's a friend. He's a friend when he is up in the
polls. He's a friend when he is down in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   At Herrera's home, former Gov. Ann Richards put it more bluntly.
``Bill Clinton isn't the first man I've had to forgive, and he
probably won't be the last,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, laughing, retorted, ``I want to thank my friend Ann
Richards for finding ways to say things that no one else can say to
make the point no one can misunderstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 200 and 300 people showed up at Herrera's home,
including 40 who paid the top price of $5,000, according to Mauro
spokesman Billy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also found friendly faces along the route. After the
event, the motorcade stopped twice near Herrera's home so Mauro and
the president could pose for photos with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By showing up Sunday, Clinton showed he is standing by a friend
not at the zenith of his political career. The most recent Texas
Poll, completed in August, gave Bush a 47-point lead, an edge
almost as remarkable as the fundraising margin he enjoys. In
mid-July, the most recent reporting deadline, the Bush campaign
said it had $14 million on hand. Mauro's campaign said it had
$220,000.
</P>
<P>
   At Herrera's home, Clinton drew an enthusiastic response with a
speech heavy on national-level issues and devoid of any mention of
Bush, a top contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened with a personal note.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, many of you whom I've already met have said some
wonderful things to me about my family, and I thank you for that,''
said Clinton. ``You know, it's easy to forget in Washington, but
presidents and their families are still people, and it meant more
to me than you'll ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Mauro must battle a general attitude, fueled by a
strong economy, of ``well, things are going well, why do
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our enemy is not adversity,'' said the president. ``Look at
this crowd. Feel your own enthusiasm. Remember what many of you
said to me today. Adversity is our friend. It forces us to dig
deep, to ask ourselves what we believe in, what kind of people we
are, what kind of people we want to be, where we want to go and
what we want to do with our lives. Adversity is our friend. Our
enemies are complacency and cynicism. Those are our enemies, and
don't misunderstand it.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Clinton, Mauro blasted Bush as a do-nothing
governor. ``George Bush hasn't done squat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes insisted the governor has done
squat. ``The vast majority of Texans know better and will show
Garry Mauro that on Nov. 3,'' she said of the challenger's charge.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time on the campaign trail, Mauro launched a
mild salvo at Bush's past, a past that the governor has said
involved a period when he was ``young and irresponsible.'' Bush
said he quit drinking in 1986 after a 40th birthday party that
convinced him alcohol was getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is a decent man from a decent family, but George
Bush thinks life begins at 41,'' Mauro said. ``Except for throwing
out a few baseballs at Rangers' games, he's been coasting all his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the events, Mauro said the prepared line was based on
Bush's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just joking about how he talks about he was young and
irresponsible, and you never know exactly when the cutoff is. And
all he ever talks about is he quit drinking at 40, so I guess
that's when he stopped being irresponsible,'' said Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   The joke was not appreciated by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before (age 41) he graduated from college, graduated from
business school, flew fighter jets, built and oil and gas business,
assembled partners and bought a baseball team,'' said Hughes. Bush
served as managing general partner of the Texas Rangers prior to
running for governor in 1994.

ON BASEBALL: THE METS' PATHETIC CONCLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BBN-METS-BRAVES) 
(mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets' last stand in 1998 was no stand at
all. It was a pathetic conclusion to what could, and should, have
been something much more memorable. The final week of the season
deteriorated, from the Mets standing above the wild-card world six
days ago to the Mets stumbling, sitting, kneeling and finally
expiring Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One peek at distraught manager Bobby Valentine sitting inside a
cramped office with gray cinderblock walls revealed just as much as
``Braves 7, Mets 2'' on the scoreboard at Turner Field. Valentine
chewed on a pen cap, picked his teeth with it and doodled on a pink
message pad as he was repeatedly asked how the Mets let such a
promising ride come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a time when the Mets reflect on the positives that
emerged from this draining season, but they should not even try to
do that now, or even next month. Not after they caved in quickly
and decisively to Greg Maddux Sunday and finished with five
straight losses, all of them in crucial games. The Mets should
ponder just what they forfeited. Ponder it for a long time, as
Valentine undoubtedly will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season didn't end a week ago,'' Valentine said. ``We had a
job to do, and we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not even close. At a time when one defeat was enough for
fans to chew their cuticles and a very confident manager to turn
more somber, the Mets somehow sputtered five times. It was
inexplicable and inexcusable, but it was explainable. The Mets
managed just 10 runs in two games with the Expos and three with the
Braves, stranding 46 runners; they made silly mistakes, like Jay
Payton's base-running blunder Friday night, and some of Valentine's
decisions failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the five most important games of the season, the Mets turned
into the Arizona Diamondbacks. They performed like a shabby team
and they had shabby timing. Especially with the Cubs and Giants
both losing Sunday, meaning a victory would have given the Mets new
life and a playoff game at Shea Stadium Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in our hands,'' Al Leiter said. ``We controlled our own
destiny, and we didn't do it. Everybody in this room should put the
blame on themselves. We should have all been a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentine. The Mets were in a desperate situation in which
they had to win, and both the Giants and the Cubs had to lose to
force a three-way tie, so Valentine wondered what he could have
done differently. Once Atlanta scorched Armando Reynoso Sunday for
five runs in two innings, Valentine had more time to question
himself, and he even conceded, startlingly, that he should have
started Hideo Nomo. Nomo followed Reynoso and did not permit a run
in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomo was throwing real well,'' Valentine said. ``I probably
should have started him. We talked about it. He didn't think it was
the right thing for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? Since when does Valentine let the pitcher dictate if
he should start a game? If Valentine really felt that Nomo would
have been a better choice than Reynoso, he should have made the
call. That was the only time Valentine criticized himself, but he
sounded as if he had second-guessed every decision, from which
pinch-runner he used to which color ink he used on the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``My frustration is I should have done something about it,''
said Valentine, his gray hair tousled, his pants unbuckled and his
brown eyes in a trance. ``Everything I tried didn't work. I should
have done something. I wish I did something.''
</P>
<P>
   The helpless feeling is one that will not and should not go
away. The Mets should use it next season as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a nothing feeling,'' Valentine said. ``There is no
feeling right now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps the Mets were more realistic or less caring than
Valentine, but no players were as morose. Brian McRae picked up the
remote control in the silent clubhouse and actually flipped on the
Cubs-Astros game. Turk Wendell walked around with a pile of
T-shirts declaring the Mets the 1998 wild-card team, shirts he
tried to hide. Despite the painful and incorrect message, John
Franco asked Wendell for a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need something to clean my car with,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine needed to get out of the crowded office or he might
have eaten the pen cap or started crying. The manager started many
answers by saying ``I don't know'' before giving slow, choppy
responses. He looked and sounded bewildered and said the only thing
he was going to do was drink, eat and phone his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plans to analyze anything,'' Valentine said. ``I
have no plans right now. My only plan was to go to New York and
play tomorrow. I don't have a plan right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Mets. And it is their own fault, five times over.

Kosovo, where he and his five children and 70-year-old father have
sought refuge, to find his next-door neighbor's property still
burning after being torched by Serbian forces. Kryeziu's own house
was also burned by the Serbs. This adds to the tally of more than
200 villages described by European Union monitors as moderately or
severely damaged since the Serb offensive began in late July. (Wade

the 1980s ABC hit show ``Thirtysomething,'' will create four new
television series for a share in the shows' future profits instead
of upfront fees. ``This seems to be the trend. In making this deal,

McGwire, Sosa, Maris and Ruth is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

(js) 
 BY GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Seventy is such an awesome number. Just awesome. The
idea that anybody could club his way past Babe Ruth, past Roger
Maris, past the pressures, past any reasonable expectation, is just
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   It just is not that easy to swat home runs over the fence,
except when Mark McGwire's personal batting-practice pitcher, Dave
McKay, is on the mound, a couple of hours before game time. But the
big man kept swinging, and the balls kept going over the fence, in
clusters, five on the last weekend alone.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire captivated the people watching his own games, and he
galvanized other ball parks, like the Astrodome, where the news
here of his home runs brought a hometown-style buzz from
Houstonians. And he finished with a total so high that only he and
his new best friend, Sammy Sosa, had predicted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, Mark is the man,'' Sosa reminded everybody, his
eyes aglow with respect, after his Chicago Cubs had lived to play
again Monday in a special playoff with San Francisco, in which he
could theoretically add to his own awesome total of 66. For months
now, McGwire and Sosa had pushed each other toward the old limits,
had recognized each other as comrades. The whole baseball world
recognized something good in the way they saluted each other.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought Sosa was playing mind games when he deferred
to McGwire, but he was merely reflecting the gut knowledge of the
arena, the way baseball players always knew Mickey Mantle was ``the
man'' in his league and Willie Mays was ``the man'' in his league,
way back when. McGwire was almost expected to challenge 60, 61, 62
this season, and he did it first. Then Sosa roared right along with
him.
</P>
<P>
   People looking for trouble began to see some form of American
benign neglect when, days after McGwire had done it, Sosa passed
Ruth and Maris with somewhat less pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he detected any pattern of racism, Sosa, a dark-skinned
man from the Dominican Republic, denied it emphatically, saying:
``Come on, man. It's 1998.'' He plays in the city of Michael
Jordan. He's not living a few decades in the past. His words should
be the last on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday afternoon, McGwire had spoken twice with his bulging
muscles and his aggressive mind and his big bat, had left a record
that will last forever _ or at least 11 months and change. Now the
big man was packing for a vacation with his 10-year-old son,
Matthew, up in St. Louis, but the baseball kept getting better and
better.
</P>
<P>
   In the last hours and minutes of what should have been the end
of the regular season, two teams a third of a continent apart
staged a pitch-by-pitch struggle just to stay alive, to try to win
something called the wild card. This had been the season of the
home run, the most easily marketable commodity in baseball. Big man
swings bat. Ball flies over fence. Everybody gets it. Babe Ruth
invented the home run. Now Mark McGwire has refined it. But always,
even when the ball is not flying out of some artificial dome or
rickety relic or retro palace, the game is not merely about home
runs, as exciting as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is about old-fashioned scoreboards, like the one here,
electronic instead of tin numbers fitted into slots, but with all
games listed at all times, inning by inning _ not some idiot
message board hawking fizzy water instead of the real product, the
game itself.
</P>
<P>
   On this scoreboard, runs are posted in yellow numbers until the
inning ended. The fans could follow the Yankees' 114th victory of
the season, the second highest total in major-league history. The
fans could follow a kid named Roy Halladay with Toronto, pitching a
no-hitter until two outs in the ninth. The fans could follow Mark
McGwire's own personal yellow numbers. But the real action was in
Colorado and here.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the ancient franchises, the Giants and the Cubs, teams
with roots back to the 19th century, were tied going into the last
day. The team of John McGraw and Frankie Frisch, now located in San
Francisco, was playing in Colorado. The team of Hack Wilson and
Ernie Banks was playing here in the shabby old erstwhile Eighth
Wonder of the World, a doomed dome.
</P>
<P>
   They went back and forth, on their fields, on the scoreboards,
on the televisions, on the radios, on the Internet, on little
electronic gadgets, pitch by pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was the central figure, starting the game two homers behind
McGwire, soon four behind. His first time up, Sosa did the
responsible thing and rapped a run-scoring single to center. Later
he singled up the middle and stole second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be patient, to help the team,'' Sosa said later.
</P>
<P>
   His home runs and his engaging personality have obscured his old
reputation for being a mediocre right fielder, at best. Maybe Babe
Ruth in his early years would have caught the line drive by Carl
Everett in the 11th inning; Roger Maris in his prime would have run
it down. Sosa had it fall a step between him and the fence, for a
triple. Two batters later, the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Superman can catch that ball,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   This warm and alert man has been a blessing in this year of the
home run. Now he received a blessing in return. As he trooped up
the stairs from the field, he heard a whooping in the clubhouse. In
this season of the home run, a Colorado player named Neifi Perez
had beaten the Giants. Mark McGwire is on vacation; Sammy Sosa has
another game. The season of the home run is not quite over.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol Kay, a professor of 18th-century literature and culture at
the University of Pittsburgh, died on Sept. 12 at Montefiore
Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was aplastic anemia, said her husband, Jonathan Arac.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kay wrote ``Political Constructions'' (Cornell University
Press, 1988), which examined the political history, moral
philosophy and fiction between the English civil war and the French
Revolution. Claudia Johnson, a professor of English at Princeton
University, called the book ``one of this generation's most
important studies of 18th-century fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kay graduated from Radcliffe College in 1967 and received
her PhD from Harvard University in 1975. From 1973 to 1979 she
taught English at Princeton. She held faculty appointments at
Amherst College, at Washington University in St. Louis and at New
York University. In 1989 she became an associate professor of
English at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kay is survived by her husband and by her brother, Jeffrey
Kay of Takoma Park, Md.

EDITORIAL: SHARKS IN THE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Alfonse D'Amato, who represents New York in the U.S. Senate,
appears to be planning a re-election campaign aimed at increasing
the tensions and distrust between New York's residents. That is a
remarkable conception of what it means to be a statewide elected
official.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's latest television ads against his Democratic opponent,
Rep. Charles Schumer, claim that because Schumer comes from
Brooklyn, he ``doesn't think upstate New York matters.'' Meanwhile,
the state Republican Party is running similar commercials that
depict New York City politicians as sharks, swimming up the Hudson
to steal money from helpless upstate taxpayers. ``They're back,''
says an announcer to music from the movie ``Jaws.'' ``New York City
liberals have plans for higher taxes and higher spending, and you
know what that means _ higher taxes for us, more spending for
them.'' The Republicans are playing to a suspicion, long encouraged
by upstate politicians, that the city is a drain on their economy,
gobbling up far more than its share of resources. In truth, the
city has been the economic engine for the state, and the real
beneficiaries of an imbalance between taxes and spending are the
small rural towns upstate, which are extremely dependent on state
jobs and state aid paid for by all New York taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   No one should begrudge helping these needy towns, and if the
political culture of New York were not so impaired, the state would
have long since resolved some of the problems that have kept it
lagging behind most of the rest of the country in job growth. But
the mutual distrust between upstate New Yorkers and New York City
is a political cancer that has laid waste to the state's
government. The Legislature flounders perpetually because its
members believe they were sent to Albany to champion their regions
rather than work for the well-being of the entire state. Lawmakers
have never been able to agree on sacrifice for the common good
because in New York's warped political culture there is no common
good, only a never-ending struggle to grab more for your own side.
</P>
<P>
   The governor serves as the only real symbol of a unified New
York, and it is incredible that Gov. George Pataki, the party's
standard-bearer, would allow his party to run ads that aim at
turning one part of the state against another. Pataki is well ahead
in the polls and nurtures national ambitions, and his own ads are
mainly feel-good paeans to his virtues. He cannot really believe he
needs to run against New York City in order to be re-elected, but
he cannot dodge responsibility for divisive commercials that are
being paid for by his party on behalf of his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the ``liberal New York City politicians'' card upstate
is an easy dodge that transfers voter discontent away from local
politicians and dumps it on a scapegoat far away. D'Amato did not
invent the tactic, but he is perhaps the first official who
actually represents New York City residents to use it against his
own constituents.

EDITORIAL: THE YEAR OF THE HITTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The baseball playoffs begin Tuesday, which leaves far too little
time to savor the manifold pleasures of a regular season that seems
disinclined to leave the stage. The season will not, in fact,
officially end until Monday night, when the Cubs and Giants play an
extra game to determine the National League's wild-card team. The
Yankee manager, Joe Torre, called it ``the best year I've been
involved with, and it was at the proper time'' _ by which he meant
that this summer's heroics may finally have restored the game of
baseball to its rightful place at or near the top of the U.S.
sporting pyramid, and laid to rest the sullen memories of the
strike-ridden seasons of 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre is right, the hitters are primarily responsible. This
has been the year of the booming bat, with balls soaring to left,
right, center and plain out of sight. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
both of whom broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 home runs,
battled for the home-run prize until the very last weekend, when
McGwire settled the issue by belting four homers in two days for a
mind-boggling total of 70. Theirs was a splendid rivalry that
excited interest even among casual observers of the game. But it
also obscured a host of other impressive achievements. There were a
dozen players with more than 40 home runs, including Cleveland's
(and upper Manhattan's) Manny Ramirez, who hit eight homers in five
games near the end of the season. Barry Bonds of San Francisco
became the first player ever to hit 400 home runs and steal 400
bases in a career. Meanwhile, Sosa drove in 158 runs (and may add
to that total on Monday night), well short of Hack Wilson's record
of 190, set in 1930, but better than anyone since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Whether baseball's owners and players can capitalize on their
sudden good fortune remains to be seen. But for now it is enough to
think back on a wonderful year marred by only one disappointment,
at least in these precincts. The Mets did not make the playoffs.
But the fact that they came so close with a team that was not
expected to do much of anything gives us one more reason to look
forward to next year.

COWBOYS CAN'T OVERCOME VARIETY OF ERRORS IN LOSS TO RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ While a few Cowboys players wondered aloud last
week about easing through a relatively easy upcoming schedule,
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey cringed at the notion. Though the Cowboys
topped the NFC East, Gailey said they ``weren't good enough to take
anyone for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 13-12 loss to the Oakland Raiders at Texas Stadium
proved his point.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after seemingly having everything go their way
in last Monday's victory against the Giants, the Cowboys were
undone b turnovers, red-zone failures, dropped passes and a bad
bounce on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few teams that can make mistakes and win, and we are
not one of them,'' Gailey said. ``We've got to be a consistent
fooball team before anyone can talk about us having arrived. We
haven't done that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jason Garrett, starting for an injured Troy Aikman
for the second consecutive game, lost his undefeated touch as a
starter with two interceptions _ the first killed a scoring drive
in the end zone, and the second sealed the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' lone touchdown came when Jeff George connected with
James Jett on a 75-yard touchdown pass, which bounded off the
shoulder of Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith into Jett's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up one play on defense,'' Gailey said. ``We turned the
ball over on offense and shot ourselves in the foot in the red
zone. And that will get you most times. That's what happened
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning consecutive games for the first time since
topping Arizona and Washington last season, the Cowboys (2-2)
allowed a winnable game to slip a way.
</P>
<P>
   Now tied with the Giants (2-2) and Arizona Cardinals (2-2) atop
the NFC East, the Cowboys find themselves trying to hold it
together until Aikman gets back from his fractured collarbone. They
will play the Washington Redskins (0-4) and the Carolina Panthers
(0-3) in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating for the guys on offense,'' said Garrett,
who completed 18 of 33 passes for 222 yards. ``We made some errors.
And the two turnovers hurt a great deal. Most important is that we
have to put ourselves in position to win, and we didn't do that
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency has been the theme of 1998 for the Cowboys, who
opened with a victory against the Cardinals, a loss against the
Denver Broncos and a victory against the Giants before succumbing
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency certainly was the theme against the Raiders, as
the big play to Jett offset a strong performance by the Cowboys'
pass defense. Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis recorded his first
sack, and rush end Kavika Pittman had probably the best showing of
his career with a sack, a batted pass and a couple of quarterback
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also limited Raiders game-breaking receiver Tim
Brown to four receptions for 35 yards and largely contained the
potentially potent Raiders offense _ save for the Jett play, which
came against tight-coverage from Smith and gave the Raiders a 10-3
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Smith's play and a 116-yard rushing effort from Raiders
running back Napoleon Kaufman, the Cowboys had a chance to win if
they could have executed on offense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's first interception _ also the first of Raiders
cornerback Charles Woodson's career _ squelched a Cowboys bid to
tie the game midway through the third quarter. Cowboys receiver
Michael Irvin ran a curl inside, and Garrett threw the ball outside
_ into the waiting hands of Woodson in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a poor throw,'' Garrett said. ``I thought he was going
to be outside. It was my fault. If I throw it in, we have a chance
to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had another chance on the next series when Sanders
thrilled the crowd with a 60-yard punt return. However, instead of
adding to his NFL record of 16 returns for a touchdown, he was
stopped at the 14-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came away empty when All-Pro kicker Richie
Cunningham, who didn't miss any from less than 40 yards last
season, missed from 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After the Raiders added a field goal to make the score 13-3,
Garrett and receiver Billy Davis connected on a 55-yard pass play.
A 1-yard touchdown run by Emmitt Smith narrowed the score to 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   However, Garrett, who played the part of hero in his two
previous starts at quarterback for the Cowboys, ran out of magic in
the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After driving the Cowboys to the Raiders' 43-yard line, Garrett
made a second critically bad read. Trying to hit Davis on a post
route, Garrett threw into double coverage, and his pass was
intercepted by Oakland safety Eric Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you don't get it done, you get frustrated,'' Garrett
said. ``At the end of the game we had a chance to win, that was
encouraging. But we didn't get it done.'' \Ntagtop:Clarence E. Hill

GIANTS REGAIN THEIR STRUT OVER CHARGERS, 34-16 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The formula is not new to these Giants, and they
knew where they were headed Sunday when they saw the rattled rookie
Ryan Leaf throwing the football into their formations without much
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The swagger was back in the Giants' defensive players, and they
swarmed at the San Diego Chargers and their young quarterback. Four
interceptions later, the Giants had righted their record to 2-2,
won on the West Coast for the first time in seven years and
regained a piece of the National Football Conference East lead with
a thorough 34-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance that brought a sigh of relief to the
Giants' locker room and spared them from their worst doubts.
</P>
<P>
   At a team meeting on Saturday, coach Jim Fassel had reminded his
players that they have goals, emphasizing the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we had goals,'' Fassel said. ``We have goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Sunday's game was over, the players acknowledged they
had overcome a loss of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been knocked on our heels a little,'' Giants
quarterback Danny Kanell said. ``But we couldn't let a little
setback become a big setback.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the Giants' collapse against Dallas last
Monday, Fassel and his assistants decided to alter their approach,
making it more simple and yet highly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Giants were certain they could force turnovers,
and they did. Leaf, who completed 15 of 34 passes for 193 yards,
left the game in the third quarter, booed off the field after his
fourth interception was run back for a touchdown by the Giants' new
starting free safety, Percy Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth had two interceptions, his first leading to the
Giants' third touchdown and a 21-0 first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Fassel decided to let Kanell throw the football
downfield more often, to work the middle of the field with Ike
Hilliard and Chris Calloway. And then, there was a subtle surprise:
Fassel gave the football to the rarely used Gary Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who played last season for the Chargers, admitted last
week that he was disappointed that he was returning to San Diego
with just 21 yards rushing on 10 carries in the Giants' first three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's disappointment appears to have been put to good use by
Fassel, who unleashed Brown as the Giants' secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time this season, the Giants' running game had
some bite. Brown did not look like Rodney Hampton, the man he was
signed to replace, and his rushing totals (66 yards on 20 carries)
were not overwhelming. But he did get valuable first-down yards on
several drives, and he looked effective as the between-the-tackles
runner the Giants need him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on the Giants' second possession of the game, Brown
scored from 4 yards out to give them a 7-0 lead they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard for them,'' Brown said of the Chargers. ``It
hurt to have to leave and I ran today with a year's worth of
emotion _ all that wondering why they had to let me go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kanell, ``Gary was a man possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's rushing and Kanell's passing were greatly aided by the
performance of the Giants' offensive line. This unit _ much
maligned the last two weeks _ played a strong game. There were
holes for the running backs and adequate protection for Kanell, who
completed 17 of 33 passes for 208 yards and was not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   The line's consistent play allowed the Giants to mount a few
long drives and had the Chargers' defense confused. Kanell, who
started slowly but later threw accurately and quickly, found
Calloway for a 25-yard touchdown pass near the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense operated with the faster tempo Fassel
prefers, which was another goal. When the Giants faced a
fourth-and-1 at the Chargers' goal line midway through the second
quarter, the coach decided not to back down from his more
aggressive offensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   He went for it, and Charles Way scored with a second-effort
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were knocking on the door there and I couldn't back out,''
Fassel said. ``That's how we came out to start the game _ no
motion, no trickery, just meat-and-potatoes football. We won the
old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, that included a harassing performance by the
defense. When three John Carney field goals had brought the
Chargers back into the game and cut the Giants' lead to 21-9,
Ellsworth stepped in front of a Leaf pass over the middle for his
second interception of the game. Ellsworth returned it 20 yards for
a 19-point Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hid behind the linemen and I recognized the pattern the wide
receiver was running,'' said Ellsworth, who started in place of the
team's usual free safety, Tito Wooten, who has a hamstring strain.
``I knew the quarterback couldn't see me, and I just waited and
then broke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers removed Leaf after Ellsworth's touchdown, replacing
him with Craig Whelihan, who completed the first pass he threw.
Four plays after he entered the game, he lofted a pass over
cornerback Phillippi Sparks and into the hands of wide receiver
Charlie Jones for a 41-yard touchdown pass that cut the Giants'
lead to 28-16.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who also got interceptions from Sparks and
cornerback Carleton Gray, stifled that comeback with some solid
defense and a steady drive at the start of the fourth quarter that
led to a 32-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso and put the Giants
safely ahead. Daluiso added a 19-yard field goal to give the Giants
a 34-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This felt exactly like the games we won last year,'' Ellsworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel gave a different version.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was exactly as we laid it out,'' the coach said.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hurricane Georges, rampaging again after earlier
devastating islands in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, slammed
into the seaside cities and resorts of the Gulf Coast on Sunday
night with rain-packed winds of up to 105 miles per hour and a sea
surge of 10 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Recharged after a three-day wander at 10 mph across the Gulf of
Mexico's tropical waters, the storm first began to move ashore
early Sunday evening with 50 mph winds at the leading edge. As the
night wore on, the winds grew stronger, blowing twice as hard near
the eye of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that the storm, one of the most dangerous to
hit the vulnerable, low-lying gulf region in many years, might not
move immediately inland if it collided with a high-pressure area to
the north. In that case, disaster experts said, there was the
possibility of catastrophic damage from a lingering pounding by
wind, rain and surf along the coastal strip that stretches for more
than 300 miles, from just east of Panama City in the Florida
Panhandle to just west of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the coastal region here is only a few feet above sea
level. And New Orleans, which is surrounded by levees, lies an
average of 6 feet below sea level. In the middle of the stretch, at
ground zero for the storm's eye, is Biloxi, Miss., a resort city
from which thousands of residents and visitors fled over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Early damage reports made no mention of deaths or injuries, but
they indicated that the marshes and barrier islands in the path of
the storm had been battered and that in the hours that followed,
cities, towns, and resort strips were already suffering, with
extensive power failures, large numbers of downed trees and
widespread damage to windows and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Waves from the Gulf of Mexico leaped across beachfront roads
along Route 90 in Mississippi, and thousands crowded into almost
250 shelters along the state's coast. Winds were gusting up to 55
mph as the storm advanced.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, sheets of rain were driven by 65 mph wind gusts in
Mobile and Baldwin Counties, and the hurricane's 25-foot waves
clipped off fishing piers along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. ET, the hurricane's center was about 70 miles
south-southeast of Biloxi and 105 miles east-southeast of New
Orleans. Wind blew at about 105 mph, and forecasters said that
might increase to 120 mph. The hurricane was moving north-northwest
at 6 mph.
</P>
<P>
   On the northeast side of New Orleans, the storm surge in Lake
Ponchartrain was pushing water up against some levees, and now and
again a rogue wave crested over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The city has many pumps to handle water accumulated in its
streets and open spaces, including rain water. But the pumping
system was not designed to handle a huge amount, including a
massive overflow of levees by Lake Ponchartrain and sustained
downpours that could exceed 20 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any reports of deaths or injuries from the storm was
a testament, in part, to the fact that coastal residents were given
early warnings of the storm and told that those who could should
batten down or evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Since it formed in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa a
couple of weeks ago, and started to blow west, Hurricane Georges
has caused more than 300 deaths, most in the Dominican Republic,
and has left more than 150,000 people homeless in Haiti. Damage
estimates range in the billions of dollars, with $2 billion of that
occurring in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a devastating storm,'' said James Lee Witt, head of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, as his teams prepared to move
into the Gulf Coast area once the hurricane moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of coastal residents fled northward in the
hours before the storm blew ashore, so many that on many highways,
cars, vans and trucks were bumper to bumper for miles on end.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others took refuge in schools, public buildings and
other shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Orleans, some 10,000 were housed in the hallways and
corridors of the Superdome, many spreading their blankets on the
concrete and doing what they could, with their books and puzzles
and bags of chips, to make the best of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before for football games, but this ain't no
game,'' said Demetrius Moody, an oil rig operator, as he slumped in
an end-zone seat in the sports arena, which can hold 69,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   In places along the coast where there were no levees to protect
people and property, the emergency authorities ordered residents to
evacuate. Most moved to higher ground with few, if any, complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And even in areas where evacuation was not mandatory, thousands
left anyway, heeding the words of Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans,
whose pre-storm mantra was: ``Our recommendation to people is to
go. We're in a state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter of downtown New Orleans _ where the
unofficial motto is ``Let the good times roll!'' and where the
streets are normally packed with noisy partygoers _ was nearly
abandoned in the hours just before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Plywood sheets covered windows and doors on Bourbon Street.
There was no whiff of Creole cooking, no pungent smell of coffee.
Most telling of all, even the bars that sell that most lethal of
alcoholic concoctions, the hurricane, were battened down.

DOAK WALKER, 71, STANDOUT IN COLLEGE AND PRO FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Texas)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doak Walker, the 1948 Heisman Trophy winner and one of college
football's legendary heroes, died Sunday at Routt Hospital in
Steamboat Springs, Colo. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from the paralysis he suffered in a
skiing accident last Jan. 30 in Steamboat Springs, where he lived,
the hospital said. After hitting a change in terrain, Walker
traveled 20 feet to 30 feet in the air and tumbled 75 feet, and he
was paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   In the years immediately following World War II, when Texas was
feeling big about itself in so many ways, the state's biggest
sports figure was Doak Walker, a handsome, humble hero who could do
so much with a football. He played for Southern Methodist
University in his home city of Dallas, and twice the Cotton Bowl
there was enlarged to accommodate the crowds that came to watch
him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Heisman Trophy, voted annually to the best college
player, went to Walker following the 1948 season, Ewell and Emma
Walker, his parents, who were teachers, accompanied him to New York
to receive the award at a banquet in the Downtown Athletic Club. In
those days, that was a big trip. On the flight home, Emma Walker
said, ``All of this because one little blue-eyed boy could run with
the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was small for big-time football at 5-feet-11-inches and
170 pounds. He played four seasons for Southern Methodist between
1945 and 1949 and six more for the Detroit Lions of the National
Football League. He quit after the 1955 season, saying, ``I want to
get out while I have all my teeth and both my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959 and
the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986. When the Pro Football Hall
of Fame admitted him, a Lions teammate, Gil Mains, said: ``At last.
Now we can relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Mains and other old Lions had lobbied hard and long for Walker's
inclusion, which had been delayed perhaps because he played so
briefly as a pro. However, he left his mark.
</P>
<P>
   He led the NFL in scoring his first season, when he was named
the league's rookie of the year, and he was chosen for the Pro Bowl
five times. With Walker as their running back, the Lions won the
NFL championship in 1952 and 1953. They were the league's dominant
team of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of that team was the quarterback, Bobby Layne,
Walker's teammate at Highland Park High School in Dallas and an
opponent in two epic college games between Southern Methodist and
Texas. They became lifelong friends.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was installed as the first-string tailback in Coach Matty
Bell's double-wing offense upon entering SMU, and in his first game
he played the full 60 minutes against Texas. Walker scored his
team's only touchdown and kicked the extra point, but a late
touchdown pass by Layne won the game for Texas, 12-7.
</P>
<P>
   After Army service in 1946, Walker returned to Southern
Methodist for glorious seasons in 1947 and 1948, when the team lost
only once, and for a lesser season in 1949 because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1947 season, unbeaten Southern Methodist trailed
Texas Christian, 12-0, when Walker scored a touchdown on a 65-yard
run and set up another for a 13-12 lead. But Texas Christian scored
with 90 seconds left for a 19-13 lead, and a Texas Christian
tackle, Harold Kilman, said, ``Now what are you going to do,
Doak?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Score again,'' Walker said. Whereupon he returned the ensuing
kickoff 65 yards to the Texas Christian 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   SMU.scored on a pass play as time ran out but Walker missed the
extra-point kick and the game ended in a 19-19 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who had accounted for 475 yards in the game, often said
later, `'All I remember is, I missed the kick.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Southern Methodist had moved its games from a
17,700-seat campus stadium to the Cotton Bowl on the grounds of the
Texas State Fair. Over the next two years, upper decks were built
on both sides and the capacity of 45,507 was increased to 67,431. A
plaque went up that read, ``The House That Doak Built.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when Walker made both conversion kicks, Southern
Methodist defeated Texas and Layne there, 14-13. That gave Southern
Methodist the conference championship and a berth in the Cotton
Bowl game there on New Year's Day, Walker's 21st birthday. That
game against Penn State ended in a 13-13 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Walker ran with the football, passed it, caught it and kicked
it. In 30 regular-season college games, he scored 288 points.
</P>
<P>
   After football, Walker was a sales executive with an electrical
construction firm and then founded Walker Chemicals in Denver, a
company he sold upon retirement. He had married a college
classmate, Norma Peterson, in 1950. He is survived by their four
children, Laurie, Kris and Russell Doak and Scot Alexander, and
four grandchildren. The marriage ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Walker moved to Steamboat Springs, Colo., and in 1969 he
married Skeeter Werner, who had been an Olympic skier and New York
model. They ran a ski shop in Steamboat Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Werner's brother, Buddy Werner, was the United States' best
Alpine skier at the 1964 Winter Olympic Games. He was killed
shortly after by an avalanche while skiing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain in Steamboat Springs was then renamed Mount Werner.
It was there that Walker, at age 71, fell and was paralyzed.

TV SPORTS: GO PUNT, FOOTBALL; BASEBALL IS ON THE THRONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere on television Sunday, football existed. But it hardly
mattered _ no, not even on a day when New Orleans won its third
straight game _ on a dizzying baseball afternoon when the Mets lost
and were eliminated from playoff contention, the Cubs and Giants
lost but will meet Monday night in a playoff and Mark McGwire
slugged his 69th and 70th home runs.
</P>
<P>
   And it was all there: The Mets-Braves game played in tandem on
Fox Sports New York and ESPN2, which took viewers on a surfer's
magical tour from Atlanta to Houston for the 11-inning Cubs-Astros
game (where Sammy Sosa got two hits but no home runs beyond his
current 66) and to Denver for the Giants-Rockies game.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a Toronto stopover for the no-hit bid of Blue
Jays' rookie pitcher Roy Halladay, which was spoiled by a two-out,
ninth-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   It meant nothing to the standing, but the Yankees, on the MSG
Network, beat Tampa Bay for their 114th victory. Shane Spencer hit
another grand slam and Bernie Williams won the American League
batting title. Who said baseball was boring?
</P>
<P>
   ``This season just won't end,'' a delighted Gary Thorne of ESPN2
said during yet another twist in the Cubs-Astros game.
</P>
<P>
   The only way you knew football existed was to see it on ESPN2's
bottom-screen scores ticker. (Sure Fox and CBS combined to show
three games locally, but did they matter?) The omnipresent ticker
got ditsy during a replay of McGwire's 70th home run, when the
slow-to-be-updated ticker read, ``McGwire hits 69th home run.'' On
a red-letter day, history beats technology.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, baseball itself made ESPN2 shine. The
Astros had just beaten the Cubs, 4-3, when ESPN2 switched to
Denver. As if fated by the cable deities, the first thing viewers
saw was Colorado's Neifi Perez hitting a game-winning home run in
the bottom of the ninth to make the Rockies a 9-8 victor over the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The camera stayed on Dusty Baker, the Giants' manager, long
enough to see his expression change from astonishment to gloom to
happiness, as he realized that his team was headed to Chicago for
the playoff game despite the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy gets another day,'' Thorne said to Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, maybe he'll hit four,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 70th home run ended his season _ and even if Sosa hits
four, the friendly battle is less fun when there is only one
contender _ but ESPN2 offered McGwire in replays from early to late
afternoon. By tape, ESPN2 carried post-game ceremonies and his news
conference, where he said: ``This is unheard of for someone to hit
70 home runs. I'm in awe of myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything ESPN2 did is what it should do. This is what an
all-sports network is capable of when it works at its technical
best on a mesmerizing story. The home run chase revived baseball,
which is more popular than it has been in years. Baseball, once
maligned and shunned for its miserable labor relations, looks like
a hot property compared with the National Basketball Association,
now shuttered by a lockout and in danger of looking as stupid as
baseball did during the 1994-95 strike.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the story in baseball is not about sinking ratings.
ESPN, ESPN2 and Fox all benefited by showcasing the McGwire-Sosa
home run bacchanal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a feud continues between Major League Baseball and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, baseball wrested three Sunday night games from ESPN,
because the station wanted to move them to ESPN2 to make way for
Sunday night National Football League games. (One of those games
happened to be last Sunday's, when Cal Ripken Jr. sat down.)
</P>
<P>
   Baseball should be thrilled with the job ESPN2 did Sunday, even
if it has only 60 million cable households, not ESPN's 74 million.
You could quibble and ask why baseball wasn't on ESPN Sunday, not
the NAPA Auto Care 500, a Nascar race. But that's a small
complaint. What ESPN2 did was a bonus, not a contractual
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the great twist in baseball's testy relationship with
ESPN: The Cubs-Giants playoff game will be carried at 8 o'clock
Monday night, on ESPN, directly against the ``Monday Night
Football'' game between Tampa Bay and Detroit on ABC, ESPN's
corporate sister in the Disney empire.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some baseball? Sosa vs. Sanders? Bonds vs.
Dilfer?

SCHUMER TOURS UPSTATE IN A COUNTERATTACK ON D'AMATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. _ After a week of being assailed in television
advertising as a ``liberal Brooklyn congressman'' hostile to
upstate interests, Charles Schumer campaigned across western and
central New York Sunday, ticking off the names of relatives who had
lived there and blaming Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for the economic
decline that has gripped this region.
</P>
<P>
   From an airport terminal in Rochester to a union gathering in
Syracuse to the front porch of the house where his father grew up
in this central New York city, the Democratic candidate for the
U.S. Senate asserted that, his ZIP code and accent notwithstanding,
he was sympathetic to the concerns of voters north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's visit here, which followed a series of television
advertisements directed by Schumer at upstate audiences, signaled
the extent to which both Schumer and D'Amato are viewing upstate as
critical to the outcome of the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Schumer spoke about the anemic economy in the
region, pledging to push legislation that, he said, would lower the
cost of electricity and air fares, two major constraints on
economic growth. But again and again, Schumer was reminded of the
potency of D'Amato's saturation television campaign as he was
repeatedly asked by reporters how a lawmaker who had spent his life
representing New York City constituents could understand upstaters'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer is a tough-on-crime, tax-cutting, moderate
Democrat, whose dad was raised in Utica, who shares the same values
as upstate New Yorkers,'' Schumer said into a clutch of television
cameras in Syracuse. He accused D'Amato of dividing the state for
political gain, adding, ``All his name-calling and negativity does
nothing positive for the people of this state _downstate or
upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, D'Amato countered Schumer's move by venturing into
the congressman's district, making a direct appeal to Jewish voters
and predicting that he would beat Schumer in his own backyard.
``I'm going to carry this district,'' said D'Amato, who also
campaigned Sunday in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato bristled at Schumer's assertion that the Republican
senator was running a divisive campaign and that he had failed to
tend to the needs of New York's troubled upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's total nonsense,'' he said after speaking at a Holocaust
memorial service at the East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn.
``If you look at the record, you will see that repeatedly we have
delivered over and over again for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato declared that Schumer had been divisive in Congress by
voting, for example, to raise the gasoline tax. ``His votes are
being divisive,'' said D'Amato, who has also supported a gas tax
increase. ``You've got to represent all the people. I have. I
represented the interests of upstate, while at the same token,
fighting for, championing and getting the largest increase for mass
transportation because the people here in Brooklyn need it. And
I've never played one against the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between the two men captured a day in which
D'Amato and Schumer battled over constituencies _ geographic and
ethnic _ that both sides see as critical to victory in what has
become one of the closest watched contests in the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato announced his intention to visit Brooklyn shortly after
learning that Schumer had organized a trip upstate in an apparent
attempt to confront D'Amato in a part of the state that D'Amato has
identified as his prime battleground. Schumer was trailed by a
chartered plane filled with reporters as he sought to rebut the
notion that he would be unable to compete with D'Amato for support
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, dodging thunderstorms that chased his single-propeller
plane through a bumpy itinerary that included Rochester, Syracuse,
Utica and Albany (Ithaca and Binghamton were rained out), signaled
how he intended to compete with D'Amato upstate. He said the
senator had shown no concern about how this part of New York had
lagged behind the economic recovery most of the nation had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything to create jobs in western New York,''
Schumer said. ``Al D'Amato hasn't talked about jobs. He hasn't
talked about ways to get businesses to come here and stay here. He
has no plan. Rochester doesn't need a senator who once every six
years comes up to Rochester, calls somebody some names and then
vanishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who accompanied Schumer accused D'Amato of running a
divisive campaign. ``They're going to try to pit one part of the
state against the other for political advantage,'' said state Sen.
Richard Dollinger of Rochester. ``I believe it's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer went to considerable lengths to try to dodge D'Amato's
effort to characterize him as alien to upstate. At every
opportunity, he took note of some relative who had made a home, no
matter how briefly, in this part of the world. ``I feel at home
here,'' he said in Rochester. ``I love this city. I have relatives
here. In fact, my uncle is the head of surgery at Strong Memorial
Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   At Schumer's request, his parents drove up from Brooklyn to join
him in Utica, so his father, Abe, who is 75, could pose with him at
the home where the elder Schumer lived for three of the nine years
he was here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in front of his father's house, there were reminders of
the difficulties Schumer faced here. John Cosgrove, a lawyer from
the town of Clinton, who served in the Assembly in the 1960s,
stopped by to praise Schumer's candidacy. When asked his party
affiliation, Cosgove responded loudly, ``I was a Democrat,'' but
then dropped his voice to a whisper. ``And a liberal. But don't put
that word in.''

IN THIS VOTE, YOU CAN TAKE MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Would a ``real mensch'' trash Manhattan to curry
favor in Munnsville?
</P>
<P>
   Would a genuine champion of upstate interests embrace Ed (Rural
Life Is a Joke) Koch?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, New York state Democrats insist, is no on both
counts. Hence their highly unorthodox step of promising to buy air
time to rebroadcast Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's own advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Democrats announced plans to run an ad in upstate
media markets that the Republican senator himself has broadcast
exclusively over New York City airwaves. In this ad, Koch and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani put aside their differences to praise the senator,
calling him a ``real mensch.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstate, meanwhile, the Democrats say they plan to rebroadcast
a commercial created by the state Republican Party for upstate
viewing only. This ad depicts city Democrats, quite literally, as
rapacious sharks gobbling up tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are exposing downstaters to what Republicans have to say
about them when they think they are not listening,'' said the state
Democratic chairwoman, Judith Hope, who called the shark ad ``very
cynical and even offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   By running the two ads in media markets where they were most
certainly not intended to be shown _ or at least by talking about
doing so _ Democrats hope to dramatize internal contradictions in
the senator's campaign. In effect, they are betting that D'Amato
has miscalculated, pushing too hard _ and too early _ on the old
upstate-downstate rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   But the last few elections also suggest that the risk D'Amato is
taking in alienating city voters may well be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   City residents tend to imagine that they live at the center of
the world, to say nothing of the state. And while the city's
influence, in cultural and economic terms, is disproportionately
large, its influence in electoral politics is just the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century ago, city voters made up half the state's
electorate. Today, they make up just over a third. And even that
figure overstates their significance, with a consistently low voter
turnout rate.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, for example, when George Pataki was a
little-known state senator running against Gov. Mario Cuomo,
two-thirds of all registered voters outside the city went to the
polls. But within the city, fewer than half did. Had the city's
turnout been comparable to the rest of the state's, Cuomo would
almost certainly still be governor, while Pataki would be a
little-known former state senator.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before that, when Cuomo ran against the
much-ridiculed Pierre Rinfret, only 37 percent of the city's
registered voters went to the polls, while outside the city, 57
percent did. That year, Cuomo was pushing a $2 billion
environmental bond act that was defeated largely because of voter
apathy in the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite many factors in the low city turnout, most
significantly demography. ``By and large,'' said Frances Fox Piven,
a professor of political science at the City University's Graduate
Center, ``the pattern for fully a century now is that if you have
less income, less education and are a member of a minority group,
the less likely you are to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Piven, politicians could draw more city voters
to the polls if they focused on the right issues, like income
inequality, unemployment and health care access. The problem for
Democrats, obviously, is that these are precisely the kind of
issues associated with good old-fashioned New York City liberalism.
Thus, they are precisely the kind of issues that can be used to
galvanize opposition upstate.
</P>
<P>
   If the last two gubernatorial elections are a guide, city
residents will cast somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of the vote
this November, a significant figure to be sure but hardly decisive.
</P>
<P>
   So while it may be unseemly for D'Amato, himself Nassau
County-bred, to attack his Democratic opponent, Rep. Charles
Schumer, for his New York City roots, it is quite logical for him
to do.
</P>
<P>
   In a D'Amato ad that the Democrats have decided not to
rebroadcast, a large saw cuts the state in two while an announcer
warns voters of Schumer's metro-centrism. ``Liberal Brooklyn
congressman Chuck Schumer doesn't think upstate New York matters,''
the narrator intones.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sharpest irony of the Republican strategy is that in
statewide elections, it is increasingly New York City that doesn't
matter.

NEN GETS RELIEF AFTER LOSING IN RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE LIPSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The distraught San Francisco Giants closer Robb Nen
thought his season was over as he walked off Coors Field Sunday
afternoon after serving up a game-losing home run to the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But in an improbable twist to an improbable season, unbeknownst
to many of the Giants, the Chicago Cubs had dramatically lost only
a moment earlier to force a one-game playoff Monday in Chicago for
the National League wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' Nen said. ``I didn't find out until we were
in the clubhouse. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   So despite the crushing bottom-of-the-ninth-inning home run by
shortstop Neifi Perez, the Giants head for Chicago's Wrigley Field,
somehow still in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were five games behind with just 11 games to play,
but they won nine of those games, including seven of their last
eight to surpass the Mets and draw even with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how hopeless the team's chances had seemed when it
faced that five-game deficit on Sept. 18, the veteran outfielder
Joe Carter said: ``If someone had told us then that we were going
to be in a one-game playoff, we would have taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are a franchise with a storied history of stretch
drives and this one brought back memories of the legendary 1951
run, when the team made up 13{ games in the final six weeks,
culminating with Bobby Thomson's ``shot heard round the world'' to
win a three-game playoff with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our hearts out the past week,'' Giants shortstop
Rich Aurilia said. ``I think it's kind of fun. This is something
you dream about as a little kid, a one-game playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker, who said he recently dreamed that
his team would make the playoffs, expected to start the
right-hander Mark Gardner (13-5, 4.27) in the tie-breaker against
the Cubs right-hander Steve Trachsel (14-8, 4.60).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to be going to Chicago,'' Baker said. ``I mean, we
could be going back to San Francisco. We could be going back to
paint our garages.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing before 48,028 fans on a sun-splashed afternoon in Coors
Field, the Giants seemed in control early, jumping out to a 7-0
lead and watching the outfield scoreboard for details of the Cubs'
game with the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was a typical Coors Field-type game again, where no
lead is safe,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' rookie of the year candidate, Todd Helton, capped a
six-run fifth inning with his 25th home run, a three-run blast off
John Johnstone, to narrow the margin to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, third baseman Vinny Castilla gave the Rockies
the lead with his 46th home run, a two-run shot, but Giants second
baseman Jeff Kent tied the game with a solo shot in the eighth off
Pedro Astacio.
</P>
<P>
   Nen entered the game in the bottom of the ninth and the first
batter he faced was Perez, a shortstop who was hitting .274 with
eight home runs. Perez took Nen's first pitch for a ball and then
slammed a fastball into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was comforting to discover that the Cubs had also
lost, Nen said: ``I don't know if you're ever relieved when you
give up a solo home run to lose the game. We had a chance to win
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took their traditional end-of-season lap around the
field, but Sunday's victory was only a small bit of solace. Larry
Walker did manage to lock up the NL batting title by going two for
four to finish with a .363 average, but the team that had expected
to contend for a pennant ended up with a 77-85 record. The Giants
are 89-73, with one game to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from emotional high to emotional low, but that's the
game of baseball,'' said Carter, who went three for four with a
homer and two runs batted in and is a major reason for the Giants'
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   They won only two of their first 13 games after the All-Star
Game break, but but after acquiring Carter from the Baltimore
Orioles and reliever Jose Mesa from the Cleveland Indians on July
23, they went 35-24.
</P>
<P>
   Noting his impending retirement, the crowd gave Carter a
standing ovation before his first at-bat in the second inning, and
the slugger responded by doffing his helmet and blowing kisses,
then singling to center and stealing second. ``I appreciate the
gesture the fans gave,'' he said. ``That was real touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the outfielder who won the 1993 World Series for Toronto
with a game-winning homer has at least one more game to play in his
storied career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in Wrigley Field,'' Carter noted. ``As Ernie Banks would
say, `Let's play two.' ''

 PETER B. PUTNAM, 78, SCHOLAR WHO WROTE ABOUT HIS BLINDNESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Peter Brock Putnam, a blind historian who spoke in public and
wrote about blindness and was active in nonprofit organizations,
died on Wednesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered from lymphoma for three years, said his son
Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brock Putnam had his sight when he was born, in Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga. He went on to graduate from Hill School in
Pottstown, Pa., and entered Princeton University. When he was a
20-year-old Princeton undergraduate, he was blinded when he shot
himself in the head with a .22-caliber rifle while trying to commit
suicide during ``a state of depression,'' his son Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Peter Brock Putnam recalled that after the shooting, ``in
a 10-day sleep I cannot remember, I had a miraculous awakening to
life and a sense of my own selfhood previously lacking. Near death
and totally blind, I was more alive than I ever had been.''
</P>
<P>
   He received a bachelor's degree in 1942 and a doctorate in
Russian history in 1950, both from Princeton, and was a lecturer at
Princeton, mostly in European history, from 1950 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The books he wrote included two highly praised autobiographical
works, ``Keep Your Head Up, Putnam!'' (1952) and ``Cast off the
Darkness'' (1957). He also wrote ``Love in the Lead: The Miracle of
the Seeing Eye Dog'' (1979, University Press of America), and
edited ``Seven Britons in Imperial Russia, 1698-1812'' (1952), an
anthology of travelers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the posts he held in the nonprofit world over the years
were president of the board of trustees of Recording for the Blind
and vice president of the Unitarian Universalist Association. He
recently received a lifetime-achievement award from the Seeing Eye
in Morristown, N.J., the organization that trains guide dogs and
their masters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Brock of Litchfield, Conn., he is survived by
his wife, the former Durinda Dobbins, whom he married in 1944;
another son, John Gerry Putnam of Manhattan and Boston; a daughter,
Barbara Putnam, also of Litchfield; two grandchildren, and a
sister, Theodora Downing of Annapolis, Md. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to place the Bronx back at the center of the
debate over a home for the Yankees, Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer plans to offer a proposal Monday to renovate Yankee
Stadium, install 120 luxury boxes, ease traffic congestion and
redevelop the neighborhood with a waterfront park, a Yankee Hall of
Fame and sports-related stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer's proposal, called Yankee Village, comes a month before
George Steinbrenner III, the Yankees' principal owner, is expected
to announce his decision on where the team will play after its
lease with the city expires in 2002. Steinbrenner has long
threatened to move his team to New Jersey or Manhattan, complaining
that the Bronx stadium has too few luxury boxes and parking spaces,
and that the neighborhood is unpleasant, unsafe and a traffic
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer's plan, which he commissioned himself and which combines
elements of several previous stadium proposals, would cost an
estimated $535 million, far less than any new stadium. But its
chances of becoming reality seem far-fetched, given Ferrer's fierce
and frequent criticism of the two people whose support for any
stadium plan is essential: Steinbrenner and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its fate, the Ferrer plan is likely to add another
layer of complexity to the speculation and debate caused by
Steinbrenner's shaky commitment to the Bronx. Giuliani has praised
the economic benefits of a billion-dollar stadium on the West Side
of Manhattan. New Jersey beckons with its own plans. Even The
Star-Ledger of Newark has weighed in, publishing its own plan
Sunday for a stadium in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But even though a Yankee move has at times seemed a foregone
conclusion, the debate's focus has shifted in recent weeks back to
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Gov. George Pataki declared that the Yankees
``belong in the Bronx, period.'' Pataki _ perhaps feeling pressure
from the Democratic candidate for governor, City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, who strongly favors keeping the team in the Bronx _
now contends that traffic jams, widespread opposition and the high
cost of construction in Manhattan ``argue strongly against that
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner himself suggested in July that the Yankees might
stay in the Bronx if they drew 3 million fans this season. A
spokesman later backed away from that statement, but the team set
an attendance record anyway _ 2,949,734 by Sunday, the end of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   And now Ferrer has a plan that seems intended to blunt each of
Steinbrenner's familiar arguments for moving away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal,'' Ferrer said, ``will present to fans and
visitors a year-round entertainment venue that will begin to return
to the city the enormous investment the city will, and has already
made, in the New York Yankees. It's fan-friendly, fiscally prudent
and answers the legitimate concerns raised by the Yankees and by
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ferrer's proposal, the 75-year-old stadium would regain
its historic entrance porticos, perimeter wall at the upper deck
and distinctive copper friezes, while a new, glass-enclosed
concourse would be built on the outside wall. Babe Ruth Plaza would
be moved to the west side of the 50,000-seat stadium, where
restaurants, sports shops, batting cages and a museum would provide
year-round attractions. Fans would arrive and depart from an
expanded ferry terminal, a renovated subway station, a new
Metro-North station and newly configured highway ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said that Yankee Village would cost less than half the
price of a proposed stadium in Manhattan, with an estimated $360
million coming from state, federal and private sources and only
$175 million from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was prepared by the Manhattan architectural firm of
Beyer Blinder Belle, which designed the Ford Theater on 42nd Street
and the renovation of Grand Central Terminal. Richard Blinder, a
partner at the firm, said he weaved together his own ideas,
features of the National Tennis Center in Queens, Chelsea Piers in
Manhattan and previous design efforts to address complaints by the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can restore the stadium, invigorate it with a kind
of high-tech circulation system and give George all his luxury
boxes,'' Blinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Blinder said he did the study for only $25,000 because he
believed in the project and because an alternative _ the Yankees'
relocating to Manhattan _ ``is horrible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Built in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the first three-tiered
ballpark and the first to be called a stadium. In the mid-1970s,
Mayor John Lindsay renovated the stadium, but failed to make good
on promises to rehabilitate the neighborhood as the cost ballooned
to $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer's proposal seeks to restore many of the original elements
obliterated by the earlier renovation, although some things may be
gone forever. The original Yankee bat rack and bullpen steps are at
the Smithsonian Institution, while the foul poles and some of the
lights are in Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ferrer's plan, luxury boxes would be built along the
entire mezzanine level, while the stadium club, with a new dining
terrace, would be moved to left field.
</P>
<P>
   To answer the most persistent complaints from Steinbrenner and
fans about traffic congestion and parking, Yankee Village calls for
the creation of a total of 10,340 parking spaces (up from about
7,000) at six garages that are designed to feed traffic across one
of two bridges or onto local streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic problems at Yankee Stadium are solvable,'' said
Samuel Schwartz, a transportation consultant and a former city
traffic commissioner who has seen parts of Ferrer's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer's plan tries to go beyond simply solving the team's
problems by integrating the stadium into the economic life of the
surrounding neighborhood. Under the plan, restaurants and retail
stores would be built alongside the Yankee Hall of Fame.
Storefronts and street lighting would be improved along River
Avenue and 161st Street.
</P>
<P>
   The new garages would be limited to three stories to reduce the
impact on the community and the exit time for automobiles. At the
same time, sports centers with ball fields for local teams would be
atop garages on the northeast and south sides of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Ferrer said, he would have the city condemn the
dilapidated Bronx Terminal Market, a 32-acre site on the south side
of the stadium, to build a waterfront park along the Harlem River
and 450,000 square feet of commercial space for so-called big-box
retailers like Sports Authority or Modells that would draw people
to the area year-round, not just during the 81 home games the
Yankees play every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will revive the existing commercial areas and
restore the neighborhood parks for Little League teams that play in
the shadow of Yankee Stadium,'' Ferrer said. ``It will ignite a
whole system of active and passive parks with vibrant new
commercial areas and make this as exciting as Camden Yards or the
National Tennis Center.''

BLANCA ROSENBERG, 85, WROTE HOLOCAUST MEMOIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (Eds: The boldfaced word in the 5th graf should be italicized.) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were the Thelma and Louise of Nazi Poland, and
if Hollywood hasn't tumbled to their story, it may be because
Blanca Rosenberg and Maria Rosenbloom had too many hair-raising
escapes, too many improbable rescues _ and far too much unremitting
horror in between _ for a single script to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for all the appeal of the wily and intrepid heroines
_ the blond, blue-eyed Bronislava, as Mrs. Rosenberg was known, and
her brunet sidekick, Maria _ Mrs. Rosenberg's 1993 memoir, which
described in rollicking (and harrowing) detail how the two young
women survived the Holocaust while posing as Catholic peasants,
left the story unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   While it continues for Dr. Rosenbloom, a retired professor at
the Hunter School of Social Work who lives in Manhattan, the story
has now ended for Mrs. Rosenberg, and with satisfying flair.
</P>
<P>
   When she died on Sept. 11 at her apartment in Manhattan, her
death _ at the age of 85, in her own bed, after a long, peaceful
retirement and a distinguished career as an assistant professor at
the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work _ was a
triumphant flick of her hand almost six decades coming to the
German soldiers who arrived in the small city of Kolomyja in
eastern Poland (now Ukraine) on July 3, 1941, and tacked up posters
that declared, in three languages, ``Death to All Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Rosenberg made clear in her book, ``To Tell at Last''
(University of Illinois Press), it didn't take too many  &UR; aktions
 &LR; in the increasingly depopulated Kolomyja ghetto for it to become
apparent that the Nazi regime intended to kill each and every Jew
in Poland _ including those, like Mrs. Rosenberg and Dr.
Rosenbloom, who had documents identifying them as essential workers
at a clothing factory.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the German invasion, Mrs. Rosenberg, a native of
Gorlice who had studied law at the University of Cracow, was the
27-year-old wife of a doctor who had escaped the Nazis by accepting
a medical assignment with the retreating Soviet army, leaving her
behind with an infant son, Zygmund, and her adored younger brother,
Romek.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosenberg's son, siblings, parents and other relatives died
in the Holocaust, but her husband survived. The couple were
divorced after the war, and she promptly married an old flame, Sam
Rosenberg, a gynecologist who became a psychiatrist in New York.
Rosenberg died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After watching her brother virtually volunteer for death during
a mass ``selection,'' Mrs. Rosenberg escaped to the nearby city of
Lwow armed with a birth certificate, supplied by her compassionate
factory manager, belonging to a Polish Catholic woman who had died.
</P>
<P>
   If she had kept to herself, the blond-haired and blue-eyed Mrs.
Rosenberg might have had a safer time of it. But she was
continually befriending those, like Dr. Rosenbloom, whose
appearance increased the likelihood that they would be unmasked.
</P>
<P>
   As a ground-zero account of life on the run, Mrs. Rosenberg's
book is filled with crosscuts between cities and a dizzying array
of hurried apartment changes, narrow escapes and ruthless
shakedowns by police officers, greedy landlords and freelance
extortionists.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, for example, the young women escape through a back
window of a military hospital in Lwow, where they had been working,
as police are coming in the front door (they had been betrayed by
one of Dr. Rosenbloom's former college classmates who had spotted
her in a bookshop). This is swiftly followed by a scene in which
they make their way in disguise past wanted posters with their
pictures (from their hospital identifications) at the Lwow train
station, which is in turn followed by their arrival in Warsaw _ in
the midst of the abortive ghetto uprising of April 1943 _ and their
immediate arrest on suspicion of being Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The two women spent the last months of the war working for
German families in Heidelberg.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosenberg said that she originally wrote her book in 1948
as a way to deal with the paralyzing guilt she felt as a Holocaust
survivor, and that she published it to satisfy her brother Romek's
last request that she stay alive to tell the story of the Kolomyja
ghetto to the world.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by twin sons, Alex of Athens, Ga., and Mark of
Coimbatore, India, and two grandchildren.
