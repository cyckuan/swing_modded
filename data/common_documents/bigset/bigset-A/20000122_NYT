Jags need victory over Titans for validation
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Although the Jacksonville Jaguars compiled
an NFL-best 14-2 record this season, they have not earned universal
approval as the best team in the league, an omission that will gnaw
at them unless they reach Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars won the AFC Central, and they are favored by seven
points to defeat Tennessee in Sunday's AFC Championship Game.
Despite its success, Jacksonville has a chip on its shoulder the
size of a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people believe we're a legitimate 14-2 team,''
outside linebacker Kevin Hardy says.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of respect at this time of the season is a tired but
familiar refrain echoed by players and coaches who apparently need
additional motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are using the same tool despite posting a
franchise-best 13-3 record and beating Buffalo and Indianapolis in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Titans, the Jaguars believe they will get the
recognition they deserve if they win Sunday and take the next step
to the Georgia Dome at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars are favored by a touchdown and an extra point, but
here's the real rub: They lost both games to Tennessee this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's between the lines, not on paper,'' Jaguars safety Donovin
Darius says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jaguars won't admit it, they might have an
inferiority complex against the Titans. The Jaguars are trying to
avoid a 3-0 sweep by Tennessee, which would be the eighth since the
merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I wanted to play Tennessee again,'' Darius says.
``The emotional part of the game builds it up to the biggest game
of our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars lost 20-19 and 41-14 to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every psychological edge except one _ that they beat
us twice,'' Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin says. ``But we have the big
one _ we're at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at Alltel Stadium is no big deal for the Titans.
Jacksonville is 28-4 at home, including three losses to the Titans.
New England is the only other team to win in Jacksonville since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In this season's one-point loss at home to the Titans, the
Jaguars blew the game when Coughlin called for quarterback Mark
Brunell to throw for the end zone with time running out, and the
pass was intercepted by cornerback Samari Rolle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a game we should have won,'' Coughlin says. ``We lost
the game. I lost the game. It's just a bad memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Jaguars suffered that loss started speculation that
Brunell and Coughlin were having problems working together, that
the coach was putting too much pressure on the quarterback. Both
denied it, of course, but those close to the Jaguars say Coughlin
let up over the course of a season in which he called plays for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars didn't lose again until the second game against the
Titans when they were embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   What the Jaguars and Titans knew and what the nation is
discovering is this has developed into an intense, bitter rivalry.
A lot of bad blood exists between the teams, and the players and
coaches don't try to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some flashes of arrogance, and there's some talking,
no question about that,'' Coughlin says. ``Because we're so
familiar with each other, there's some nastiness about the way we
play each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that sets the tone physically, and we're going
to have to answer the bell if we're going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans aren't intimidated by the prospects of playing at
Jacksonville. But they would like to play on a level field.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Jaguars destroyed Miami 62-7 and showed the kind
of big-play offense and suffocating defense Coughlin has sought.
</P>
<P>
   The rout of the Dolphins has helped boost the Jaguars'
confidence at a time they need it the most. Brunell showed against
Miami he has recovered from the sprained knee he suffered in the
second Tennessee game.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Fred Taylor, who has been bothered by a hamstring
injury that has severely limited his playing time this season,
rushed for 138 yards against the Dolphins and showed the quick
cutting ability of Barry Sanders. Included in Taylor's impressive
performance was a playoff-record 90-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor knows he won't be 100 percent until the offseason and
hopes he doesn't aggravate the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be until after the season, until I get a chance to
rest it two, three weeks in a row doing nothing,'' he says. ``I
mean barely walking, just lying on the couch. I might gain 15
pounds in the process, but I don't care. I'll gain 15 pounds to get
my legs back to 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars would like to get Taylor more involved in the
passing game to make him a more dangerous threat, but he was
limited most of the season because of the injury. What they can't
afford is another performance like the one in Tennessee, where
Taylor rushed for only 42 yards on 20 carries when they fell behind
early and were forced to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Miami game) demonstrated not only his elusiveness, but his
acceleration and what a dangerous threat he is once he's in that
secondary,'' Coughlin says. ``He has presence about him. He sees
people most of us might not see. And I still don't think he's at
full speed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a scary thought for the Titans. Interestingly, Taylor
is close friends with a player who will try to ruin his Sunday _
Titans rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse. Taylor and Kearse
attended the University of Florida. They are so close they talked
on the telephone this week and plan to take a trip together in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon's so intense during games,'' Taylor says. ``I tried to
talk to him when we played them. At one point, I said, `You're
beating the hell out of us; why won't you talk now,' but he didn't
say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer words between the teams this week. Coughlin and
coach Jeff Fisher cautioned their players about providing
bulletin-board material. Still, though, there was the woe-is-me
refrain from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just them trying to get ready to play,'' Jaguars
offensive tackle Leon Searcy says. ``I don't think anyone here
doesn't respect them. I hope that's not their motivation for this
game, but if it is, so be it.''

JORDAN HAS TO BE TRUE MAGICIAN TO TURN WIZARDS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what do you get the man who has everything?
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Washington Wizards . . . of course.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to hit the curve ball and, lately perhaps, the 2-iron,
Michael Jordan added the line ``slum lord'' to his burgeoning
business portfolio this week. The distressed property in this case
is the Wizards, the discount magicians of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not accurate. The Wizards are anything but
impoverished. When Jordan was named this week as the club's
president of basketball operations, it was noted that next season's
Wizards would boast a total payroll that is $16 million over the
league salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   They really do need a magician.
</P>
<P>
   Enter His Airness. The so-named greatest athlete of the 20th
century. Holder of six NBA title rings. Disdainer of gravity. And
until Wednesday, lord of the car pool line.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that NBA commissioner David Stern sensed the
void left by Jordan's absence and wanted him back in the league.
But the Wizards?
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the big announcement, no less than the president
of the United States was out driving around _ wink, wink _ and
stopped into the MCI Center to wish Michael well. Alas, his new
mongrels happened to be losing to the Mavericks, 104-86, which
meant that President Clinton could have immediately declared the
Wizards a federal disaster area, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's Mike's problem now. He has a team of aging
underachievers and the fifth-worst record in the NBA. He might or
might not have a No. 1 draft pick. His alleged three best players _
Juwan Howard, Mitch Richmond and Rod Strickland _ are scheduled to
earn a combined $36.8 million next season. The league salary cap is
expected to top out at $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like a true Wizard, maybe he could saw both Howard and
Strickland in half.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, His Airness didn't need the money. He couldn't have lost
that much playing golf. He retired in January 1999 , saying he
wanted to become a normal dad, a family guy, and looked forward to
the wonders of signing-the-homework and the 10-item express
checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, as always, likes the action. He breathes adrenalin,
in lieu of oxygen. He was the game's ultimate competitor and maybe,
a year and a half after his last jump shot beat the Utah Jazz, he
still is.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, therefore, the Wizards are a walking, dribbling
Indiana Jones movie. He will be more than challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight,'' Jordan said. ``I'm
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Like trying to play for the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be because Jordan missed the cheers, because no one
gives standing ovations to the owner's suite. As of this week,
Jordan won't have a box score to fall back on. He'll have only the
blunt Eastern Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has been my life,'' Jordan said at his midweek news
conference. ``I know it. I know it inside and out. This is an easy
transition for me, to be involved with a team and have input on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows talent, Mike said. But all athletes who move to the
sideline or front office think that.
</P>
<P>
   For every Jerry West or Kevin McHale, there is an Elgin Baylor
or a Bill Russell, neither of whom had the patience or general
managing wiles to build a winner. The Bob Gaineys, Joe Torres and
Larry Birds are the exceptions _ star players who have been able to
win once their playing days are over.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no guarantee. Ted Williams, Pete Rose and Frank
Robinson _ to name just three _ tried managing and achieved only
modest returns of success.
</P>
<P>
   General managing is different, Jordan will learn. He'll have to
watch a lot of games, including pro and college games on TV. He'll
have to work the phones. He'll have to network with other GMs,
including a guy like Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most bemusing things that Jordan said this week was
that he planned to still live in Chicago and commute to Washington.
He can't be serious, but it further proves the notion that most
professional athletes think everyone in the front office works
10-12 hours max per week.
</P>
<P>
   He must have really owed David Stern a favor.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap and the new collective bargaining agreement _
which Jordan opposed, by the way _ will make it Maverick-sized
impossible for the Wizards to get better any time soon. Like a true
Wizard, Jordan is going to have to pull a rabbit out of the hat.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, a Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say it couldn't happen. Remember _ he likes the action.

CAR BOMBS KILL 1, INJURE SEVERAL IN MADRID 
</HEADLINE>
   (RECASTS 8th graf to delete extraneous words) 
 (lh) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Two car bombs exploded in Madrid Friday, killing
a Spanish army officer and injuring several other people. The
government accused the Basque separatist group ETA of staging the
attacks, which would be the first after a year and a half of peace
overtures that included a unilateral cease-fire which the rebels
broke off late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two blasts came four days after Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar set general elections for March 12. No one has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, but the long-feared renewal of
separatist violence immediately took center stage in the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The first car bomb, activated by remote control at about 8:10
a.m., killed Lt. Col. Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 47, as he walked
in his neighborhood, where many military families live, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspected rebels then fled several blocks in a second car,
which they left to explode about 30 minutes later. The police said
a 14-year-old girl was also injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETA will fail,'' Aznar said in a nationally televised address.
``The attack in Madrid is a sign of their weakness, not their
strength. The government will not step back one inch in the fight
against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, has fought for 31 years for an independent
Basque homeland. But its last fatal attack was on June 25, 1998,
when a bomb killed a Basque town councilman from Aznar's ruling
center-right Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   The past year and a half has been the longest period in three
decades without separatist violence, and had raised hopes that both
sides might use the rebels' unilateral cease-fire, declared in
September 1998, to achieve a lasting peace to a conflict that
officials say has killed about 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 people demonstrated Friday evening in Madrid
to demand an end to Basque violence, but at similar gatherings in
two Basque provincial capitals, San Sebastian and Bilbao, the
state-run news agency EFE reported tensions when supporters of the
rebels showed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   The protests against terrorism, scheduled to continue throughout
the weekend, apparently sought to revive the outpouring in 1997
when millions of Spaniards marched in the streets for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The first political fallout from the blasts came while workers
were sweeping up broken glass at the bomb sites in southwestern
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the regional Basque government, Juan Jose
Ibarretxe, said that his moderate Basque Nationalist Party would
suspend its parliamentary deal for support from the Euskal
Herritarrok coalition, widely considered to be the rebels'
political wing.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarretxe said the suspension would last until the coalition,
whose name means Basque Citizens, clearly condemns the rebel
violence. But a coalition leader, Arnaldo Otegi, retorted that
while the attack was the work only of its perpetrators, the entire
political class shared blame for not preventing it.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, when announcing on Jan. 17 the March election date, said
that he had started his first term in 1996 with the goal of
standing firm against Basque terrorism. He and Joaquin Almunia,
leader of the opposition Socialist Party, had agreed that the fight
against the rebels was a national matter that should not divide the
major political parties during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Almunia, alluding to differences, said Friday:
``Unfortunately, in recent weeks, unity among the democratic
parties has not been sufficiently strong and intense. We have not
been able to meet the high standards demanded by the citizens who
remind us that the only one to blame for the terrorism is ETA.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 14-month cease-fire, which the rebels initially
described as ``indefinite,'' the government negotiated only once
directly with rebel leaders, at a secret meeting last May 19 in
Switzerland. But the peace effort had been stalled for months
before the rebels announced last Nov. 28 that attacks could resume
by Dec. 3.

ADOPTING THE GOLD STANDARD ISN'T PRACTICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: How long has it been since the readers have been heard
from? Hmmmm. That long, huh? No wonder the mailbag is bulging with
so many valued contributions. Well then there now, let's just
rectify this situation by turning today's column over to those who
cared enough to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to hear your opinion on returning to the gold
standard, as some prominent conservatives (such as) Jack Kemp and
Steve Forbes have suggested. I'm a curious grad student at
University of Missouri-Kansas City and the gold-standard question
is one we have entertained in an advanced finance class.
</P>
<P>
   Dear (Gold) Bugged: There is something to be said for the
tradition of linking a currency's value to an instrument of
tangible value such as gold. Given the way the world's financial
system has evolved during the postwar era, however, it's no longer
a practical option. As you probably know, from 1946-71 the Bretton
Woods agreement provided a modified gold standard which was really
a U.S. dollar standard. International balances were settled in
dollars, and the U.S. pledged to redeem dollars for gold at $35 an
ounce. In August 1971 President Nixon announced the U.S. would no
longer redeem currency for gold, effectively ending the
gold-standard era. In the absence of global hyperinflation, there
will never be enough political support in the industrialized world
for a return to the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of things that glitter, the subject of casinos came up
in the context of increasing bankruptcies hereabouts since the
arrival of the riverboats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you read (the) article about bankruptcies and gambling?
You always seem to tout how great casinos are for our economy (but)
never evaluate the human tragedy (and) cost to our local economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Concerned: As the son of a father who had a very
destructive gambling Jones, the bad things a family can experience
as a result of irresponsible behavior isn't an abstract matter with
me. Nevertheless, society shouldn't be denied its guilty pleasures
and petty vices simply because a relative few members can't handle
them responsibly. As for the local bankruptcy trend, the numbers
didn't seem to reflect anything approaching alarming proportions.
From a practical standpoint, most Americans seem able to live in
harmony with legalized gaming, whether they participate or not.
What this says about our society is a worthwhile subject for
debate, but legal gambling is here to stay, for the time being at
least. Therefore, it should be accepted as a legal enterprise whose
economic benefits have so far substantially outweighed its social
overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   On a closing note, here are some words of wisdom for a reader
getting into the spirit of the election season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing up `Gratuitously Meddlesome Government,'
(which) reminds me of Sir Ernest Benn's words: `Politics is the art
of looking for trouble, finding it whether it exists or not,
diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedy.' Keep
poking fun at the grand pooh-bahs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Valued Contributor: Thank you for sharing. Couldn't have
said it better myself. Benn's words are worth putting in
needlepoint and displaying in a prominent place.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

ON IOWA'S LESS-TRAVELED CAMPAIGN TRAIL, PERSONAL APPROACH PAYS
OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEON, Iowa _ The George W. Bush campaign in Decatur County was
making a final push before Monday's Iowa caucuses, and for
71-year-old Wendell Tuttle there's only one way to go:
</P>
<P>
   Door to door, one household at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more effective than a telephone call,'' Tuttle said.
``People feel if you take the time to come and see them you are
really sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping by Charles Warren's house in this southern Iowa
community, Tuttle started the conversation with his longtime
acquaintance by joshing the die-hard Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if you were interested in Bradley or Gore,''
Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Iowa race reaches a crescendo, many campaigns out in
Iowa's 2,131 precincts are still low-key and one-on-one. The style
seems far removed from the last-minute barbs many candidates are
aiming at each other.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas such as Decatur County, hard sells are about as
welcome as a blast of arctic air. But a well-aimed pitch from a
longtime neighbor can be more effective than a month's worth of
slick TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole different political culture here than in the
big cities,'' said Bill Russell, the county coordinator for
Democrat Bill Bradley. ``It's less aggressive, more informal, more
laid back.''
</P>
<P>
   So Russell, a political science professor at Graceland College
in Lamoni, leaves a lot of his politicking to chance encounters. He
chats up fellow professors in the hallways outside his Briggs Hall
office. He talks to students on campus sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tuttle, he'll also work the phones, contacting precinct
residents. ``The more of those calls that we make, the better off
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with a big primary, a caucus state requires more
individualized campaigns and places a huge premium on the Tuttles
and Russells.
</P>
<P>
   The objective, after all, is to get supporters to show up.
</P>
<P>
   You can't arrive at 8 p.m. or 6 p.m. and expect to vote. It's 7
p.m. or bust. If you have another commitment, forget it. Can't get
a baby sitter? Sorry. Absentee ballots? They don't exist in the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you've got to stick around awhile and also vote on
platforms and delegates. You've got to spend an hour, or most
likely two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not hardcore, you don't go,'' said Manuel Atwood, a
Bradley worker from Lamoni. ``I'm going to have a hard time getting
my wife to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 200,000 of Iowa's 2.9 million residents are expected
Monday _ 100,000 Republicans and about the same number of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers seem pretty abstract in Decatur County. With
only 8,300 people, it ranks 87th in population of Iowa's 99
counties. Just 344 Republicans and Democrats turned out in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the county's 22 precincts, as few as three people may
show up. The goal the Bush people set for Tuttle is 14. ``Shouldn't
be a problem,'' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bush and Bradley, only Vice President Al Gore has a
presence here. Other campaigns appear to have taken a pass _ even
Republican Steve Forbes, who is said to have a stellar Iowa
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is location. Situated just north of the
Missouri state line, Decatur County is far from the main routes the
contenders follow.
</P>
<P>
   Slim pickings or not, Tuttle journeys on, joined one evening by
Deb Etcheson, the county coordinator for Bush. Their target: Leon
households identified as Republican, but not squarely in Bush's
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The combo seems to be a good match. Tuttle knows the residents;
Etcheson comes armed with talking points the Bush campaign has
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no sense of urgency, perhaps because of Bush's
strong showing in the polls. They meet at 6:30 in Tuttle's office,
but take 45 minutes to talk over campaign business. And once they
hit the streets in Etcheson's car, they manage to reach only three
homes before deciding to quit at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, they hear lots of reasons that justify their
more personal approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like these telephone people, these pollsters,'' Doug
Akers said. ``Would you support so and so? I just say, `I don't
believe it's any of your business,' and that just ends it right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Etcheson and Tuttle mostly listen. When Charles Warren says he's
heard Bush criticized as too much of a preacher, Tuttle responds
quietly, ``I don't think that would ever be a problem with Bush at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marletta Warren notes that she's seen little of the candidates'
spouses. ``These wives have a powerful influence,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheson responds with a story about how she saw Bush and his
wife, Laura, in Ames last August dancing the Texas two-step.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just looked so romantic,'' Etcheson said. ``That did a
lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At evening's end, Etcheson doesn't know if they've swung any
votes. But she is sure that a few more people know that the Bush
campaign is serious in Decatur County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends the kind of message that Governor Bush wants to send,
and that is paying attention to people on their level,'' she says.
``You can't do that with a phone call or fliers.''

STRIKERS DISREGARD VOTE TO REOPEN UNIVERSITY IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to update voting numbers in 2nd graf.) 
(mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Students, faculty and workers of the national
university, worn out by a nine-month strike, voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a plan by its president to return to class, results of
a Thursday referendum showed Friday. But the strikers who have
paralyzed the enormous campus since April refused to recognize the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180,000 of the 333,000 people affiliated with the
university voted in the ``plebiscite'' organized by the university
president, Dr. Juan Ramon de la Fuente. Of the voters, 157,191, or
87 percent, approved his plan to suspend tuition payments
indefinitely and organize a special congress drawing from all parts
of the university to carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The show of support was even stronger than de la Fuente had
expected in his high-stakes gamble to break the deadlock. He had
said that 125,000 votes would be enough to give him a mandate to
bargain more forcefully with the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal has won a consensus for the university to
reunite,'' he said, with visible relief, at the close of balloting
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal yields to the strikers on most major
points, but does not reinstate open admissions, as they have
demanded, or cancel limits on how long a student can be enrolled
without graduating.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers, as they have done time and again, quickly
dismissed the administration's effort as a sham. On Tuesday and
Wednesday the strikers held their own competing referendum, in
which they said that 86,329 members of the university voted for the
strike to continue until every demand was met.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers' referendum was chaotic, and a number of
observers reported a much lower turnout than the strikers claimed.
Unlike the president's vote, the strikers took no measures to
require identification from voters or to stop them from voting
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare their vote to ours because theirs is a
fraud,'' said Ana Maria Hanan, a political science student,
announcing the strike council's decision. ``It was just designed to
capitalize on the desperation in the university to pave the way to
use violence against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still no end in sight to the protest, de la
Fuente now has an important new tool with which to turn up the
pressure on strike leaders. With 275,000 students, the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, is Latin America's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of attrition in the strike movement. Friday
morning, students at one major high school associated with the
university decided to end their strike and release the school to
UNAM administrators. But de la Fuente decided not to take back any
buildings without a general settlement, and radical strikers
quickly re-occupied the high school.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente, a former health minister who stepped in as
president on Nov. 17, has succeeded almost single-handedly in
mobilizing a passive majority in the university that has long
opposed the strike but was also put off by the remote and imperious
style of the former university president, Francisco Barnes de
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist who was trained at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., de la Fuente went in person to meetings in every department
to sound out opinions, enduring an acid bath of criticism about how
the giant university functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get people involved so we eventually can turn over
this black page and go back to classes without rancor or revenge,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally put a human face on the administration,'' said
Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor who has been a constant
critic of the administration. Like many in his department, Alvarez,
a former student leader, supported the strike at first. But after
he began to question it in July, strikers called him a traitor and
broke into his offices to steal the computer that contained much of
his research.

OFFICER'S SUSPICIONS LEAD TO SEIZURE OF NEARLY $4 MILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLBY, Kan. _ If a Colby police officer hadn't confused the
letters ``K'' and ``X'' on a license plate last week, a suspected
drug dealer might still be alive and on the run.
</P>
<P>
   But Cpl. Scott Sitton read the wrong letter, and the events that
followed led him to pull the car over. In short order, one of the
two men in the car killed himself with a gunshot to the head, and
officers found $3.77 million in cash in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The cash seizure was by far the largest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas authorities later learned that the dead man was being
sought in connection with drug trafficking and was linked to $5.99
million that had been seized earlier that day at a storage locker
in Fort Collins, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   It all began about 9 p.m. Jan. 14, when Sitton saw a driver
trying to maneuver a Ford Taurus into position for gasoline at a
service station just off the highway in Colby. The driver didn't
seem familiar with the car, so the officer radioed a dispatcher
with the license plate number.
</P>
<P>
   The license plate didn't go with the Taurus, which was rented,
so the officer drove by again to see whether he had misread it. He
had _ the plate was right _ but the two men in the Taurus seemed
nervous to see the officer again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went by them the second time, they really gave him the
old rubberneck,'' Colby Police Chief Randall Jones said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer waited for the men to fill up and got behind them
when they pulled out of the service station. The driver illegally
passed through the right-hand southbound lane and got into the
left-hand southbound lane to make a left turn onto Interstate 70,
Jones said. Sitton turned on his flashing lights, and the driver
pulled over on the highway on-ramp.
</P>
<P>
   The officer took a driver's license and car-rental agreement
from Justin E. De Busk, 26, of Katy, Texas. A dispatcher told
Sitton that the documents were valid and De Busk wasn't wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But De Busk was shaking when Sitton returned the papers, Jones
said, so the officer asked the driver if he would answer a few more
questions. The driver said he was returning from a ski trip, but
the officer didn't see any skiing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sitton asked if he could check the trunk, which De Busk opened
from a latch inside the car. Inside, the officer saw cardboard
boxes and a locked duffel bag that felt as if it held bricks.
Sitton suspected the bricks were packages of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The officer called De Busk out of the car and asked him to open
the bag, but De Busk said it belonged to his passenger, Jones said.
The officer told De Busk to stand in front of the police car and
then called to the passenger, Robert Henry Golding, 43.
</P>
<P>
   Golding came out but immediately grabbed something from his
waistband, Jones said. Sitton shoved Golding against the Taurus,
and Golding shot himself in the head, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitton ran back to his car and shouted into his radio, ``Shots
fired! Shots fired! The suspect shot himself in the head!'' Then he
pulled his pistol on De Busk and ordered him to the ground until
help arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Golding was pronounced dead at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officers searched the car and found cellophane-wrapped bricks of
cash in the duffel bag, six boxes and a trash bag. They also found
dozens of Social Security cards, birth certificates, identification
cards and driver's licenses, some blank and some with Golding's
photo, police said.
</P>
<P>
   De Busk was booked into the Thomas County jail, charged with
aiding a felon.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Fred De Busk of Huntington Beach, Calif., said
Friday that he doesn't know whether his son knew what he was
hauling. He suspects that Justin De Busk, who stands 6 feet 6
inches tall and weighs about 240 pounds, was recruited to travel
with Golding _ who was about 5 feet 6 and less than 170 pounds _
because of his stout build.
</P>
<P>
   Justin De Busk worked selling spray-on pickup bed liners but
frequently made money dealing in various goods, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always dabbling with something _ buy something for 10
and sell it for 20,'' Fred De Busk said. ``But I never suspected
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin De Busk grew up in a large family and was raised as a
good Mormon, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we can train our children, but we can't
dictate their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cash seized in Kansas will be split among law enforcement
agencies that helped with the investigation and must be used for
law-enforcement purposes that are not funded by their regular
budgets, Attorney General Carla Stovall said in a statement. The
$3.77 million seizure breaks the record set by a $813,786 cash
seizure in 1995.

KANSAS CONGRESSIONAL RACE GARNERS NATIONAL ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Sitting in his easy chair after a stunning
election upset more than a year ago, a tired U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore
took a congratulatory call from an exuberant Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That call was only a small indication of how closely Washington
insiders had watched this Kansas campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Moore faces another tough GOP challenge this year in a
predominantly Republican district, and the spotlight could focus
even more brightly on this race and ensure a flood of GOP and
Democratic campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the election of Moore, the first Democrat to capture
the 3rd district in about 40 years, and a handful of other
victories left the Democratic Party just short of taking control of
the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of another five seats from Republicans in the 2000
elections could put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Moore is important for the overall future of the
Democratic Party,'' said Amy Walter, House editor for the Cook
Political Report, a Washington-based, nonpartisan group that
analyzes congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the attention given his district is something he
can't control and, thus, doesn't focus on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens nationwide is going to happen,'' he said.
``What I'm doing is focusing on my race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cook report and others list the Moore race as one of about
40 across the country to watch and the only one in the Kansas City
area to make the lists.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, only two congressional districts, both in the St.
Louis area, make the lists. In the 1st District, Democrat William
L. Clay is retiring, and in the 2nd District, Republican Jim Talent
is stepping down to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Although open seats with no incumbent running will receive a
higher priority, Moore is believed to be one of the most vulnerable
Democratic freshmen in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Democrats elected (in 1998), he's sitting in one of the
most Republican districts in the country,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Registered Republican voters make up 42 percent of Moore's
district compared to Democratic voters at 28 percent and
unaffiliated voters at 30 percent. The district is made up of
Johnson, Wyandotte and Miami counties, and most of Douglas County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand this is considered a vulnerable seat,'' Moore
said ``The majority party thinks they own it, but it belongs to the
people of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban areas and their strong GOP tradition have long been a
political problem for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Walter said Moore became a symbol to Democrats that they could
be successful in such areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs were a critical piece in the Democrats' ability to
pick up seats in the last two election cycles,'' she said. ``The
suburbs are the new battleground in national politics. Moore is a
perfect example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It also means that Moore is high on the Republican list of
Democrats the GOP would like to defeat this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more important Democrat to knock off than Dennis
Moore,'' said Mark Pfeifle, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee. ``We'll do everything possible to bring this seat back
where it belongs _ in the hands of a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a big surprise to me,'' Moore responded. ``I didn't
expect to get a free ride by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University
of Kansas, said that will mean a lot of soft money going to the
candidates from the two political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flow of money is potentially going to be overwhelming if
this is perceived to be close,'' Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cook report and the Stuart Rothenberg Political Report,
another national publication, have the race listed as a tossup but
tilting Democratic. In other words, the race could be close, but
Moore should emerge the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said it isn't a pure tossup because the Republican
field lacks a big name and looks rather fragmented. The GOP in
Kansas is seen in Washington as still badly split between
conservative and moderate factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little skeptical that they have a candidate that can
unite the party,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most congressional elections are really a referendum on
incumbents, and voters won't leave one they're satisfied with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last election was a rejection of (Vince) Snowbarger and
his campaign,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Moore race is on all the ``lists to watch'' but
lacks the pizazz of some of the other races around the country
where more well-known Republicans are challenging freshman
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sawyer, chairman of the Kansas Democratic Party, said the
Moore race is being discussed in national political circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely on the radar screen, and it's a targeted
seat,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed with the Washington analysts that more attention
will be paid to races where there is no incumbent running.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis said another reason the national analysts put the
district in the Democratic column for November is the amount of
money raised by Moore so far.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of Snowbarger's term, the Republican hadn't raised
much money. Moore, on the other hand, reported last week that he
raised $626,000 last year, far more than any of his potential
Republican opponents, and on a pace to exceed the $1 million he
raised in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis said Republican money could dry up in September if polls
indicate the race here doesn't look competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore has a problem that is beyond his control and is one
that privately worries many Democrats. If Gore, the likely
Democratic presidential nominee, doesn't excite voters on the
presidential ballot and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
front-runner, wins in a landslide, Moore and Democratic hopes to
recapture the House could get buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dennis Moores will be swimming for their lives,'' Loomis
said. ``The joker in the deck is a Republican landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he survived one Republican landslide in 1980, the
year Ronald Reagan captured the presidency. Moore barely hung on to
his job as Johnson County district attorney that year. His
supporters say he would come through again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it's one of those things I can't do anything about,''
he said.

COIN DEALER BUYS HISTORIC LAS VEGAS DISPLAY OF 100 $10,000 BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Several weeks ago in a Las Vegas hotel, an
``under renovation'' notice took over the spot that for 49 years
had been made famous by a horseshoe-shaped display of $1 million in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   This week, word leaked that the famous collection of 100 $10,000
bills was not being restored, but had been sold to a Kansas City
man. To many in Las Vegas, and many of the estimated 25 million
people worldwide who've had their pictures taken with the Binion's
Horseshoe Hotel &AMP; Casino display, the question immediately became,
``Who in Kansas City would do such a thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to some people here, the question would be ``Who
else?''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Parrino, owner of The Mint and without question Kansas
City's highest-profile coin dealer, is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation is that I buy the best, the rarest,'' he said
Friday. ``This collection is a piece of Las Vegas history, the most
famous collection of currency on Earth. How could I turn away from
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, simply, shocked Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been here forever, there's no doubt it was an icon,''
said Alvin Normand, vice president of the Las Vegas Travel Bureau.
``It's a shock to find out it's gone. Everyone who knows this town
knows it. Heck, I've got pictures at home of me standing in front
of it. Everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come cheaply. The face value of the bills in the
display is $1 million. The purchase price is private, but Parrino
said he paid between face value and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer to $10 million than $1 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the man who four years ago plunked down $1.5 million
in exchange for a nickel, getting 100 $10,000 bills for less than
$10 million must have seemed like an absolute bargain.
</P>
<P>
   He's guessing that it is. For now, he plans to display the money
at a collector's show next month in Long Beach, Calif. He also
hopes to show it in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Kansas City, so I think it would be a sin not to put
this collection on display here,'' Parrino said. ``I haven't
thought about where yet. Maybe it would work at one of the casinos.
I should be able to get it done somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, he plans to break up the display and sell
each of the famous, crisp bills separately.
</P>
<P>
   Sold this way, Parrino estimates their value to be at least $10
million and maybe twice that. Several potential buyers already have
contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first deal to put Parrino, 53, in the eye of a
public beyond the collectors' world.
</P>
<P>
   He had a spat with Secret Service agents in 1996 about the
legality of a rare 1933 gold coin he was offering for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, he became the first coin collector known to bid $1
million for a single coin, paying $1.5 million at an auction for
one of the rarest coins on Earth, a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. And
last year, he paid $1.3 million for what is known as ``the grand
watermelon,'' an 1890 $1,000 bill with zeros that look like
watermelons.
</P>
<P>
   The $10,000 denomination no longer is printed. The collection,
which had been on display since 1951, makes up a huge percentage of
the number of collectible $10,000 bills in circulation. (Salmon P.
Chase, Abraham Lincoln's treasury secretary, is pictured on them.)
</P>
<P>
   Collectors estimate that there are fewer than 300 such bills
around. Parrino estimates the actual number might be much lower
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will account for 90 percent of the bills available,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not unusual for a Parrino deal. He's a firm
believer that if something is worth doing, it's worth doing big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already done pretty much everything that can be done in
coins,'' he said. ``And I've always loved paper money _ these bills
really are just gorgeous. Course, they don't go as far today as
they did when they were printed.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ minor student misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   George Gurley, a Pem-Day classmate and Kansas City Star
columnist, recalled in a 1993 article that ``Bartlett even then had
the aura and authority of a judge. He confronted the accused with
the evidence and fixed him with his steely gaze. The rascal
squirmed, then blurted out a full confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice was served, repentance was won and there was a
satisfying sense that all was well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett received his bachelor's degree from Princeton
University in 1959 and his law degree from Stanford in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that time in college was spent in Europe, with childhood
friend Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., who later went on to become chief
executive officer of Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday remembered a visit to Spain where they slept with their
heads on the tables of outdoor cafes and then ran with the bulls in
Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when he practiced law that he was still running
with a lot of bull,'' Hockaday said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That vigorous, youthful adventurism carried over into his later
intellectual life, Hockaday noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was principled, but open minded,'' Hockaday said. ``He was
not dogmatic. He was an excellent listener.''
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law with the Kansas City firm of Stinson, Mag,
Thomson, McEvers &AMP; Fizzell from 1962 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Missouri Attorney General Jack Danforth, later a U.S.
senator, hired Bartlett in 1969 and promoted him to first assistant
attorney general in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett was a steadying hand for Thomas, who joined the
attorney general's office in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd spend a lot of time fussing with things and being in too
much of a hurry,'' Thomas said. ``But he was kindly, considerate,
warm and brilliant. He always had time to talk. He was never too
busy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bartlett returned to private practice in Kansas City
with the firm of Blackwell, Sanders, Matheny, Weary &AMP; Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett also served as chairman of the board at the Linda Hall
Library of Science and Technology in Kansas City and the boards of
trustees for the Midwest Research Institute and St. Luke's Hospital
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Karen Iverson, a lawyer whom he met
while working in Jefferson City, Mo., and four children, Julia,
Linton, Amanda and Polly.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's death leaves a vacancy on the federal bench in
Western Missouri, which would be filled by presidential appointment
and Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements had not been announced Friday.

CHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE D. BROOK BARTLETT OF MISSOURI DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chief U.S. District Judge D. Brook Bartlett
of Kansas City, an exacting jurist who rewarded candid admissions
of guilt with compassion and punished waffling with stiff
sentences, died Friday afternoon after a long illness. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bartlett suffered a relapse of the bone cancer in his
spine that kept him out of trials for nine months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who worked
with Bartlett in the Missouri attorney general's office in the
1970s, said the judge's death leaves an emptiness that goes far
beyond Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judiciary has lost one of its best,'' Thomas said Friday.
``I've met a lot of people in my life and he was one of the finest
people I've ever set eyes on. They all hurt when you lose friends.
This loss leaves a huge hole in my heart. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Bartlett's death spread quickly at the federal
courthouse in Kansas City, where the flag was lowered to half staff
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known anyone with more integrity or who was more
thoughtful,'' said Senior U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright.
``His death is a great loss to this court.''
</P>
<P>
   The position of chief judge, a largely administrative and
ceremonial post, will be filled after a meeting of the active
district judges. That post often is passed to the judge with the
greatest seniority. Currently, U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple
holds that position.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's courtroom appearances grew less frequent in recent
months. Still, he watched over the cases that remained before him,
filing a report earlier this month on a procedural issue in a
relatively minor civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who was known as a tireless worker, presided over
hundreds of cases, civil and criminal, in his 19 years on the
federal bench. But perhaps he'll be remembered most for how he
conducted the lengthy hearings at which he accepted the guilty
plea, and then sentenced, former Missouri Attorney General William
Webster in a 1993 public corruption case.
</P>
<P>
   Though Webster had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and
embezzlement charges, he seemed unwilling in court to actually
acknowledge he had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett pushed Webster to establish that he was pleading guilty
because he committed the crime, not for expediency. It was a
standard that he applied consistently to every defendant who
appeared before him, whether a bank robber or the state's highest
elected law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do anything I can, if I accept these pleas of
guilty, to prevent you from walking outside this building and
telling people you're not guilty,'' Bartlett said in admonishing
Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Though Webster finally acknowledged breaking the law, sentencing
him proved no easier and even more time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   After a grueling 11-day hearing, Bartlett sentenced Webster to
two years in prison, the maximum allowed under the sentencing
guidelines and well above the 18 months recommended by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lost track of the fact that the people of the state of
Missouri entrusted power to you as an elected official,'' he told
Webster. ``You confused the personal with the public. You failed to
keep foremost in your mind you were a public trustee.''
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, after former Kansas City Councilman
Michael B. Hernandez made a straightforward admission that he had
taken $70,000 in bribes from Northland developers, Bartlett
sentenced Hernandez to 15 months, well below the 30-month maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's decision in the Webster case cemented his reputation
as a tough sentencer, but that characteristic had surfaced before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he sentenced four nuclear arms protesters to eight to
18 years in prison for damaging a Minuteman II missile silo east of
Kansas City. The sentences were upheld by the court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bartlett dismissed suggestions from some of the
activists' supporters, who contended he should have given them a
break because their motives were pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start taking motive as an excuse for committing crime,
we have a whole new judicial system,'' Bartlett observed.
</P>
<P>
   Though perceived as ``pro-prosecution'' by some defense lawyers,
as reported in the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, Bartlett
demanded high standards from government attorneys who appeared
before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pro-justice,'' said U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr.
``If that meant telling the U.S. attorney something the U.S.
attorney didn't want to hear, that was just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bartlett did just that in 1993, when he declared a
mistrial and fined the U.S. attorney's office $100 after learning
that an assistant prosecutor had failed to turn over FBI and police
reports to defense lawyers in a bank robbery case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers felt that Bartlett was always prepared to
listen, said local attorney John P. O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who ever appeared before Judge Bartlett felt that all
aspects of their case were considered, and then some,'' O'Connor
said. ``He cared about the clients, the victims, the lawyers and he
cared about the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett was appointed to the federal bench on Sept. 19, 1981,
by President Ronald Reagan. He became chief judge of the Western
District of Missouri on July 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A native Kansas Citian, Bartlett graduated from Pembroke-Country
Day School in 1955, but not before he got his first taste of the
judicial life. As president of the Pem-Day student council, he
adjudicated cases of minor student misbehavior. MORE

WHERE'S THE TREATMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Drug addicts in Ari zona have little chance of
getting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are wealthy or in jail can find programs, but the
majority have nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand people are on lists for a handful of programs. There
would be more, but the state stops taking names after 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get a place usually wait 60 to 80 days to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Most addicts can't wait two days, experts say. They lose their
resolve; they don't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Those individual failures translate into a monumental failure
for soci ety: A thousand people who don't get off drugs are 1,000
people who break the law, who fill emergency rooms, who disrupt
families, who waste lives.
</P>
<P>
   None of it makes sense, said Lupe Quintero, director of Corazon,
the only bilingual residential drug treat ment center for men in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of dollars are going to sophisticated technology to
fight the drug peddler, and forgotten are people needing help,''
Quintero said. ``Get rid of the demand for drugs by increasing
prevention and making treatment easier to get.''
</P>
<P>
   America's federal drug-fighting budget is nearly $18 billion
this year. One-third of that goes to treatment, education and
prevention, but the treatment dollars are hard to find in Arizona. &QL; 
ABUSE GROWING &QL; 
In 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, Arizona
spent $44 million on drug treatment. The federal government kicked
in $15 million of it.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's contribution has remained about the same for the past
10 years, despite a doubling of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   Spending hasn't kept pace with the state's growing problem, said
Steve Carter, whose family for decades has run the Maverick House,
a treatment and halfway facility in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 36,000 Arizona adults abuse or are dependent on
illicit drugs, according to a 1996 telephone survey by the state
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   The survey undercounted addicts because it did not include the
homeless or others without phones, said Christy Dye, director of
the Bureau of Substance Abuse for the DHS.
</P>
<P>
   The population of drug users has grown in the past five years,
primar ily because Arizona has become one of the biggest producers
of metham phetamine, Dye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, counselors started treating more meth users
than crack users,'' she said. Heroin abuse also is high in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see 10- and 12-year-old kids come into the hospital who are
already addicted,'' said Don Ald ridge, director of business
develop ment for Charter Behavioral Health Systems/Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the number of drug-related deaths is climbing.
In 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, more than
500 Arizo nans died as a result of drug use. That was up 42 percent
from five years earlier. VALUE OPTIONS Sally Lara doesn't believe
that things have ever been this bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we are turning people away,'' said the
executive director of the Phoenix branch of the National Council of
Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, which provides counseling. ``We get
over 200 calls a month from addicts wanting to clean up, or their
families. It keeps me awake, knowing the addicts are probably out
on the streets tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lara and others in the field blame the way the state distributes
money to non-profit programs such as hers, which provide the bulk
of public drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state hired a for-profit, Virginia-based health
management company, Value Options, to manage state resources for
drug and alcohol programs. The company made a number of changes
that it said would make the system more efficient and help more
people.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Value Options changed the way the state reimburses
private, non-profit treatment centers for ad dict care. The average
stay in resi dential care facilities across Phoenix dropped to
under 30 days instead of six months or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drive-through therapy,'' Quin tero said. ``The fog (of
drug use) isn't even removed . . . in many cases. There is not
enough time to get to the reasons behind a client's addic tion.''
</P>
<P>
   Value Options also is challenging the amount of care outpatient
counseling centers provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Value Options believes six group sessions is a lot, but we
think the ideal is at least 24 visits, three a week, with a year of
after-care,'' Lara said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Quintero's facility, run by the non-profit
Chicanos Por La Causa, has had empty beds, even with demand up. The
reason: Value Options' requirements and paper work are too costly,
Quintero said.
</P>
<P>
   Value Options counters that the problem is lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arizona, there are not enough dollars to take care of all
the people who need the care,'' said Helen Sommer, the company's
director of communication. ``Part of our job is to maximize the
number of people who get treated.''
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, CEO of the Arizona Council of Human Service
Providers, said the problems are the result of years of
underfunding by state law makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to paint Value Options as the bad guy; it may or may
not be true,'' he said. ``Almost all of the drug treatment centers
in the state are on shaky ground.'' FOLLOWING THE MONEY The
availability of drug treatment in Arizona depends on the kind of
addiction and what kind of addict is being treated.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, many drug rehabilitation centers are going after
federal money, which has been on the rise. The DHS received $7
million more from the federal government for drug pro grams in 1999
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the money is earmarked for special groups, such as
pregnant addicts, Native Americans, the homeless, those recently
out of jail and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there are five programs for pregnant addicts in the
state but none to help the mothers stay clean after they give
birth.
</P>
<P>
   New Arizona Family is one of the centers that has adapted. The
east-central Phoenix center used to serve male and female addicts
of all ages, but it's now switching to serve women only.
</P>
<P>
   Many other rehab slots are reserved for drug users coming
through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of inmates in all U.S. prisons were convicted of
drug-related charges, and many require treatment while serving
time.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of jail, half of all Arizonans in treatment programs
were ordered there by a court. That's up from about one-third just
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those paroled from jail can get into treatment in two or three
weeks because the court system purchases services for them and they
have probation and parole officers helping them through the
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves fewer slots for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start prioritizing groups like pregnant addicts and
criminals, it means you must turn other people away,'' Dye said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups shorted: kids.
</P>
<P>
   In Maricopa County, there are no residential rehab beds
available for minors who need to get out of their homes to get
clean or who already live on the streets, and there hasn't been
since October, said Superior Court Judge John Foreman, who started
the first juvenile drug court program in Arizona three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take kids who are seriously addicted, detoxify them
and get them into a residential treatment right away,'' he said.
``In most cases, the best we can do now is to stick them in
detention and detoxify them, and then send them home where they
couldn't stay clean before.''
</P>
<P>
   A few also get placed in a foster home or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One other option is to send them to the Department of Juvenile
Correc tions, but they have to stay at least a year to get into a
substance abuse program,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   By not providing treatment to youngsters right away, their prob
lems often intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids aren't serious addicts, but they are on a pathway to
serious adult addiction,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman hopes that the juvenile detention center someday will
have a wing for substance abuse rehabilita tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, we are relying solely on jail or prison,'' he said.
SEEKING SUPPORT Treatment and prevention programs have had tough
sledding in the Arizona Legislature over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The last major legislation was five years ago, when subsidized
substance abuse programs were expanded to impoverished Arizonans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have done is some minor tinkering with drug programs
the past decade. We haven't looked at the system that exists and
who it is serving and what happens to them afterwards,'' said Sen.
Ruth Solo mon, D-Tucson, who is leading an effort to fund more drug
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She and state Rep. Sue Gerard, R-Phoenix, want a special
appropria tion of $10 million this session from an untapped federal
fund designed to provide temporary assistance to needy families.
Much of that would be used to help parents get off drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two say that spending money on drug treatment would save
taxpayers money in the long run by keeping people out of jail and
off welfare. It also would help women have healthy babies and keep
families together, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a lot cheaper to treat them for $3,000 to $10,000 a
year vs. the $17,000 it costs to incarcerate them?'' said Jay
Levenson, vice president for Southwest Behavioral Health in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not an easy sell to legislators, many of whom view
drug addiction as a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many legislators still have this old blind notion that
treatment doesn't work and all people have to do is just say no,''
said W. Mark Clark, chief executive officer of CODAC Behavioral
Health of Tucson, which recently closed one substance abuse program
and cut back another for lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Legislature is more willing to build prisons to lock up
people who have drug abuse problems than they are willing to spend
money on treatment,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Value Options' Sommer said she's heard legislators say, ``We
will give you more money for mental health as long as you can
promise none of it will go to the substance abuser.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators say they're not against treatment, they're just
against treat ment that doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody sees that there is a need. But a lot of
people don't like throwing money down a rat hole, and I am one of
them,'' said state Rep. Karen Johnson, R-Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   As chairwoman of the Appropria tions subcommittee on health and
welfare, Johnson said she sees ``a lot of money being spent that is
not accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the courts put people in drug rehab programs,'' she
added, ``and if they don't want to go and don't want to recover, it
seems to me that is a waste of money. Before I fund anything, I
want some defini tive information that proves this is working, the
how and why.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of information can be hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health Services released a study this fall of
415 addicts who completed treatment and 60 who didn't. The study
followed the addicts for up to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Its conclusion: Those who went through rehabilitation were more
likely to have jobs and stay clean and less likely to be arrested
than those who didn't get help.
</P>
<P>
   Many state-funded programs aren't scientifically evaluated at
all, Solo mon said. She said the governor's drug policy council
needs to do a better job of gathering data so that legislators can
make better decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull said she is studying ways to assess treatment
programs, although no assessments are under way.
</P>
<P>
   She said that although more money for drug treatment is a good
idea, it has to be weighed against other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In state government, there are always more needs than there
are dollars to go around,'' she said. ``At the same time, I am
willing to push for more dollars if they can be proven effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard believes that the Legislature's resistance to funding
rehabilitation may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is more attention being paid to drug addiction this
year, it is because there is more awareness of the problem as it
touches more families, including those of legisla tors,'' she said.
``Once it has touched you in some way, you understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of drug treatment isn't lost on former drug users
including, Charlie DeMo, 46.
</P>
<P>
   A recent graduate of the Salvation Army's Harbor Lights, a
long-term drug recovery program, DeMo now has his own apartment and
car again. He visited his 22-year-old daughter, whom he hadn't seen
in many years. He plays harmonica in a church group.
</P>
<P>
   Look at him closely, and you will see a tiny black-and-white
yin-and-yang earring, reminding him to keep life balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my life back again,'' he says. About this series During
a seven-month investigation, Arizona Republic reporters spoke to
dozens of drug officers, smugglers, counselors and residents on the
Mexican border. The conclusion: We're losing the war against drugs.

TROJANS LOSE CLANCY, TURNER TO INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The euphoria of USC's overtime victory over
Arizona State lasted about a n hour Thursday night, with the
devastating news that leading-scorer Sam Clancy and sixth-man
Jarvis Turner suffered injuries that are expected to sideline them
for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy, who is also the Pacific-10 Conference's second-leading
scorer at 17.2 points per game, fractured a bone in his right foot
while shooting a layup in the s econd half of the Trojans' 95-92
victory. He had a pin placed in his foot Friday and ``cou ld be
finished for the year,'' according to USC coach Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, virtually the only contributing member of the bench,
fractured his left ankle while attempting a layup in the first
half. He already missed seven games this season after suffering a
stress fracture in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, both players are listed as being out 6-8 weeks, but
neither is expected to return this season. Clancy's injury has been
compared to the broken foot that sidelined Michigan State point
guard Mateen Cleaves for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby will start 6-foot-11 freshman Kostas Charissis at center
tonight a gainst Arizona in place of the 6-7 Clancy. Charissis has
played just three minutes in four Pac-10 games and is averaging 1.1
points and 1.4 rebounds. He last played Jan. 6 against Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking 20 points out of the lineup,'' Bibby said.
``Losing Jarvis Turner and Sam Clancy are both serious blows and we
will have to rally as a team to pic k up the slack. This sets us
back but we'll have to throw some other people in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be OK. We need to settle down and maybe not run as much
as we we re, and we need to be a better defensive team now.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries could not have come at a worse time for the Trojans
(11-5, 4-0). They are off to their best conference start since
1978-79, and had three straight emo tional victories over
Washington, UCLA and Arizona State heading into their first-place s
howdown with Arizona (15-2, 4-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but there's nothing I can do but stay
positive,'' Cl ancy said. ``These type of things happen and I'll
just have to deal with it. The team is st ill capable of winning
without Jarvis and me. Other people will have to step up in our
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Turner averaged just 1.7 points per game, he was also
considere d one of the Trojans' leaders, and helped give frontcourt
players like Brian Scalabri ne and David Bluthenthal a chance to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize how important Jarvis is to the
team,'' Sc alabrine said. ``He really keeps my mind in the game.
It's a big setback . . . and real hard for us to come back from. A
real blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Turner: ``I worked hard to come back from my first injury
and I'll work hard now.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does this all leave the Trojans?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tempering the enthusiasm generated over their
successful Pac-10 start, it means freshman guard Nate Hair and
possibly freshman guard Malachi Thurs ton will see more playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hair played 17 minutes against Arizona State and scored one
point. He is averaging 2.0 points and 1.6 rebounds. The injury
could also force USC to move shootin g guard Jeff Trepagnier back
to small forward, where he played last season.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlights the importance of losing 6-8 forward Greg
Lakey, who transferred to Loyola Marymount last spring, and 6-6
forward Shannon Swillis, who trans ferred to Fresno State in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have some other guys come in and play,'' Bibby
said. ``Ev eryone who has been starting has been playing as well as
they can play. For the younger guys, we've brought them along
slowly, showing them the water before they really got a chance to
test it. Now, they're going to have to swim.''

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Arizona Democrats were looking to make history by
turning their March presidential primary into the world's first
online election. History may have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   A voters advocacy group on Friday, Jan. 21, sued to stop the
cast-your-vote-on-the-Internet election, saying it benefits
affluent White voters at the expense of minorities who don't have
access to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Voting Integrity Project, a Virginia-based, non-profit
group, contends that Arizona's Democratic primary is also invalid
because the online election hasn't received approval from the U.S.
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotes voter turnout in predominately White
neighborhoods at the expense of minority voters,'' said Timothy
Casey, a Phoenix attorney co-representing the group. ``While the
suburbanite in north Scottsdale can sip coffee and vote, the Navajo
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey argues that the disparity goes beyond Internet access: The
online voting is available March 7-10, while people wanting to cast
a ballot at traditional polling places can do so only on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic leaders find themselves in a quandary: They
intend for the election to draw more voters, especially younger,
computer-savvy types who historically have stood on the sidelines;
instead, they are fending off allegations that the election
discriminates against ethnic minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core support of the Democratic Party is the minority
community. Why would we want to do anything to disenfranchise
them?'' asked Mark Fleisher, chairman of the Arizona Democrats.
``Believe me, the first two questions we asked was how to preserve
integrity and what about the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leaders say they didn't send the online primary
plan to the Justice Department because they weren't sure whether
the privately funded and privately run election falls under the
federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said the online plan will be on Justice Department
officials' desk by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The department then has at least 60 days to decide, which could
either delay the election or, should the election go ahead, make
the results effectively moot.
</P>
<P>
   The Voting Integrity Project is seeking a three-judge panel to
examine the merits of their case sometime next week and possibly
delay the election until the matter is settled, Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   In filing the suit, the project refers to statistics from a U.S.
Department of Commerce report on the ``digital divide'' between
minorities, in particular Native Americans, and Whites.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Commerce Department report, 32 percent of
Whites in 1998 had access to the Internet at home, compared with 10
percent of Blacks and 10 percent of Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kaibab-Paiute Nation in northern Arizona, a tribe of 240,
Chairwoman Carmen Bradley said that it's ``only been two years ago
when we actually got telephone lines available to our tribal
members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have (Internet access) at our administrative office,''
Bradley said, ``but for individual tribal persons on the
reservation, I know of none.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same case at the Fort Mojave Nation in the western part
of the state. There, few can even afford computers, Tribal
Chairwoman Nora Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would very much limit not only us, but a lot of other
low-income people without access to the Internet,'' Helton said.
``It's a small segment of the population that can even
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting Integrity Project Director Deborah Phillips says the
lawsuit does not mean that her organization is against Internet
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many potential benefits to (Internet voting) to
reach a segment that isn't participating, but party officials need
to take an intimate look at how fragile this could be before it
wreaks havoc with election integrity,'' she said. &QL;

COUNCIL SPEAKER SAYS PATAKI TAX-CUT PLAN WOULD `PUNISH' NEW YORK
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Council Speaker Peter Vallone on Friday
announced his opposition to a tax-cut plan proposed by Gov. George
Pataki that would offer $120 million in incentives to upstate
communities, saying it ``outrageously'' excludes New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like this, in all the years as
speaker,'' Vallone said Friday. ``I can only surmise this is an
attempt to punish New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's press secretary responded by calling Vallone a
hypocrite who did not appreciate the many benefits for New York
City included in the governor's $76.8 billion spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing politics in 1998 when he claimed to care about
upstate,'' said the press secretary, Michael McKeon, referring to
Vallone's unsuccessful run for governor. ``He is playing politics
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are scheduled to testify on
Monday in the state capital about Pataki's plan for the budget year
starting April 1, which includes $700 million in proposed new tax
cuts, about $120 million of which are intended exclusively for
communities north of Dutchess County. Giuliani had no comment
Friday on Pataki's budget, his press secretary, Sunny Mindel, said.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate communities like Buffalo, Niagara and Syracuse have had
modest growth in their employment base in the last five years, but
far less than the 8.9 percent jump statewide and the 11.8
percentage increase in jobs in New York City, a New York state
Department of Labor spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed offering upstate employers tax credits,
interest-free loans and discounts on electric power if they create
new jobs, particularly higher-paying computer positions or other
technology-related spots. The special incentives have been backed
by the state Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who said
Friday through a spokesman that it was entirely fair to give
exclusive benefits to a struggling part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, said: ``It is very simple.
Downstate has grown three times as fast during this most recent
economic expansion, so the governor's plan make sense. We did the
same thing for New York City in the 1970s when it was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who is considered a likely candidate for mayor in 2001,
rejected the suggestion by Pataki's office that he was playing
politics. He said he was not calling for Pataki to back away from
his economic development plan. Instead, he wants at least parts of
New York City _ like the Bronx, which had a 7.8 percent
unemployment rate in November compared with the 4.8 percent
statewide average _ included in the incentive package.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Vallone will express opposition to two other
provisions in Pataki's budget. One would impose a new $250 annual
water supply fee on 80,000 New York City businesses. The other
would give the city only 36 percent of the state's public school
money _ around $4.6 billion _ when the city's students make up 39
percent of the state's student population.

WENKSTERN, 87, TONKA TOYS CHIEF AND TRUCK CO-DEVELOPER

<P>
   VENICE, Fla. _ Russell L. Wenkstern, who as the chief executive
of Tonka Toys made them a household name, died on Tuesday in Spring
Park, Minn. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Wenkstern lived in Mound, Minn., and had a winter home in
Venice, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   While Wenkstern was chief executive and president of Tonka Toys
from 1961 to 1977 he helped develop one of the nation's most
popular toys, the Tonka dump truck, working closely with its
designer, and he designed several other truck cabs.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the big yellow Mighty Dump, the dream toy of many
young boys, accounted for nearly $15 million in sales for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Wenkstern was born on Oct. 1, 1912, in Garber, Iowa. In 1936, he
graduated from Teachers College at Ellendale, N.D., then taught
classes in industrial arts, math and science and coached sports at
schools in Oklahoma, North Dakota, Minnesota and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Wenkstern gave up teaching and took a job with Streater
Industries, a manufacturer of drugstore fixtures and wooden toys.
After three years, he left to develop another toy manufacturer,
Moulded Products.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he became secretary of the board and production manager
for Mound Metal Craft, later Tonka Toys. Nine years later,
Wenkstern moved into the top position at Tonka.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, Tonka, based in Minnesota, became a
worldwide company. It established marketing and production
operations in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Britain, Germany,
France and Belgium. The company's annual sales rose to $80 million
from $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Wenkstern was inducted into the Toy Hall of
Fame in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 64 years, Lucille; a son, Grant;
three daughters, Vonnie Garens, Mary and Janet; two brothers, Grant
and Kermit; nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

JACKSON HOPES REST IS ANSWER FOR SHAQ'S SLUMPING OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson hopes to
stem two disconcerting trends tonight, but he might have to settle
for just taking care of one.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, noting a decline in Shaquille O'Neal's offensive
efficiency, wants to cut back his minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's greater concern is a mini-slump that's seen the
Lakers go 2-2 over the last week. So O'Neal is probably in for
another 40-minute ride when the Lakers play host to the Portland
Trail Blazers tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers arrive with a 29-10 record, second in the NBA only
to the Lakers (33-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think it's good to play good opponents whenever
you're struggling a little bit,'' Jackson said. ``It gives you
definition, win or lose, as to how you're doing, where your
preparation is, and what the focus of the team has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lakers can sustain a safe lead, expect to see O'Neal
on the bench for a bit longer than usual. O'Neal is averaging 39.6
minutes per game and has played 47 minutes in two of the last four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile his shooting percentage, once over .590, is
plummeting. O'Neal is shooting just 52 percent over the last five
games, while averaging 44.4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An unconcerned O'Neal said the shooting woes are not a product
of fatigue and dismissed the idea he needs more rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need rest, I don't need like a five-, six-minute rest.
I need a drink of water, one or two minutes, then I can get back in
the game,'' he said. ``Most the time I get tired, I just suck it
up.... It's just a day-to-day thing. It's more beat up than
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Second-year guard Tyronn Lue probably will miss the
rest of the regular season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on
his right knee Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lue had bone fragments and tissue removed by team physician Dr.
Stephen Lombardo at the Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center. He is out for a
minimum of three months, placing his earliest possible return date
in late April, when the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe time: Kobe Bryant said he decided not to compete in the
NBA's slam-dunk contest next month because he would rather
concentrate on the Lakers' drive for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just my focus, where my focus is right now, with the team and
winning games. That's all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the slam-dunk contest posed a distraction, Bryant said,
``Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   He also declined a spot in the 2ball competition, but will be
plenty busy over All-Star weekend. He's secured a starting spot for
the Western Conference team on Sunday and will be performing a song
from his upcoming album with supermodel Tyra Banks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As for defending the slam-dunk title he won as a rookie in 1997,
he said, ``I will eventually. Just not this year.''

U.S. HALTS HUMAN RESEARCH AT ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ala.)  (CORRECTS name of university in lede) 
 (With SCI-GENE-THERAPY) 
(jw) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of problems for universities over
federal ethical rules, the University of Alabama-Birmingham was
told on Thursday to shut down about a quarter of its research
involving human subjects, about 550 experiments, mostly medical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The order came from the Office of Protection from Research
Risks, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. It
did not restrict the university's ability to conduct other
research.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama action was the agency's seventh such move in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, as in each of the other cases, the agency found that
the university had frequently violated federal rules. Under these
rules, researchers who want to use federal funds for research on
humans must obtain prior approval for their plans to assure that
patients will be safe and will be informed about the risks they
will face.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for each experiment must be approved by a university
review board, and then the experiment must be checked later to see
if the original plans and the ethical rules are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials told the university that its review board
routinely failed to check whether the research was being conducted
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Turnbough, a university spokeswoman, said the experiments
with patients already enrolled or about to be enrolled might be
restarted within days as the review board checked to see that
guidelines were being followed. A more complete review of each case
would take longer, Ms. Turnbough said.

DEFENSEMEN CARRY LOAD FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov says he can't wait
for the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   And not because he's playing in the Feb. 6 game.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's 3-1 loss to Anaheim, in which Joe Nieuwendyk
and Jere Lehtinen joined an already-crowded injury list, the
All-Star break became a mini-finish line of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday ``night was a reality check because that's the first
time it was put forward that there were no players coming back
until after the All-Star break,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``And that's reality. That means there are seven, eight, nine games
that we have to play with the group that is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if the Stars can hold on until the All-Star
break, then the cavalry will arrive. Players such as defensemen
Derian Hatcher and Shawn Chambers and winger Jamie Langenbrunner
are expected to begin returning after the break.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of responsibility for holding on thesix games before the
break falls to defensemen Zubov, Darryl Sydor and Richard
Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   How important are they?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see by the minutes,'' Stars assistant coach Rick
Wilson said. ``It's not by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor played 30 minutes, 27 seconds against Anaheim on Wednesday
and 23:25 against Los Angeles in a 5-2 victory Thursday, scoring a
goal and assisting on two others. Matvichuk played 29:11 and 30:08,
assisting on three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov played a game-high 34:28 against Anaheim and 30:58 against
LA, assisting on two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really tired,'' Zubov admitted. ``The first couple of
shifts you struggle and fight it, but this is the way it is right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   For sake of comparison, the NHL leader in ice time averages
29:40, and he's Hatcher, one of the players these three are having
to replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the state right now with all three of them where it's
just play the game,'' Hitchcock said. ``Practice is irrelevant for
those guys. It's just the way it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, more impressive than the extra minutes is the way these
three have played in those minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have they chipped in offensively with a goal and seven
assists in the Stars' past two games, but they've also played
strong defensively. The role is nothing new for Matvichuk, but
Zubov and Sydor had reputations as skilled defensemen who can shoot
but can't hit.
</P>
<P>
   That label may have to be reconsidered based on the recent
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zubov has been playing in tough defending scenarios and doing
great,'' Wilson said. ``Sydor's also involved in that. Really, I
think all three of them have stepped up and played well in both
ends but certainly played well in defending areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' goals-against average is 2.23, second best in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But the injuries to Nieuwendyk and Lehtinen will further test
the defense. When a team loses scorers, the defense feels more
pressure to limit opponents' scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Stars need guys like Zubov, Sydor and even Matvichuk
to chip in offensively even more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep shots down and get an opportunity to get
going the other way,'' Sydor said. ``Obviously, when you play 30
minutes, you can't go every time. We're just trying to keep it
simple. That's our whole motto: Keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and: Bring on the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov sat in his locker stall after the game Thursday, an ice
pack strapped to his shoulder. He has been doing a lot more leading
with it lately. He has a lot greater understanding of what Hatcher
does every night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he just can't wait to give him his role back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Zubov said. ``As soon as possible.''

BRACK WON'T RETURN TO DEFEND INDY 500 CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Team Rahal has decided not to compete in the 84th Indianapolis
500 in May, a decision that will deny reigning champion Kenny Brack
the opportunity to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   Citing prohibitive costs, team owner Bobby Rahal announced
Thursday that he had decided against competing in the cornerstone
event of the Indy Racing League. Brack, the 1998 IRL champion, won
the 1999 Indy 500 while driving for IRL car owner A.J. Foyt of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Brack joined Team Rahal, which competes in the rival
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series, last fall. Rahal had
considered purchasing IRL-approved engines and chassis for the Indy
500, which has been boycotted by most CART teams in a dispute with
IRL founder Tony George beginning with the 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it bluntly, given the cost that it takes to go there,
it's not worth it,'' said Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 champion. ``Just
to buy the cars and the engines, you're talking well over $1
million \Rfor a two-driver team\S, and that's not including the
time and money for testing.''
</P>
<P>
   CART revamped its 2000 schedule to eliminate conflicts for its
teams wishing to race at the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway
on May 28. As many as a dozen CART teams were rumored to be
purchasing IRL equipment. But in light of pressure exerted on CART
teams by engine suppliers Ford and Mercedes-Benz, George said the
original estimate has shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see two or three teams, maybe,'' George said
during the ``Texas Tour 2000'' at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth. ``I think \Rcar-owner\S Derrick Walker is planning to do a
full \RIRL\S season, and Chip Ganassi is close to deciding. We're
going to be sending out entry forms on Feb. 14. The deadline is
about April 14 or so, so we'll see.'' \Nsubheds:Ray retaining focus
Reigning IRL champion Greg Ray of Plano said he cannot afford to
let the testing accident that left friend and driver Sam Schmidt
paralyzed to detract from his preparation for the 2000 season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, 35, was paralyzed from the clavicle down after a crash
suffered during the IRL's Open Test at the Walt Disney World
Speedway in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., on Jan. 6. The IRL will open
its fifth season with the Delphi 200 at WDWS on Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad and tragic what happened,'' Ray said during the
preview at TMS. ``But if I'm going to continue to drive I can't
focus on those things because those are big distractions. It's a
double-edged sword, because it hurts. It's probably one of the
toughest things mentally I've had to deal with because sometimes it
seems very cold or callous or selfish. But every driver has to come
to grips with those things in a different way.'' \Nsubheds:Outlaws
revise format Pennzoil World of Outlaws officials will operate with
a revised racing format this season. The series' Sprint Car drivers
will continue to run two time-trial laps and compete in qualifying
heat races, but an extra dash race will earn positions in the main
event.
</P>
<P>
   A single dash, consisting of the fastest qualifiers for the main
event through heat races, has been run for close to 10 years. This
season will see two dashes of 10 cars determining the top-20
positions for the 24-car ``A'' Main.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old format, when you finished in the top five in your
heat you automatically got your time back. But what we found was
that once they got in the top five there was a lot of coasting,''
said Ted Johnson, president and founder of the Plano-based Outlaws.
``Last year we made a few little changes, but this winter this hit
us like a brick and we came up with the right formula.''

RAMS REVERSAL BREATHES LIFE INTO ST. LOUIS SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For a town whose principal landmark is a monument to
all the people who left, voluntarily and eagerly, what's happening
here borders on the freakish.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway Arch, built to salute those who said, ``Let's dust
this burg for California,'' now seems to be the symbolic threshold
to return across for a civic re-birth.
</P>
<P>
   The party hits a peak here Sunday. A place renowned most
recently for the Mark McGwire phenomenon hosts another
physiological aberration, the NFC Championship game featuring the
preposterous renaissance of the NFL Rams.
</P>
<P>
   They meet the equally unlikely Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The
likelihood four months ago that these two teams would meet in this
place, the Trans World Dome, for a championship is only slightly
greater than a John Rocker presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To put a cherry on the thing, the Rams are eye-popping 14-point
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the two-season McGwire home-run festival, and
coupled with rise of the Blues as one of the National Hockey League
elite, St. Louis is suddenly awash in sports delirium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some rash talk in this town,'' Rams fan Jim Wright
said between bites of lunch at Dierdorf &AMP; Hart's, a downtown eatery
owned by two locally eminent football names, Dan Dierdorf and Jim
Hart. ``The talk is of championships in football, hockey and
baseball. In one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rash talk. Don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Wright offered up the slightest smile. He might have been the
only St. Louisan bothering to be coy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' single-season turnaround from 4-12 to 14-3 has made
all dreams possible. If the Blues regain their defensive edge and
the Cardinals' new pitchers deliver, St. Louis will be so
hyper-cool that Lewis and Clark will regret they ever left.
</P>
<P>
   Too much cannot be said about the Rams' reversal, although we
will attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the deadness surrounding this city's first NFL team,
the Cardinals, that not once in its 27-year history was a playoff
game played here.
</P>
<P>
   The travail, due mostly to the incompetence of the Bidwill
ownership family, was so pervasive that the franchise decamped
after the 1987 season to Phoenix. Arizonans have yet to forgive the
good people of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, the market stock boy turned NFL
MVP whose story seems destined for at least six TV movies, grew up
a few hours north of here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and recalls almost
nothing of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Cowboys fan,'' he said. ``Some relatives were Bears
fans, some friends followed the Chiefs. Nobody was particularly
interested in the Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-year vacuum, a little reverse migration kicked in
_ St. Louis stole the Rams from California, where legions of
Midwesterners, including a St. Louis native by the name of Georgia
Frontiere, had trekked for decades in the hopes of not spending
another winter at the business end of a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the football results did not change from the
Cardinals era. The Rams' first four years in St. Louis amounted to
a 22-42 dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   But in one season that has visited the frontiers of the sporting
imagination, Warner, running back Marshall Faulk and coach Dick
Vermeil's touchy-feely magic have morphed the Rams into one of the
most wicked offensive attacks in years.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams exploited the salary cap system for five free agents
who became starters, gave up only second- and fifth-round picks to
Indianapolis for Faulk and, regarding Warner, simply were luckier
than broken-slot-machine night at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also are proof that the salary cap system, and its
almost mandatory parity, means that once a top football executive
and coach are selected, ownership is a much smaller factor in
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, the one-time lounge singer and TV weather woman who
inherited the Rams from her late husband Carroll Rosenbloom in
1979, was seen for two decades as a prime impediment to franchise
success.
</P>
<P>
   Now the prodigal daughter has returned from Hollywood, after six
husbands and countless failed quarterbacks, to civic heroine
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis feels right,'' she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
``I feel I belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudden life after 40 years of flat-line football has created a
sense of belong and passion among more than Frontiere. As a
prominent billboard on the main freeway from the airport put it,
``Wham, bam, thank you Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a great sports town, and they've been waiting
for a while just to have a winner,'' Warner said. ``They backed us
for the last four years here when we weren't doing anything. We
were playing bad football, and they were just waiting for their
chance to jump on and ride in with a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if St. Louis doesn't know sports success. The
baseball Cardinals have produced nine World Series championships.
But the last was in 1982, and the town had already lost the NBA in
the '60s and then the NFL in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   So the Rams and Blues have been met with eager embrace. And
there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the truest sign of St. Louis' re-emergence on the
contemporary sports scene was when Bill Laurie, married to a
Wal-Mart heir and allegedly worth $1.2 billion, recently tried to
buy the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies from Seattle's John McCaw, who's
also a Mariners part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie owns the Blues and their home, Kiel Center, and had some
open dates he wanted to fill. But he pulled out of the bid
officially Thursday, when it was plain NBA Commissioner David Stern
had no intention of letting Laurie move the team here.
</P>
<P>
   Seems a city can't be major league unless it has a sports
pirate.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of centuries of watching folks pass through,
there's nothing like two or three sports championships to turn the
Arch into a hook for the heartland wayward.

U.S. HALTS HUMAN RESEARCH AT ALABAMA-BIRMINGHAM
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ala.)  (CORRECTS name of university in head) 
 (With SCI-GENE-THERAPY) 
(jw) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of problems for universities over
federal ethical rules, the University of Alabama-Birmingham was
told on Thursday to shut down about a quarter of its research
involving human subjects, about 550 experiments, mostly medical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The order came from the Office of Protection from Research
Risks, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. It
did not restrict the university's ability to conduct other
research.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama action was the agency's seventh such move in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, as in each of the other cases, the agency found that
the university had frequently violated federal rules. Under these
rules, researchers who want to use federal funds for research on
humans must obtain prior approval for their plans to assure that
patients will be safe and will be informed about the risks they
will face.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for each experiment must be approved by a university
review board, and then the experiment must be checked later to see
if the original plans and the ethical rules are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials told the university that its review board
routinely failed to check whether the research was being conducted
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Turnbough, a university spokeswoman, said the experiments
with patients already enrolled or about to be enrolled might be
restarted within days as the review board checked to see that
guidelines were being followed. A more complete review of each case
would take longer, Ms. Turnbough said.

BOSTON MASSACRE ENDS SONICS' WINNING STREAK AT SEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sonics coach Paul Westphal tried everything.
</P>
<P>
   He interrupted the commotion early and often. He tried
uncustomary lineup combinations, searching for energy, grit.
</P>
<P>
   Something.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal even challenged one of his players to perform or buy a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   The ballhandling? All over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Their shots? Crooked.
</P>
<P>
   Defense? The only stop the Sonics put on the Celtics was when
they exited the court after a 111-86 pounding Friday night in the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Sonics have played the past three weeks, they
were startlingly bad in having their league-high win streak snapped
at seven.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: This was, well, a stinker. Boston ran the Sonics
ragged in what had to be an aberration, considering the Sonics lost
for just the second time in the past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to lose, you might as well get blown out. That
seems to be our philosophy,'' Westphal said. ``We've had it happen
to us a few times this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But never like this.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Sonics tried swam like a rock against the quick,
energetic, 19-20 Celtics. It was evident the Sonics would remain
impaired after the first two minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly fell behind 28-18 and trailed 37-22 with 10:03 left
in the second quarter. By the time Westphal decided to remove Gary
Payton _ the last starter to sit _ the Sonics trailed 84-52 with
2:26 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth period was garbage time with the Sonics playing their
reseves and never getting closer than 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play basketball and we paid for it,'' said Payton,
who had 13 points but no 3-pointers for the first time this season.
``Everybody looked bad. It happened and now we have to go and start
another streak.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not show it, but the Sonics had been deft on the road.
Part of having their six-game road win streak halted had to do with
uncustomary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did not arrive in Boston until seven hours before
tipoff. A snow storm Thursday night forced the team to remain in
Milwaukee. Normally, NBA teams fly to their next destination
immediately after road games. The situation kept the Sonics from
practicing before playing Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the benefits of that,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said.
``We'll take our wins any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the arena being abnormally cold, some players
admitted being tired. The Sonics played their fourth game in five
nights. It was also the second consecutive game on this
four-in-five-nights road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was tired, but with the money we get paid it's all
about determination and heart,'' Sonics center Horace Grant said.
``We have to go out there and at least give an effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said not practicing hurts preparation. But he gave the
Celtics credit for dominating in their fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny that it was the fourth game in five nights. You
can't deny that the travel was a hassle,'' said Westphal, whose
team shot just 37 percent. ``You can't deny that it was freezing in
the building. The score was still 0-0 and they beat us. They had
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker had 19 points and led the Sonics' brief surge when
they got within 39-33 midway through the second. However, Boston
finished the quarter with a 22-8 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play defense,'' Baker said. ``The reason we had the
seven-game win streak is because we played great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker's buzzer-beating 3-pointer from 36 feet provided
an example of how explosive and opportunistic the Celtics were.
That basket buried the Sonics in a 61-41 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no excuses,'' Payton said. ``We just lost. We played
bad. This is the NBA. If you can play basketball, you can play any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics stumbled in their attempt to win eight straight games
for the first time since the 1997-98 season with former coach
George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   After the game a reporter suggested the Celtics played like
those celebrated Boston teams because legendary center Bill Russell
attended the game. Westphal quickly pointed out that Russell still
lives in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, Russell could later be found joking around with
Sonics players in the visitor's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was the only breath of fresh air on the Sonics'
unpleasant night.

OH, THE EXCITEMENT _ OF TIMEOUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many facets that make basketball exciting. Great
shots. No-look passes. Buzzer-beating baskets. Coaches calling
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, there are few moments in all of basketball that
are as thrilling or spontaneous as when a coach reaches up and
makes a ``T'' with two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NCAA has done fans a huge favor, adding to the
excitement by granting more timeouts. That's right, the
pause-and-play boredom of the NBA is now available at an NCAA game
_ men's or women's _ near you.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, the NCAA Division I men's basketball rules
committee decided to restructure the number and length of timeouts.
Teams used to have two full timeouts (60 seconds) and one 20-second
timeout in addition to a game's four ``television'' timeouts each
half. Now teams have five 30-second timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters is that these 30-second timeouts do not
negate the ``television'' timeouts that are automatically taken as
soon as there is a stoppage in play after four-minute intervals in
each half _ whether or not the game is televised.
</P>
<P>
   What was this committee thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had gotten it through some meetings with executives from
CBS,'' said Marty Benson, the NCAA's staff liaison for the rules
committee.
</P>
<P>
   What a stunner. TV executives recommending stoppages in play to
air precious commercials. Even if a game isn't televised, the same
timeout format applies. When all this mess is added up there are a
possible 18 timeouts. This is part of the NCAA's effort to shorten
the overall length of games?
</P>
<P>
   Is this some paradox that really means to speed something up it
must slow something down? This isn't mysticism, it's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dislike it,'' TCU women's coach Jeff Mittie said. ``We have
too many timeouts, and they aren't long enough. I think the game is
being stopped too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember that end-of-game excitement that was used to be
prevalent in college basketball? Sure you do. Tie game, maybe a
timeout left per team and the game had a real flow. The end wasn't
some pre-scripted shot, it was a spontaneous play with fluid
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with plenty of timeouts, it means this: a shot, followed by
a timeout. Another shot, followed by a timeout. Repeat sequence
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the game is over, the fans are furious and the
referees are drawing overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's to make the games go quicker, but I think it's
for TV and commercials,'' Mittie said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Almighty _ television _ speaks, the NCAA listens.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this step validates the arrival of women's basketball on
the national scene; TV calling the shots is somehow a rite of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this passage television executives forgot that
moving the start of a game here or there is one thing. It's
something else to intervene and throw in stoppages for more
commercials. The timeouts affect the play and damage a game's
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other rule in that it could be changed at the
end of the year,'' the NCAA's Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Great, change it. Go back to the old way _ four media timeouts
plus two full timeouts per team. People don't want to see
stoppages, they want to see games.  &LR; subheds:FAST BREAKS
 &LR; subheds:Fast start in Abilene  &LR; agatea:Scholarships ... who needs
em? Hardin-Simmons coach Julie Goodenough apparently doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In her seventh season as head coach, the Cowgirls are undefeated
(15-0) and off to their best start in the program's history. They
are ranked No. 1 in the NCAA Division III South region and are 3-0
in the American Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Their previous best start was an 11-0 beginning in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Dating to last season, Hardin-Simmons has won 28 consecutive
regular-season games and 31 of its past 32 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowgirls are seeking a return to the NCAA Tournament, where
they finished in the Sweet 16 in their first NCAA appearance.
 &LR; subheds:Lipscomb tragedy  &LR; agatea:Lipscomb freshman Kaia Jergenson,
who has been hospitalized with meningitis since Jan. 4, recently
had to have both of her legs amputated below the knees.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old was listed in critical condition after surgery
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctors are confident the disease has not caused brain
damage and that she can make a complete neurological recovery, the
family said in a statement. Doctors, however, believe the disease
also damaged her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jergenson was one of the top players for Lipscomb, an NAIA
school in Nashville, Tenn. She was the Class AAA tournament MVP
while playing for Nashville's Gallatin High School last year.
 &LR; subheds:Heating up  &LR; agatea:Not that the Pac-10 was ever a weak
conference, but the emergence of Arizona and Arizona State could
mean a couple of more NCAA Tournament berths.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, ranked 16th, is off to its best start ever at 14-3 and
recently posted its first road sweep of Washington and Washington
State. The Wildcats' victory against the Huskies on Jan. 15 was
Arizona's first victory in 14 attempts in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State is 4-1 in conference play, the school's best
conference start since 1986-87. The Sun Devils' 78-74 victory
against USC Thursday marks the first time they have defeated the
Trojans in consecutive meetings.
</P>
<P>
   With an 11-4 record, coach Charli Turner Thorne has led Arizona
State to double figures in victories in each of the past three
seasons.  &LR; subheds:Plenty of bad seats available  &LR; agatea:Speaking of
Arizona State, the Sun Devils announced that their first meeting
against Tennessee, scheduled for Dec. 28, will be played at Bank
One Ballpark, which seats more than 48,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game has the ability to be one of the greatest events in
women's basketball history,'' Arizona State coach Charli Turner
Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, home of Major League Baseball's Arizona
Diamondbacks, is equipped with a retractable roof. If everything
goes right, the game should break the NCAA women's single-game
attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   The record was set by Tennessee _ shocker _ when 24,597 fans
watched the Lady Vols beat Connecticut at Thompson-Boling Arena on
Jan. 3, 1998, in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be televised nationally with proceeds from tickets
sales to benefit breast-cancer research.  &LR; subheds:Good timing
 &LR; agatea:This past Sunday, Kentucky celebrated its 25th anniversary
of women's basketball as a varsity sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats put an exclamation on the party by defeating
Arkansas for the first time since 1996 in front of a season-high
crowd of 5,139. Other Catchings makes impression for Illinois While
her younger sister continues a tradition, Tauja Catchings decided
to build one.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' 6-foot-1 senior forward is the older sister of
Tennessee All-American Tamika Catchings. Both were high school
All-Americans with credentials to earn a scholarship to any school.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tamika, who is one in a long line of Lady Vols greats,
Tauja is a part of arguably the most successful run in her team's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I came here U of I hadn't had a lot of success,''
said Tauja Catchings, who averages 15.1 points and 8.1 rebounds.
``We used to play in this little gym and now we play at Assembly
Hall. We have a brand new practice facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Catchings began playing in the 1996-97 season, Illinois
(14-7) hadn't had a winning record in 10 seasons. In her first
season, and the second for coach Theresa Grentz, the Illini
finished 24-8. They have reached two NCAA Tournament Sweet 16s and
are ranked No. 13 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good to walk into practice every day and see
those NCAA Tournament banners,'' Catchings said. ``That says a lot
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she speaks to her younger sister every day and that
eventually, she hopes to play alongside her professionally. Playing
against her, apparently, can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played against each other we would fight all the
time,'' she said. ``It was brutal. Our parents would always have to
separate us. I think the worst I ever got was a bloody nose.''
 &LR; subheds:Who's better?  &LR; agatea:Here's a comparison of the Catchings
sisters, Tauja and Tamika. Tauja Catchings is not expected to take
the majority of shots and accordingly her numbers aren't as good as
her sister. Tauja Tamika Pos. F Yr: Sr. Jr. Ht: 6-1 6-1 Ppg: 15.2
15.2 Rpg: 8.1 7.3 Apg: 2.2 2.4 Team's Record: 14-7 13-3 Team's
Rank: 13 2 THE VERDICT: Offensively, Tamika Catchings has few peers
on the collegiate level; she does just about everything. Tauja

COWBOYS' JIM BATES SET TO JOIN DOLPHINS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys, without a head coach or an
offensive coordinator since Chan Gailey's firing Jan. 11, now
expect to lose Jim Bates, assistant head coach/defensive line, to
the Miami Dolphins as their defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is heading in that direction, ... \Rand\S I would
get the job on Monday,'' said Bates, who is scheduled to fly to
Miami tomorrow afternoon and meet with new Dolphins head coach Dave
Wannstedt the following day. ``It's not official until Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 53, has been offered the job by Wannstedt, who may end up
with both Gailey and Bates as his coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey still hopes to get a second head-coaching opportunity but
if nothing pans out, Wannstedt is interested in the former Cowboys
head coach/offensive coordinator as his offensive coordinator.
Gailey and Wannstedt are expected to meet Tuesday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's best chance to be a head coach again right away seems
to be with the New Orleans Saints, especially if Tom Donahoe, who
recently resigned as director of football operations at Pittsburgh,
ends up as general manager in New Orleans. Gailey and Donahoe spent
four seasons together with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose Jim Bates, I really do. He's a good man and an
outstanding coach,'' said Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo,
who remains a candidate for the Cowboys' head-coaching job. Campo
and special teams coach Joe Avezzano are the leading candidates
inside the Cowboys' organization to succeed Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was unavailable for comment yesterday
on the search for a new head coach. The latest names to surface as
possible candidates are St. Louis Rams wide receivers coach Al
Saunders and Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach and former
Raiders coach Art Shell.
</P>
<P>
   They join New England Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese, Patriots quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly, Chicago Bears
offensive coordinator Gary Crowton and Denver Broncos offensive
coordinator Gary Kubiak.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys offensive line coach Hudson Houck said yesterday that he
is ``not actively pursuing'' the position, although his name has
been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Bates spent four seasons with the Cowboys, including the past
two with the ``assistant head coach'' title. He coached linebackers
in 1996-97 and defensive line in 1998-99, helping to develop such
linebacker talent as Fred Strickland, Randall Godfrey and 1999 Pro
Bowl selection Dexter Coakley, then getting the most out of the
Cowboys' highly successful defensive-line rotation this past
season.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bates' gung-ho tutelage, Greg Ellis, Kavika Pittman and
Chad Hennings helped anchor a solid defensive line along with
Alonzo Spellman, who was switched late in training camp from
defensive end to defensive tackle and turned out to be a
comeback-player-of-the-year candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed every day coming to work here,'' Bates said.
``This year was especially gratifying because of everything that
was written about us. ``Football News'' called us the worst
defensive line in the league before the season. We used all of that
\Rto get motivated\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates' successor as the defensive line coach could be former
Cowboys defensive end Jim Jeffcoat, who has assisted Bates the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RJeffcoat\S has done a great job. He has really made strides
... \Rand\S is going to make a great coach,'' said Campo, who said
he isn't sure if the defensive-line chores will be handled by one
or two people next season.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt created the opening for Bates by firing defensive
coordinator George Hill, who spent the past 11 of his 21 NFL
seasons with the Dolphins. Defensive line coach Cary Godette was
also relieved of his duties yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was Steve Spurrier's first defensive coordinator at the
University of Florida (1990) and sees the Dolphins job as a great
chance to work with Wannstedt and inherit top-line defensive
personnel, most of them under contract.

TROUBLED ROOKIE SMITH WOULD LIKE TO PLAY FOR ROCKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Now that he's close to receiving his
$1.447 million buyout package from the Mavericks, rookie Leon Smith
said he would like to sign a contract with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets worked Smith out before last summer's NBA draft and
liked the athletic ability and power that they saw in the 6-foot-10
forward. Smith is in Houston working out with Purvis Short, the
director of player programs for the NBA players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shown me a lot of love ever since the day I came in
and worked out for them,'' Smith told Houston TV station KRIV.
``Ever since that, it was fun. They showed me nothing but
hospitality, and that's all I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said he will be releasing a compact disc in about two
months that he plans to dedicate to his mother, Linda Sue Smith.
Smith will be rapping poetry on the CD. A portion of it goes like
this: ``I dedicate this song to you, Linda Sue I thank you for
having me, so I thank you for you And I really care about you,
though I never told you And if anybody ever told you stories, you
know I owe you.'' Nelson near 900 A victory over the New Jersey
Nets today would provide Mavericks coach Don Nelson with his 900th
career victory.
</P>
<P>
   That would put him in an exclusive club; Lenny Wilkens (1,164),
Pat Riley (970), Bill Fitch (944), Red Auerbach (938) and Dick
Motta (935) are the only coaches who have won 900 NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   But getting No. 900 against a Nets team that beat the surging
Detroit Pistons on Thursday, 122-120, won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a tough team at their home,'' guard Erick Strickland
said. ``So we've got to go in and definitely play the way we played
\RWednesday against Washington\S and give it our best effort, and
hopefully he'll get \RNo. 900\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has a 899-735 record in 22 seasons. He has said this will
be his final season coaching, and Mark Cuban, the Mavericks owner
pending NBA approval, has said Nelson won't be coaching the
Mavericks after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that he's coached that many games and put that
many wins up on the board,'' forward Cedric Ceballos said.
``Hopefully we'll get some more wins for him, and he can be even
higher on that list.'' Briefly Mavs' point guard Steve Nash plans
to play in today's game against the New Jersey Nets. Nash hasn't
played since straining a tendon in his right ankle in a Nov. 29
game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley was in the NBA Entertainment studios in
Secaucus, N.J., yesterday talking basketball on NBA.comTV.

GENEVA DEAL REACHED ON YOUNG SOLDIERS AFTER U.S. REVERSES STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``protocol'' to ``accord'' in 1st graf) 
(bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Negotiators in Geneva agreed Friday on a new
international accord prohibiting the use of child soldiers in war
after the United States dropped its opposition to establishing 18
as the minimum age for sending soldiers into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from the Pentagon,
had insisted for months that any agreement allow the United States
the option of sending volunteers as young as 17 into combat. The
administration's opposition had threatened to block efforts to
revise the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to
raise the minimum age for soldiers to 18 from 15.
</P>
<P>
   But in internal discussion during the last two weeks, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff dropped their opposition to a minimum of 18 and
accepted a compromise that would allow the armed services to
continue recruiting and training 17-year-olds as they do today, but
take ``all feasible measures'' to keep them out of combat until
they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. reversal cleared the way for negotiators from 50
countries to agree on new guidelines governing children in combat
after a final round of negotiations in Geneva. The protocol
agreement, which the U.N. General Assembly must approve before
governments can begin to ratify it, would also prohibit the
drafting of children younger than 18 and would require countries to
raise the minimum age for volunteers above 15, the convention's
current standard.
</P>
<P>
   As with many treaties, the countries that agree to those
international standards on child soldiers are expected to be the
ones least likely to violate them. Some of the most egregious
violators may not sign, while others may sign and simply ignore the
provisions, given that the protocol provides no real enforcement to
punish violators.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and other supporters of the
protocol agreement said Friday that it would help to stigmatize the
use of children in combat, especially since the Convention on the
Rights of the Child has strong international support. Only the
United States and Somalia have yet to ratify overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. compromise amounts to a tactical retreat by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who had feared that a strict age limit would
prohibit recruiters from signing up 17-year-olds, who today can
join the military with parental consent. The Pentagon won the right
to continue that practice but agreed to take still-unspecified
steps to keep those youngest soldiers and sailors out of direct
warfare, administration and defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiefs weren't crazy about it,'' a defense official in
Washington said, ``but we felt we could live with it with that kind
of construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new minimum will have little real effect on the U.S.
military, which has nearly 1.4 million men and women in uniform.
Last year, 49,900 enlistees were 17 when they signed up to join the
armed services, but only 11,000 were still 17 when they reported to
basic training. Of those, only 2,500 had not turned 18 by the time
training was completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's retreat saved the administration the
diplomatic embarrassment of blocking an agreement meant to prohibit
the use of soldiers as young as 9 or 10 in some of the world's most
brutal conflicts, a policy that officials at the State Department
strongly advocated. Experts have estimated that as many as 300,000
children are fighting in wars from Africa to Chechnya to Latin
America, many of them drafted against their will.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked as if the negotiations would end like
those on an international treaty to ban land mines. In that case,
the Pentagon's opposition to a broad ban kept the administration
from signing the treaty, despite support from the State Department
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protocol is an important advance for human rights,'' the
president said in a statement released by the White House on
Friday. ``At the same time, it fully protects the military
recruitment and readiness requirements of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in
1995, but has yet to submit it for ratification by the Senate,
where it faces opposition from conservatives who argue that it
usurps the rights of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the administration signs the protocol, it will also require
Senate approval. Because of opposition to the convention overall,
the administration may well submit only the new protocol for
ratification, increasing the chances that the Senate would ratify
it. But any move to ratify is not expected to take place until the
end of the year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol also applies its standards to rebel groups or other
factions that are not represented by any government and so not
party to it. Still, proponents said they hoped that the desire for
international recognition by some of those groups would curb the
most extreme cases of putting children into combat.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the minimum age for soldiers dragged on for six
years, reflecting the complexities of countries' policies on young
soldiers. Britain, for example, begins recruiting at 16, though it
does not deploy the recruits in units until they are older.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol requires any country accepting volunteers under 18
to maintain safeguards to ensure that they are not coerced into
signing up and that they have parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries still have compulsory service, often beginning
before young men turn 18. The last round of negotiations almost
collapsed Friday when Cuba protested the language, hoping to be
able to continue to draft soldiers at 17. But in the end the Cuban
negotiators accepted the minimum of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Becker, an official with Human Rights Watch, welcomed the
agreement, though she expressed disappointment that the United
States and other countries succeeded in weakening a strict minimum
age of 18 for anyone in uniform, which Canada and the Scandinavian
countries had advocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard does allow a little wiggle room for exceptional
cases,'' she said. ``We would have liked stronger language, but
this is a good step.''
</P>
<P>
   The weakest part of the new agreement, she and others said, was
language requiring governments to raise the minimum age for
voluntary recruitment, which today is 15. The protocol calls on
them to increase it, but does not specify by how much, though some
officials interpret that to mean raising it to at least 16. The
language was left vague, a Clinton administration official said,
mainly because the negotiators could not have otherwise come to a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Although willing to compromise on establishing a minimum age for
combat duty, Pentagon officials insisted that it not be an absolute
ban. Although there are very few 17-year-olds in combat units,
Pentagon officials said they envisioned a situation when one
assigned to a peacekeeping operation or aboard a ship could end up
in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If commanders get caught in exceptional circumstance,'' one
official said, ``it would not be a violation to have a soldier in
direct combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The protocol requires countries to take ``all feasible
measures'' to keep soldiers under 18 out of combat, but that is
language open to interpretation. An administration official said
the Pentagon would ultimately establish its own rules for the armed
services to determine the extent to which commanders will be
required to keep the youngest U.S. soldiers away from battlefields.

TRADE DEFICIT PITS U.S. AGAINST OTHER G7 MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Saturday to Sunday in lede.)  
(Eds: See also IMF-GERMANY) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Against the backdrop of the record $26.5 billion U.S.
trade deficit, the meeting of the finance ministers and central
bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that will take
place here Sunday has shaped up as a conflict between the United
States and the rest of the members.
</P>
<P>
   During a press briefing Friday evening, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers repeatedly if diplomatically suggested that
Japan and Europe were not pulling their weight in the global
economy. ``You can't have a balanced global economy without more
growth in Europe and Japan,'' he said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Summers sought to portray the huge trade deficit as an
endorsement of the U.S. economy, saying it was a demonstration of
the financial strength of American companies and consumers as well
as a result of capital inflows from abroad drawn to attractive
American investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in Asia and to a lesser extent in Europe has pulled
out of the economic doldrums through exports to the United States,
running up huge current account surpluses in the process. Summers
called for a reversal of that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to happen, it is important that all regions pursue
appropriate economic policies, both in the macro-economy and
structurally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion is rising among U.S. officials that their European
counterparts are deliberately turning a blind eye to the weakness
of the euro, which makes European exports to the United States
cheaper, rather than adopting more politically difficult policies
like altering social welfare benefits and labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have the opposite problem: The yen is strong, at
least in part because of the U.S. trade deficit. They are thus
pushing the officials at the meeting to issue a statement of at
least mild concern about the current relationship between the
world's three dominant currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, on the other hand, do not want to see the phrase
``exchange rates'' mentioned at all in the final communique that
will be issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And neither Europe, where the economy is thriving, nor Japan,
which is slowly crawling out of a recession, has much sympathy for
the United States, with its strong dollar, booming stock market,
low unemployment and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury secretary also met Friday with Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi of Japan and commended him on Japan's nascent economic
recovery, although he reiterated long-standing demands that Japan
do more to foster domestic consumption and structural changes.

CLIFFORD TRUESDELL, 80, MASTER OF 2 DISCIPLINES OF MECHANICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SARA ROBINSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clifford Truesdell, a mathematician and historian of mathematics
who also was an authority on European art and culture, died on Jan.
14. in Baltimore. He was 80 and lived in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Truesdell was best known for developing the mathematical
underpinnings of the study of elasticity and fluids, work that
started in the 1960s and continued for the rest of his life. The
field, continuum mechanics, includes the study of the bending of
beams and bridges as well as the vibrations of drums and the study
of water, air and more exotic forms of fluids like liquid crystals,
which are found in the displays of laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Truesdell helped popularize rational mechanics, a
field devoted to developing a mathematical framework for mechanics
as broadly defined to include mechanical systems like robotics,
thermodynamics and electromagnetism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a bit of a reactionary in that he viewed the
mathematical foundations of continuum mechanics to be on rather
shaky ground, and he set about to put this right,'' said Jerrold E.
Marsden, a professor in the department of control and dynamical
systems at the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think such an endeavor would be of interest only to
mathematicians, but when you put your mathematical house in order,
it broadens and strengthens its applications,'' Marsden continued.
``What Truesdell did eventually had an enormous impact on
engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Truesdell was also a historian of mathematics and a scholar of
the literature, art and music of the 16th through the 18th
centuries. He financially supported and promoted the performance of
Baroque music on period instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford A. Truesdell III was born in 1919 in Los Angeles. As a
youth he traveled through Europe on his savings, extending his
knowledge of Latin and Greek and becoming fluent in German, French
and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time he wanted to be a poet,'' said his son, Clifford
A. Truesdell IV of Cambridge, Mass. ``However, he had a strong
belief that poetry should be metrical and rhyme and thought he had
no chance to succeed in the 20th century with such old-fashioned
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to science in college, Truesdell did his undergraduate
and master's work at the California Institute of Technology, and
received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1943.
From 1944 to 1950 he was a member of the Radiation Laboratory at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, chief of the theoretical
mechanics subdivision of the United States Naval Ordinance
Laboratory and head of the theoretical mechanics section at the
Naval Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 Truesdell became a professor of mathematics at the
Graduate Institute for Applied Mathematics at Indiana University,
and in 1961 he was appointed professor of rational mechanics at
Johns Hopkins University. He retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Truesdell was a member of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. Among the professional awards he received were the
Humboldt Prize, an international research award, and he twice
received the Euler Medal of the Soviet Union's Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 he won the George David Birkhoff Prize in Applied
Mathematics, an honor given jointly by the American Mathematical
Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics for
an outstanding contribution to applied mathematics. Truesdell's
award was for his work in giving precise mathematical formulations
to the study of mechanics and for major work in the history of
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Truesdell was the founder and editor of The Archive for Rational
Mechanics and Analysis. He wrote hundreds of research papers in
five languages, and was the author or co-author of 26 books on a
variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Clifford, he is survived by his wife of 48
years, Charlotte Brudno Truesdell, and two grandsons.

EDITORIAL: CONCILIATORY ELECTION IN CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The narrow election last weekend of Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist,
as Chile's new president reflected a welcome break from the
polarized past. Even before the final vote count was in, the
defeated conservative candidate, Joaquin Lavin, went to Lagos'
headquarters and embraced him on a flag-draped balcony, declaring,
``I am at his disposal to help unify Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an astonishing gesture of conciliation between right and
left that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, when
politics was still riven by recriminations from Chile's era of
repression, torture and political murder.
</P>
<P>
   Chile will now have its first Socialist president since Dr.
Salvador Allende was overthrown by Augusto Pinochet's violent coup
in 1973. But this does not mean it is headed radically leftward.
Lagos has distanced himself from the traditional positions of his
party, embracing a European-style socialism that bears little
resemblance to the divisive Marxist program of Allende. He is
unlikely to provoke the ire of Washington, which backed the coup
that toppled Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has pledged to fight the gross income disparities between
rich and poor and to bring modern health care to the poor. But he
has also reassured the private sector that he will continue the
economic polices promoted by the centrist coalitions that have
governed Chile since 1990. He served in the current administration
as public works minister, cooperating closely with private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos had been a supporter of Allende. After the coup he spent
three years in exile in the United States, teaching at the
University of North Carolina. He returned to Chile in the 1980s,
and played a key role in the 1988 plebiscite campaign that led to
Pinochet's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The election's narrow result _ 51 to 49 percent _ signified a
deserved return to electoral competitiveness for the Chilean right,
which in the past two campaigns had failed to shake off popular
mistrust of its democratic credentials because of its long
identification with Pinochet's dictatorship. Lavin is a former aide
to the general but downplayed that association during the campaign,
instead stressing some of the same centrist social and economic
themes that Lagos promoted.
</P>
<P>
   There remains the troublesome ghost of Pinochet himself, whose
absence helped make possible today's more moderate atmosphere. Five
days before the election, Britain, which arrested him 15 months ago
on human rights charges filed in Spain, declared that the
84-year-old general was unfit to stand trial. The Spanish judge
seeking to extradite him has properly asked for a second opinion.
The general's possible return to Chile could cause the new
administration difficulties. He could face new charges in Chilean
courts. Lagos last week sent the right signal when he declared that
``Chilean courts will do their job,'' and that he would make sure
those courts were respected.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Both New York and Russia will hold elections in March, noted
Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, as he
stood in the snow outside the Russian consulate in Manhattan on
Thursday, trying to make a point. That point _ sadly, a valid one _
is that, as things now stand, Russia's presidential election
promises to be more democratic than the rigged March 7 presidential
primary in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Using party resources to take advantage of New York's outdated
ballot laws, Gov. George Pataki and the state Republican chairman,
William Powers, plan to block McCain from running statewide against
their favorite, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Unless a federal
court intervenes to give Republican voters a full ballot, they
could well succeed in keeping McCain off the ballot in about half
of the state's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Bush has preferred to stand by quietly while
his New York ballot henchmen did the dirty work of blocking McCain
and disfranchising thousands of Republican voters. This week,
though, responding to McCain's mischievous publicity stunt at the
Russian Embassy, Bush embarrassed himself by coming to the defense
of the undemocratic petition rules that quadrennially disqualify
credible presidential candidates who are not backed by the party
machine or lack the money to hire scores of lawyers and
signature-gatherers. The problem, Bush suggested, is not the closed
ballot system but McCain's failure to abide by the established
rules. ``People must get grass-roots support to get on the ballot
in New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the stringent petition requirements insisted upon by
New York party bosses provide a poor measure of popular support,
much less a candidate's fitness for the presidency. What really
guarantees a ballot position is the help of a friendly governor
with the keys to the state political machine and a willingness to
pocket delegates won in a rigged primary. So far, Bush has both. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A MISDIRECTED COLLEGE TAX CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's plan to provide tax subsidies to cover
college tuition was a bad idea when he proposed it five years ago.
It was still a bad idea when he proposed it again this week,
calling for a tuition tax credit of as much as $2,800 a year for
families with incomes of up to $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits are an ineffective way to boost college attendance.
Much of the money is frittered away on families that are well off
and would send their children to college even without a gift from
Washington. The Clinton plan would mostly benefit families earning
between $80,000 and $120,000 who send children to private colleges.
These families are well aware that the gap in earnings between
college and high school graduates is rapidly widening.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, the families that receive Clinton's credit are
unlikely to reap all of the benefit. Colleges provide financial aid
to families that cannot afford full tuition, basing their grants
and loans on family need. Many colleges will determine that they
need to provide less aid to applicants if Washington provides them
a tax cut. Part of the money that Clinton intends for struggling
families will wind up as relief for colleges. Efforts by Congress
to stop colleges from exploiting its tax credit will almost surely
prove fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct, and least costly, way to help struggling
families is to give them, and only them, direct grants to cover the
costs of post-secondary education. That is exactly what the
existing program of Pell grants does. The grants go only to
families that need help. That way they do not waste taxpayer money.
The program provides a maximum grant this year of $3,300. About 75
percent of the money goes to families earning less than $30,000 a
year and 90 percent goes to those earning under $40,000. Clinton
would spend an extra $716 million on Pell grants next year, raising
the maximum grant to $3,500. But that increase would only serve to
keep the maximum Pell grant at about 20 percent of the average
tuition of private colleges. In the mid-1970s, Pell grants covered
over 60 percent of average tuition bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes to spend $30 billion on tax credits over the
next 10 years. The better idea is to spend that money on Pell
grants. That would raise the maximum grant by about $1,000, to
about 30 percent of the average private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Clinton's purpose was in part to reward well-off
suburban voters that Hillary Rodham Clinton _ who accompanied the
president when he announced his proposal _ needs to attract to win
the Senate race in New York, then a scattershot tax credit is a
dandy idea.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The number of union members increased more last year than at any
time in the past two decades, drawing cheers from organized labor.
But a sober look at the numbers mutes enthusiasm. Unions barely
kept pace with the overall economy, accounting for an unchanged
13.9 percent of the work force. That is a drop from about 35
percent in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   President John Sweeney of the AFL-CIO points with pride to the
focus he has placed on recruiting members since taking charge in
1995. He has called on unions to boost dramatically the amount they
spend on organizing drives. Some of last year's results reflect
Sweeney's drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the changes between 1999 and 1998 are small and serve as no
firm guide to the future. Indeed, a close look at the numbers might
dampen some of Sweeney's enthusiasm. The anemic union membership in
the private sector, under 10 percent of the work force, fell
slightly last year. Union membership in the public sector, near 40
percent, also fell slightly. The only reason the overall
unionization rate _ an average of the two numbers, weighted by
their relative size _ held steady is that there was a shift in jobs
from the private sector to the public sector. Sweeney's drive to
improve these numbers will confront an economy that is turning away
from union strongholds and employers who increasingly find new ways
to thwart workers who want to join unions. His job was made harder
this week by the leak of an internal report pointing to extensive
corruption in the nation's largest union of government workers.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles before organized labor affect nonunion workers
too, because union wage hikes spread to non-unionized workplaces.
Two recent reports have shown that inequality in wealth and income
between rich and poor continues to widen. Falling union membership
explains perhaps as much as 20 percent of the increase in
inequality. There is, then, reason to welcome the end to the
downward slide of union membership. But there are as yet no grounds
for optimism about the future.

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban refugee who has been living with relatives in Miami and
caught for months in the eye of an international custody storm,
flew to New York from Havana Friday and made a poignant appeal for
the motherless boy's return to his homeland and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask all of you who want to help us _ if you want to help us,
help us return Elian home,'' Raquel Rodriguez, the boy's maternal
grandmother, pleaded in Spanish as tears welled in her eyes at a
crowded, raucous news conference at Kennedy International Airport.
``I want that my daughter will be in peace, and she will not be in
peace until Elian is home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, was almost
pugnacious in response to a question about a move in Congress to
resolve the tug of war by legislating citizenship for Elian. ``No
one has a right to make him an American citizen,'' she said. ``He
was born in Cuba. He lives in Cuba. He's a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, who have occasionally appeared at
demonstrations in Cuba calling for the boy's return, said they had
spoken often to Elian by telephone and insisted that he had
expressed a desire to return to his father and family in Cuba. The
boy's relatives in Miami scoffed at the assertion, insisting that
he had said repeatedly that he wanted to stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that has divided a family, generated demonstrations in
the streets of Miami and Havana, reached into America's courts and
the presidential race and been turned into crusades by President
Fidel Castro in Cuba and anti-Castro expatriates in Florida, the
grandmothers' mission added yet another dimension Friday, but the
fate of the boy seemed as uncertain as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in the Caribbean on Nov. 25 after the
small boat on which he had been bound for Florida capsized, killing
his mother, Elisabet Brotons Rodriguez, and 10 others. The boy's
relatives in Miami have sought to keep him, arguing that he would
have a better life in the United States. But his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded his return.
</P>
<P>
   An order by American immigration officials for the boy's return
to Cuba has been blocked by a lawsuit in federal court in Miami,
and scores of legislators, clergy members and others have joined
the battle, which has become highly politicized.
</P>
<P>
   It was with that in mind that the grandmothers flew to New York
Friday to appeal directly to the American people. Arriving at 3:30
p.m. with a delegation from the National Council of Churches who
support their cause, the grandmothers winced in the 16 degree cold
as they stepped off a chartered Lear jet in trench coats, and were
quickly ushered through Customs in a VIP lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired after their journey and somewhat intimidated by a
tumultuous reception, the women were soon confronted by 40
television cameras, a blaze of flashbulbs and 100 reporters from
around the world at a news conference that erupted frequently in
shouting matches among journalists in a circus atmosphere that
reflected the tensions of the case and competitiveness of the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But, speaking through an interpreter at a session broadcast live
on several national cable networks, the grandmothers, who live in
Cardenas, a city on Cuba's north coast 90 miles east of Havana,
responded to questions with simple phrases that sounded broken in
translation but conveyed passion, pride and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this
tragedy that has been so hard on us as a family, and to ask that
our grandson can return as soon as possible,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Rodriguez spoke of a desire to preserve the memory of
her daughter. ``We feel that the best way to keep that memory is
for Elian to come back with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The women had been persuaded to come to New York by a delegation
of clergy members. They were escorted to the United States and
introduced by the Rev. Dr. Robert W. Edgar, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, who was a member of the House of
Representatives from Pennsylvania from 1974 to 1987 and is the
president of the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He called the grandmothers courageous, and said it was their
hope to return home in a few days with Elian. ``We believe in
miracles,'' he said when asked how that might happen. The
grandmothers, who were whisked away after the news conference to an
undisclosed location, wanted to meet with legislators and others
who might help them, including Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and the commissioner of the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service, Dor- is Meissner, will meet with
the grandmothers in Washington on Sat- urday afternoon, according
to a spokesman for the Justice Depart- ment. Both Reno and Ms.
Meissner have called for the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers said they had no plans to go to Miami, where
Cuban exiles have staged demonstrations against Fidel Castro and
the return of Elian Gonzalez, choosing instead to take their
message to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives said the grandmothers were
welcome to visit him there but would not be allowed to take him
back to Cuba. And one suggested that the Cuban government was
behind the grandmothers' trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some
degree,'' said Spencer Eig, who filed a lawsuit in federal court in
Miami on Wednesday on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez. The suit asked a federal judge to prevent the Immigration
and Naturalization Service from returning the boy to Cuba before
granting him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the judge assigned to the case, James
Lawrence King, recused himself Friday after disclosing potential
conflicts of interest. He noted that his daughter was a federal
prosecutor in Miami and that his son, Miami-Dade County Judge
Lawrence B. King, had hired as a campaign consultant a man now
working as a spokesman for the boy's relatives in Miami. The case
was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of the former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   There were other pronouncements on the case by members of
Congress. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said
the Senate would act as early as next Wednesday to make Elian an
American citizen, an unusual step ordinarily used to honor
prominent people _ Winston Churchill, for one.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans hope that citizenship will safeguard
the boy's rights and aid his Miami relatives in their legal fight
to keep him. Asked in a taped television appearance whether the
action was intended to aid George W. Bush's presidential election
bid, Lott said: ``We don't want it to be a political football. We
want to have a determination made about what is best for the young
boy.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Money, which (allegedly) is only capable of
renting happiness, can do major damage if you're in the market to
purchase a little basketball chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   See, money still talks, especially when it has a translator like
Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, the relentlessly verbal Minnesota forward, rang up 18
points Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers, and the bottom line
was a 95-89 Timberwolves victory before 12,853 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, whose $16.8 million paycheck for this season is $7.5
million more than the combined wages of the Clipper starters, spent
much of the evening as the bystander in a spicy war with Clips
rookie Lamar Odom (18 points, 14 rebounds). But even though team
ownership spent most of its money in one place, Garnett had help
from Sam Mitchell (20 points), ex-Clipper Malik Sealy (18 points)
and Bobby Jackson (17 points, 7 assists).
</P>
<P>
   The T'wolves (21-16) won for the 14th time in 17 games,
including the last three without point guard Terrell Brandon
(strained right calf).
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (10-29), who led at the completion of each of the
first three quarters, moonwalked to their seventh defeat in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers were forced to play without backup center
Keith Closs Jr., whose Friday absence was excused for maternity
reasons ... the birth of Keith Closs III. Closs, who left
Wednesday's workout early and missed Thursday's practice entirely
(without contacting team officials), is expected to practice with
the team today at Staples Center. He also is to meet with Ford and
Elgin Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball operations.
Teammate Charles Jones offered an alternative in the naming
process: ``He should name him `Minutes,' because Keith's always
talking about how he wants some minutes,'' Jones said. Clips
forward Tyrone Nesby, who became a father for the second time
earlier this season, said, ``I feel Keith Closs. I was in the same
situation a couple of months ago. I hope he gets some sleep ... I
didn't.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   There may have been some serious snoozin' at the NBA offices,
where it was decided Nesby would not join the league's rookie class
of 1998 at Oakland for an All-Star Weekend battle with this year's
season's rookie class. Nesby, who had been pushed by the Clips'
media-relations staff as a strong slam-dunk contest candidate (also
denied), was one of the top first-year players (statistically) even
though he wasn't draft out of UNLV. ``That's the way my whole life
has been,'' said Nesby, who became emotional on the subject prior
to Friday's game with Minnesota. ``I always keep having to prove
myself. Eventually all that proving has to stop. At least I can
enjoy my three days in Las Vegas ... that's where I'll be, not
Oakland.''

COURT UNIFICATION HIKES COUNCIL PAY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was Christmas in January for Los Angeles City
Council members who were informed Friday that they will be
receiving their second pay raise in six months -- a 4 percent boost
that gives them annual salaries of $117,912.
</P>
<P>
   They owe their good fortune to voter approval of a 1989 charter
amendment that linked their pay to that of Municipal Court judges
-- nearly doubling their salaries in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from City Controller Rick Tuttle, council members
were advised their pay -- already the highest in the nation for a
council -- will jump to $117,912 because Municipal Court judges
were elevated to Superior Court judges' pay. Salaries were raised
July 1 from $110,612 to $113,377.
</P>
<P>
   The latest pay raise is retroactive to September when the
compensation of judges increased. The back salary will be paid in
the first check to council members in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about it when it first happened and when we
learned about it last week, we began to make plans to put it into
effect,'' said Deputy Controller Tim Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries of all city officials are tied to those of Municipal
Court judges as a result of a 1989 charter change approved by
voters that, among other things, created the city Ethics
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Not all council members are accepting the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, as he has with all past increases, said
he will return his raise to the city treasury and will remain at
$98,070, the amount he was paid when he was first elected to office
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick, as she has in the past, said she would
accept only the amount being given other city workers. That is 2
percent and will take her salary to $104,072 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Alex Padilla, one of the council's two newest
members, said he will use his increase to buy playground equipment
for Telfair Elementary School in Pacoima, which is in his district
and is where he went to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dedicated to providing opportunities for youth,
especially those in my district,'' Padilla said. ``When I attended
Telfair, there were plenty of after-school activities to
participate in, including playgrounds and tutoring programs,
library programs and Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden plans to put his raise into a nonprofit
trust fund for needy schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Holden counterpart, Councilman Nick Pacheco, said he
will accept the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has a lot of outstanding school loans,'' an aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Hal Bernson said he also will accept the money as
provided for with the charter amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters decided this and he thinks they were correct,''
spokesman Ali Sar said. ``He thinks this is a much better system
than having council members vote on their own pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Vosburgh of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a closer connection to how well the
taxpayers are doing and how well the elected officials are paid,''
Vosburgh said. ``The problem is these raises are on autopilot. A
council member should vote for their salary and then stand for
election to see if the public agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that would dampen these raises. Not only are these
folks receiving generous pay, they are getting cars and other perks
the general public doesn't have,'' Vosburgh said.
</P>
<P>
   The new City Charter approved by voters last year kept the
current system in place, with charter commission members arguing it
should be retained because there were other limits on how officials
can earn money.
</P>
<P>
   The new raises also will increase Tuttle's salary to $129,631
and City Attorney James Hahn to $141,142. Aides to both said they
would accept the raises.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1989 charter change, a council member's salary was
tied to the cost of living. At that time, council members were paid
$61,522. The first year the new measure took effect, the salaries
jumped to $86,156 and have gone up steadily since then.
</P>
<P>
   The one other city official not affected by the increase is
multimillionaire Mayor Richard Riordan. He accepts $1 a year in
salary.

DUCK PULL OUT TIE WITH AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The good vibes from the hard-work win against Dallas
was a nice respite from the losing, but the Mighty Ducks said the
luster of that win would be tarnished quickly if it didn't produce
a string of wins.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 3-3 tie with the Colorado Avalanche before a sellout
crowd of 17,174 at the Pond does nothing to dim the shine.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne scored with 1:40 remaining in regulation to give
the Ducks the tie and a pivotal point. It was also the climax of a
dominating thi rd period in which Anaheim spent most of the time in
Colorado's zone. The Ducks outshot the Avalanche 38-15.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Selanne tied it 3-3 with a one-timer from the slot.
Selanne left the puck in the right wing corner for Paul Kariya then
circled through the zone. Kariya skated along the wing boards
before finding Selanne in the slot. Selanne ripped the puck past
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought back from a pair of one-goal deficits, the
Avalanche went ahead 3-2 late in the second period. Ducks
defenseman Ruslan Salei lost control of the puck in the offensive
zone and it developed quickly into a 2-on-1 for Colorado that
resulted in Chris Drury taking a feed from Al ex Tanguay and
shooting it into an open net with 1:19 left in the period .
</P>
<P>
   Despite being outshot 18-10 in the first two periods, the
Avalanche held the one-goal lead heading into the third. Less than
three minutes into the third Anaheim had an opportunity to tie it,
but Roy made a glove save on a close-range backhander by Oleg
Tverdovsky. The Ducks also had numerous chances on a power play _
the best being Matt Cullen swatting at a loose puck _ but Roy made
a hand full of tough saves to preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks now begin a grueling part of their schedule. Beginning
with tonight's game in San Jose, they'll play six of their next
seven games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 1-0 lead 11:56 into the first period on a nice
effort b y Tverdovsky, who fought off a backcheck from Colorado's
Peter Forsberg and slid the puck past Roy's right pad. It was
Tverdovsky's first goal s ince Oct. 29, and fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim played strong defensively in the first period, but the
Avalanche 's power play, ranked second in the league, struck with
2:08 remaining. During a scramble in front, Forsberg reached his
stick between the legs of teammate Adam Deadmarsh and flicked the
puck past Ducks goalie Guy Hebert to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Until the three-goal third period in Wednesday's win against
Dallas, sco ring at any juncture was a problem for Anaheim. But
Kariya, who had a pair of goals in the win against the Stars and
assisted on Tverdovsky's goal, gave the Ducks their second one-goal
lead against the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   A nifty move by Marty McInnis allowed Anaheim to get the puck
deep into Colorado's zone, and the Ducks worked the puck to the
left point. Kariya 's slap shot deflected off an Avalanche stick
and over Roy's left shoulder as the Ducks took a 2-1 lead with
15:17 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Ducks' lead was short-lived. Given room to create,
Forsberg did just that in delaying with the puck before feeding Joe
Sakic in the slot. Sakic then wristed a shot over Hebert's right
shoulder to pull the Avalanche even at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Icings: Though center Steve Rucchin skated in practice Thursday,
it appears his return won't come soon. Rucchin's been out since
Dec. 27 with a staph infection and is still experiencing pain when
he skates. ... McInnis' first-period assist was the 200th of his
career. ... Because of USC basketball, tonight's Ducks game in San
Jose can be heard on KOGO 600-AM.

FIRM ANNOUNCES ASIAN VENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- MRV Communications, which has been a
darling to investors in recent months, received another boost after
announcing a joint partnership in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The communications equipment maker's stock surged 27 percent in
heavy trading Friday after announcing it would form Access Asia, a
venture with Korea Microwave Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The combination will give MRV expanded manufacturing capacity
and the ability to make its optical components at a lower cost,
said Chet White, an analyst with First Security Van Kasper in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings a little more attention to MRV's fiber optic
components business and it offers them a lower cost manufacturing
opportunity,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will design, manufacture and market optical
components in Korea and other Pacific Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the transaction were undisclosed, MRV said
it will be the majority stakeholder in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   MRV Chief Executive Officer Noam Lotan said Optical Access Asia
will serve Asia's emerging markets, which have strong demand for
fiber optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   Optical Access Asia will serve many of MRV's existing customers
in Korea, such as Samsung, Lotan said. Several of them have local
purchasing policies that might benefit the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have maintained a relationship over the years,
the companies said. Korea Microwave's knowledge of MRV's existing
products was a major factor in the partnering decision, Lotan said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White said Korea Microwave has expertise in
wireless technology that MRV lacks.
</P>
<P>
   The extra manufacturing capacity will benefit MRV, even though
the company recently expanded its manufacturing, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Lotan said MRV recently expanded its manufacturing plant in the
suburban Los Angeles community of Chatsworth from 30,000 square
feet to 75,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects capacity to become more of an issue as
customers begin to demand fiber in place of copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term we're OK, but we have to be ready for the
biggest growth, which will happen two years from now,'' Lotan said.
``Fiber is going deeper and deeper into the neighborhoods.
Ultimately, fiber is king.''
</P>
<P>
   MRV's stock closed at $87 per share, up $18.625. White, who
recommends the stock as a ``strong buy,'' said he has a price
target of $166 per share in the next 12 months.

 CELTICS ENJOY A SONIC BOOM
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News    Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Kenny Anderson was sitting at his locker Friday night when An-
toine Walker came by for a visit. The Celtics had just defeated the
Sonics at the FleetCenter, 111-86. Walker was smiling and extending
his right hand as he approached Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' Walker said, ``you busted his tail tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he didn't exactly say ``tail,'' but you get the idea.
Walker was talking about Gary Payton, the Seat- tle point guard who
began talking as soon as the ball was thrown up. Celt- ics fans
know that Walker is quite a talker himself. But Payton talked so
much that he made Walker look like an introvert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very loquacious guy,'' An- derson said of Payton.
</P>
<P>
   So, what was he saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure,'' said the Celtics guard, who had 19 points
and five assists. ``He likes to talk. But I'm not a talker. I don't
even like to talk that much when I'm around my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the visitors, Payton's verbal energy was the
only ammunition they had all night. Pay-H ton, an MVP candidate as
a point guard and orator, managed 13 points on 5-for-16 shooting
(but he led his team with nine rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Why was this such a rout?
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the Sonics said they didn't want to make any ex-
cuses. But then they reminded you that they played Thursday night
in Milwaukee, were forced to stay L there longer than they wanted
be- cause of bad weather, and didn't ar- rive in Boston until noon
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics forced the Sonics to shoot horribly and were
superior to them in rebounding, winning the board wars by 18. The
Sonics are one of the best teams in the West, but the Celtics made
them look soft. Understandably, the Celtics have a phobia about
blowing leads. But L when their halftime advantage rest- ed at 20,
there wasn't any doubt they would win. The last shot the Sonics saw
before the half was Walker's 36- foot banker at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of night. It was the kind of night that
featured 6- foot-10-inch Walter McCarty lobbing alley-oop passes to
5-11 Dana Bar-H ros; Walker throwing a behind-the- back bounce pass
to Vitaly Pota-H penko for an assist; Tony Battie and Danny Fortson
combining for 41 minutes and 21 rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of night that forced the Sonics, down by 31
(86-55) going into the fourth, to trot out this Blowout Unit to end
the game: L Shammond Williams, Emanual Da- vis, Rashard Lewis,
Jelani McCoy, and Vladimir Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our passing was the catalyst,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino
said. ``Our unselfishness, our passing, our (ball) reversal . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   He could have raved about ev- eryone on his roster if he wanted.
Even Pervis Ellison got off the L bench long enough to toss in 5
points and collect two rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Celtics' fourth in a row, which sounds modest.
But when you consider that it is only the second four-game winning
streak in Pitino's three seasons, you realize the significance. The
last time the Celtics won four in a row, Andrew DeClercq was the
starting center and Dontae Jones was the team comedian. That was
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the Celtics will be thinking of more
contempo- rary history. They now have a 19-20 record and can reach
the break-even point with a win at Charlotte Colise- um. They
haven't been a .500 group of guys since mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, we're better than our re-H cord,'' Anderson said. ``I can
tell you that. How much better? Way better. We could be five or six
games over .500 right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he didn't want to overemphasize Friday night's game.
But then, he said, ``It's a very big game for us.'' Like Anderson,
Walk- er believes the Celtics are unques-H tionably a playoff team.
``Look at the Eastern Conference,'' he said. ``I think you can see
we can play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   They did that Friday night, em- barrassing a 27-14 team. Paul
Pierce and Walker were able to score 21 points apiece and rest,
playing 31 and 29 minutes, respectively. The only thing they
weren't able to do was silence Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's cool,'' Walker said. L ``That's my boy.''

   After the game, Walker saw Pay-H ton. Payton told him that the
Celtics are a bad team and the only reason they won was that the
Sonics played the night before. Those comments should be enough
motivation for the next Sonics-Celtics game, Feb. 19 in Seattle.

CLIPPERS FALL TO TIMBERWOLVES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Money, which (allegedly) only is capable of
renting happiness, can do major damage if you're in the market to
purchase a little basketball chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   See, money still talks, especially when it has a translator like
Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, the relentless Minnesota forward, rang up 18 points
Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers, and the bottom line was a
95-89 Timberwolves victory before 12,853 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another nightmare,'' said Clippers coach Chris Ford, whose
team's 20 turnovers included several with lousy timing. ``We did an
awful lot of good things, but we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned goodies include outrebounding Minnesota,
44-39, balanced scoring (six Clips in double figures) and making a
respectable 47.6 percent of their cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, whose $16.8 million paycheck for this season is $7.5
million more than the combined wages of the Clipper starters, spent
much of the evening as the bystander in a spicy war with Clips
rookie Lamar Odom (18 points, 14 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to talk about us being the youngest team in the
league,'' said Odom, preparing to deliver an oxymoron, ``but that's
getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the T'wolves' ownership spent most of its money in
one place, Garnett had help from poorhouse residents Sam Mitchell
(20 points), ex-Clipper Malik Sealy (18 points) and Bobby Jackson
(17 points, 7 assists). Minnesota (21-16) won for the 14th time in
17 games, including the last three without point guard Terrell
Brandon (strained right calf).
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (10-29), who led at the completion of each of the
first three quarters, have lost 11 of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play to win,'' said Clips forward Maurice Taylor, who
had 14 points and 10 rebounds. ``It's like we just back down. They
(Timberwolves) turned up the defensive intensity on us, but we
didn't match it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers were forced to play without backup center
Keith Closs Jr., whose Friday absence was excused for maternity
reasons ... the birth of Keith Closs III. Closs, who left
Wednesday's workout early and missed Thursday's practice entirely
(without contacting team officials), is expected to practice with
the team today at Staples Center. He also is to meet with Ford and
Elgin Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball operations.
Teammate Charles Jones offered an alternative in the naming
process: ``He should name him `Minutes,' because Keith's always
talking about how he wants some minutes,'' Jones said. Clips
forward Tyrone Nesby, who became a father for the second time
earlier this season, said, ``I feel Keith Closs. I was in the same
situation a couple of months ago. I hope he gets some sleep ... I
didn't.''

   Nestle USA said Friday it plans to lay off 1 percent of its U.S.
work force, workforce, including 64 employees at its Glendale
headquarters. By Jason Cohen
</P>
<P>
   including 64 employees at its Los Angeles-area headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Kimberly Constant said the company decided Wednesday
to lay off 225 of its 19,500 employees. The decision was not
precipitated by any specific event, Constant said.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle employs approximately 1,800 people at its Glendale
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Weller, Nestle USA's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the layoffs are a competitive move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is always to deliver the highest quality products at
the most competitive price. This work force reduction will enable
us to remain a top player in this highly competitive industry,''
Weller said.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs mark Nestle's second major strategic move in recent
weeks. In early December, the company announced it would sell three
of its coffee lines -- Hills Bros., MJB and Chase &AMP; Sanborn -- to
competitor Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was billed as a move by Nestle to focus on its Nescafe
brand, which is receiving a new image accompanied by a major
marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle USA, with headquarters in Glendale, is a division of the
Swiss company Nestle S.A., the world's largest food company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. brands include Carnation, Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine,
Nescafe, Libby's, Juicy Juice, Ortega, Friskies, Alpo and Mighty
Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Mayor Ginger Bremberg said the city won't likely suffer
any ill effects, but that several families will be disrupted
because of the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that that's happening, but a great many companies
are doing reorganization right now. It's a business decision,''
said Bremberg, who called Nestle a wonderful corporate citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides candy for the city's parks programs,
Bremberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Business trouble is hitting other parts of the food industry as
well, said Doug Christopher, an analyst with Los Angeles-based
Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, who follows competitor Hershey Foods Inc., said
that company has had troubles with a new computer system that has
caused it to miss shipments for every major holiday since
Halloween.

DUCKS TIE AVALANCHE

(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details)

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The good vibes from the hard-work win against
Dallas was a nice respite from the losing, but the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks said the luster of that win would be tarnished quickly if it
didn't produce a string of wins.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 3-3 tie with the Colorado Avalanche before a sellout
crowd of 17,174 at the Pond isn't the win they wanted, but it'll do
just dandy.
</P>
<P>
   After ambushing Colorado goalie Patrick Roy for much of the
third period, the Ducks finally got the equalizer from Teemu
Selanne with 1:40 remaining in regulation and went on to earn a
much-needed point. It was Selanne's first goal in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is about confidence, and hopefully this will be a
big boost for me,'' Selanne said. ``I know if I'm open the puck is
going to come. Paul (Kariya) is playing great hockey right now. He
was big tonight. I'm trying to keep up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as important as the tie was Selanne breaking his
goal-scoring drought, and the domination Selanne and Kariya showed
late in the game. It culminated with Selanne's goal, which marked
the first time since Nov. 3 the duo scored in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teemu's been the best goal scorer in the league since he's
been here,but even the best goes through streaks where nothing is
going in,'' said Kariya, who has three goals and two assists in his
last two games. ``I'm not going to worry. I know he's going to take
off.''
</P>
<P>
   While Selanne got the tying goal, it was another masterful
performance by Kariya that made it possible. Already with a goal
and assist, Kariya took the puck from Selanne in the right corner,
skated up the boards and slipped a pass to Selanne in the slot.
Having been stonewalled by Roy for much of the third period,
Selanne fired the puck past Roy on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great play by two great players,'' Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg said. ``It wasn't really much of a breakdown by them.
Those two guys made an unbelievable pass and an unbelievable
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning just two of its past 12 games (2-8-2), Anaheim
believes it played some of its best hockey in Wednesday's win
against Dallas and the tie against the Avalanche. In fact, the
Ducks outshot Colorado 38-15, including 20-5 in the third period
and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Third-period surges are a huge reason. The Ducks scored three
times in the third period to beat Dallas, marking the first time in
17 games they won when trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim entered the third period trailing Colorado 3-2, and for
the third time this season didn't go on to lose. The Ducks are
1-15-2 when behind after two periods. By contrast, Colorado was
17-0-1 when leading after two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of positive things happening,'' Hartsburg said.
``It's been a tough road, but our guys just have to stay with it,
stay persistent and keep pushing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fought back from a pair of one-goal deficits, the
Avalanche went ahead 3-2 late with 1:19 left in the second period.
Chris Drury capitalized on Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei's turnover
and beat Guy Hebert on a 2-on-1.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't distract the Ducks, who began their onslaught on Roy
less than three minutes into the third. But Oleg Tverdovsky, the
Ducks' first goal scorer, was stopped at the side of the net. Roy
also made six saves on a power play a few minutes later the best
being when Matt Cullen swatted a loose puck _ to preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Icings: Though center Steve Rucchin skated in practice Thursday,
it appears his return won't come soon. Rucchin's been out since
Dec. 27 with a staph infection and is still experiencing pain when
he skates.... Marty McInnis' first-period assist was the 200th of
his career.... Because of USC basketball, tonight's Anaheim game in
San Jose can be heard on KOGO 600 AM.

CREAM SODAS CATCH BLAME FOR BRADLEY HEART PROBLEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSCATINE, Iowa _ Bill Bradley's cardiac condition, and the
possible effects of cream soda, momentarily became the heart of the
Democratic underdog's presidential campaign Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about recent episodes of irregular heartbeat forced
Bradley to put aside health care reform and other showpiece issues
as he tried to reassure supporters that he is healthy enough to
wage political war and serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Bradley. ``It hasn't affected
my schedule, and it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley disclosed Thursday that the irregular heartbeat _ a
condition called atrial fibrillation _ had recurred four times
since he sought medical care Dec. 10. Previously, he had
experienced three episodes in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the caffeine in cream soda may have been the cause
of his recent bouts of irregular heartbeat. Bradley, a 56-year-old
former professional basketball player, said cream soda was his
preferred soft drink on the Iowa campaign trail until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in eastern Iowa late Friday, three days before the
state caucuses, Bradley gave reporters a letter from one of his New
York cardiologists saying the frequency of the recent episodes was
not significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation includes
sporadic increases in frequency in episodes which does not indicate
any change in heart status,'' Dr. Robert Heissenbuttel wrote. ``He
(Bradley) has been advised to continue all normal activity without
limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, Vice President Al Gore downplayed any suggestion
that Bradley's heart condition would interfere with their race for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that it's nothing serious,'' Gore told
reporters as he played with young patients at Mercy Medical Center.
``He's out there campaigning. That's the good news. It's a routine
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, Gore said Bradley ``is in great health. It
shouldn't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of medical correspondence and soft-drink concern came
after his first campaign appearance of the day in Muscatine, when
the first question from supporter Bonnie Weeks, a 66-year-old
retiree, was about his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several million Americans have it,'' Bradley responded. ``It's
irregular heartbeat. I take medicine twice a day to stay in regular
heartbeat. On occasion it goes out, stays out a couple of hours and
goes back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition ``has absolutely no effect on my ability to
dispose of the responsibilities of the job (of president) if I am
successful,'' Bradley said. ``So you should feel reassured on that
front, and I hope we have some perspective on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator noticed a warning label on a cream
soda can stating the drink contains caffeine. He said he has been
trying to avoid caffeine and chocolate because they could aggravate
his condition, for which he takes the drug Procanbid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew that cream soda has it (caffeine)? I knew that Coke
did,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told reporters that he had switched to Sunkist diet
orange soda, a drink he said was caffeine-free.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, campaign aides said Bradley was re-thinking his
soft-drink choice because he had learned that the Sunkist beverage
contains some caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, who tells voters at every campaign stop that he
is trying to prove that a politician can be straightforward and win
at the same time, said he doesn't feel obligated to make episodes
public unless he has to seek care from a doctor or a hospital _
attention that the four recent episodes did not require.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asserted that Bradley has an obligation to
announce when he is suffering from the ailment, he responded: ``If
I'm sick in my stomach, I have to tell you I am sick in my stomach?
If I didn't sleep well at night, I have to tell you I didn't sleep
well at night?''
</P>
<P>
   Health controversy aside, Bradley was focused and intense as he
campaigned to crowds of 50 to 200 people in towns along the
Mississippi. He stuck to a speech in which he called for health
insurance for all children, expanded gun control, campaign finance
reform and ``restoring the collective good will'' of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Des Moines, Gore took some time to address
environmentalists launching an Earth Year 2000 celebration before
moving on to a family farm near Perry and an Elks Lodge in Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Ed Begley Jr., an
actor and environmental activist. The vice president was introduced
by Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, who called Gore ``our last
best chance to save our planet.''

   WASHINGTON _ Never have so many given so much in so little time.
If the current dizzying pace of fund-raising continues, political
operatives and campaign finance experts estimate that the 2000
elections for president and Congress will end up costing a total of
$3 billion, an amount that would dwarf the $2.1 billion spent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no reason to think the pace will slacken. On the
eve of the Iowa caucuses, many political analysts say this year's
front-loaded presidential primary schedule, which will almost
certainly see both major-party nominees selected by mid-March if
not earlier, clears the calendar to provide even more time to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and the billionaire publisher Steve Forbes, have escaped the weakly
enforced limits on spending by refusing to accept federal matching
funds. Forbes is financing his own campaign, but Bush managed to
collect a record $67 million from more than 171,000 Americans in
just 10 months last year. Several of their rivals _ Elizabeth Dole,
Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander _ quit the race before a single
citizen voted with anything other than a checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the two candidates who have spoken most often
about the need for an overhaul of the campaign finance laws _ Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., _ have
discovered that the issue generates only modest outrage among
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Like the booming stock market _ or perhaps partly because of it
_ there appears to be no stopping the ballooning campaign finance
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is pretty flush right now, and there is so much at
stake in this year's elections,'' said Mel Sembler, the finance
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so much money is cascading into the political system
that politicians have begun to invent places to stash it, thanks in
part to a loophole in the campaign law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, the influential Oklahoma Republican, has
quietly created a new political organization that exploits that
loophole by allowing anonymous donors to make unlimited donations
to a project meant to burnish his party's image with an advertising
campaign. Watts refuses to identify the donors, who have
contributed $200,000 since October.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known organization called Citizens for the Republican
Congress hopes to raise $35 million to spend on this year's
congressional elections. Led by former Rep. Pat Saiki, R-Hawaii,
the organization is offering the party's wealthiest donors an
opportunity to give unlimited amounts without ever having their
identities revealed. Fund-raisers call the committees ``safe
havens'' for donors seeking privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited sums, given anonymously: that specter was the engine
that powered the fundamental changes in federal election laws in
the years following Watergate. But now most of those limits and
restrictions are rarely, if ever, enforced by a weakened and
underfinanced Federal Election Commission. There were few
consequences for those who brazenly bent and broke the rules during
the 1996 campaign finance scandal, when record amounts of illegal
contributions landed in both parties' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Large anonymous donations worry advocates for campaign finance
overhaul, who say it will be much more difficult than in past years
for the public and press to identify the candidates' most generous
benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a year of unprecedented amounts of
corrupting influence money flowing in Washington, dangerous new
secret funds being used to affect federal elections and massive
blatant violations of the campaign finance laws,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Democracy
21, who has studied the issue for 25 years. ``It's going to be an
unmitigated disaster for the health and integrity of our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of fund-raising has been driven, in part, by the
obsessive wants of both parties. Republicans want to retake the
White House; Democrats want to recapture the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited donations from corporations and individuals, commonly
known as soft money, did not emerge in presidential elections until
1988, when both Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts had donor clubs of $100,000 contributors. Bush's
club was called Team 100, a concept that seems quaint now that the
Republican Party has created a $250,000-a-year donor club with the
imperial title Republican Regents. The Regents are endowed with
exclusive benefits, like intimate meetings with party leaders and
luxury box seats at the convention.

   WASHINGTON _ Never have so many given so much in so little time.
If the current dizzying pace of fund-raising continues, political
operatives and campaign finance experts estimate that the 2000
elections for president and Congress will end up costing a total of
$3 billion, an amount that would dwarf the $2.1 billion spent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no reason to think the pace will slacken. On the
eve of the Iowa caucuses, many political analysts say this year's
front-loaded presidential primary schedule, which will almost
certainly see both major-party nominees selected by mid-March if
not earlier, clears the calendar to provide even more time to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and the billionaire publisher Steve Forbes, have escaped the weakly
enforced limits on spending by refusing to accept federal matching
funds. Forbes is financing his own campaign, but Bush managed to
collect a record $67 million from more than 171,000 Americans in
just 10 months last year. Several of their rivals _ Elizabeth Dole,
Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander _ quit the race before a single
citizen voted with anything other than a checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the two candidates who have spoken most often
about the need for an overhaul of the campaign finance laws _ Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., _ have
discovered that the issue generates only modest outrage among
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Like the booming stock market _ or perhaps partly because of it
_ there appears to be no stopping the ballooning campaign finance
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is pretty flush right now, and there is so much at
stake in this year's elections,'' said Mel Sembler, the finance
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so much money is cascading into the political system
that politicians have begun to invent places to stash it, thanks in
part to a loophole in the campaign law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, the influential Oklahoma Republican, has
quietly created a new political organization that exploits that
loophole by allowing anonymous donors to make unlimited donations
to a project meant to burnish his party's image with an advertising
campaign. Watts refuses to identify the donors, who have
contributed $200,000 since October.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known organization called Citizens for the Republican
Congress hopes to raise $35 million to spend on this year's
congressional elections. Led by former Rep. Pat Saiki, R-Hawaii,
the organization is offering the party's wealthiest donors an
opportunity to give unlimited amounts without ever having their
identities revealed. Fund-raisers call the committees ``safe
havens'' for donors seeking privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited sums, given anonymously: that specter was the engine
that powered the fundamental changes in federal election laws in
the years following Watergate. But now most of those limits and
restrictions are rarely, if ever, enforced by a weakened and
underfinanced Federal Election Commission. There were few
consequences for those who brazenly bent and broke the rules during
the 1996 campaign finance scandal, when record amounts of illegal
contributions landed in both parties' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Large anonymous donations worry advocates for campaign finance
overhaul, who say it will be much more difficult than in past years
for the public and press to identify the candidates' most generous
benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a year of unprecedented amounts of
corrupting influence money flowing in Washington, dangerous new
secret funds being used to affect federal elections and massive
blatant violations of the campaign finance laws,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Democracy
21, who has studied the issue for 25 years. ``It's going to be an
unmitigated disaster for the health and integrity of our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of fund-raising has been driven, in part, by the
obsessive wants of both parties. Republicans want to retake the
White House; Democrats want to recapture the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited donations from corporations and individuals, commonly
known as soft money, did not emerge in presidential elections until
1988, when both Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts had donor clubs of $100,000 contributors. Bush's
club was called Team 100, a concept that seems quaint now that the
Republican Party has created a $250,000-a-year donor club with the
imperial title Republican Regents. The Regents are endowed with
exclusive benefits, like intimate meetings with party leaders and
luxury box seats at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee was criticized for inviting
its most generous donors to coffees with the president and White
House sleep-overs. Like the Republicans, it also offers its largest
donors private sessions with Democratic congressional leaders. Not
as glamorous, perhaps, as a night in the Lincoln Bedroom, but it
has proved an effective incentive. As one fund-raiser put it, ``A
lot of these people just want to rub elbows with the decision
makers in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee is offering
supporters the title of executive chairman at its national
convention this summer in Philadelphia. The cost for the honor is
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hardly a well-kept secret that if George W. Bush is
this year's nominee, his network of 200 ``Pioneers,'' each of whom
has already raised $100,000, will begin raising huge sums of soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at what he has raised in the hard money and just
imagine if one can raise when there are no limits on that the same
source,'' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for
Public Justice, a group that monitors Bush's fund-raising.
``Two-hundred-fifty million is probably a conservative guess.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee meeting in San Jose,
Calif., this month, fund-raisers said privately that they thought
the Bush presidential campaign could easily raise $250 million, and
possibly exceed $300 million, with the help of the Pioneers, all of
whom are well-connected multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about big numbers,'' said Donald Evans, the
former oil executive from Midland, Texas, who is Bush's finance
chairman and a close friend. ``I have heard $225 million, $250
million. Those numbers don't make any sense to me. But it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If those big numbers come in for the Republican nominee, his
Democratic opponent will probably be outraised and outspent by a
3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Only McCain and Bradley have made campaign finance a cornerstone
of their campaigns. Because the public has not embraced the issue,
the McCain-Feingold bill has sputtered in Congress for four
consecutive years. And judging by polls, the predictions that this
year's election will be bought rather than won has failed to enrage
most voters _ a response that baffles the advocates for stronger
controls on fund-raising and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to figure this out,'' said Roger Witten,
a lawyer who stood before the Supreme Court to defend the
post-Watergate election laws. ``People are interested in the
subject, and they get outraged by it, but they don't seem to relate
it either to the need for legislation or the way they react to
particular candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the guy on the street, they will say we need
campaign finance reform, but if you ask them who they are for, very
few people would rate campaign finance reform as a reason they
support someone. People simply blame the system.''

 WASHINGTON: the convention.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee was criticized for inviting
its most generous donors to coffees with the president and White
House sleep-overs. Like the Republicans, it also offers its largest
donors private sessions with Democratic congressional leaders. Not
as glamorous, perhaps, as a night in the Lincoln Bedroom, but it
has proved an effective incentive. As one fund-raiser put it, ``A
lot of these people just want to rub elbows with the decision
makers in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee is offering
supporters the title of executive chairman at its national
convention this summer in Philadelphia. The cost for the honor is
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hardly a well-kept secret that if George W. Bush is
this year's nominee, his network of 200 ``Pioneers,'' each of whom
has already raised $100,000, will begin raising huge sums of soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at what he has raised in the hard money and just
imagine if one can raise when there are no limits on that the same
source,'' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for
Public Justice, a group that monitors Bush's fund-raising.
``Two-hundred-fifty million is probably a conservative guess.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee meeting in San Jose,
Calif., this month, fund-raisers said privately that they thought
the Bush presidential campaign could easily raise $250 million, and
possibly exceed $300 million, with the help of the Pioneers, all of
whom are well-connected multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about big numbers,'' said Donald Evans, the
former oil executive from Midland, Texas, who is Bush's finance
chairman and a close friend. ``I have heard $225 million, $250
million. Those numbers don't make any sense to me. But it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If those big numbers come in for the Republican nominee, his
Democratic opponent will probably be outraised and outspent by a
3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Only McCain and Bradley have made campaign finance a cornerstone
of their campaigns. Because the public has not embraced the issue,
the McCain-Feingold bill has sputtered in Congress for four
consecutive years. And judging by polls, the predictions that this
year's election will be bought rather than won has failed to enrage
most voters _ a response that baffles the advocates for stronger
controls on fund-raising and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to figure this out,'' said Roger Witten,
a lawyer who stood before the Supreme Court to defend the
post-Watergate election laws. ``People are interested in the
subject, and they get outraged by it, but they don't seem to relate
it either to the need for legislation or the way they react to
particular candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the guy on the street, they will say we need
campaign finance reform, but if you ask them who they are for, very
few people would rate campaign finance reform as a reason they
support someone. People simply blame the system.''

   WASHINGTON _ The drumbeat of good economic news is becoming so
familiar that the nation might be excused for taking its prosperity
for granted. The United States enjoys the lowest unemployment rate
in a generation, stratospheric stock markets, stable prices and
even reduced welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But with the current economic expansion about to become the
longest on record, there are other, less salutary numbers worth
reflecting on. They suggest that those at the bottom of the
economic ladder are not benefiting much from the boom and, by some
measures, are falling even farther behind.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of the problem remains subject to debate, but it is
substantial and persistent enough that some analysts, particularly
on the left, now see it not just as a social problem but as a
potential threat to the economy's long-term prospects. And it is
striking enough that politicians across the spectrum feel compelled
to address it as they set out their election-year agendas.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate in 1998, the most recent year for which data
are available, stood at 12.7 percent, according to the Census
Bureau. That was down from 15.1 percent in 1993, but virtually the
same as at the peak of the last expansion, in 1989. And it is worse
than 1969, the year the previous record-setting expansion ended,
when 12.1 percent of Americans lived in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is all the news on income good. Average income for families
in the bottom fifth of the income scale fell 5 percent between the
late 1970s and the late 1990s, after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, income among the top fifth of families rose 33
percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute and the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, liberal research organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last, the median value of assets owned by families with incomes
less than $25,000 _ including everything from bank accounts and
stocks to homes and cars _ fell between 1995 and 1998, according to
the Federal Reserve, while families with higher incomes saw the
value of those assets surge.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the gap between rich and poor may no longer be
widening. The government's most widely used measures of income
inequality were basically unchanged through the latter part of the
1990s. And wage growth is picking up after a long period of decline
and then stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in an era of abundance, the continuing disparities
are focusing new attention on how to deal with inequality. And
while there remain sharp ideological differences, conservatives for
the most part have joined liberals in acknowledging that the issue
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential primary campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas talks of a ``compassionate conservatism'' that leaves no one
behind. In Washington, President Clinton plans to use his State of
the Union address this week to focus on how the nation can better
use the bounty of these good times to help those at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we must answer an increasingly urgent
question,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said last week. ``What
can we do to close the widening gap in income and skills that
leaves too many Americans unable to participate fully in the
American Dream?''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives still argue that inequality and poverty statistics
should be viewed in light of the extraordinary ability that
Americans have to move up the income ladder, and that fewer people
get left permanently behind than the numbers would suggest. Still,
they are increasingly acknowledging the persistence of poverty and
inequality to buttress their case that government solutions to
problems like inferior schools and teen-age pregnancy should give
way to market-based approaches and an emphasis on personal
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can read and write only at a third-grade level, the
economy has to get extremely strong for there to be a market for
you at the minimum wage or any wage,'' said John Weicher, director
of urban policy studies at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
research organization. ``And while the economy can make a
difference for many people, there are a lot of people for whom the
economy is not the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an emerging view among conservatives that the most
important gap is not in income, but in wealth. In their view, the
nation is becoming divided between people who are able to save,
invest and build wealth over the long run and those who are not.
The solution, they say, rests in steps like overhauling Social
Security to create private investment accounts for all workers,
giving everyone a chance to own capital and have a direct stake in
the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement toward becoming one nation that can invest and
one nation that cannot invest has potential consequences for social
and political stability down the road,'' said Michael Tanner,
director of health and welfare studies at the Cato Institute, a
conservative research group. Policy debates over wealth and
inequality still tend to be framed by liberals, who stress fairness
and social responsibility. But liberals, too, are increasingly
focusing on the economic implications.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy
Institute, cited the protests in December at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle and a recent Harris poll for
Business Week that found that 75 percent of Americans believe the
gains of the ``new'' economy are being distributed unequally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly banked a lot of our economic, political and
social capital on this notion that the global, technology-driven
economy is one that all Americans should buy into,'' Bernstein
said. ``That kind of poll result, the events in Seattle and this
gap between overall growth and the economic fortunes of the middle
class really threatens that contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence linking an economy's long-run potential to its success
in ameliorating inequality is still sketchy. But economists are now
starting to generate research suggesting that if ``inequality leads
you to underinvest in the lives of the have-nots,'' Bernstein said,
``then ultimately that can be a drag on economic growth, and that's
a situation we may ultimately have to face if we don't wrestle this
problem to the ground.''

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Last week, as Russian troops battled
Chechen rebels in Grozny, thousands of civilians were trapped in
the city; many others had fled.
</P>
<P>
   Zalpa Bersanova, a Chechen graduate in history from Moscow State
University and an aspiring author, was one of the refugees last
fall. She is a member of the republic's relatively privileged
intelligentsia, a woman whose family in Grozny had a second home in
a village and who, like most of her neighbors in Grozny, scorns the
calls of Islamic militants for a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of the 1994-96 Chechen war in Moscow, where she
was studying, but visited Grozny in the summer of 1995. Last
summer, when the new war was beginning, she returned from Moscow
and began a three-month diary. It was written sometimes in
leisurely recollection of a day, at other times as hastily
scribbled notes to be transcribed into a narrative when time
allowed. Here are excerpts, translated from the Russian by The New
York Times: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   By ZALPA BERSANOVA
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 25 Today, early in the morning, my older sister came. She
ordered everyone to get ready. We have to leave the city
immediately. Even the republic. ... Mama does not gather her
things. And I know why. Because she isn't planning to leave. Of
course she would like to leave and be with her children and
grandchildren. But she knows that our father won't go anywhere, and
she won't abandon him for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly planes begin to circle in the air. They seem to be very
close, almost touching the roof of our house. Rayana was born after
the war. She is only 8 months old. That's why seeing the planes she
thinks that they are flying toys and jumps in her mother's arms and
waves her hands. But Khava remembers still from that war what these
toys bring with them. She hasn't had the chance to forget that when
she hears a plane she has to grab her potty, a flask with water,
toys, and go down to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Mama is the very last to go down to the basement. But father
sits at his table and continues to write. I see his very
concentrated face. I become a bit frightened. It seems he is
writing something very important and is afraid that he won't have
time to finish.
</P>
<P>
   He began to write his book about the deportation ((by Stalin of
Chechens to Central Asia in 1944)) in the beginning of the '90s,
when it became permitted to write about this. He didn't finish this
book because in 1994 the war began, and he began to write a book
about that war. He hasn't finished it yet. Now another war has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the noise of the plane dies down, everyone is led
right out of the basement and put into cars. Of all the things we
chose, we are taking only the most essential: children's things,
bedclothes, warm clothes and food for the road.
</P>
<P>
   Father understands that the children must be saved. They become
cross-eyed from bombings, start to stutter and some of them stop
talking. During the last war many children were crippled by the
bombings, and those who died can't even be counted. But at the same
time father is worried that we might not be allowed back into the
republic. He is afraid that 1944 will be repeated ... Old people
are afraid that they will die in a foreign land and will be buried
there. ...
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky that we cross the border before dark. But people
coming in our direction warn: All of the homes in Ingushetia are
full. ... We drive around Ingushetia for a long time. But we don't
find anything ... Well, we'll have to turn back. It's already
completely dark when we cross the border again. ... When a traffic
jam forms and cars stop, we ask those who are walking what is
happening in the city. They tell of new bombings. We decide not to
go to the city, but stop in our family village, Shaami-Yurt, which
is not very far from the Ingush border. ... After feeding the
children and putting them to bed we recalled how we didn't want
father to build this house 20 years ago. We thought, why do we need
it if we have a house in the city. Father said confidently: It will
be useful.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 26 In the morning, all of the neighbors ask: Have you
become refugees? That word grates on the ear each time. Because
each time it smells of war. ... It's very cramped for everyone in
the house. But when I go to the Magomadovs, I become convinced that
it's not so crowded at our place. First of all, all of the
Magomadovs who lived in the city have come to their parents' home.
Second, they have a huge number of refugees in their house. About
40 people, I think.
</P>
<P>
   I last saw the Magomadovs' mother, Zulai, before the last war.
She always looked very young. No one believed that she had nine
children. Now she has eight children. During the last war he oldest
son, Shamil, died. She now has a heavy gait, her hair has turned
gray, her entire face is covered in wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 27 You get the feeling that all of the villages in
Chechnya were being bombed but ours. My first cousin Asya tells us
that in the beginning of the last war her mother had a dream in
which the saint buried here flew over our village on a white steed.
He covered the village with his felt cloak, as if protecting it.
During the last war Shaami-Yurt really wasn't bombed. Maybe this
time it will also fly past us.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 28 Today the refugee woman from the village called the
15th Dairy Collective Farm gave birth to a son. They named him
Islam. He will never know his father, who died in bombing two days
ago. His height and weight were estimated at a glance. Fortunately
the boy was born healthy. His young mother is not worried about
him. She's worried about what happened to her sisters and mother,
who stayed at home. The Magomadovs already know that they were
killed. But they are hiding this terrible news from their guest.
She hasn't gotten back her strength yet after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The following entry, scribbled on the back
of a list of Chechens living in Moscow, is not dated, but the
writer believes it is from Oct. 5. Aunt Malika cannot forget that
in 1997, when two of her sons searched the woods for firewood, one
died and the other lost an eye after land mines exploded. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Food is running out in every house ... the firewood is also
ending. ... All of the young men have gone to the woods for
firewood. ... Everyone is anxiously awaiting their sons. Especially
Aunt Malika. At around noon planes begin to ominously circle over
the village. ... Their load pulls away from them and flies down.
And no one knows where it will fall.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may seem, people haven't hidden, but are running
along the street. Ahead of everyone is Malika, white as chalk. I
don't understand right away that they are running to the woods,
where their sons are.
</P>
<P>
   While we are going down to the basement ((where we took small
children)) the noise dies down. But we are in no rush to go back
outside until we are sure that the planes have flown away. Then I
suddenly notice that Selima, who was sitting in my arms, has been
silent all the time. I start to shake her so that she will say at
least a word. But she is silent. When we come out of the basement,
a herd of cows rushes toward us. They are mooing loudly and
anxiously and run so quickly that their horns knock against each
other. Selima points toward them and says: ``Moo.'' I breathe a
sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   All of the woodcutters return alive and well, although the bombs
were aimed right at them. Apparently the Russian attack planes took
them for fighters, since they turned up in the woods.

reopened. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 29. Finally this happy day has come. ... Through the
gridded fence I see how one car after another drives out onto the
highway. The last to drive out is a big bus crammed with people. On
each side of the driver's cab are white flags.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour passes before we hear the familiar sound of
planes. Once again the glass in the windows shakes. Once again the
anxious bellowing of the cows, returning from pasture earlier than
usual. Once again the children are afraid and are pressing against
their parents. Once again there is panic in the village. Because
it's become clear they're bombing the highway. ... On the highway
itself is real hell ... deformed, burning cars, the moans of the
wounded, cries for help. Disfigured corpses. The Russian attack
planes are circling over this horrible scene like hawks. ...
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 30 I want to forget yesterday like a bad dream. I go down
to the river. They say that water takes away painful thoughts and
the heart becomes easy. But standing here on the bank is the bus
with the white flags. The bus is shot full of holes.

   NOV. 6 All of the days after October 29 have showed that it's
not safe to leave the village. The Rostov-Baku highway is
constantly under fire. Destroyed cars with corpses in them have
become a common sight on the highway. But it's no less dangerous to
remain in the village. There is no choice. We will have to take the
risk and try to get out of the republic before the border is closed
again.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult thing in this war is saying goodbye _ when
fellow villagers look with envy, but not unkindly, on those who are
getting out of this hell. And the most painful parting is parting
with parents. Once again war is placing us before a cruel choice:
Either save the children or abandon the parents. It is difficult to
see how old parents say goodbye to their grandchildren, as if
trying in these last minutes to give all of their caresses and
remember their faces, so they can then caress them in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The car pulls away from the gate. ... I try to hold back tears.
I take another look at my parents who, with crossed hands, are
standing at the gate. It is painful to see how after raising 10
children they are once again remaining alone in this land, which
has been enveloped by war. Mama, father, when will we see each
other again?
</P>
<P>
   We drive only to the nearest checkpoint. The driver doesn't risk
driving any further. ... After distributing our load among everyone
(the children were given the smallest and lightest bags) we set off
on foot. ...
</P>
<P>
   There it is finally, the cherished border. And the hated men in
camouflage uniforms with automatics. ... The commander of the
checkpoint is very happy that today he has power over these
unfortunate refugees. He is drunk with, reveling in, this
transitory power. He is giving various commands and getting
pleasure from how the crowd is obediently carrying them out. ...
The people don't become indignant, they don't have any strength
left to become indignant. And they are afraid of angering the
soldiers. ... Finally the barrier opens, and women and children are
let out in small groups. Men, of course, are not let out. And no
one know what will happen to them next. ...
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this nightmare is behind us. And ahead of us is once
again the unknown, alarm over the fate of our parents who have
stayed there where war is raging. A war in which for now there is
no end in sight.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Last week, as Russian troops battled
Chechen rebels in Grozny, thousands of civilians were trapped in
the city; many others had fled.
</P>
<P>
   Zalpa Bersanova, a Chechen graduate in history from Moscow State
University and an aspiring author, was one of the refugees last
fall. She is a member of the republic's relatively privileged
intelligentsia, a woman whose family in Grozny had a second home in
a village and who, like most of her neighbors in Grozny, scorns the
calls of Islamic militants for a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of the 1994-96 Chechen war in Moscow, where she
was studying, but visited Grozny in the summer of 1995. Last
summer, when the new war was beginning, she returned from Moscow
and began a three-month diary. It was written sometimes in
leisurely recollection of a day, at other times as hastily
scribbled notes to be transcribed into a narrative when time
allowed. Here are excerpts, translated from the Russian by The New
York Times: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   By ZALPA BERSANOVA
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 25 Today, early in the morning, my older sister came. She
ordered everyone to get ready. We have to leave the city
immediately. Even the republic. ... Mama does not gather her
things. And I know why. Because she isn't planning to leave. Of
course she would like to leave and be with her children and
grandchildren. But she knows that our father won't go anywhere, and
she won't abandon him for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly planes begin to circle in the air. They seem to be very
close, almost touching the roof of our house. Rayana was born after
the war. She is only 8 months old. That's why seeing the planes she
thinks that they are flying toys and jumps in her mother's arms and
waves her hands. But Khava remembers still from that war what these
toys bring with them. She hasn't had the chance to forget that when
she hears a plane she has to grab her potty, a flask with water,
toys, and go down to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Mama is the very last to go down to the basement. But father
sits at his table and continues to write. I see his very
concentrated face. I become a bit frightened. It seems he is
writing something very important and is afraid that he won't have
time to finish.
</P>
<P>
   He began to write his book about the deportation ((by Stalin of
Chechens to Central Asia in 1944)) in the beginning of the '90s,
when it became permitted to write about this. He didn't finish this
book because in 1994 the war began, and he began to write a book
about that war. He hasn't finished it yet. Now another war has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the noise of the plane dies down, everyone is led
right out of the basement and put into cars. Of all the things we
chose, we are taking only the most essential: children's things,
bedclothes, warm clothes and food for the road.
</P>
<P>
   Father understands that the children must be saved. They become
cross-eyed from bombings, start to stutter and some of them stop
talking. During the last war many children were crippled by the
bombings, and those who died can't even be counted. But at the same
time father is worried that we might not be allowed back into the
republic. He is afraid that 1944 will be repeated ... Old people
are afraid that they will die in a foreign land and will be buried
there. ...
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky that we cross the border before dark. But people
coming in our direction warn: All of the homes in Ingushetia are
full. ... We drive around Ingushetia for a long time. But we don't
find anything ... Well, we'll have to turn back. It's already
completely dark when we cross the border again. ... When a traffic
jam forms and cars stop, we ask those who are walking what is
happening in the city. They tell of new bombings. We decide not to
go to the city, but stop in our family village, Shaami-Yurt, which
is not very far from the Ingush border. ... After feeding the
children and putting them to bed we recalled how we didn't want
father to build this house 20 years ago. We thought, why do we need
it if we have a house in the city. Father said confidently: It will
be useful.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 26 In the morning, all of the neighbors ask: Have you
become refugees? That word grates on the ear each time. Because
each time it smells of war. ... It's very cramped for everyone in
the house. But when I go to the Magomadovs, I become convinced that
it's not so crowded at our place. First of all, all of the
Magomadovs who lived in the city have come to their parents' home.
Second, they have a huge number of refugees in their house. About
40 people, I think.
</P>
<P>
   I last saw the Magomadovs' mother, Zulai, before the last war.
She always looked very young. No one believed that she had nine
children. Now she has eight children. During the last war he oldest
son, Shamil, died. She now has a heavy gait, her hair has turned
gray, her entire face is covered in wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 27 You get the feeling that all of the villages in
Chechnya were being bombed but ours. My first cousin Asya tells us
that in the beginning of the last war her mother had a dream in
which the saint buried here flew over our village on a white steed.
He covered the village with his felt cloak, as if protecting it.
During the last war Shaami-Yurt really wasn't bombed. Maybe this
time it will also fly past us.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 28 Today the refugee woman from the village called the
15th Dairy Collective Farm gave birth to a son. They named him
Islam. He will never know his father, who died in bombing two days
ago. His height and weight were estimated at a glance. Fortunately
the boy was born healthy. His young mother is not worried about
him. She's worried about what happened to her sisters and mother,
who stayed at home. The Magomadovs already know that they were
killed. But they are hiding this terrible news from their guest.
She hasn't gotten back her strength yet after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The following entry, scribbled on the back
of a list of Chechens living in Moscow, is not dated, but the
writer believes it is from Oct. 5. Aunt Malika cannot forget that
in 1997, when two of her sons searched the woods for firewood, one
died and the other lost an eye after land mines exploded. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Food is running out in every house ... the firewood is also
ending. ... All of the young men have gone to the woods for
firewood. ... Everyone is anxiously awaiting their sons. Especially
Aunt Malika. At around noon planes begin to ominously circle over
the village. ... Their load pulls away from them and flies down.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Forcing Gov. George W. Bush to talk about
abortion can be more challenging than getting a child to eat
broccoli. He almost never raises the issue _ or even utters the
word _ on his own. For months, he ignored his Republican rivals who
assailed him relentlessly for his silence. Not until late last
week, in the final countdown to Monday's presidential caucuses in
Iowa, did Bush, cornered by reporters, offer more emphatic remarks
about his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He was squirming all the way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from four years ago when Bob Dole, then the
Republican front-runner, happily embraced the issue as he stomped
through Iowa. He promised to declare his first day in office
``American Family Day'' and to immediately reverse executive orders
by President Clinton that were ``forcing abortion even farther into
American life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's resistance to being yanked rightward on abortion and
other nettlesome social issues reflects a reality of Campaign 2000
that is magnified in Iowa but has set the tone for the entire
political season: The major candidates, Republicans and Democrats
alike, insist that they will stick to the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is most striking in Iowa because the state has a
history of driving candidates to extremes in order to prod voters
into venturing out on a bitter weekday evening to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In scrambling to the center, the candidates are parroting
Clinton's template from 1992: They don't want to say or do anything
that might come back to haunt them in November. The campaigns also
perceive a post-partisan, even post-political, dimension in the
American electorate. Voters these days don't want harsh
partisanship or leaders who vow to upset the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bush and the challenger he seems most worried
about, Sen. John McCain, are not that far apart on many issues. Nor
are the two Republicans appreciably different from Democrats on
some of the big questions. They all favor maintaining, if not
increasing, military spending. They oppose new taxes. They want a
balanced budget. They advocate free trade. They support the death
penalty. Except for Bradley, they favor welfare reform as it has
been pursued in recent years. And just as the two Republicans have
had little to say about their anti-abortion positions, the
Democrats do not advertise their abortion rights stands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrast from past campaigns in Iowa has been most
pronounced with Bush. His advisers' calculation is that after the
debacle with Newt Gingrich and impeachment, Republicans should do
nothing that in a general election could marginalize them.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Bush is truly a moderate. He has a
decidedly conservative record on abortion in Texas. Rather, he has
walked a tightrope, trying to mask the extent of his conservatism
so he can appeal to moderates, while not forsaking the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   All this was on display Friday when Bush refused to cave in to
his rivals' demands that he apply an anti-abortion litmus test to
his running mate or to judicial appointments. His advisers argued
that he had said nothing he would have to defend _ and in fact,
nothing new at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world has changed,'' said Ralph Reed, an adviser to
Bush who was the executive director of the Christian Coalition.
``As was the case with liberal Democrats in '92, religious
conservative Republicans in 2000 are willing to give their
candidates a little more rope to maintain their viability in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a liberal who backs Gore, put it this
way: ``There's no real grass-roots movements out there like the
freeze movements or the arms race back in the '80s. When the
economy's good, those kind of issues get pushed to the back
burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the campaigns have revived Clinton's early themes,
talking about opportunity and responsibility, improving education
and preparing American workers for the global economy. ``Everybody
is on everybody else's 45-yard line,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a former
senior adviser to Clinton, ``and Clintonism is the paradigm in
which everybody is operating on.''
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable test of whether a candidate has veered too far
to please (or appease) his base is whether he has said or done
anything that could resurface in a crippling 30-second commercial
in the general election. By that measure, all the candidates this
year have at times strayed.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials in Washington said they are salivating at
the chance to remind voters that Bush cited Christ as the
philosopher-thinker who most influenced him and of his hands-off
policy on South Carolina flying the Confederate flag. The
Republican Party has already produced a commercial highlighting
Gore's remark that he would favor a litmus test on gays in the
military for his appointments to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (He
quickly backtracked after a firestorm.)
</P>
<P>
   But it is Bush who has been most chary of committing a sound
bite he would live to regret. As he said here, he intends to out
forth ``a consistent message throughout in order to win the will of
the people.'' It's true that, in contrast to his inoffensive public
persona, Bush's campaign vigorously promotes its candidate as a
true conservative _ if only to conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   But, characteristically, at a public event in Pella, Iowa, on
Thursday, Bush, when asked by reporters why he did not mention
abortion in a speech, said he did so in his private conversations
with supporters. That same day, Gore, following a similar approach,
met with gay supporters. But the meeting was not public. And in
Burlington, Iowa, on Friday, Bradley _ who is also vying for
support among gays _ was not eager to discuss homosexual rights. To
a reporter's question, he offered a curt reply about civil rights
and quickly moved on.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from 1988, when then Sen. Paul Simon repeatedly
invoked Hubert H. Humphrey and Bruce Babbitt pressed Michael
Dukakis to have the ``courage'' to talk about tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   John Haskell, a political science professor at Drake University
here, argued that the view of Iowa as ``a crazy, loony state'' was
always overblown. The only reason past candidates were more attuned
to the fringes of their parties, he said, was that those races were
more competitive _ leaving candidates battling over smaller slices
of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come right down to it,'' he said, ``Iowa is just a
boringly moderate state.''

decidedly conservative record on abortion in Texas. Rather, he has
walked a tightrope, trying to mask the extent of his conservatism
so he can appeal to moderates, while not forsaking the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   All this was on display Friday when Bush refused to cave in to

<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a liberal who backs Gore, put it this
way: ``There's no real grass-roots movements out there like the
freeze movements or the arms race back in the '80s. When the
economy's good, those kind of issues get pushed to the back
burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the campaigns have revived Clinton's early themes,
talking about opportunity and responsibility, improving education
and preparing American workers for the global economy. ``Everybody
is on everybody else's 45-yard line,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a former
senior adviser to Clinton, ``and Clintonism is the paradigm in
which everybody is operating on.''
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable test of whether a candidate has veered too far
to please (or appease) his base is whether he has said or done
anything that could resurface in a crippling 30-second commercial

</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials in Washington said they are salivating at

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Forcing Gov. George W. Bush to talk about
abortion can be more challenging than getting a child to eat
broccoli. He almost never raises the issue _ or even utters the
word _ on his own. For months, he ignored his Republican rivals who
assailed him relentlessly for his silence. Not until late last
week, in the final countdown to Monday's presidential caucuses in
Iowa, did Bush, cornered by reporters, offer more emphatic remarks

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The leading Republican presidential candidates
might sound timid to non-Southerners when they insist that the
people of South Carolina should decide whether the Confederate flag
should fly above the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   After all, opinion polls have repeatedly shown that around 60
percent of South Carolinians have already decided they want the
battle flag taken down or moved elsewhere, leaving the national and
state flags on the dome. The decision really rests with a handful
of Republicans in the state Legislature who control not only the
flag's future, but also some of the votes the candidates need in
the state's presidential primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who instantly defer to South Carolinians on the issue of
the flag, may know exactly what they are doing in refusing to
express an opinion. To many of the state's voters and public
officials, particularly the Republican majority, the flag
represents neither slavery nor a hazily remembered mixture of
Southern courage and gentility. Instead, it flies primarily as a
warning beacon, reminding the rest of the country that South
Carolina brooks no interference in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Running deep in the state, particularly in white rural areas, is
a prickly, almost primordial sense of independence and insularity
that resents any meddling. South Carolina is full of public
officials who believe that the Civil War was fought not over
slavery or a way of life, but over federal trespass on a very lofty
ideal of state sovereignty. For some of them, this may be a last
chance to re-enact the ancient struggle over sovereignty that
haunts the state 140 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ancestors fought for the question of who was supreme, the
federal or the state government,'' said state Sen. Glenn McConnell,
a Charleston Republican who is a leader of the pro-flag forces.
``They felt like South Carolina freely went into the union, and had
the right to opt out, like an independent country. So no one from
outside the state is going to have any effect on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure to move the flag increases, chiefly from black
groups, local business leaders and Northern Democrats, tempers have
flared, with legislators saying they will never budge as long as
the NAACP continues its ``outside'' economic boycott of the state.
The issue has now become a staple of the presidential campaign, and
whenever there is a denunciation of the flag by one of the
Democratic candidates _ or by President Clinton, who weighed in
last week _ resistance to a compromise seems to grow, although
compromise appears inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the Confederate flag as a contemporary banner of defiant
states' rights may sound like a high-minded evasion of a history
that is steeped in slavery. But whether they realize it or not,
Bush and McCain _ both advised by flag supporters _ are paying
homage to a tradition of stubbornness that is well known to
students of the state's history. Carolina colonists staged the
continent's first revolution in 1719, overthrowing the English
power structure known as the Lords Proprietors when the nobles were
unable to protect the residents against raids by Indians and
pirates. A Charleston merchant, Christopher Gadsden, designed the
Revolutionary War's famous naval flag with its ``Don't Tread on
Me'' slogan and coiled rattlesnake; some South Carolina militias
carried a similar flag into battle during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes back to the first settlers, who were from the
English-speaking Caribbean,'' said Dr. Walter Edgar, director of
the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South
Carolina, who wrote ``South Carolina: A History'' (University of
South Carolina Press, 1998). ``They were a bunch of pretty tough,
driven individuals, used to having their own way, and if anyone
interfered, they were eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said it was no coincidence that South Carolina was the
first state to secede (in December 1860), partly to preserve
slavery but also to assert its independence from Washington. Since
then, the state has also resisted women's suffrage, integration and
even the enrollment of female cadets in the Citadel, the military
college in Charleston. It is the only state without an official
holiday marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about controlling your own destiny,'' Edgar said.
``This is a state that has always believed it should determine its
own affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have explored public opinion on the flag have no
trouble finding the ideological descendants of those first willful
colonists. Professor David Woodard, a political scientist at
Clemson University who has supervised polls on the flag, said
resentment motivates most of the 36 percent of those surveyed who
want to keep the flag flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told us is they dislike being held hostage by the
boycott, so they're just going to dig their heels in more deeply,''
Woodard said. ``I got the feeling that most of them don't even have
a particular allegiance to the Confederate battle flag, but if some
Northerner is telling them to take it down, that's why they want to
keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first voices demanding the flag's removal have
not been from outsiders, but from black South Carolinians, who see
the flag as a symbol of racism rather than independence. At last
Monday's enormous anti-flag rally, which drew nearly 50,000 people,
speaker after speaker made the point that the boycott and the
protests were organized within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks say they suspect the word ``outsider'' is actually
aimed at them, though their ancestors have been in the state since
1670 and often outnumbered whites. In the 1960s, segregationists
often blamed ``outside agitators'' for sit-ins and protests,
refusing to acknowledge that the civil rights movement had roots in
their state; references to the outsiders in the anti-flag boycott
have a similar ring for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they really mean by all this talk about states' rights is
that whites don't like for blacks to tell them what they ought to
do,'' said the Rev. Dr. William Diggs, pastor of the Trinity
Baptist Church in Florence, who gave the closing benediction at the
rally. ``Whatever they do, they want to make it appear that it's
their idea to do it.''

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The leading Republican presidential candidates
might sound timid to non-Southerners when they insist that the
people of South Carolina should decide whether the Confederate flag
should fly above the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   After all, opinion polls have repeatedly shown that around 60
percent of South Carolinians have already decided they want the
battle flag taken down or moved elsewhere, leaving the national and
state flags on the dome. The decision really rests with a handful
of Republicans in the state Legislature who control not only the
flag's future, but also some of the votes the candidates need in
the state's presidential primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who instantly defer to South Carolinians on the issue of
the flag, may know exactly what they are doing in refusing to
express an opinion. To many of the state's voters and public
officials, particularly the Republican majority, the flag
represents neither slavery nor a hazily remembered mixture of
Southern courage and gentility. Instead, it flies primarily as a
warning beacon, reminding the rest of the country that South
Carolina brooks no interference in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Running deep in the state, particularly in white rural areas, is
a prickly, almost primordial sense of independence and insularity
that resents any meddling. South Carolina is full of public
officials who believe that the Civil War was fought not over
slavery or a way of life, but over federal trespass on a very lofty
ideal of state sovereignty. For some of them, this may be a last
chance to re-enact the ancient struggle over sovereignty that
haunts the state 140 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ancestors fought for the question of who was supreme, the
federal or the state government,'' said state Sen. Glenn McConnell,
a Charleston Republican who is a leader of the pro-flag forces.
``They felt like South Carolina freely went into the union, and had
the right to opt out, like an independent country. So no one from
outside the state is going to have any effect on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure to move the flag increases, chiefly from black
groups, local business leaders and Northern Democrats, tempers have
flared, with legislators saying they will never budge as long as
the NAACP continues its ``outside'' economic boycott of the state.
The issue has now become a staple of the presidential campaign, and
whenever there is a denunciation of the flag by one of the
Democratic candidates _ or by President Clinton, who weighed in
last week _ resistance to a compromise seems to grow, although
compromise appears inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the Confederate flag as a contemporary banner of defiant
states' rights may sound like a high-minded evasion of a history
that is steeped in slavery. But whether they realize it or not,
Bush and McCain _ both advised by flag supporters _ are paying
homage to a tradition of stubbornness that is well known to
students of the state's history. Carolina colonists staged the
continent's first revolution in 1719, overthrowing the English
power structure known as the Lords Proprietors when the nobles were
unable to protect the residents against raids by Indians and
pirates. A Charleston merchant, Christopher Gadsden, designed the
Revolutionary War's famous naval flag with its ``Don't Tread on
Me'' slogan and coiled rattlesnake; some South Carolina militias
carried a similar flag into battle during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes back to the first settlers, who were from the
English-speaking Caribbean,'' said Dr. Walter Edgar, director of
the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South
Carolina, who wrote ``South Carolina: A History'' (University of
South Carolina Press, 1998). ``They were a bunch of pretty tough,
driven individuals, used to having their own way, and if anyone
interfered, they were eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said it was no coincidence that South Carolina was the
first state to secede (in December 1860), partly to preserve
slavery but also to assert its independence from Washington. Since
then, the state has also resisted women's suffrage, integration and
even the enrollment of female cadets in the Citadel, the military
college in Charleston. It is the only state without an official
holiday marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about controlling your own destiny,'' Edgar said.
``This is a state that has always believed it should determine its
own affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have explored public opinion on the flag have no
trouble finding the ideological descendants of those first willful
colonists. Professor David Woodard, a political scientist at
Clemson University who has supervised polls on the flag, said
resentment motivates most of the 36 percent of those surveyed who
want to keep the flag flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told us is they dislike being held hostage by the
boycott, so they're just going to dig their heels in more deeply,''
Woodard said. ``I got the feeling that most of them don't even have
a particular allegiance to the Confederate battle flag, but if some
Northerner is telling them to take it down, that's why they want to
keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first voices demanding the flag's removal have
not been from outsiders, but from black South Carolinians, who see
the flag as a symbol of racism rather than independence. At last
Monday's enormous anti-flag rally, which drew nearly 50,000 people,
speaker after speaker made the point that the boycott and the
protests were organized within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks say they suspect the word ``outsider'' is actually
aimed at them, though their ancestors have been in the state since
1670 and often outnumbered whites. In the 1960s, segregationists
often blamed ``outside agitators'' for sit-ins and protests,
refusing to acknowledge that the civil rights movement had roots in
their state; references to the outsiders in the anti-flag boycott
have a similar ring for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they really mean by all this talk about states' rights is
that whites don't like for blacks to tell them what they ought to
do,'' said the Rev. Dr. William Diggs, pastor of the Trinity
Baptist Church in Florence, who gave the closing benediction at the
rally. ``Whatever they do, they want to make it appear that it's
their idea to do it.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The murder of Zeljko Raznatovic, the
Serbian patriot known as Arkan and an indicted war criminal, was
treated here as a cultural event, and in fact there may be no
better recent window into this land's curious political culture.
Arkan and his death combined the peculiarly Serbian worlds of
mobsters and police, sports stars and starlets, businessmen and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people came to a commemoration service last week
for Arkan, while at least 3,000 more came to his funeral Thursday.
The streets outside were packed with glossy black sports utility
vehicles and BMWs, reminders of Arkan's rise to wealth from his
beginnings as a bank robber. Beside them were vendors for church
candles and flowers, serving an ordinary population. These people
admired Arkan for his devotion to Serbdom and dismissed the
relevance of his crimes when he was a Serbian paramilitary leader
whose forces used murder and the expulsion of civilians as military
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   These days, every conversation revolves around the mystery of
his death _ whether the government of Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, was responsible or some equally murky chain of
criminal rivalry. Newspapers covering the details of his life and
assassination by gunfire in a hotel lobby sell out early in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   At his commemoration, Borislav Pelevic, one of his friends and a
``general'' in Arkan's paramilitary force, known as the Serbian
National Guard or Tigers, spoke of his life in three parts: as a
hero and patriot; as a supporter of sports, especially soccer and
kick-boxing; and as a humanitarian and family man, noted for the
free bread his bakeries distributed and the charitable foundation,
``The Third Child,'' headed by his last wife, the hugely popular
patriotic folk singer Svetlana, known as Ceca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslim women kissed his hand,'' Pelevic said of Arkan, who was
a pioneer in Bosnia of forced expulsions and the murder of Croat
and Muslim civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Al Capone had merged with Gen. George Patton and
then married Madonna, moving into the semi-respectable, tacky elite
of Serbia, with its openings and fashion shows, all the while doing
favors for and being protected by the police and important
politicians. He even started going to restaurants like Madera and
the Writers' Club, where the real cultural elite, itself
nationalist, came to dine _ and many to talk with disgust about his
presence.
</P>
<P>
   As he became a very rich and almost respectable man, many young
people saw his wealth and glitzy connections as a model and had
little idea of his past. After only five years, it became tedious,
if not impolite, to mention his felonies and his war crimes, and
even the independent press here said little about his indictment by
the international war crimes tribunal in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a defeated, defensive Serbia had let his
nationalism and its own defensiveness cover over everything.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ceca, who was wildly popular before they married in 1995
and who added glamour to his reputation, were regulars on the
country's most popular talk show, run by Milovan Ilic, known as
Minimaks, a kind of Serbian Jay Leno. And it was on that show that
the couple announced their marriage and her pregnancies, adding two
children to the seven Arkan had fathered from two previous
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   She would talk about how she now wore Armani but would return to
Versace ``if he improved,'' while he would often be interviewed on
serious political topics. He traveled surrounded by intense
security, in a armored black Chevrolet Blazer, and they lived in a
giant house on a fancy corner in the fancy suburb of Dedinje, a
house of concrete and green glass that looked like a fancy
bordello. He was involved in business both shady and open, and even
his business interests were becoming more respectable. And he
clearly seemed to have protection from on high _ for a while, until
he got too rich or too greedy or too independent or too disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkan was a symbol here, not of ideology but of kleptocracy,''
said Biljana Srbljanovic, a 29-year-old playwright. ``He meant that
crime was not only legal but open. The newspapers make it seem like
`Godfather Part I and II,' but the leaders are also the mob, the
mob is part of them _ this is not a metaphor. He was invited
everywhere,'' she said, and even Patriarch Pavle, the leader of the
Serbian Orthodox Church, received him.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances on the Minimaks program, on a television station
controlled by the party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, made
him a part of ``the wealthy stupid people in the jet set,'' Ms.
Srbljanovic said. ``But it creates a cultural and moral world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arkan's rise makes no sense without understanding the nature
of the nationalism that apparently, for many here, excuses
everything else, and continues to hollow out the Serbian moral
framework.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian mind, he was associated with the extension,
consolidation and preservation of Serb land in the early years of
Yugoslavia's breakup, not with the terror and expulsions that made
it ethnically uniform or with the loss of that same land in 1995.

</P>
<P>
   In Croatia in 1991, with Belgrade's help and presumably under
its orders, Arkan ran arms to the Serbs around Knin and the Krajina
region at a period when the Yugoslav National Army could not openly
take sides; he was also active in eastern Slavonia, around Vukovar,
where 250 Croats were taken from a hospital and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the formal outbreak of the Bosnian war in April
1992, Arkan and his Tigers moved quickly and professionally to
seize Bijeljina and Brcko, the key towns in a vital corridor that
could connect the eastern and western halves of the Serbian part of
Bosnia, allowing it to become one coherent autonomous region within
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of real fighting that made this autonomous entity,
the Republika Srpska, possible.
</P>
<P>
   This period made Arkan a hero in Serbia and covered over his
petty criminal past, as well as some of his secret work in Europe
for the police in the killing of ethnic Albanian exiles. And as he
moved into business after the war, he began to wash both his
reputation and his money.
</P>
<P>
   For Goran Svilanovic, the leader of the opposition party called
the Civic Alliance, the celebrity of Arkan was despicable and his
death was no subject for mourning. ``I thought that if Arkan wasn't
killed, my kids would be working for his kids,'' he said, saying
that Arkan was quickly moving to legitimize his businesses and was
being widely admired for his power and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   And if that had happened, Svilanovic said, it would have been
the victory of a tainted gangsterism and the defeat of a modern
view of moral behavior. ``It would mean that he would have been
right and I would have been wrong,'' Svilanovic said. Of his
8-year-old daughter, he said: ``My fear was that in 10 years she
would tell me, `You were on the wrong side.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By day, Dr. Penelope Friedman, an internist at the
Washington Clinic here, has been busy prescribing Relenza, a new
and heavily promoted medication for the flu. At night, when
commercials for Relenza pop up on her television screen, she finds
herself angrily lecturing the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It irritates me,'' Dr. Friedman said. ``I think it gives
partial knowledge to the consumer that is not always helpful.''
Drug manufacturers have a conflict of interest, she said, adding,
``They present themselves as educating the public, but they stand
to make money if the patients ask for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two and a half years since the Food and Drug
Administration relaxed its rules, enabling drug companies to pitch
products directly to consumers on television, the public has gotten
a cram course on drugs, Madison Avenue style. Herpes, allergies,
depression, baldness, obesity and, in this season of runny noses,
the flu all make the heartbreak of psoriasis look insignificant by
comparison. As the billion-dollar ``direct-to-consumer'' media
blitz has escalated, so has the criticism from drug safety experts
and physicians like Dr. Friedman, who complain that the flood of
ads will misinform consumers and put pressure on doctors to write
unnecessary, or inappropriate, prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns recently won an ally in the agency that opened
the floodgates in the first place: In a public health advisory, FDA
officials warned that doctors appeared to be relying too heavily on
Relenza, and that some patients might have died for lack of more
aggressive treatment. The agency, which had already forced the
drug's manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome, to pull an ad for Relenza off
television, said the caution was prompted in part by its concern
over the intense marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have found that more than 80 percent of patients and
doctors have seen such drug ads, and the commercials have clearly
affected the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. A recent
FDA survey found that among 960 people who had visited a doctor in
the previous three months, 27 percent were prodded by an
advertisement to talk to a doctor about a medical condition they
had not mentioned before. Roughly 7 percent of respondents had seen
an ad and subsequently asked their doctor for the drug. Half the
requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Still another study, a survey of 329 randomly selected residents
of Sacramento County, Calif., asked patients how they would react
if their doctor refused such a request. One-quarter said they would
seek the prescription elsewhere; 15 percent said they would
consider leaving their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are being pressured,'' said Dr. Raymond Woosley,
chairman of the pharmacology department at Georgetown University.
``People are saying, `I will go to another doctor if I don't get it
from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether doctors succumb to that pressure depends, in part, on
their specialty and the severity of the illness, said John

ads. Infectious-disease specialists seldom prescribe AIDS drugs
based on a patient's request, he said. But podiatrists often accede
to requests for therapies for toenail fungus, which many people did
not know existed until ads for Laprisil, an antifungal medicine,

between patients and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistent with the whole trend toward consumer
empowerment,'' said Dr. Nancy Ostrove of the FDA's Division of Drug
Marketing, Advertising and Communications. ``We believe there is a
certain public health benefit associated with letting people know
what's available. People are telling us that they are going to talk
to doctors about conditions that they have never discussed
before.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are unseen risks, said Dr. David Kessler, the former

FDA would approve a drug, and its sales would increase gradually,
giving the agency time to track side effects that did not turn up
in testing but emerged only with use in the general population.
``What happens now is that the FDA approves a drug,'' he said,
``and with the direct-to-consumer advertising, the drug becomes a
blockbuster overnight and all of a sudden it's in wide use. That's
what makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   As to how much a particular commercial changes prescribing
patterns, that is almost impossible to tell. The drug industry
conducts studies, but does not discuss the results _ in part, some
in the advertising world suspect, because certain commercials are
not as successful as is generally believed.
</P>
<P>
   Such campaigns have brief runs, promoting flu drugs in the
winter and allergy drugs in the spring, and outsiders cannot easily
track their effectiveness, said Richard Campbell, a partner in the
Campbell Regan Ward agency, which specializes in promotion to
medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody spends $40 million and then stops,'' Campbell
said, ``it begs the question: Did it stop because they found out it
didn't work, or because it was effective? Nobody's telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck, for instance, dropped its campaign for Fosamax, an
osteoporosis medicine, and replaced it with generic ads encouraging
women to talk to their doctors about the disease. Such
``unbranded'' ads are not subject to the FDA's stringent rules
about advertising information on side effects, and can therefore be
shorter and less expensive. ``We just wanted to do something
else,'' said Jan Weiner, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the ads backfire. Dr. Friedman said the litany of side
effect information required by the FDA scares off some patients,
keeping them from taking drugs they really need. ``They'll start
listing off the side effects,'' she said, ``and say, `I am not
about to try these things.'''

CHOOSING DRUGS FROM TV ADS THAT CIRCUMVENT DOCTORS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By day, Dr. Penelope Friedman, an internist at the
Washington Clinic here, has been busy prescribing Relenza, a new
and heavily promoted medication for the flu. At night, when
commercials for Relenza pop up on her television screen, she finds
herself angrily lecturing the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It irritates me,'' Dr. Friedman said. ``I think it gives
partial knowledge to the consumer that is not always helpful.''
Drug manufacturers have a conflict of interest, she said, adding,
``They present themselves as educating the public, but they stand
to make money if the patients ask for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two and a half years since the Food and Drug
Administration relaxed its rules, enabling drug companies to pitch
products directly to consumers on television, the public has gotten
a cram course on drugs, Madison Avenue style. Herpes, allergies,
depression, baldness, obesity and, in this season of runny noses,
the flu all make the heartbreak of psoriasis look insignificant by
comparison. As the billion-dollar ``direct-to-consumer'' media
blitz has escalated, so has the criticism from drug safety experts
and physicians like Dr. Friedman, who complain that the flood of
ads will misinform consumers and put pressure on doctors to write
unnecessary, or inappropriate, prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns recently won an ally in the agency that opened
the floodgates in the first place: In a public health advisory, FDA
officials warned that doctors appeared to be relying too heavily on
Relenza, and that some patients might have died for lack of more
aggressive treatment. The agency, which had already forced the
drug's manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome, to pull an ad for Relenza off
television, said the caution was prompted in part by its concern
over the intense marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have found that more than 80 percent of patients and
doctors have seen such drug ads, and the commercials have clearly
affected the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. A recent
FDA survey found that among 960 people who had visited a doctor in
the previous three months, 27 percent were prodded by an
advertisement to talk to a doctor about a medical condition they
had not mentioned before. Roughly 7 percent of respondents had seen
an ad and subsequently asked their doctor for the drug. Half the
requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Still another study, a survey of 329 randomly selected residents
of Sacramento County, Calif., asked patients how they would react
if their doctor refused such a request. One-quarter said they would
seek the prescription elsewhere; 15 percent said they would
consider leaving their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are being pressured,'' said Dr. Raymond Woosley,
chairman of the pharmacology department at Georgetown University.
``People are saying, `I will go to another doctor if I don't get it
from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether doctors succumb to that pressure depends, in part, on
their specialty and the severity of the illness, said John
Fezzuoglio, a market research analyst for the Scott-Levin
consulting firm in Pennsylvania, which tracks prescription drug
ads. Infectious-disease specialists seldom prescribe AIDS drugs
based on a patient's request, he said. But podiatrists often accede
to requests for therapies for toenail fungus, which many people did
not know existed until ads for Laprisil, an antifungal medicine,
started appearing on television. Women who ask for
Ortho-Tri-Cyclen, a contraceptive promoted as the only
birth-control pill that can relieve acne, almost always get the

<P>
   When it comes to their money, Americans hate _ pardon the pun _
change. The U.S. Mint is well aware of this, and is spending some
$45 million to assure public acceptance of the ``golden dollar,'' a
new gold-colored coin that replaces the Susan B. Anthony silver
dollar this month. The Mint expects, among other things, to
circulate 100 million golden dollars through 4,000 Wal-Mart outlets
and even slip them into 5,000 boxes of Cheerios. The new coin,
carrying the image of Sacagawea, Lewis and Clark's Indian guide, is
needed because stockpiles of Susan B. Anthonys are almost gone, and
because nobody seemed to like them in the first place (they were
easily mistaken for quarters). So the Treasury Department took a
new approach _ a coin whose color and smooth edge should be
appealing and easily distinguishable from its numismatic brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a hard sell. ``We think of coins as being the
ultimate utilitarian objects,'' said Philip Diehl, the director of
the Mint. ``And yet there are very deep, irrational attitudes
toward them.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why more than 75 percent of Americans, according to
one recent poll, oppose eliminating the $1 bill in favor of any
dollar coin. So what if the Federal Reserve estimates that it could
save $395 million annually by replacing bills that last 18 months
with coins expected to last 30 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very conservative about changes in money,'' said
Douglas Mudd, a manager of the National Numismatics Collection of
the Smithsonian Institution. ``Smart cards have flopped in the
U.S., whereas they've been very successful in Europe. We're
resistant to innovation.'' If you need proof, just look at the
street scene on the back of a $10 bill: yes, those automobiles are
from the 1920s, as is the clothing on the few people loitering
about.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' conservatism about money is embedded in its
history. ``Our forefathers were acutely aware of how the Crown
would debase money by adding base metals,'' said Beth Deisher,
editor of Coin World magazine. Their response was Article I,
Section 8, Paragraph 5 of the Constitution, which reserves to
Congress the power to coin money. But vesting politicians with
moneymaking power has caused problems that don't exist in other
nations, where the central bank has the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've politicized something that never should have been
politicized,'' said James Benfield, executive director of the Coin
Coalition, a lobbying group. ``Members of Congress are afraid to be
known as the guy who took Thomas Jefferson off the nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, American money doesn't change much. The recently
overhauled $100, $50 and $20 bills had not been through a redesign
since 1928, and were changed now only in response to widespread
counterfeiting. Predictably, Americans mistrust the new bills.
``We've gotten criticisms that the new bills don't look like real
money,'' said Edward Sheehan, a spokesman for the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing. It's a fair bet that the updated $10 and $5
bills being released later this year will elicit the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which was ``just dumped on
the public,'' said Stephen Bobbitt, public relations officer of the
American Numismatics Association, the image of Sacagawea was chosen
after considerable public comment. It is a traditional image,
harking back to the 19th century, when Native Americans were often
employed as icons of Liberty. Still, it's new money, and some
people have already registered their protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too `prettified' and cute,'' wrote David Wiegleb of
Pleasant Hill, Calif., in an e-mail message to the Mint. ``Looks
like a Hallmark card,'' another e-mailer complained. ``There aren't
enough female Native Feminists to make this thing popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Frank Gasparro, the 90-year-old former chief engraver of
the Mint, weighed in on Sacagawea. ``The designer doesn't know
coinage too much,'' he said. ``She has a three-quarters image, so
there will be more wear on her face. Should have used a profile.''

   FULL-MONTY-CALENDAR (Rylstone, England) _ It would hardly occur
to someone looking for exhibitionists to seek them out among the
sisterhood of the Women's Institute, a wholesome rural service
organization. So it provoked wide-eyed interest when word went
forth from this pastoral place that 11 members of the Rylstone

within Grand Central Terminal, where a handful of workers keep

Nebraska work with a passion that its critics say verges on

there has been little political risk for those who denounce
abortion with vehemence. Now the Supreme Court has decided to
examine a Nebraska law that bans a late-term procedure its
opponents call partial-birth abortion. While similar laws in other
states have been winding their way through the courts, it was the
Nebraska law that reached the Supreme Court, in part, because state
officials here have aggressively sought the legal challenge. By

national attention and ridicule to Cleveland, but it also proved to

<P>
   They are more likely to have health problems and learning
disorders. They are more prone to accidents and psychological
problems. But today they are the minority most likely to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   While just over one in 10 Americans are left-handed, southpaws
are dominating this year's presidential race: Al Gore, Bill
Bradley, John McCain and Steve Forbes are all left-handers. The
only real hope of a right-handed presidency lies with Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, but his father is a portsider.
</P>
<P>
   The current crop of candidates represents a curious surge in
southpaws in national politics. Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald
R. Ford are also lefties, but among earlier presidents only Harry
Truman, Herbert Hoover and James Garfield made the list. While it's
not clear whether more lefties are drawn to presidential politics,
the recent boom might be explained by some new findings about
handedness, psychology and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left-handers actually have a profile that works very well for
a politician,'' said Stanley Coren, a psychology professor at the
University of British Columbia and the author of ``The Left-Handed
Syndrome'' (Free Press, 1992), which caused a stir with its claim
that lefties die premature deaths. ``They tend to be more dominant
rather than nurturing. And they tend to be a bit more pushy and a
bit more cold.''
</P>
<P>
   One person's pushiness may be another's coping skills. After
all, from the first time lefties smudge their alphabet to the last
time they set their watch, the right-sided world conspires against
them. From computers to cars, camcorders to corkscrews, tools to
stairway banisters, left-handers must navigate a daily obstacle
course.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning: only the right hand is allowed to
swear on the Bible, salute the flag and press the flesh. In fact,
in many languages ``left'' is synonymous with weak, clumsy or
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coren, lefties are in a class with others who see
themselves as part of a poorly treated minority.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that in politics, a vocation dominated by privileged
men, persecuted lefties actually have an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the requirements for a leader _ real or aspiring _ is
that he or she needs to be able to anticipate what is going to
happen, to think about things in unconventional ways, to see
himself or herself as different from the rest of the pack,'' said
Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at Harvard
and the author of ``Leading Minds: An Anatomy of Leadership''
(Basic Books, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Tackling life from the other side may have other cognitive
benefits. A 1995 study published in The American Journal of
Psychology found that left-handed respondents scored higher on
tests of divergent thinking, a style of reasoning that generates
multiple solutions. (Perhaps it is more than coincidence that
Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci were both lefties.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility that southpaws are hard-wired for
success in an arena where tactical skills and verbal gymnastics are
prized attributes. In the last five years, new brain-mapping
technology has revived a debate over lateralization, the theory
that portions of each brain hemisphere specialize in different
functions and talents.
</P>
<P>
   Since the brain is connected to the body in a crisscrossed
fashion, the theory is that lefties give their right lobes more
exercise. While almost all right-handers process language
exclusively in the left hemisphere, about half of all left-handers
have language centers in both sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefties are more symmetric rather than lopsided,'' said Dr.
Albert Galaburda, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston. ``In our models, we do find more
connections between the two hemispheres in symmetric brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaburda says lefties may also have an advantage in their
capacity for visual-spatial analysis, which gives them a stronger
grasp of the spatial relationships among objects. He cites the high
percentage of left-handed architects, artists and athletes. This
ability might account for Bradley's success, but with the exception
of Gore's newly acquired wardrobe aesthetic, the left-handed
candidates have yet to display any notable visual flair.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner suggests that lefties have an edge when it comes to
conceptualizing and planning a campaign. ``It is probably not an
accident that military leaders, who need to envision wide terrains,
historically went into politics,'' he said. So maybe it is not an
accident that Colin Powell, H. Norman Schwarzkopf, George Patton,
Winston Churchill and Napoleon were all southpaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left brain seems to be better at looking at the pieces,
while the right brain seems better at putting the pieces
together,'' said Robert Ornstein, a psychologist and author of
``The Right Brain'' (Harcourt Brace, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   So does McCain tap more of his brain during debates than Bush
does? Do lefties run better campaigns and make better
filibusterers?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, roughly half of all left-handed people have the
same basic brain design as right-handers. In addition,
left-handedness has been linked to dyslexia, epilepsy, attention
deficit disorder, depression and alcoholism. And researchers at the
University of Wisconsin have found that in general, people with
heightened activity in the right prefrontal cortex of the brain
tend to be more nervous and pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   As for Coren's panic-inducing studies about lefties' checking
out earlier, more recent findings have found the death differential
to be insignificant. So if the ticking clock of mortality is making
the candidates desperate to secure a spot in history, they can all
exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that being left-handed in a
right-handed world creates stress. And that may be the most potent
motivating force of all. ``There are a large number of individuals
who, when faced with a number of stressors, are driven to become
more successful,'' Coren said. ``Some even achieve greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to being left-handed, that which does not kill you
might just make you president.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in the loopy landscape of South American economies, Ecuador
is an extreme case. Last year it defaulted on some of its debt,
roughly 70 percent of its banks have been taken over by the state,
inflation exceeded 60 percent, and the local currency _ the sucre _
is running at 25,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that Ecuador's president, five days before he was
ousted in a coup Friday, tried the economic equivalent of a Hail
Mary pass. On Jan. 9, President Jamil Mahuad announced that the
U.S. dollar would be the new coin of the realm. The sucre would be
used only as small change. (The new president, Gustavo Noboa
Bejarano, said in a radio speech Saturday morning that he intended
to continue with the dollarization program.)
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador thus joins a growing list of more than two dozen
countries, the largest of them Panama, that use the dollar as their
official currency, as well as the people in more than 50 other
countries who unofficially put their trust in U.S. money, according
to the International Monetary Fund. In Russia alone, residents hold
about $40 billion in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's abandonment of the sucre is raising questions about
how many economically battered countries can take refuge behind the
dollar without having an impact on the U.S. economy itself.
</P>
<P>
   The question is difficult to answer, in part because there has
never been anything quite like the current dominance of the dollar.
More than $300 billion is circulating outside the United States,
and from the tiniest Mexican pueblo to the street corners in
Albania, the dollar is accepted, even favored over local
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, U.S. treasury officials have been unwilling to either
openly condemn or endorse the dollarization. But since the euro,
Europe's new single currency, mad its debut last year,
dollarization gained credence as a way for the United States to
maintain the pre-eminence of the dollar and to export economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress take this view. ``For a country like
Ecuador, dollarization creates at the very least a period of
stability,'' said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who is the vice chairman
of the Joint Economic Committee, which has drafted bills offering
other countries financial incentives to adopt the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins
University, has compared the performance of developing economies
linked to the dollar with those that are not and found that the
dollar's stability does seem to rub off. Dollarized countries and
those that back their currency on a one-to-one ratio with dollars
(as Argentina does now) enjoyed higher growth rates, lower
inflation and smaller deficits from 1950 to 1993 than those that
relied on their central banks to set monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to extinguish the frequency and reduce the
magnitude of recurring currency crises is to put these little
half-baked central banks out of business,'' Hanke said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Ecuador, where the three top members of
the central bank quit when the government decided to replace most
of the 11 trillion sucres in circulation with about $450 million,
at a rate of 25,000 sucres to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Under dollarization, the banks lose their most important power,
the ability to print money. That's one reason the three top bankers
quit.
</P>

<P>

the long-term effects of dollarization. The gyrations of a small
national economy that used dollars would have little effect here,

or a group of countries in the hemisphere decide that they want to
do it,'' he said, referring to dollarization, ``it could have an

</P>
<P>
   Bergsten wonders what would happen if the U.S. economy slowed,
but high oil prices kept a dollarized Mexico booming. The demand
for dollars south of the border could put upward pressure on
interest rates just when the American states needed lower rates to
kick-start economic growth.

the Federal Reserve to alter course or have its own purely U.S.

   Ecuador is also running the risk of being out of sync with the
U.S. economy. For example, an interest rate hike, intended to slow
expansion of the U.S. economy, might send Ecuador into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering bills to give the secretary of the
treasury the power to share with the dollarizing countries some of
the revenue that they lose by not issuing their own currency. In
the case of Argentina, that comes to about $750 million a year. In
Ecuador, it would be about $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But formal arrangements would invariably be accompanied by
pressure from the dollarizing country to have some say in setting
monetary policy, perhaps with a seat on a new or expanded Federal
Reserve Board. Something similar happened in Europe, where the
central banks of 11 nations were replaced by a new European Central
Bank that represents them all but gives special consideration to
none.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington, the desire to legislate the dollarizing process
is a natural one. But a better idea may be to let foreign nations
decide on their own whether to adopt U.S. currency. This is what
Ecuador did, without implicating the United States in the process
at all. As Hanke said, with Ecuador ``the bottom line is that there
aren't any realistic downsides for us.''

YANKEE DOLLARS: LATIN AMERICA DECIDES, IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM, JOIN

<P>
   Even in the loopy landscape of South American economies, Ecuador
is an extreme case. Last year it defaulted on some of its debt,
roughly 70 percent of its banks have been taken over by the state,
inflation exceeded 60 percent, and the local currency _ the sucre _
is running at 25,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that Ecuador's president, five days before he was
ousted in a coup Friday, tried the economic equivalent of a Hail
Mary pass. On Jan. 9, President Jamil Mahuad announced that the
U.S. dollar would be the new coin of the realm. The sucre would be
used only as small change. (The new president, Gustavo Noboa
Bejarano, said in a radio speech Saturday morning that he intended
to continue with the dollarization program.)
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador thus joins a growing list of more than two dozen
countries, the largest of them Panama, that use the dollar as their
official currency, as well as the people in more than 50 other
countries who unofficially put their trust in U.S. money, according
to the International Monetary Fund. In Russia alone, residents hold
about $40 billion in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's abandonment of the sucre is raising questions about
how many economically battered countries can take refuge behind the
dollar without having an impact on the U.S. economy itself.
</P>
<P>
   The question is difficult to answer, in part because there has
never been anything quite like the current dominance of the dollar.
More than $300 billion is circulating outside the United States,
and from the tiniest Mexican pueblo to the street corners in
Albania, the dollar is accepted, even favored over local
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, U.S. treasury officials have been unwilling to either
openly condemn or endorse the dollarization. But since the euro,
Europe's new single currency, mad its debut last year,
dollarization gained credence as a way for the United States to
maintain the pre-eminence of the dollar and to export economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress take this view. ``For a country like
Ecuador, dollarization creates at the very least a period of
stability,'' said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who is the vice chairman
of the Joint Economic Committee, which has drafted bills offering
other countries financial incentives to adopt the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins
University, has compared the performance of developing economies
linked to the dollar with those that are not and found that the
dollar's stability does seem to rub off. Dollarized countries and
those that back their currency on a one-to-one ratio with dollars
(as Argentina does now) enjoyed higher growth rates, lower
inflation and smaller deficits from 1950 to 1993 than those that
relied on their central banks to set monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to extinguish the frequency and reduce the
magnitude of recurring currency crises is to put these little
half-baked central banks out of business,'' Hanke said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Ecuador, where the three top members of
the central bank quit when the government decided to replace most
of the 11 trillion sucres in circulation with about $450 million,
at a rate of 25,000 sucres to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Under dollarization, the banks lose their most important power,
the ability to print money. That's one reason the three top bankers
quit.
</P>
<P>
   But the presidents of developing countries that adopt the dollar
also lose some power. They can no longer resolve political crises
by bullying their central bankers into lowering interest rates or
printing money to cover government debts. The benefit is that it is
more difficult for these governments to pursue inflationary
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hanke's enthusiasm, though, economists are divided over

   His Airness Laces Up Some New Shoes
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's intimate association with winning ended
Wednesday when the former Chicago Bulls superstar bought an
unspecified stake in the lowly Washington Wizards and became its
president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan-Wizards match is one of stark opposites. Jordan won
10 scoring titles in his National Basketball Association career and
led the Bulls to six championships in eight seasons _ with a
sabbatical for minor league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards, born in 1961 as the Chicago Packers, won an NBA
title in 1978, as the Washington Bullets, but have two winning
seasons in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to evaluate everything involved,'' Jordan said at a
press conference, ``and if that means everyone worries that their
heads will be chopped off, then they'll go out and do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the game 53 weeks after his retirement offers
Jordan a chance to communicate the tao of His Airness to a dozen
underachieving Wizards. ``It's my job to make sure they put the
effort on the court to show respect for the people paying to watch
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, though not in game shape, has enough wind to practice
with his players. He frequently outraged his Bulls teammates during
practices with his obsessive demands to play harder and better.
</P>
<P>
   His players know they won't be able to fool Jordan. ``The best
evaluation I can make of a player is to look in his eyes and see
how scared they are,'' he said, his trademark edge on display. ``I
know the signs of scaredness.''
</P>
<P>
   Be afraid, Wizards. Be very afraid.

   I'm No Doofus. I'm a Genius.
</P>
<P>
   He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool,
according to an old Chinese proverb. But new research suggests that
if this is so, such fools are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Two psychologists, Dr. Justin Kruger of the University of
Illinois and Dr. David Dunning of Cornell University, found in a
series of studies that incompetence often accompanies
overconfidence. Asked to rate their skill on tests of logic,
grammar and humor, subjects who scored lowest were also the most
likely to ``grossly overestimate'' their performance, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   These results make sense, Kruger and Dunning wrote in a recent
article in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
because the knowledge necessary to perform competently is often the
same knowledge required to evaluate competence.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their incompetent peers, subjects who did well on the
tests tended to underestimate their abilities a bit. But asked to
``grade'' the tests of others, they quickly upgraded their
self-assessments. ``They instantly realize, `My God, I had no idea
people were so lousy!''' Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, low-scoring subjects further inflated their
self-judgments after seeing the work of their peers. Only when they
received training in the skills demanded by the tests did the inept
subjects grow more realistic in their evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the researchers said, fit well with previous work
showing that overconfidence is a common human trait.
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent studies, the psychologists have examined
people's assessments of their performance on drivers' tests. Their
finding: ``There is very little, if any, correlation between how
much people think they know about driving safety and how much they
really know,'' said Dunning. ``And of course, they overestimate how
much they know.''

   Israel and Syria Suspend Peace Talks
</P>
<P>
   High-level peace talks between Israel and Syria are in limbo
after negotiations scheduled for last Wednesday in West Virginia
were canceled. Both sides agreed to send experts to the United
States to discuss technical matters, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration blamed neither side for the
postponement, saying only that ``their approaches to the next round
differ, and as a result, there is going to be a delay.'' Talks
unraveled after the Syrian news media, responding to leaks of the
American draft peace treaty in the Israeli press, declared that
Israel must make its withdrawal from the Golan Heights the first
order of business.
</P>
<P>
   Helms Lectures the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and one of the sharpest critics of the United
Nations, went to the Security Council to tell its members why he
thinks the American people have put the organization on notice.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that Congress has the right to dictate conditions for
the payment of more than $1 billion in debts, Helms warned the
United Nations that Americans will ``cast it aside'' if the
organization fails to meet their expectations. Afterward, nearly
every member of the council challenged his harsh words.

   Crazy Weather Ahead
</P>
<P>
   Scientists reported that naturally occurring changes in heat
patterns in the Pacific Ocean may make winters more volatile in the
United States over the next 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such weather, prevalent this winter and last in much of the
country, is characterized by unusual warmth alternating with
numbing cold, and results from a natural phenomenon known as La
Nina.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is too early to be certain, experts say a long-term
shift in Pacific surface temperatures may result in more frequent
editions of La Nina _ exposing North America to meteorological
split personality from December through February.

   Chile elected its first Socialist president since Salvador
Allende was overthrown in a violent coup in 1973. The victory of
Ricardo Lagos over a former aide to Gen. Augusto Pinochet was a
sweet triumph for the country's political left.
</P>

10 years, but he has promised to work hard to improve education and

and other questions of Aegean sovereignty, which have been at the

   Kohl Resigns Party Post
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl resigned his post as honorary chairman of Germany's
Christian Democrats after the party accused him of betrayal for
refusing to identify secret donors from whom the former chancellor
illegally took more than $1 million in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the party's popularity plunged, Kohl insisted that his honor
would be compromised if he named people he had promised anonymity.
But many Germans seemed deeply offended at his apparent contempt
for the law requiring that the source of any party contribution
over $10,500 be declared.

   Harsh Anti-Tobacco Message
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at teen-age smoking, the Canadian government proposed
that cigarette packs carry color photographs of diseased hearts and
cancerous lungs, lips and gums. And in an attempt to rob smoking of
its sex appeal, the link between smoking and male impotence would
be illustrated by a photo of a droopy cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Rock, Canada's health minister, justified the proposal,
which the tobacco industry has vowed to fight, by saying that 90
percent of the nation's habitual smokers started as teen-agers.

   Opposition to Tube Feeding
</P>
<P>
   When people with advanced Alzheimer's disease become unable to
eat, it might seem humane and logical to feed them through a
stomach tube, as many hospitals and nursing homes do. But tube
feeding is far from an act of kindness, according to an article in
The New England Journal of Medicine. Experts say tube feeding does
not help most demented patients, and may increase their suffering:
they often pull out the tubes, and wind up in restraints and
sedated. Feeding patients by mouth would be much kinder, doctors
say.

   Clinton Offers a Health Plan
</P>
<P>
   Returning to a central theme of his political career, President
Clinton proposed a $110 billion package of tax credits and
subsidies to help people get health insurance over the next decade.
He said the proposal would cover at least five million people now
uninsured. He would, for example, let parents enroll in the new
Children's Health Insurance Program. And he would help low-wage
workers pay premiums for insurance offered by employers.

   Turkish-Greek Accords
</P>
<P>
   After decades of hostility, Turkey and Greece, two neighbors who
share a common geography and centuries of history, began taking
concrete steps toward friendship. Their foreign ministers met in
Istanbul to sign accords dealing with commerce, tourism,
environmental protection and other areas of common concern. Both
ministers said the accords could lead to serious talks on Cyprus
and other questions of Aegean sovereignty, which have been at the

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 23, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-IOWA-REVIEW (Des Moines) _ A little-noticed reality of
Campaign 2000 is magnified in Iowa but has set the tone for the
entire political season: Even in the face of relentless sniping
from their rivals and from interest groups, all major candidates
have refused to swerve from the middle of the road on nettlesome
social issues. The situation is most striking in Iowa because this
state has a storied history of driving candidates to the extremes.
By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the `a' and `p' categories.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CASH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Record amounts have poured
into national political committees. Record sums have been raised by
most senators and congressmen and governors. Record amounts have
flowed to leadership committees, state party organizations and
political action committees. The 2000 elections could cost a total
of $3 billion, an amount that far exceeds the estimated $2.1
billion spent on the 1996 elections. By Don Van Natta. (Moved in
the `a' and `p' categories.) With a graphic.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-DIARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Diary excerpts by Zalpa
Bersanova, a Chechen graduate in history from Moscow State
University and an aspiring author, who recently returned to Grozny
and became a refugee. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INCOME-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a time of plenty, why are the
poor still so poor and becoming even poorer? The problem is
substantial and persistent enough that some analysts, particularly
on the left, now see it not just as a social problem but as a
potential threat to the economy's long-term prospects. And it is
striking enough that politicians across the spectrum feel compelled
to address it as they set out their election-year agendas. By
Richard W. Stevenson. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SC-FLAG-REVIEW (Columbia, S.C.) _ To many South Carolinians, the
Confederate flag debate is not about slavery vs. Southern heritage,
but is about whether the rest of the country should keep out of
South Carolina's business. This stubbornness is of no surprise to
students of South Carolina history, who have seen it throughout the
centuries. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTHAND-CANDIDATES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Left-handed persons
comprise only about 10 percent of the population, but they are
often overrepresented among prominent presidential candidates: Al
Gore, Bill Bradley, John McCain, Steve Forbes (and, in previous
campaigns, Bill Clinton, George Bush the elder, Ross Perot, Gerald
Ford). The phenomenon might be explained by some new findings about
handedness, psychology and the brain. By Melissa Roth.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-ADS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the FDA relaxed its rules to
permit drug companies to pitch products directly to consumers on
TV, the viewing public has been taken on a short course through
pharmacy school, Madison Avenue style. As the multi-million dollar
media blitz has escalated, so has the criticism, from drug safety
experts and irritated physicians complain that the flood of ads
will misinform consumers and put undue pressure on doctors to write
unnecessary, or inappropriate, prescriptions. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-COINS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When it comes to their money,
Americans hate _ pardon the pun _ change. More than 75 percent of
Americans, according to one recent poll, oppose eliminating the $1
bill in favor of any dollar coin. The nation's conservatism about
money is embedded in its history. The result is that U.S. money
doesn't change much. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ARKAN-REVIEW (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The murder of Arkan,
a Serbian patriot and indicted war criminal, was treated here as a
cultural event, and in fact there may be no better recent window
into this land's curious political culture. For Arkan and his death
combined the peculiarly Serbian worlds of mobsters and police,
sports stars and starlets, businessmen and politicians. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLARIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ecuador has joined a growing list
of more than two dozen countries, the largest of them Panama, that
use the dollar as their official currency, as well as the people in
more than 50 other countries who unofficially put their trust in
U.S. currency. Questions arise about how many economically battered
countries can take refuge behind the U.S. dollar without having an
impact on the U.S. economy itself. By Anthony DePalma.

   RYLSTONE, England _ It would hardly occur to someone looking for
exhibitionists to come to the Yorkshire Dales village of Rylstone,
a picture perfect collection of cottages and a duck pond on the
road between Skipton and Kettlewell.
</P>
<P>
   Much less would someone seek them out among the sisterhood of
the Women's Institute, a wholesome rural service organization known
for ``jam and Jerusalem'' _ the home bottled preserves from English
country kitchens and the Blake poem enshrining ``England's green
and pleasant land.''
</P>
<P>
   So it provoked some wide-eyed interest when word went forth from
this pastoral place that 11 members of the Rylstone and District
chapter of the Women's Institute, ages 45 to 66, had decided to
substitute the usual images of watery sunsets and hiking paths
bursting with buttercups on their annual calendar with pictures of
themselves with no clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   But what proved even more surprising than the event was the
response to it.
</P>
<P>
   The women had come up with the attention-getting notion as a way
of raising money for leukemia research, a mission that took on a
poignant urgency after the husband of one of their members died of
the illness. They hoped that by the deadline of their campaign
sales of the $8 calendar might reach $2,000. It reached $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another unexpected reaction, their calendar, a discreet and
tasteful sendup of the garage mechanic model, brought forth
thousands of letters from middle-age women saying that the serenity
and confidence of the village women had restored their own flagging
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our 50s, and it doesn't bother us, and that seemed to
come across,'' said Tricia Stewart, co-owner with her husband of a
medical software firm. She introduces herself these days as Miss
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to say, how absolutely bloody marvelous!'' wrote a
Bristol woman in her mid-40s. ``I have no intention of reaching my
50s, 60s, 70s or more and lying down for the rest of my life, and I
know that a lot of other women out there need to see that they
aren't expected to either.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Liverpool said, ``It makes us oldies feel better
about ourselves _ quite uplifted, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A man from the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland said the
calendar had enabled him to convince his 47-year-old wife that a
recent mastectomy didn't make her ``any less desirable.'' And
another man exulted, ``How wonderful to see real women instead of
stick insects with pouty lips and pipe cleaners for legs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The women, who call their fund-raising effort the Calendar Girl
Campaign, have seen their own daily calendars fill up with events
ranging from agriculture and amusement fairs to network television
interviews to the annual Woman of the Year dinner in London and
modeling appearances on the catwalks of fall fashion week.
</P>
<P>
   Royal courtiers in London, hearing the women were in town,
invited them to Buckingham Palace to hand-deliver calendars for the
queen and the queen mother to a gold-braided equerry. ``A really
dishy young chap,'' confided Angela Baker, 54 (Miss February).

   But none of it seems to have gone to their heads. When Matthew
Freud, great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, who is the moment's hottest
celebrity public relations man in London, invited them in to
discuss corporate sponsorship, they gleefully told him they had
never heard of him. ``The whole time,'' Ms. Baker said, ``I thought
his name was Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   They also won't be doing another calendar. ``We couldn't repeat
the success, and we'd lose the novelty,'' said Moyra Livesey (Miss
May), a 51-year-old nursing home manager.
</P>
<P>
   The women first thought up their daring venture in 1997, a time,
they said, before any of them had heard about ``The Full Monty,''
the hit film about a group of men who bare it all in nearby
Sheffield. ``We partly did it out of devilment,'' said Lynda Logan
(Miss July), a 56-year-old painter. ``But the top and bottom of it
was that we were so shocked by John's death that we would have done
anything to draw attention to the tragedy of his illness.'' John
Baker, 54, a national park officer in the Yorkshire Dales, died in
July 1998, only five months after falling ill.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan was to have Ms. Logan's husband, Terry, a former
professional photographer, set up the shot, then duck into a side
room while she snapped the shutter. But on the day of the shoot
itself, the women overcame their inhibitions with generous amounts
of red wine and let Logan, 61, go ahead and do the whole job
himself. ``We're all great friends, so there was no
embarrassment,'' Ms. Livesey said. ``In fact, watching each other
covering ourselves strategically with sieves and plants and apple
presses and the like was tremendous fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The women maintain their Women's Institute image by wearing
pearls in all the shots. The pictures are in black and white,
except for the presence of a bright yellow sunflower in every
frame, a symbol that commemorates John Baker, who busied himself
planting sunflower seeds during his illness but didn't live to see
them bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The calendars were a hit from the moment they were published in
April, and no objections came even from quarters the women were
wary of. Their husbands and children all applauded their
initiative, and the chairman of the parish council said only,
``Well, I've seen more than that over the garden fence.''

   Reporters from the London tabloids who showed up with money to
pass out for gossip found no one to spend it on. A television

word to say about the appearance of strippers in his flock, said,
``So will it be Methodist ministers posing this way next?''

   ``No,'' the Rev. Keith Hopper responded. ``They'll pay us to

   The urge to bare all has now spread to other organizations
around England, many with causes of the same traditional bent as
the Women's Institute. Those stripping for charity have included
Countryside Alliance chapters, pro-hunting groups, sports clubs,
farmers from Devon, chefs in Suffolk, a Royal Air Force pilot team,
a fire brigade in suburban Manchester and the Sir Watkins
Williams-Wynn's Hunt in Cheshire, which Prince Charles has often
ridden with.

   With all this shedding of cricket whites and jodhpurs going on
across Britain, the only reported moment of embarrassment occurred
in the countryside outside Prees Higher Heath in Shropshire.

   David Higham, 41, an editor of a hunt supporters' magazine, was
being photographed astride a mountain bike driving feverishly

air.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ A visit to the headquarters of the Nationalist
Party, which has governed Taiwan for more than 50 years, erases any
doubt about the party's proprietorial role in this island nation.
The fortresslike edifice looms large across a boulevard from the
president's office _ a marble-and-concrete reminder that, in
Taiwan, the government does little without the party's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the opening of the headquarters in 1998 may turn out to have
been spectacularly ill-timed. Taiwan will hold elections in less
than two months, and for the first time in five decades, the
Nationalists are in real danger of losing the presidency. The
party's candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, is trailing his two
rivals in the very close race to succeed Taiwan's longtime
president, Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an opposition leader moving into the red-brick
quarters that the Nationalists confiscated from the departing
Japanese in 1945 has rattled the political establishment here. And
it is forcing the governing party to make some significant
concessions _ moves that may permanently alter the power structure
in Taiwan, regardless of who wins the election on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Lien shook up the race by pledging that the
Nationalist Party would stop managing the more than 100 companies
in which it owns shares and would place its business interests in a
trust. The party's portfolio, which ranges from petrochemical
companies to a television network that is piped into karaoke bars,
is worth at least $3.8 billion and generates annual profits of $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   Lien's proposal has drawn a deeply skeptical response. People
here find it hard to believe that the party would sever its ties to
a commercial empire that has made it, by some estimates, the
richest political organization in the world. But Lien insists that
he is not just trying to score points in the campaign. He says he
wants to clean up Taiwan's money-saturated political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much troubled by the so-called vulgarized
political culture,'' Lien said in a recent interview at his office,
as a military band played marches outside. ``What is important
today is how we make the necessary arrangements so that political
competition in the future can be more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of corruption have already affected the campaign,
though it is not Lien but a former Nationalist official who has
been tainted. James Soong, a former provincial governor of Taiwan
who quit the party last year to run for president as an
independent, has admitted that he deposited $7.6 million in party
money into the bank accounts of his son and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Soong said that the transfers were authorized by President Lee
and that the money was set aside to support the family of Taiwan's
former president, Chiang Ching-kuo. President Lee and the Chiang
family both deny that, and the ensuing furor has wiped out Soong's
early strong lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   However Soong came into his millions, the scandal has served to
underscore the deep financial reservoir and other assets that the
Nationalist Party has accumulated. Among the party's holdings are
Taiwan's largest radio station, one of its three main television
networks and a daily newspaper. While these news organizations are
no longer party organs, they can still be counted on to favor
Lien's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody believes they will spend a tremendous amount of
money in this campaign,'' said Annette Lu, the vice presidential
candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. ``The
people are sick of the KMT,'' she added, using the initials by
which the party _ Kuomintang in Chinese _ is usually known in
Taiwan. ``They have ruled Taiwan for 55 years, and they are
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lu said the deep pockets of the party allowed it to buy more
commercial time and set up broader local networks than the
opposition. She also accused the Nationalists of buying votes by
handing out money on election day and by steering contracts to
influential business people.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party entered the business world almost by
accident in 1945, when its troops arrived from China and seized
hundreds of buildings from the defeated Japanese. After the party
fled the mainland in 1949 and established its base on the island,
it used its money to propel Taiwan's economic development. The
party's pattern was to finance aspiring businesses in new
industries, often taking a small stake.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the party invested in the petrochemical industry.
In the 1970s, it expanded into banking, insurance and financial
services. And by the 1980s, it was helping bankroll Taiwan's leap
into high technology. Defenders of the party say it played an
indispensable role in the transformation of Taiwan from a backwater
into one of the world's most advanced economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, people say the party took advantage of Taiwan's growth,
but it wasn't that way at all,'' said Benny T. Hu, the president of
China Development Industrial Bank, in which the party has a small
stake. ``In 1975, nobody else had the money to put into these
ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As Taiwan's economy matured, however, it became less reliant on
money from the party. The country's financial markets are as
sophisticated as any in Asia, and local companies have ample access
to capital. Critics say that far from being helpful, the party's
involvement in business now just opens the door to conflicts and
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, the party sold the headquarters of its radio
station _ a blocklong complex on one of the last prime development
sites in Taipei _ in late 1998. It obtained an assessment of the
property's value, but then sold it to a politically connected
developer at well below the market price. Real estate agents here
expect the building to be replaced by luxury apartments. In the
meantime, the party is using it as its campaign headquarters and
has plastered a vast poster of Lien and his running mate across the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has dabbled in technology, the party largely missed
out on the high-tech boom of the last decade. Its media properties
remain reliably profitable, but the Asian economic crisis hammered
the party's property development and construction companies.
Despite the overall profits from the portfolio, analysts estimate
that more than half of the party's companies are losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Given this deteriorating performance, some observers think Lien
is simply displaying shrewd business sense in turning the concerns
over to trustees. ``They retain ownership, and if the trusts are
run by professional managers, they will generate even more cash,''
said Ching-hsi Chang, a professor of economics at National Taiwan
University and a frequent critic of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, party officials say that by severing the party from the
management of the companies, the Nationalists will be less able to
use them as a vehicle to win support.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, we'll have to use our policies to attract voters,
not our financial superiority,'' said Lee Ching-ping, an adviser to
Lien and the president of the party's radio station, the
Broadcasting Corp. of China. ``That's why this was a very sensitive
decision for us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the vice president took the step to distinguish himself
from President Lee, who has governed Taiwan for 12 years and is a
commanding political figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview here, Lien said that he may relax President
Lee's tight restrictions on trade with China. He also declined to
reaffirm the president's policy of dealing with Beijing on a
``state-to-state'' basis, saying it was not necessary to keep
endorsing an existing policy. That policy has infuriated the
Chinese, who view it as a precursor to a declaration of
independence by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, analysts said it was the vice president's
faltering campaign that spurred him to break with the past.
Although the race for president is too close to call _ with Lien,
Soong and the Democratic Progressive Party's candidate, Chen
Shui-bian, all bunched within a few percentage points _ Lien has
generally been in third place in polls. Chen and his party, in
particular, have successfully painted Lien as a symbol of the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without us, he would never have done this,'' said Ms. Lu of
the Democratic Progressive Party. ``The possibility of his defeat
is so clear that he had no choice.''

HEALTH CARE ISSUES DOMINATE STATE LEGISLATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I., Wis., Md., NY., N.J., Va.)  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Massachusetts lawmakers returned to work this
month, these jumbo-sized, hard-to-chew items were on their
legislative plate: the financial meltdown of the state's biggest
health maintenance organization, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care;
rising prices for prescription drugs, and the lack of an HMO
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   And more: the confidentiality of medical records; prompter
payment by insurers; long-term care; nursing salaries, and on and
on, for at least 400 bills related to health care.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplated the labor ahead, the Massachusetts
legislators could at least console themselves that they were far
from alone.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
health care issues made up a greater proportion of bills in state
legislatures around the country than any other topic in 1999, about
27,000 bills out of about 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 of those health care bills became law last year.
Although fewer state legislatures are in session this year _ 44 as
opposed to 49 _ already 16,000 health care proposals, again the
largest proportion of 104,000 bills on the table, have carried over
or been introduced for 2000. A good percentage will pass, said Lee
Dixon, director of the health policy tracking services of the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every likelihood that the states will continue to
enact legislation that addresses the concerns of the citizens of
the states around access to care, managed care and cost of health
care,'' Dixon said. ``It's a populist issue. It's not a Republican
or Democratic issue. It's state legislators and legislatures trying
to address the needs of their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Congress is stuck on many critical health care
questions, some state lawmakers say they feel as if they are
bearing the brunt of the burden, struggling to fill the most gaping
holes in the medical system. They cannot wait for Congress, they
say, to tighten controls over managed care, to expand health
insurance coverage, to begin addressing the rise in demand for
long-term care, and more.
</P>
<P>
   While the states can serve as laboratories for what later
becomes federal policy, some legislators say the load is feeling
awfully heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As state lawmakers, we recognize that this has fallen to us,
but I think you would be hard pressed to find many legislative
leaders in the country who don't think the time is ripe for a
national health policy of some sort,'' said state Rep. Gerard M.
Martineau, the Democratic majority leader of the Rhode Island
House. ``Some sort of solution is necessary. It's just too big, and
we've been doing the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, lawmakers have just finished helping to assure
the transition of 125,000 patients to new health care plans after
Harvard Pilgrim pulled out in an earlier admission of financial
defeat. In the coming weeks, Martineau said, lawmakers will try to
fashion some relief for companies whose health insurance premiums
have gone up from 12 percent to 60 percent as a result. They are
considering a plan to help small companies form groups to gain
lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now, Martineau said, is how the state can prevent such
crises in health maintenance groups and ``how we can act as a
facilitator to improve the affordability and accessibility of
health care to our citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar focus prevails in Wisconsin, where state Sen. Russell
S. Decker, a Democrat, said that three competing proposals to help
older people pay for prescription drugs were in the works, along
with plans for a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the speaker of the House of Representatives is
proposing a broad program to expand health insurance coverage for
working people and children.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it is not clear how extensively Gov. George Pataki
and the Legislature will deal with the issue in the current
session, particularly because they have enacted a host of laws
intended to protect patients in managed care plans. The laws ranged
from one requiring medical plans to release detailed information
about their policies and another making it easier for people with
debilitating illnesses to receive treatment from specialists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature is expected to deal with a related measure
this year. It would give consumers better access to doctors'
disciplinary and malpractice history. HMOs do not include such
information with the names of the doctors on their provider lists,
and doctors are usually reluctant to volunteer the information to
patients. HMOs are are not required to provide the information.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has already been passed by the Democrat-led Assembly,
but has yet to be taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is also wrestling with health care issues, including
a $150 million bailout of the HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, a
Democratic push for an HMO bill of rights, and Gov. Christie
Whitman's veto of a bill that would have required health insurers
to cover infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly are
pushing for prescription drug subsidies for the elderly and greater
rights for members of health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislatures, said Dixon of the National Conference of
State Legislatures, are ``where we have seen, over the last four or
five years, the nation's health policy is really kind of shaped.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Few states seem to be in quite the health care fever that
prevails in Massachusetts, where the current crises mix with a
tradition of leadership on innovative health care laws. The state
extended health insurance coverage to children in 1996 when the
Legislature increased the cigarette tax to finance the cost. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., used the bill as a model in helping to
write federal legislation that allowed millions of children to have
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Massachusetts Legislature voted to subsidize small
businesses that paid 50 percent of the insurance premiums for
lower-income employees. The same law offered the employees
financial help in paying their share.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mark C. Montigny, a Democrat and the chairman of the
Senate Ways and Means Committee, said, ``I expect the first quarter
of the year to be heavily dominated by prescription drug issues and
HMO reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature enacted a law last year protecting patients
whose health groups failed _ just in time for the financial crisis
at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Harvard Pilgrim, one of the oldest
and most respected nonprofit HMOs in the country, disclosed tens of
millions of dollars in losses early this month and was placed in
court-ordered receivership, leaving 1.3 million members in
Massachusetts in a health care quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is also still coping with the aftermath of a
federal judge's ruling that the state's HMOs are not required to
provide an option of full prescription drug coverage to older
citizens. The state is moving toward a plan to buy drugs in bulk to
help get discounts for the elderly and others, but the issue
remains a burning one.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the pharmacy issue, the federal government has just
abdicated its role,'' said State Rep. Harriette L. Chandler, a
Democrat and chairwoman of the Legislature's Joint Committee on
Health Care. ``I think the prescription issue should be handled at
the federal level, and I think people are saying, `The system is
broken, and how do we fix it?'''
</P>
<P>
   So heavy is the focus here on health care that Montigny _ who
admits he has a passion for the topic _ estimates that he spends
more of his own time and his staff's time on it than any two or
three other issues combined.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Massachusetts lawmakers said they put such heavy
emphasis on health care in response to demands from their
constituents. They are ``closer to the ground'' than their
congressional counterparts, they say, and when a doctor tells
unhappy patients to complain to their local politicians, the state
lawmakers tend to get the phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published on Wednesday,
voters named health care as among their top concerns, with 32
percent of 1,027 surveyed saying the price of health care was
``extremely important'' to them and 31 percent saying the same
about the number of Americans with no health insurance. In
addition, 26 percent said that medical care available in health
maintenance organizations was extremely important to them.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, all the state action on health care is good, said
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national group
for health care consumers. Their explorations of various options,
Pollack said, ``augur well for more comprehensive action, either by
additional states or by the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as broadening health insurance coverage for children,
Pollack said, the states have been leaders in passing protections
for patients in managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``As both these examples illustrate, you can't
systematically achieve the kind of change that's needed without
partnership from the federal government,'' particularly because of
the enormous amounts of money needed to expand health care
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislatures do have certain advantages. They are not
as hampered by the lobbies that often block federal health care
bills, state lawmakers say, and they tend to work in a more
bipartisan fashion on health care than Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so much they can do, they say, and they
foresee no respite soon.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no major federal change in health policy soon,
``you'll see this real frenzy in the state legislatures,'' Montigny
said. ``I don't see any lightening up of that over the next couple
of years.''

 DOUBLE DARE: ONE EYE ON McNAIR, ONE ON GEORGE  
 (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The game plan was simple and
self-explanatory. Dare McNair, the Jacksonville Jaguars called it.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars would stack eight defenders at the line to stop
Tennessee's superb running back Eddie George and challenge
quarterback Steve McNair to stand in the pocket and pass the Titans
to victory.
</P>
<P>
   And the plan worked for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Until this season, the Titans had not beaten the Jaguars with
McNair at quarterback. Early this season, when Jacksonville
quarterback Mark Brunell was out of the game, the Jaguars lost to
the Titans here at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was reason to believe that the system could still
work when the teams met again Dec. 26. McNair had missed five games
after surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his lower back in the
second week of the season, and he had been dismal since his return.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven games that followed, he had thrown only one
touchdown and had been intercepted seven times. Neil O'Donnell, who
had gone 4-1 while McNair was convalescing, seemed on the verge of
being named the starter.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the Jaguars and their aggressive defense on the
day after Christmas. This time, Jacksonville's vaunted zone blitz
seemed to have played to McNair's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz forced McNair out of the pocket, where he moves with
the nimbleness and confidence of a running back who has found his
lane. And he had the best game of his professional career: five
touchdown passes in a 41-14 stunner over the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   McNair dispelled once and for all the suggestion that he is not
a quarterback who can lead the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I haven't heard any saying about `Dare McNair' this
week,'' McNair said. ``It took four or five games to really get
back. I broke out against Jacksonville, and from then on, I've been
playing with a lot of confidence. After that type of surgery, I
don't think anybody comes back and puts up big numbers, regardless
of who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   That game has changed Jacksonville's view of McNair as they
prepared for Sunday's American Football Conference championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, the unofficial scouting report on McNair
said that he was weakest when he had to stay in the pocket and read
defenses. So far in the playoffs, that theory has not been tested.
McNair has clearly been a secondary figure to George in the Titans'
two playoff victories, with only 188 yards and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   While Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin says stopping the run is
still his top priority, the Jaguars have had success limiting
George. He has run for more than 100 yards only once against the
Jaguars, in the December game.
</P>
<P>
   In McNair, Jacksonville faces a quarterback who, cornerback Dave
Thomas said, is like facing an extra running back in the backfield.
And so, McNair has become less a player the Jaguars dare to beat
them and more of one they will beware of, even though he arrived at
a Friday evening news conference wearing a protective boot on his
left foot, a precautionary measure to alleviate pressure on a
bothersome turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie George complements McNair,'' Thomas said, in a reversal
of the conventional wisdom. ``When you have a running back like
Eddie George, he's going to get downfield. Then you have another
guy who can throw and run, so you have to account for three things,
versus a team like the Dolphins, where you cannot worry about
Marino running.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair was 187 of 331 passing for 2,179 yards with 12 touchdowns
and eight interceptions this season. But he ran for eight more
touchdowns and gained a career-high 337 yards on 72 carries, and it
is his running ability _ and the fearlessness with which he uses it
_ that is especially troubling to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   In watching film last week, Thomas said he noticed that McNair
seldom looks to his secondary receiver, preferring, if his primary
receiver is covered, to tuck the ball away and go on the run. But
when McNair is running around in the backfield, Thomas said, he
finds the second and third receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher does not expect McNair to produce the
big play, although the quarterback was able to exploit several
blown coverages against the Jaguars in December. And it was McNair
_ not George _ who produced the game-breaking play when he
scrambled to his left and found Jackie Harris uncovered for a
62-yard touchdown that gave the Titans a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wiggled out of the pocket and got to the perimeter,''
Jacksonville safety Carnell Lake said. ``When he gets outside the
pocket, he's dangerous. He's not the type of quarterback who
happens to be in trouble and will slide. He'll put his head down
and try to get the extra yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Jaguars shied away from the notion that they were
daring anyone to beat them, cautious not to sound as if they were
disrespecting a player who scorched them in December.
</P>
<P>
   But the soft-spoken McNair merely smiled Friday at the
suggestion that the Jaguars might change their strategy because of
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still going to dare us to throw,'' McNair said. ``But
when you have eight guys in the box to stop the run, you've got
one-on-one on the receivers.''

<P>
   With broken bits of prayer they begged God to save them, as the
smoke thickened and the orange glow beneath their door brightened.
The three young women, cowering against their college room's
window, then sought comfort in a trembling recitation of that most
familiar of Christian prayers, the Lord's Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But no rescuers came for Alyssa Merla and her two roommates.
Seeing no other choice, they breathed in the tainted air, reached
for one another's hands and dashed into the eye-stinging blackness.
Somehow they made it down the stairs and emerged into the 10-degree
cold outside, their knees bruised from crawling, their faces
streaked with soot and tears. Ms. Merla was wearing pajama bottoms
and a T-shirt with the name of her school: Seton Hall University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merla was hospitalized for a day for smoke inhalation. But
she would soon learn that she had been among the fortunate in the
brief fire early Wednesday in a third-floor lounge of Boland Hall,
the freshman dormitory at Seton Hall. Three freshmen were killed,
including one of her best friends. Another friend was among five
students seriously burned; at least three remain on ventilators at
nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merla is 18 years old, a physical therapy major from West
Long Branch, N.J., with long brown hair and a face that seems
incapable of hiding emotion. But a flash point in time has aged
her, she acknowledges. ``Life will never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   So too has Seton Hall University been transformed. Its history
as a venerable Roman Catholic institution of 10,000 students,
nestled in peaceful South Orange, N.J., will now always include
what every college dreads: a deadly dormitory fire.
</P>
<P>
   The campus is now host to an unsettling tandem: mourning and
investigation. In trying to determine the fire's cause, a task
force led by the Essex County prosecutor has set out to interview
hundreds of students roused from Boland Hall that morning,
including the dozens who were injured. Investigators have even
taken over a room on campus for interviews with students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that we want to do is interview every single
person who was on that floor, including the residents and anyone
else who might have been on that floor prior to the fire,'' said
Joseph Green, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. ``We're trying to get the message out: If you
were on that floor and you weren't interviewed, get in touch with
the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury has also been convened, and documents are being
subpoenaed, signaling that investigators are taking an
unsentimental view of some accepted ways of life on campus _ from
frequent prank fire alarms to administrative decisions regarding
housing made more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Seton Hall say that they will cooperate fully
with investigators; that they want to grieve, console and move on.
In the meantime, many students have stepped forward to give
testimony _ as though speaking of the fire will help them to
understand the incomprehensible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first hours of Wednesday at Seton Hall were charged with the
kind of carefree exuberance that alumni seek to re-create for
decades afterward. The second half of the 1999-2000 academic year
had begun with a singular moment of joy _ the Seton Hall Pirates
had upset St. John's Red Storm in men's basketball on Tuesday night
_ and many students felt like celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   They packed places like Bunny's Tavern and the Gas Light
Brewery, about a mile down South Orange Avenue, shared hoots and
high-fives on the campus grounds, and milled through the halls of
the university's six dormitories, including Boland, where _ the
school likes to say _ its community begins.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman building's charm comes from its inhabitants, not
its architecture; it is a six-floor mishmash of bricks and cinder
blocks. In addition to sharing a quest for a college degree, the
600 residents are united by the taste of first freedom shared with
people still in their teens. That means an absence of tranquillity,
a swirl of smuggled six-packs, Chinese food ordered at 3 a.m. and
youthful pranks _ especially false fire alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Whether executed by fraternity pledges or bored troublemakers,
students say, alarms were typically tripped by blowing cigarette
smoke into the sensors or by taping a smoldering cigarette beneath
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The false alarms long ago became synonymous with Boland and were
so frequent that students often ignored them. Imperfect evacuations
of the dormitory happened so regularly, in fact, that
administrators argue they were effectively complying with a state
law requiring two fire drills a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the setting at Boland early Wednesday morning _
giddiness over a basketball game, complacency about fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students milling through Boland's halls thinned as
the early morning hours passed. At about 3:30, a resident assistant
spotted three young men she had not seen before hanging around the
pay telephones and cheap couches of the north wing's third-floor
lounge.
</P>
<P>
   She asked them to leave, and it is believed that they obeyed.
Investigators have been trying to identify and interview them ever
since, Green said. ``Whether or not they came back is pure
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, at about 4:30, the shrill call of a fire alarm
rang through Boland once again. And, once again, many students
ignored it, joked about it, rolled over in their beds. On the
fourth floor, Michelle Martorano took her time dressing for the
night's chill, while on the first floor, Vincent Scerbo simply
muted the siren's blare with his pillow.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, whiffs of smoke crept into the rooms, under
the doors and through the vents. The smell nudged Yatin Patel into
opening the door to his room, just a few feet from the third-floor
lounge. He saw the jarring images of ceiling tiles dropping to the
ground, of black smoke filling the hall. He quickly slammed the
door and placed a wet towel along its bottom lip. He and his
roommate then joined the growing screams of others by shouting
their room numbers in the hope of being rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Ms. Merla and her roommates were feeling those
same stabs of desperation. ``We all thought we were going to die,''
she recalled. ``At one point I was so hysterical I tried to jump
and my roommate had to stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Nugent, a resident assistant on Boland's third floor,
followed the smoke to the lounge. There, flames were consuming the
couches and carpet, scorching the floor. He used a cordless
telephone to notify campus security officers that there was indeed
a fire, then quickly began banging on doors. Other students,
crouching below the clouds of smoke, banged on doors as well, until
it was no longer safe to remain.
</P>
<P>
   By now, hundreds of students had streamed out of the building
and onto the lawn and pavement outside. Fire engines were arriving,
their emergency lights flashing off Boland's facade. Bedsheets were
being tied and tossed from the upper stories. With no other option,
Nicholas Donato simply jumped from his third-floor window, breaking
an ankle and an arm _ but surviving.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The shouts of terrified students awakened Mike Williams, a
Newark housing inspector whose split-level home is directly behind
the dormitory. Looking outside, he saw students hanging from their
windows amid plumes of smoke. With the help of several students, he
grabbed a ladder from his back yard and lifted it up to a lower
roof and then raised it to a third-floor window _ providing at
least a dozen students a route to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, horror reigned. Fighting through the smoke to reach a
stairwell, Aliza Graut saw a young man rolling in agony on the
floor, trying to put out the fire on his back. Down the hall from
the lounge now engulfed in flames, Justin Fox traced moans to a
young man whose face and upper body were blackened by burns. He
pulled the victim into a room, where others tried to ease the young
man's pain.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The student lounge remained the fire's tragic center. Aaron
Karol, who wrote love poems that he rarely shared with his
girlfriend, and John Giunta, a volunteer at a Newark school who
planned to become a teacher, collapsed there and died. Karol's
mother later said that she believed her son had made a wrong turn
in the smoky confusion. It must have been his time to go, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dorm room a few feet away, Frank Caltabilota died of smoke
inhalation. His grief-stricken parents later said that he was such
a generous young man that they would not be surprised if they
eventually learned that he had died trying to help others.
</P>
<P>
   The three young men were New Jersey residents, just 18 years
old. Later, after the fire had been doused, two members of the
Roman Catholic hierarchy in Newark _ Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the
university's president, and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick _ came to
Boland's third floor to kneel before the bodies and pray.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While some firefighters from the South Orange Fire Department
fought intense heat to douse the fire in the lounge, others sought
out the frightened and injured. One responded to the shouts of
Patel and his roommate as the space between the smoke and the floor
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed onto his legs, and my roommate held onto my legs,''
Patel said. ``And we crawled out the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The light of morning revealed dozens of students standing in
stunned clusters, some wrapped in blankets, others still in their
pajamas _ many dusted with soot. Firefighters were rolling up their
hoses, priests were offering comfort, reporters were asking painful
questions. Broken windows on Boland's third floor symbolized a
haven violated.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, there would come the need to place blame. There would be
questions about renovations at Boland that did not include
installing sprinklers, and denunciations of students whose habit of
tripping false alarms no longer seemed so amusing.
</P>
<P>
   There would also come the need to understand. For that, Seton
Hall's leaders are recommending that students and parents seek
comfort in Scripture. The funerals will be held Monday. And Tuesday
has been declared a ``University Day of Mourning,'' a time, Sheeran
said, when the community will ``commend to God the lives of John,
Frank and Aaron.''
</P>
<P>
   But prayer will not erase the images and echoes of a cold night
at the dawn of a millennium. ``The worst part were the screams,''
said one student, Diana Savino. ``That's what I can't forget.''

ALSTOTT THROWS WEIGHT AROUND FOR BUCS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mike Alstott is a 262-pound fullback and his best
move is a little sideways shuffle where his feet pitter-patter
along the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Alstott used this do-si-do to score a touchdown in the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers' playoff victory over the Washington Redskins last
Saturday, when he was initially stopped at the point of attack.
</P>
<P>
   But that is it for fakes or jukes from Alstott. The rest of the
time he runs as if he was trying to push a truck across a football
field.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how Alstott trains in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing a car 100 yards is awesome exercise,'' said Alstott,
whose raw rumblings may be the most dependable offense the
Buccaneers have in Sunday's National Football Conference
championship game against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Alstott began this unique conditioning program while in high
school in Joliet, Ill., where he pushed an old family station
wagon. At Purdue University, he graduated to pushing his Jeep
across a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``To move a car or truck, you have to get low and get
leverage,'' he said on Friday. ``It's the same motion as blocking
for a running back or hitting the pileup at the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   Alstott has a knack for hitting the pileup at the goal line _
and finding his way past it; he has scored 25 touchdowns in four
seasons. It certainly does not hurt that he is about 30 pounds
heavier than the average National Football League fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being heavier,'' Alstott said. ``It doesn't interfere
with my running. I've always been big.''
</P>
<P>
   It is his balance and agility that make him more than a
Refrigerator Perry bulling at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't see Mike run every day don't know how
athletic he is,'' Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said. . ``He's hard to
bring down because he hits the hole hard and because he hits it
right. He's not running wildly with his head down. He's a big back
with steady, quick feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Alstott led the Buccaneers in rushing this season with 949 yards
as Dungy used a one-back formation with Alstott, especially in the
second half when defenses were tiring. Other times, Alstott blocked
for running back Warrick Dunn, who is 85 pounds lighter.
</P>
<P>
   As a combination, Dunn and Alstott present defenses with
contrasting running styles and Alstott in particular could
potentially cause problems for the St. Louis defensive line, which
is smaller than most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rams led the National Football League in rushing
defense, although that may be because they were almost always ahead
in games and teams were frequently passing to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we match up better against St. Louis than we did
against Washington,'' Alstott said. ``Washington gave us some
trouble, but we kept plugging away. That's how we play. We figure
we can wear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pounding a 262-pound fullback at a defense is certainly one way
to wear down a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us against the Rams is to not have a lot of
three-and-outs,'' Alstott said. ``We've got to give our defense a
chance to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Alstott does not win any style points for his technique
with the football, he does not mind. He is going to his third
consecutive Pro Bowl and he may be the most popular Buccaneer in
the Tampa Bay area. You can see his No. 40 jersey on fans all over.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname is A-Train.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm a workhorse running back,'' Alstott said. ``I
like when they say that.''
</P>
<P>
   But does a workhorse running back do dance steps at the line of
scrimmage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep my feet moving,'' Alstott said in his defense.
``That's all I'm doing. If my feet are moving, then so am I.'' &QL;

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Both teams spew words like nastiness and
grudge match and pride and spirit, words like rivalry and karma and
destiny in the unfolding of this colorful soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans (15-3) and the Jacksonville Jaguars (15-2)
appear joined at the hip, both members of the American Football
Conference Central and both antsy to grab one another by the neck
and never let loose Sunday at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One team, though, must let go. One will become the AFC champion
and win a trip to Super Bowl XXXIV _ the other will slump backward
in this backyard type of brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The loser _ with no Super Bowl, with no bragging rights _ will
brutally crash.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will cruise on to Atlanta with dream, season and
psyche intact.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are gigantic. So are the egos, the intensity and the
mental games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played them the last time back in December in
Tennessee, there was so much jawing on the field after the game
about us meeting a third time this season,'' said Jaguars receiver
Jimmy Smith. ``I am not surprised it is happening. It is meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two divisional opponents meeting in the AFC championship game
for the first time since 1992, when Buffalo and Miami from the AFC
East clashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Tennessee would beat Buffalo,'' said Jaguars
receiver Keenan McCardell. ``I thought they would beat Indianapolis
because Tennessee was the more physical team. We are not going to
let them do that to us. This is a game where we're going to have to
go hit somebody. We've got to bust somebody in the mouth early and
often.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee has done most of the busting lately. The Titans
have won three straight in the series, including two victories this
season, by 20-19 on Sept. 26 at Jacksonville and by 41-14 on Dec.
26 in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to think we've got an edge on them in the mind
games,'' Tennessee running back Eddie George said. ``We've had some
great battles in the past few years. It's starting to build into a
great rivalry. This is another story going into the soap opera, so
to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The franchises have met 10 times. Each team has won five games.
Each team owns a 4-1 record in the other's stadium. Jacksonville is
an expansion team in its fifth season, and its first home game in
1995 was against the Tennessee franchise, then the Houston Oilers.
Jacksonville lost. The rivalry was born.
</P>
<P>
   And this season it escalated to tense, gripping heights because
both teams featured talented players, both were fighting for the
same division crown and now both scrap for a Super Bowl berth.
Familiarity bred more competitiveness as well as some contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an awful lot of mutual respect,'' said
Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin. ``There are some flashes of
arrogance, there always is, and some talk. There's no question
about that. Because we are familiar with each other, there is some
nastiness about the way in which each team plays one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that sets the tone physically, and we're going
to have to answer that bell if we're going to beat them. There is
an intense rivalry here. It's interesting with all the talk about
scheduling that the two representatives in the AFC championship
game are out of the AFC Central.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher, the Tennessee coach, said he believes the rivalry
has grown, in part, because of the proximity of Nashville and
Jacksonville. The cities are close enough, Fisher said, for the
rivalry to also fester among both teams' fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two teams have kind of grown up together,'' said Fisher,
whose National Football League head coaching debut was the victory
that spoiled Jacksonville's first home game in 1995. ``It's great
to see. We've had respect for the Jaguars since the get-go because
of the way they're prepared and as quickly as they won.
</P>
<P>
   `'Rivalries are all about two good teams playing against each
other and playing a game where anything can happen. Playing games
that mean something. We obviously know what this one means.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks are similar but different.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brunell threw 14 touchdown passes for Jacksonville and
Steve McNair threw 12 for Tennessee. Both missed games this season
because of injury. Both are mobile passers and effective
scramblers. Both throw the deep ball, but Brunell has thrown it
more accurately in his career. Both Smith and McCardell have shown
they are deep threats who can turn a game and as a duo are more
accomplished than the Tennessee starters Yancey Thigpen and Kevin
Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   The running backs are similar but different.
</P>
<P>
   George rushed for 1,304 yards this season and averaged 4.1 yards
a carry. He is a big back who likes to punish inside but has speed
to burn outside, too. Fred Taylor of Jacksonville averaged 4.6
yards a carry and is more of a big-play hitter in the running game.
</P>
<P>
   The safeties Blaine Bishop and Marcus Robertson and the rookie
end Jevon Kearse are the key players in the Tennessee defense.
Kearse produced an amazing 14.5 sacks to lead the AFC and was a
terror all over the field with his special size, speed and
persistence. It is a quick, menacing Titans defense that knocks
ball carriers silly. Tennessee led the league in fumble recoveries
with 24.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's defense gained new direction when Dom Capers
entered as its defensive coordinator. Capers asked his defense to
attack more, take more chances, hit harder and hit relentlessly.
With its new safety Carnell Lake, end Tony Brackens and linebacker
Kevin Hardy as eventual Pro Bowlers, Jacksonville responded by
allowing a league-low 13.6 points a game and tied St. Louis for the
most sacks this season with 57.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams enter with sparkling special teams, especially in the
return games, where Jacksonville's Reggie Barlow (20.8-yard kickoff
return average) and Tennessee's Derrick Mason (19.6-yard kickoff
return average) rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee wants another taste of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville desperately wants to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play Tennessee again, and that was not a cocky
statement,'' Brunell said. ``They beat us a couple of times. It's
really as simple as that. It's not an in-your-face comment. We
wanted another shot at the team that beat us pretty bad and also
beat us here at home. It'd be a way to complete our season if we
can beat them and answer a question as to who's the better team,
and this weekend will be the case. They will be at their best and
we will be at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen, however, said: ``They really don't want to see us
again. No, they really don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the stage.
</P>
<P>
   And, Taylor said, ``That's football.''

   LONDON _ A controversial historical writer is expected to be
assailed in court Monday over his assertion that it is a ``big
lie'' that Jews were slaughtered in gas chambers at Auschwitz
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving dismisses the gas chambers seen by visitors to the
infamous camp in Poland as fakes that were built after the end of
World War II by the Polish government.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who believes the Nazi campaign to exterminate Jews has
been greatly exaggerated, is suing Emory University professor
Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for libel over
assertions made about him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt portrayed Irving as a prominent and dangerous
``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took place. She
also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and
falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, lead defense attorney Richard Rampton is expected to
challenge of Irving on the writer's statements about Auschwitz,
arguably the most notorious of the so-called Nazi death camps.
Rampton intends to call expert witnesses to validate the accepted
account of the mass killings at Auschwitz _ including at least 1
million deaths in gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which opened nearly two weeks ago, has been divided
into two segments _ the first focusing on Irving's views of the
Holocaust and Adolf Hitler's role in the mass killings. Irving has
maintained that Hitler didn't know about the campaign to
exterminate Jews until 1943, at least two years after the massacres
began.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said he doesn't deny the Holocaust but says it has been
exaggerated. He challenges the number and manner of Jewish deaths
in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   But Irving already has been forced to concede on major points.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old author of about 30 historical books has been
forced to admit in court that he based part of his claim about
Hitler's attempts to stop the mass murders on a misreading of a
1941 handwritten note from Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler. Irving
also has acknowledged that he was wrong in asserting that the Nazis
never employed exhaust fumes from trucks to kill Jews on a large
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Irving accepted documents presented by the
defense that showed that he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, Irving denies that these mistakes prove that he
distorted or manipulated historical facts to suit his purposes. He
maintains that he believed his positions when he espoused them and
was unaware of evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt and Penguin Books deny they libeled Irving, and under
British law are required to prove that the book portrayed him
truthfully. Irving, who is not a lawyer, is representing himself in
the trial, which is expected to last three months.

   WASHINGTON _ This week, the U.S. Congress is expected to
consider a private bill waiving requirements for citizenship, or
granting permanent residency to 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration and
citizenship federal issues and Congress, in 1891, established a
federal agency to deal with them. But, citizenship has become as
much a legislative as bureaucratic issue. According to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, between 1992 to 1997,
Congress granted citizenship to almost 30 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As for the process, little is written in stone. The Congress can
bypass many of the usual steps for passing a bill, and a senator
can filibuster ad nauseam to stop it. The usual steps are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The private bill for citizenship is introduced in both the
House and in the Senate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It is then sent to committees and subcommittees in both
chambers;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The committees review the bills, make changes and send it back
to the floors for debate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the bills in both chambers are passed, then it goes to a
conference committee of representatives and senators to make final
changes and again must be approved by Congress;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If approved it is then sent to the president for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The most common waivers set aside the oath of office
requirements for children or immigrants with disabilities, or
exempt residency requirements.

 &HT;    FIGHT FOR ELIAN'S FUTURE MOVES TO NEW ARENA _ CONGRESS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
has been debated in houses across the country. Now the debate moves
into the halls of Congress as lawmakers Monday are expected to
offer up legislation to make him an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move _ which has the support of the boy's Miami relatives
who want him to remain here _ would shift the issue from an
immigration question to be handled by the bureaucracy to a custody
battle to be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he supports the decision of
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner
that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba, and has
indicated opposition to a citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal, also expected to be offered Monday, would
grant the boy permanent residency status without making him a
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of the bills were still being finalized last week,
but _ in the case of the citizenship bills _ are expected to
include waiving certain requirements such as understanding English
and taking the oath of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The first action will come Monday in the House of
Representatives. Florida Congressmen Bill McCollum, Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and House Republican Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, will introduce a bill granting Elian citizenship.
Meanwhile, Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with support from Rep. Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., will offer the bill granting Elian permanent
residency status.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, a citizenship bill is expected to be introduced
soon by Republican Sen. Connie Mack of Florida with support from a
bipartisan group of senators including Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi and North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, one of
the Senate's leading opponents of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   This week's actions will be largely ceremonial and behind the
scenes. Congress likely won't get down to business until next week,
after President Clinton's State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after the bills are introduced is unscripted.
Normally, bills are next referred to a committee. But with strong
support from House and Senate leaders, the bill could be taken up
quickly on the floor of either chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely scenario is that it will be sent to one or more
committees for quick action. In the House, Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has promised to expedite the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders will decide early this week where the bill will
be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the citizenship and permanent residency
status bills is a matter of degree. Granting citizenship would give
Elian the right to return to the United States as a full citizen
even if he is taken back to Cuba; permanent residency rights would
expire within six months if he is taken back to the communist
island.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Krauders, a spokesman for New Jersey's Menendez, said the
permanent residency bill would avoid ticklish questions of dual
citizenship and the issue of Congress granting citizenship to a
person who had not applied for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Krauders said the objective of both bills is the same: take
the issue out of the INS' hands and into the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Mack agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have the same objective, to try to get this to be a
custody hearing _ where what is in the boy's best interest is the
main concern _ as opposed to immigration law and INS'
interpretation of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart spokeswoman Yanik Fenton said the citizenship bill's
supporters are girding for a difficult battle led by New York Reps.
Charles Rangel and Jose Serrano, both Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides portray their actions as being in Elian's best
interest and the other side's actions as being political. Rangel
and Serrano have said the boy belongs with his father, and have
defended the INS decision to allow him to be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of congressional action action say it is the
Clinton administration that has acted politically by bowing to
pressure from Castro to return the boy through a bureaucratic,
rather than a judicial, process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My proposal doesn't determine the outcome, it says a fair
process ought to be followed,'' Mack said. ``I reacted when I saw
what the administration did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has not signed on to Mack's bill, but
he also has urged a congressional review of the INS's actions and
has indicated that the final decision should be made by a family
court.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's McCollum, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
said he is acting to support the wishes of Elian's mother _ who
died along with 10 other rafters after their boat capsized trying
to reach South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's mother gave her life to bring her son to a free
country, and that cannot be ignored,'' he said. ``Since the proper
legal process has not been allowed to run its full course, this
bill is an added layer of protection to ensure that process is
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American and vocal critic of Castro's
Cuba, called the bill ``a hopeful step towards having Elian's day
in court, which is what the family has long desired.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional action comes against a backdrop of legal and
political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Since being plucked from the waters off South Florida on
Thanksgiving Day, Elian Gonzalez has become the ultimate
international political football.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has organized massive demonstrations in Cuba, mobilizing
his people into demanding that the boy be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner ruled that only the boy's father has the right to
request asylum on his behalf. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has
repeatedly expressed support for Meissner's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy's Miami relatives, led by his great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, with the backing of much of Miami's vocal
Cuban-American population have vowed to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives filed suit in state court seeking custody
over the child. A hearing on that suit is set for March 6 before
Miami-Dade County Family Court Judge Rosa Rodriquez, although Reno
quickly blocked that move by saying the family court judge had no
jurisdiction in the matter, since immigration issues are solely a
federal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Miami relatives also went into federal court
claiming INS had violated Elian Gonzalez's constitutional rights by
refusing to consider the family's claim for political asylum on his
behalf. The Justice Department has indicated it will oppose the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena for Elian
Gonzalez to appear before his Government Reform and Oversight
Committee on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the court and congressional actions, INS backed
away from its original Jan. 14 return date, but has maintained that
it still has the right to return him to his father.

   LIMA, Peru _ After 18 hours of chaos that began when a coalition
of dissident military officers and Indian groups overthrew the
elected president of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad, and proclaimed the
formation of a ``Junta of National Salvation,'' that country's vice
president assumed power early Saturday when a rival military
faction intervened on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Noboa Bejarano took office after Gen. Carlos Mendoza,
the Ecuadorean armed forces chief of staff and acting minister of
defense, abruptly announced that he was dissolving the three-man
junta he briefly led in Latin America's first military overthrow of
a sitting civilian president in more than a decade. Mendoza said he
was acting to ``prevent the international isolation of Ecuador,'' a
reference to demands by the United States and Latin American
countries that constitutional rule be preserved in a country
undergoing severe economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the laws laid out in the constitution, I find myself
under the obligation to assume the presidency of Ecuador,'' Noboa,
who becomes the Andean country's sixth chief of state in four
years, said Saturday morning at a news conference in Quito, the
capital. ``I have the support of the armed forces and the national
police.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Presidential Palace under military escort on
Friday afternoon, Mahuad, a 50-year-old former mayor of Quito,
resurfaced Saturday morning on television to condemn the coup but
acknowledge Noboa's authority. ``A thrown-out president does not
resign. He is thrown out,'' Mahuad said. ``I will never be an
obstacle for the vice president to assume the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant television speech on Friday, Mahuad had refused to
resign, challenging the military by saying it would have to
``remove me by force,'' a show of bravado undermined by his total
lack of political support.
</P>
<P>
   The military coup was immediately condemned by the Clinton
administration and the Organization of American States, both of
which threatened sanctions against any military-led government.
Peter Romero, the State Department's top official for Latin
America, warned the coup leaders on Quito radio Friday that they
faced ``political and economic isolation'' akin to Cuba if they
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Romero, a former ambassador to Ecuador, described
the situation as ``chaos.'' He said Noboa was a little-known
businessman who would be under enormous pressure ``not to do
anything'' to fix the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The insurrection against Mahuad originated in Ecuador's worst
economic crisis in more than 70 years. The Andean country's economy
contracted by 7.5 percent last year, the worst performance in Latin
America. Inflation was more than 60 percent for the second
consecutive year, and the country defaulted on half of its $13
billion in foreign debt in September.
</P>
<P>
   Indians, who make up more than one-third of Ecuador's 12.5
million people and are largely peasant farmers, have been hit
particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Vargas, leader of the country's most powerful Indian
group, had lobbied the government for $42 million in debt
forgiveness and new loans, but was turned down. He quickly turned
into one of Mahuad's most ferocious critics, accusing him of
inflicting ``massive impoverishment'' on Ecuadoreans.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to secure financing abroad, Mahuad responded to the
recession with an austerity program that further eroded his
popularity and included two especially controversial measures: He
froze the life savings of thousands of Ecuadoreans during a banking
crisis last March and, in a radical and desperate move on Jan. 9,
declared his intent to replace the nation's currency with the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on Ecuadorean radio Saturday morning,
Noboa said that he intended to continue with the dollarization
program. But he criticized other aspects of Mahuad's rule and vowed
to take quick action against what he described as rampant
corruption, a central opposition demand.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Mahuad government began Friday morning when
Indian protesters marched on the national Congress in Quito. A
military unit assigned to guard the legislative building stepped
aside instead, allowing Vargas and his supporters to enter, seize
control of offices there and proclaim the overthrow of Mahuad and
the dissolution of Congress and the Supreme Court, and their
replacement by a ``people's parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of more than 50 junior military officers led by Col.
Lucio Gutierrez immediately joined the Indian group, and other
officials began arriving and adhering to the uprising, among them
Col. Fausto Cobo, commander of Ecuador's military academy. With
television cameras broadcasting the takeover, Vargas announced the
formation of a new governing junta composed of himself, Gutierrez
and Carlos Solorzano, a former Supreme Court chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   The military high command had initially expressed lukewarm
support for Mahuad. But as more and more colonels, majors and
captains in charge of provincial military units rose in rebellion,
the generals were forced to reverse course, and by midafternoon
they had issued a new statement urging the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with an Ecuadorean television reporter, an
unidentified military officer who had joined the insurrection
complained that since Mahuad took office in August 1998, the value
of the officer's salary had declined from $1,100 a month to less
than $300. Gutierrez, for his part, vowed to replace ``this
ignominious model of government'' with one that would attack
``corruption and impunity'' by the bankers Mahuad was seen as
protecting.
</P>
<P>
   After Mahuad left his offices, the junta announced plans to
march on and seize the Presidential Palace a few blocks away. But
the military high command acted before it could get there, with
Mendoza and the army commander, Gen. Telmo Sandoval, sending troops
to take control of the building and deploying tanks in the square
in front of it to block the protesters' advance.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he had acted in order to ``avoid a social
explosion.'' Just before midnight, following several hours of
negotiations with Vargas and Gutierrez and their supporters, he
emerged to announce that the country would be governed by a
``triumvirate'' in which he would replace Gutierrez but Vargas and
Solorzano would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, however, he had moved to undercut his two partners
in the junta, who said they remained opposed to Noboa taking power
and called for the arrest of Mahuad. Salvador Quishpe, an aide to
Vargas, argued that Ecuador needs to ``undergo a process of
purification,'' condemned Noboa as ``one of the politicians
responsible for this debacle,'' and said his group planned to
continue its protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to negotiate a peaceful solution to the situation by
agreeing to become a member of the junta,'' Mendoza said Saturday.
``I ask my companions in the armed forces to re-establish the
juridical order through a presidential succession.''

ABORTION BAN IN NEBRASKA FACES SUPREME COURT TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ A doctor who performs abortions here has been
picketed while attending church on Sunday. Roman Catholics who work
for Planned Parenthood have been threatened with excommunication.
And the University of Nebraska Medical Center has been the target
of angry protests over research on fetal tissue in the study of
Alzheimer's and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups in Nebraska work with a passion that their
critics say verges on intimidation. But in this conservative,
church-oriented state, there has been little political risk for
those who denounce abortion with vehemence, such as the state
attorney general, Don Stenberg, who condemned certain types of
abortion as ``infanticide.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to examine a Nebraska law
that bans a late-term procedure its opponents call partial-birth
abortion. While similar laws in other states have been winding
their way through the courts, it was the Nebraska law that reached
the Supreme Court, in part, because state officials here have
aggressively sought the legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grasz, the state deputy attorney general, said Nebraska
was the first state to petition for a Supreme Court review of the
federal appellate ruling in 1998 that found the law to be so broad
as to be unconstitutional. ``I don't think any civilized society
would allow such a barbaric procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 states have enacted similar bans. These laws have
generally been struck down in federal courts as unconstitutional,
although a federal appeals court in Chicago upheld such bans in
Illinois and Wisconsin. The disparity in the federal rulings will
be addressed by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion in Nebraska hailed the Supreme Court's
announcement earlier this month that it would review the law.
Supporters of abortion rights have criticized the Nebraska law as
being so broad that it would outlaw virtually all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Funk, the executive director of Planned Parenthood in
Lincoln, said a law banning the late-term abortion procedure would
``scare doctors out of the profession'' by threatening criminal
action.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that abortion opponents have made political gains
on this issue. ``They've coined a phrase that captured people's
emotions,'' Ms. Funk said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion say the late-term abortion issue has been
a turning point in their movement.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Schmit-Albin, the executive director of Nebraska Right to
Life, said many people who favored keeping abortion legal have been
disconcerted by descriptions of the late-term procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the public is saying, `Wait a minute, this seems to
go far beyond Roe vs. Wade,''' she said, referring to the 1973
Supreme Court decision that protected a woman's right to abortion.
``We've felt like we were under siege. But now we have something to
look forward to. This issue has slapped a lot of people in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law was challenged by Dr. Leroy Carhart, an Omaha
physician who testified that he performed the banned procedure. He
said it was used in some cases because it was the most prudent way
to protect the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   While the law would make any doctor who performs such abortions
guilty of a felony, it specifically excludes the pregnant woman
from any criminal liability.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law say this exemption amounts to a tacit
acknowledgment that the public, contrary to the claims of abortion
opponents, does not view abortion as murder.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Heller, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, who is representing Carhart in the case, said the exemption
was a hypocritical stance.
</P>
<P>
   He said late-term abortions are comparatively rare, with some 90
percent of the operations occurring in the first 12 to 13 weeks of
pregnancy. Late-term abortions often involve a severe fetal
deformity, he said, or involve a girl of only 13 or 14, who may not
have realized she was pregnant for months.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the issue in Nebraska clearly favor those who
oppose abortion. Of the state's five-member Congressional
delegation, only Sen. Bob Kerrey has supported abortion rights, and
he has announced that he will not run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The measure banning the late-term abortion procedure
overwhelmingly passed the State Legislature and was signed by
former Gov. Ben Nelson, who is considering running for Kerrey's
Senate seat.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Seven presidential contenders scattered
across the flatlands of Iowa on Saturday in a chase for the unsure
and the uncommitted before voters finally have their say in this
state's precinct caucuses on Monday, the first crucial test of the
2000 primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will wound some candidates, embolden others and set
the expectations for the nation's first primary, in New Hampshire,
just eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Since polls have consistently found that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Vice President Al Gore are widely favored in their
parties' voting here, the question among political strategists has
been how much support they can attract. Despite the confidence of
prognosticators, however, polls in this state are notoriously
unreliable because it is difficult to identify caucus-goers. The
judgment day that counts, of course, is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since 1988 that both parties have had
spirited contests here. Buoyed by the support of unions and the
state's top elected Democrats, Gore is trying to pile up a sizable
lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has made Iowa
a priority and pumped more than $2 million in resources here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also has waged an aggressive drive, is trying to beat
back an unflagging challenge from Steve Forbes, the wealthy
publisher who has built a vast organization in Iowa. Bush's
supporters also hope that an impressive showing on Monday will help
him halt any surge in New Hampshire for Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. McCain skipped Iowa and is concentrating on New Hampshire,
where he leads Bush in some surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates are battling Bush and Forbes, largely for
the loyalty of religious conservatives: Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official; Gary Bauer, who headed a conservative
organization, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The die is cast,'' said Steffen Schmidt, a professor of
political science at Iowa State University, who noted that poll
after poll had found Gore and Bush comfortably ahead. ``And I think
that any dramatic reversal of the way things are would be
astonishing. The place has been polled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of polls and punditry, the caucuses represent a
transfer of power to ordinary citizens who will make their way to
meetings at places like schools, churches, homes and American
Legion posts in each of the state's 2,131 precincts. Yet for all
the national attention the caucuses draw, only about 200,000 of
Iowa's 1.8 million registered voters are expected to forsake their
Monday night in the name of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While critics argue that Iowans have too much clout, there is no
disputing that many voters here have scrutinized the candidates up
close, because the White House hopefuls have stumped here
tirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fake a few meetings in a giant state where you have a
TelePrompTer,'' said Kayne Robinson, chairman of the Iowa
Republican Party. ``But you can't just fake it here.'' Comparing
the process to inspecting chickens, he added, ``We take their
feathers off.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of taking part in caucuses is far more elaborate
than merely voting in an ordinary primary. The Republicans simply
cast ballots. But the Democrats endure a complicated, often
tedious, procedure in which groups of supporters openly discuss
whom to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to all the caucuses and always have,'' said Gary
Prochaska, 60, a landscape designer from Ames who backs Gore. ``The
caucus is the first choice we have for deciding who runs for
government office. And it is important to me that I am part of that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Faisal, 57, a youth counselor in Des Moines, said she
probably would not decide between Bradley and Gore until she got to
the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the caucus might help me make my decision,
listening to different people talk about the candidates,'' she said
when she came to hear what the vice president had to say at a rally
in Ames on Friday night. ``I really like Bill Bradley, but I don't
know if he can win. The thing that pulls me to his side is that he
is a big thinker.'' But, she added, ``Al Gore is a very intelligent
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Charlson, 25, a graduate student studying genetics at Iowa
State University, said he was vacillating between Forbes and Bush.
``I'll be listening to the remarks this weekend to decide,'' he
said. ``But I will go to the caucus even if I haven't decided
positively on a candidate. It is part of the process _ and part of
the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be ``listening to the candidates this weekend,
right up to the last minute. I mean, on the Republican side we have
six candidates, which is interesting because you hear so many
different sides of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the closing days the Republican contenders have
clashed mostly over who has the strongest stand against abortion.
And the Democrats have tussled over who put forth the best
health-care and education plans _ and would do the most to help
family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Rob Tully, the state party chairman,
said Gore was far better positioned than Bradley. But he left open
the possibility that Bradley would successfully woo new voters who
had not taken part in the caucuses before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president comes out of here with 60 percent and
Bradley comes out with 32 percent, that's a huge win for the vice
president,'' Tully said. ``And I think it may well take Bradley out
of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Tully's Republican counterpart, Robinson, was far more reluctant
to handicap his party's field. But he said he did not expect any
deviation from the basic lineup in the polls of a victory for Bush,
followed by Forbes, with the others well behind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a smidgen of drama left, Robinson could
not keep a straight face when he said, ``The suspense is who's
going to win, of course.'' He added: ``I have to say that; I'm the
chairman. But the only thing that's left is to play a spin game of
how much somebody wins by.''

</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the excitement here was in August, when the
state party staged a straw poll that attracted 25,000 Iowans. The
results were nonbinding, and the competition was largely over which
candidate could transport the most supporters to the event with
enticements of sumptuous food and entertainment. Former Vice
President Dan Quayle and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee,
who had stumped in this state for years, were spurred by their
lackluster showings to withdraw from the race.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the straw poll replaced the actual caucuses in
weeding out the field. Bush placed first in the event, followed by
Forbes and by Elizabeth Dole, who has since quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a cliffhanger may explain why the Heartland Poll,
made public on Friday by the University of Iowa, found that the
number of potential caucus participants was declining rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   A report examining the survey suggested that many Iowans thought
the outcome was ``a foregone conclusion.'' The report went on: ``In
the absence of any burning issues, a significant number of Iowans
will apparently find some other activities more personally
demanding or relevant than the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Iowa is largely one of expectations, so all the
contenders are trying to low-ball their potential. But since Bush
and Gore are the favorites, anything short of decisive victories
for either could make them appear vulnerable as the campaign moves
to a fast-paced calendar of contests. The nominees could emerge by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to tamp down expectations in the final hours of battle,
Bush insisted that he would be delighted if he matched the 37
percent that Bob Dole drew here in a six-candidate field in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that I thought 37 percent would be a pretty good
total,'' Bush said. ``After all, that's the highest that any
person's gotten in the caucuses in a crowded field _ and I hope I
can do that. Sometimes victory may not mean victory. I hope it
means it in my case.'' With a touch of concern, the governor added:
``I'm worried about getting the vote out. The biggest threat is the
people of Iowa not going to the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on Monday, a triumph in Iowa is not
necessarily the first stop on the road to the White House. Bob Dole
was victorious here in 1996, followed by Pat Buchanan and Lamar
Alexander. Buchanan went on to beat Dole in New Hampshire, but Dole
won the nomination and lost the race to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the last time there was a contested Democratic race
here, Dick Gephardt won, followed by Paul Simon and Michael
Dukakis. Dukakis won the nomination but lost the general election.
</P>
<P>
   As campaigns toiled around the clock this weekend to prod their
supporters to the polls, several organizers cited one factor over
which they had no control: the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it snows that night?'' asked Steve Hildebrand, who
runs the Gore campaign in Iowa. ``Our greatest strength is from
seniors _ and it would dramatically hurt our percentage. Seniors
are not going to go out when it snows. They're worried that they'll
slip on the ice and break their hips.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who is stumping here for
Bradley, would not mind a blizzard: ``Maybe if there was an all-out
snowstorm he might even win, because his supporters really do
believe in him.''

U.S. OFFICIAL DIMS HIS VIEW OF RUSSIA'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's top policymaker on
Russia, in his annual assessment of where that country is headed,
has presented a more wary review this time, even hinting at the
possible return of some Soviet habits.
</P>
<P>
   The policy official, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
said in a speech at Oxford University in England on Friday that the
war in Chechnya and the transfer of power to Acting President
Vladimir Putin raised the question of how the resurgence of Russian
nationalism would assert itself.
</P>
<P>
   One consistent theme of Putin's, among many inconsistencies,
Talbott said, is his desire ``to see Russia regain its strength,
its sense of national pride and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In and of itself, that goal is not only understandable, it's
achievement is indispensable,'' Talbott said. ``It all depends on
how Russia defines strength, how it defines security. Will it do so
in today's terms, or yesterday's _ in terms that are proving
successful elsewhere or in terms that have already proved
disastrous for Russia under Soviet rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott then raised another issue: ``Will Russia recognize that
in an age of global _ and regional _ interdependence, the
porousness of borders is a necessity out of which a viable state
must make a virtue? Or will it fall back into the habit of treating
this and other facts of life as a vulnerability to be neutralized
or _ that most Soviet of all verbs _ to be liquidated.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pondered, but did not give a conclusion, about whether
Russia would understand that in Chechnya ``indiscriminate aerial
attacks, forced movement of populations and civilian roundups'' are
the work of a ``weak and desperate state, not a strong and
clearheaded one.'`
</P>
<P>
   The speech was more skeptical than an address the deputy
secretary gave at Stanford University in 1997. Then, he said that
Russia ``may have turned the tide _ it may be on the brink of a
breakthrough.'' It was also more downbeat than a second speech he
gave at Stanford in 1998, titled ``The Case for Strategic Patience
in a Time of Troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Talbott, who has been criticized in some quarters as a
Russophile, chose a sterner tone than in the past, his speech was
far less critical of Moscow than an essay in the current issue of
The New York Review of Books by Sergei Kovalev, a Russian human
rights campaigner who is a member of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev predicted that Putin would build ``an
authoritarian-police regime that will preserve the formal
characteristics of democracy, and will most likely try to carry out
reforms leading to a market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life will not be sweet for Russia's fledgling civil society,''
he wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Talbott only elliptically dealt with Putin's embrace of the
Communists in the parliament last week, which resulted in a walkout
of pro-democratic factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can speculate together _ and that's all we can do at this
point _ on exactly what he's up to in his recent parliamentary
maneuvers,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Russia's war against rebels in Chechnya, Talbott said
the military campaign is a ``gruesome reminder of how hard it is
for Russia to break free of its own past.'' He blamed the reformist
government in Moscow in 1992 and 1993 and the governments after the
1994-96 Chechen war for leaving Chechnya to its own devices, thus
fueling the appetite for total independence in the republic.

COMMENTARY: HAUTE HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not easy to be irreverent in a culture without reverence.
</P>
<P>
   But some will always try.
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano unveiled his spring-summer haute couture
collection in Paris last week for the House of Dior. We've had
every other kind of tasteless chic, from heroin chic to Hasidic
chic to Kosovo chic. A radical chic 100-page Bennetton ad in Talk
magazine features cozy chats with 26 death-row inmates on topics
ranging from prison movies to Monica Lewinsky. So why not homeless
chic?
</P>
<P>
   Dior models who starve themselves posed as the starving. They
came down the runway raggedy and baggy, some swathed in newspapers,
with torn linings and inside-out labels, accessorized with empty
little green J&AMP;B whiskey bottles, tin cups dangling from the
derriere, bottle caps, plastic clothespins and safety pins. Some
posed as lunatic ballerinas in frayed tulle, others in
straitjackets and white madhouse makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion designer said he was inspired by the French homeless
as well as the mentally ill in Diane Arbus photos. He said his
collection evoked the Rag Balls of the 1930s, when French
socialites had Worth make their tattered duds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's hard to imagine a couture client shelling out
$25,000 for a dress just so she can look like a bum,'' noted Cathy
Horyn, a New York Times fashion writer.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics, the ones who assume that narcissistic designers
are disconnected from everything but Planet Fashion, applauded the
ingenuity. They called it one more bit of deconstruction, like the
Calvin Klein jeans treated to look dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics, and French homeless advocates, were appalled. Le
Monde sneered about begging for a penny, ma'am, in the tin cup of
Dior. As when Marie Antoinette dressed up like a shepherdess, there
was a glint of the guillotine. Our giddy gilded age is stretching
the chasm _ and perhaps also the tensions _ between the haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   So which is worse? A Paris fashion designer who wants to look at
the homeless as aesthetic objects, or a New York mayor who does not
want to look at them at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no puritan; I have on a cashmere sweater now,'' said Mary
Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
``But the fact that this is a matter of life and death seems lost
on Galliano and his Eurotrash following, and on Giuliani. Maybe the
mayor should have one of those little straitjackets.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's predawn sweep of shelters and arrest of at least 125
homeless New Yorkers with minor, outstanding arrest warrants seemed
like an icy move in this icy town.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani explained his actions: ``You have to pay
attention to people urinating on the street, and you have to get
people to stop urinating on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Galliano says he sees the homeless in a more romantic light and
is unapologetic about the petit scandale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most spoken-about topic at dinner parties in Paris,''
said the 40-year-old Brit proudly. ``One can't go into a restaurant
without hearing fantastic young ladies talking about the fraying of
tulle of the Christian Dior show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics have a slightly bigoted view. One is allowed to
have women mincing about in high heels and combat trousers and a
scarf around their head, inspired by the war in Bosnia. One is
allowed to be inspired by India, even though there is enormous
poverty there. One is allowed to be inspired by Africa, even though
the Masai tribe is a disappearing race. One is allowed to have
bohemian chic inspired by Gypsies even though we all know now where
Gypsies are coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get why, just because this is on their own doorstep,
it's any different. Because they don't want to know about these
people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are brought up to watch `Lady and the Tramp' and
Charlie Chaplin and `The Little Rascals.' I didn't set out to make
a political statement. I am a dressmaker. But jogging around the
Seine has thrown Paris into a whole different light for me. I call
it the Wet World. There are shades of Tennessee Williams and Marlon
Brando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are like impresarios, their coats worn
over their shoulders and their hats worn at a certain angle. It's
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fantastic, with subzero temperatures along the East
Coast, for those lining their own authentically threadbare clothing
with real newspaper. Cold never feels chic.

<P>
   ``The river catching fire brought national attention and
ridicule to Cleveland, but it also proved to be the instrumental
rallying point in the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972,''
said Steven R. Davis, the Cuyahoga's newly appointed navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a watershed expert with the U.S. Forest Service, is a
pioneer along the first 14 troubled waterways to be covered under
the new American Heritage Rivers program. As navigator, he has the
unusual job of reversing the federal stereotype of big, intrusive
bureaucracy by diplomatically roaming and working for 80
communities and more than 100 city and township jurisdictions as a
riverfront trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's exciting about this. I'm a lone federal employee
working at the grass-roots level to help the Cuyahoga,'' Davis
said. He serves as part liaison, part catalyst for local civic,
government and business leaders in northeast Ohio in their dealings
with a score of federal agencies that have the wherewithal to help
rebuild the economic and cultural life of the river.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a large-scale aquatic version of the
traditional extension agent in agricultural regions: a specialist
helping localities move from blight to bounty. On a good day, he
hopes to prove a bit of a spark in river projects involving the
private sector and the government _ a poetic enough notion
considering that local lore says it was a spark from a welder's
torch, or maybe from a passing train, that set the Cuyahoga to
burning.
</P>
<P>
   After only a few months on the job, Davis, a mustached
47-year-old whose style is far more amiably rustic than
bureaucratic, already has a raft of tasks from his assorted
governmental and environmental constituents. They range from the
minuscule (how to clear the debris under the abandoned railroad
trestle in Kent that blocks river passage) to the daunting (how to
help Cleveland and Akron find the right plans and financing to
solve serious sewage overflows during rainstorms that feed the
river's violation of federal pollution standards).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all here because of the river, the lifeblood for the
first settlers of Cleveland and Akron,'' Davis said. He has been
studying each twist and turn of the 100-mile river and measuring
the considerable recovery efforts of the five regional ``river
partners'' sponsoring the program _ government and civic
associations that have been dedicated for years to the Cuyahoga's
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turned their back on the river as soon as the railroads
came in in the 1850s,'' he noted, while taking inventory of
waterfront trash heaps and finding reclamation handsomely under way
in some areas. Notably, there is Cleveland's Flats neighborhood,
now stylishly resurgent but once the slum area where flames first
burst incongruously upon the Cuyahoga.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuyahoga _ it got its name from an American Indian term for
crooked river because of the unusual U shape that causes it to flow
both north and south _ was a teeming conduit after the
Revolutionary War, as Western settlers journeyed from Lake Erie
down the Ohio River. In modern times the river has reeled from
industrial pollution, sporting deformed fish and prompting warnings
against swimming the oil-slicked waters.
</P>
<P>
   In three decades, the river's local and regional defenders have
fought back. Fish are returning, but the warnings against eating
them remain. And there are still bans on swimming and boating in
the area's 33,000-acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   The river's 813-square-mile watershed now supports 15 percent of
Ohio's population. It is the focus of scores of local recovery and
protection programs, extending from pristine wilderness to
sprawling suburbs, that Davis is charged with coordinating.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heritage Rivers program was created two years ago
by the White House to provide a localized federal boost to historic
rivers fighting for recovery. The other rivers in the program are
the Blackstone-Woonasquatucket and the Connecticut in New England,
the Detroit, the Hanalei in Hawaii, the Hudson, the Mississippi
(which has both an upper and a lower navigator), the New River in
Appalachia, the Potomac, the Rio Grande, the St. Johns in Florida,
the Upper Susquehanna-Lackawanna Watershed in Pennsylvania and the
Willamette in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has an office in a 19th-century general store in the
Cuyahoga national park, has worked for the Forest Service for 25
years. He served as the agency's specialist in dealing with the
river problems of dozens of communities in California, Colorado and
Wyoming. He also learned invaluable politicking as the service's
congressional liaison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a federal employee working for the local governments and
associated organizations trying to improve their communities,'' the
navigator said, rather happily. He has no special financing beyond
his own $60,000 annual paycheck. His task is to see what localities
want and to broker plans and financing with private and government
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million things we need to do,'' said Davis, who is
planning a canoe trip on the Cuyahoga to further erase the image of
the burning river. ``The program is new, so there's no real
direction. But the blessing is, we can invent it as we go and work
with local people to do it.''

COMMENTARY: THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Swiss ski resort of Davos, once the home of a
sanitarium, will play host once again to the annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum _ a unique gathering of the world's business
and political elite. I last attended five years ago, even though
the forum has officially declared me a GLT (that's Global Leader of
Tomorrow _ hold the mayo), which I think means that I have a
standing invitation. But I'm sure that my first impression will be
similar. After all, the sight of all those wealthy and important
people in the same place, with scores of famous intellectuals in
attendance, surely inspires the same thought in even the most
cynical of observers: Come the revolution, we shoot these people
first.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not really. But the scene at Davos _ the superrich and their
trophy wives schmoozing with officials elected and appointed, the
lavish parties thrown by Third World nations, and so on _
represents a sort of distilled essence of everything that people
love to hate about the New World Order. Those on both left and
right who view globalization as a sort of conspiracy by rootless
cosmopolitans against the rest of us could hardly have asked for a
better spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I am one of those who believe that globalization
is overwhelmingly, though not entirely, a good thing. So the
instinctive negative reaction that even someone like me feels
toward ``Davos Man'' (a phrase coined by the political scientist
Samuel Huntington) suggests just how serious a public relations
problem now faces the global economy in which Davos Man flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that globalization makes the world a richer
place, but the wealth it creates goes disproportionately to two
sorts of people. On one side are those who benefit from vastly
improved access to technology and capital _ which is to say,
workers in developing countries. On the other are those in advanced
countries who, directly or indirectly, have technology and capital
to sell _ which means the rich and the highly educated. Largely
left out of the party, possibly even made worse off, are those who
fall into neither category. Most conspicuously, competition from
those newly productive third-world workers is one, though probably
not the most important, of the reasons that the real wages of many
American workers have stagnated or even declined over the last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to be honest, a picture that contains some shadows.
Still, if you ask about the overall effect on the human condition,
globalization has been a huge force for good. Just ask the South
Koreans, who have telescoped three centuries of European progress
into the last 40 years; or even ask the Bangladeshis, who remain
desperately poor but whose export industries have kept them from
sliding into Malthusian catastrophe. You could say _ and I would _
that globalization, driven not by human goodness but by the profit
motive, has done far more good for far more people than all the
foreign aid and soft loans ever provided by well-intentioned
governments and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But in saying this, I know from experience that I have
guaranteed myself a barrage of hate mail. For there is another kind
of person _ Seattle Man? _ who is passionately committed to a
simpler view, without any ambiguities. Seattle Man believes that
globalization is purely and simply a way for capitalists to exploit
the world's workers. He contrasts the wealth and privilege of
global movers and shakers with the poverty of sweatshop workers,
and gets angry if you try to suggest that those sweatshops are
better than the alternative (let alone that they might, as in South
Korea, be the first step on the way to first-world living
standards). Seattle Man, in short, does not believe that most of
the world is still poor because development is hard to do; he is
looking for villains. And in places like Davos he has found
putative villains who might have been chosen by Central Casting.
</P>
<P>
   Now with some exceptions the people who will be at Davos aren't
really villains: they are no worse, though a lot richer, than the
rest of us. But they have an image problem, one that threatens the
process of the globalization for which they stand. Will the great
and (in some cases) good who meet this week find answers to that
problem? Stay tuned.

CHILE PLANS NO WELCOME CEREMONY FOR PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean government and armed forces have
decided that there will be no official welcoming ceremony should
Gen. Augusto Pinochet return to Chile in the coming days from
London, where he has been under house arrest on human rights
charges for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes to discourage strong reactions by both the
former dictator's supporters and his detractors on his return,
which is expected as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest on a Spanish warrant in October 1998, there
were weeks of demonstrations by his supporters as well as by human
rights groups that mobilized in support of a Spanish judge hoping
to extradite the general to stand trial in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity of the reactions here has subsided through the
months of legal procedures, so much so that the news from London
two weeks ago that a team of doctors had found Pinochet too ill to
stand trial _ thereby probably ending the extradition proceedings _
brought little public response.
</P>
<P>
   The British home secretary, Jack Straw, who is reviewing appeals
by human rights groups to release the medical examination results,
is expected to announce this week whether the general will return
home.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has dispatched an air force Boeing 707 to London and plans
to fly Pinochet either to the provincial town of Iquique, where he
has a residence, or to Santiago. Officials say the top military
commanders will welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have a reception given by the military
authorities,'' said Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, ``but
there will not be any kind of public ceremony. Most likely he will
check into the Military Hospital for an extensive examination.''
</P>
<P>
   Both human rights groups and Pinochet supporters will probably
demonstrate outside the hospital. But Congresswoman Isabel Allende,
daughter of Salvador Allende, the president who died during the
coup led by the general, said she expected a subdued reaction to
his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day Jack Straw announced the examination results,'' she
said, ``only 50 people gathered at the Pinochet Foundation. I saw
that they had 20 people demonstrating outside the British Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming back to a different country. The right has washed
their hands of him, especially Joaquin Lavin, who during his
presidential campaign completely distanced himself from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin narrowly lost the presidential race last Sunday to Ricardo
Lagos, a moderate socialist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Should Pinochet return, he would continue to face legal
problems. While he has been away, relatives of people who
disappeared during the dictatorship have filed more than 50
criminal charges against him. A judge also ruled that an amnesty
declared by the general for crimes committed during most of the
1970s did not apply to disappearances, which will be treated as
kidnappings, ongoing crimes, until the victims' remains are found.
</P>
<P>
   But before he could be tried, Pinochet would have to be stripped
of the immunity he holds as a senator for life, a position he
gained from the Constitution he installed before leaving power in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   That process could take many months, after which he probably
would go through more health tests. If he was found to be mentally
disabled, that could prevent a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allende said she was looking forward to pressing for a
trial. ``I can't be sure, but it is possible he can be tried
here,'' she said, ``and that would have been unimaginable before
his arrest.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN OLD CRUSADE CONTINUES INTO THE NEW CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Ohio, Pa.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider this my vote for Tiger Woods as Athlete of the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who plan on casting ballots in 99 years or so,
it's never too soon to start the campaign. I'm also voting for Pete
Sampras, Lance Armstrong and the American women's soccer team, the
only other current athletes with a chance of being honored in two
different centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Will they pass the tests of time? Are they really all that great
now? Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   But I do know that if you don't vote early and often, there's a
good chance that your choice will be lost in the mists of time. And
then again, some of them should be. Bobby Jones and Bill Tilden
have always seemed, at best, footnotes in someone else's story.
Meanwhile, Jack Johnson, Babe Didrikson and Jim Thorpe are the
foundation stones of the American sports century, and it's always a
chore explaining why.
</P>
<P>
   The big three of last century's greatest-hit lists were Michael
Jordan, Muhammad Ali and Babe Ruth, the fairly safe choices of the
conventional wisdom keepers. All three ended up making us feel good
for reasons I belabored in the last century and will not again
without a major recording deal.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting choices, such as Jackie Robinson and, most
importantly, Billie Jean King, often got short shrift because of
the confusion about the term ``greatest athlete'': Is the criterion
pure animal energy (Jack Dempsey, Jim Brown), ethnic and racial
sentimentality (Sandy Koufax, Jesse Owens, Joe DiMaggio),
historical importance (the Babes, the Jacks, Thorpe, Ali, Billie),
all-around athleticism (the Jims, Deion) or commercial significance
(Wayne Gretzky, the Babes, Michael Jordan)? This could keep you in
the bar past closing time or on the Net forever.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not over. Grace Thorpe, a formidable publicity mill
with a Washington Rolodex, thinks a great injustice has been done
her father, who won gold medals in the pentathlon and the decathlon
at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, starred in college and pro football
and played major-league baseball. Which of the big three came close
to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan is a neat guy, classy, but he starred in one sport,''
she said from Prague, Okla., near where Jim was born in 1887 of
equal parts Irish, French, Potawatomie, and Sac and Fox blood.
``Babe's records have been superseded by Hank Aaron and Mark
McGwire. And Ali, a draft dodger married four times. This is a role
model?''
</P>
<P>
   A former Army corporal in World War II, Grace is 78 and well
known among anti-nuclear and Indian affairs activists. She admits
she is having great fun stirring this pot. There are U.S. Senate
and House resolutions calling for Thorpe to be proclaimed the
athlete of the century. The state legislatures of Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Oklahoma have already done so. Ten days ago in
Colorado Springs, the Native American Sports Council and the U.S.
Olympic Committee held a tribute to Thorpe at the Olympic Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Oren Lyons, the Iroquois diplomat and Hall of Fame lacrosse
player, is currently lobbying the king of Sweden to proclaim Thorpe
international athlete of the century. This would reaffirm the
declaration of his ancestor, King Gustav, who as he placed the
laurel wreath on Thorpe's head at the Olympics 88 years ago, said,
``Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's reply itself made him worth remembering always. He
said, ``Thanks, King.''
</P>
<P>
   To the world press, it was an amusing example of the barely
civilized native with amazing natural abilities meeting his master,
the tolerant, sophisticated royal. To Native Americans, it was an
example of their simplicity, directness, honesty, their harmony
with all beings. To us now, it should be a milestone; as an
all-American icon, Thorpe was beaten but never tamed, a symbol of
hope for a muscle-flexing new country.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Olympic officials treated Thorpe so harshly
when they learned that he, as had many college athletes of his
time, played semipro summer baseball. They took back his medals and
struck his name from the amateur honor roll. They also took back
valuable jeweled trophies he had been given by the king of Sweden
and the czar of Russia. Those babies have yet to reappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad had a terrible life,'' Grace Thorpe said. ``His twin
brother died when he was 9, his parents died when he was young, he
lost his first-born son as a baby and then his wife. But he never
lost his good spirits, he never stopped trying. I'd like to do this
for him. And I think I can.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the last we'll say about this matter, at least for
this century. Now, back to the future and the
Woods-Sampras-Armstrong-Soccer-Babe bandwagon. Just as the lack of
``SportsCenter'' videotapes of Thorpe hurts him among the wise
panelists, so will the lack of three-dimensional holograms (by 2078
you'll be able to feel and smell athletes in your entertainment
chamber) hurt Sampras et al. These candidates will have been born
too early for the future ESPN classic channel where we will be able
to virtual pitch to Ken Griffey IV or try to elude one of those
500-pound linebackers bred in a bottle at the Robert Wood Johnson
IV Memorial Sports Breeding Farm.

SEWER BILLS ADJUSTED FOR DRY WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If your water bill seems higher than normal,
blame it on La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate fight to keep lawns and gardens alive during this
year's bone-dry winter, Los Angeles residents used 20 percent more
water in December as compared to the five-year average, officials
said. Even compared to December 1998, which also was drier than
normal, last month's water use was up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people aren't conserving water. It's just
because of the dry weather. People are trying to maintain their
lawns,'' said Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Darlene
Battle. ``We understand them wanting to keep their lawns looking
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this winter, rainfall is about an eighth of the normal
total.
</P>
<P>
   Logic holds that because the city measures sewer bills by water
consumption during the rainy season, sewer bills should skyrocket
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, city officials insist.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Sanitation takes dry weather into consideration
when calculating sewer rates. To account for dry winters, the
bureau uses a complex formula to adjust for water that residents
are using to sprinkle their lawns.
</P>
<P>
   The less rain that falls, like with the La Ninas of this year
and last year, then the more the bureau figures people are watering
their yards. So there's more water going into the ground and less
into the sewers than during a normal, wet winter.
</P>
<P>
   So a resident's water bill is based on actual consumption for
that month, while the sewer bill is figured from consumption the
previous winter.
</P>
<P>
   But that distinction can give rise to an odd situation like
1998, when some residents were charged for dumping more water into
the sewer system than they were actually using in their homes. That
winter, El Nino was pouring rain on the area and people were using
less water than the year before, when a dry winter had them
sprinkling their lawns more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, any time you're trying to come up with a sewage
volume for a half-million customers, it's really hard to come up
with a system that fits everybody,'' said Lisa Mowery, a civil
engineer with the Bureau of Sanitation. ``That's really the closest
we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   To account for winters when folks are doing a lot of watering
and sprinkling, but not putting a lot of water down the drain, the
city applies the Dry Winter Compensation Factor.
</P>
<P>
   Because last winter was also dry, the factor for current bills
is 0.82, meaning that the Bureau of Sanitation estimates only 82
percent of the water a household used went down the drain. The
previous winter had plenty of rain and little need for sprinkling,
thanks to El Nino, so that factor was 0.92.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very wet winter, and most people's water consumption
was very low. They weren't using much irrigation water at all,''
Mowery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this winter continues to be a dry one, next June when we're
determining what the Dry Winter Compensation Factor for this winter
will be, it will probably be pretty low again, to try and take into
account the fact that our residents need to keep irrigating during
the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnetka resident Claude Field installed low-flow toilets and
shower heads in 1998, but said that didn't help the previous year's
consumption, and consequently the current year's sewer bill. Since
then, however, he said his bills for both water and sewer usage
have evened out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I get stable bills,' he said. ``It's kind of a
budget-buster when you get a bill for several hundred dollars that
you weren't expecting. All of a sudden you get a bill that breaks
your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the extreme dry weather this winter, Field said he
hasn't had a jump in his water usage. He said he has a small back
yard that doesn't require much watering to survive this winter, and
a large pool that needs to be topped off during the summer because
of evaporation, so the seasonal differences balance out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dry Winter Compensation Factor of 0.82 for this year's bills
is the lowest figure the bureau has ever used. But this is only the
third year the system has been in place. Before 1997, the bureau
charged residents a flat 60 percent of their water usage -- a
method that had charges oscillating wildly from bill to bill, and
elicited many complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is averaged over the entire year, so the charge
remains flat, a change that officials say has cut customer
complaints in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had the big bulges,'' Field said, ``going from a
$200 bill to a $700 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Water use in December was 562.5 million gallons per day, an
increase of 15 percent from the previous December, and 20 above the
five-year average for that month. But December is traditionally the
lowest month for water use, Battle said, so even with the big jump,
the total was far below the total for August, for example, which
was 7.06 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the water usage is higher (during the dry winter),
the conservation effort is the same,'' Battle said. ``We're so
proud of our customers conserving. We want them to keep up the good
work, even during the dry season.''

L.A. AREA HOME PRICES RISE IN HOT MARKET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Residents of Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley
snapped up homes at a torrid pace last year, driving sales to their
highest level of the decade and fourth best ever, according to a
report to be released Sunday, Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   With single-family home prices making double-digit gains, buyers
looking for bargains flocked to the condominium market in strong
enough numbers to push 1999's combined sales to 16,794 units, up
1.4 percent from 1998, the decade's previous best, said the
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The best year on record was 1979, when 19,964 units sold.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the increased sales in condominiums was a
jump in the median price of single-family homes last year. As
prices rose, buyers shifted to the condo market in droves.
</P>
<P>
   On an annual basis, the median price for single-family homes --
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less
-- climbed to $212,929, up $21,175, or 11.7 percent, from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third consecutive year that the median price has
increased, after it fell from 1991 to 1997. However, last year's
value is still 10.4 percent under the previous high annual median
of $236,958, achieved in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That gap is closing fast, though.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carney, director of the Real Estate Research Council at
California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, said his analysis
of the Valley market shows prices appreciating by about 10 percent
annually. At that rate, prices should be back to pre-recession
levels sometime late this year or early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of a decline in sales, prices are still up, and
that's an indication there is clear excess demand for homes in the
San Fernando Valley,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Link, the association's executive vice president, thinks the
value lost during the recession could be recovered sometime this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no hard-and-fast rules and many factors are
involved, including the price range and location, but we believe
full recovery is in sight if the resale market keeps moving at its
current pace,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's market should see more activity in the move-up
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As prices rise, there will be a renewed interest by existing
owners to move to bigger, better or newer properties,'' said Link.
</P>
<P>
   The price spike in the single-family market made condominiums
hot properties last year, as sales surged nearly 19 percent to
3,936 units, the fifth increase in a row. The annual median price
increased just 1.4 percent to $122,741. Condominiun prices jumped a
whopping 24.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, single-family sales cooled a bit last year,
totaling 12,858 units for an annual decline of 3 percent. It was
the first annual decline after three consecutive years of
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, consumers still bought $4.1 billion worth of
residential housing, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   Now several trends are evident in the Valley's market.
</P>
<P>
   Nima Nattagh, an analyst at Santa Ana-based First American Real
Estate Solutions, said 1999 proved that the Valley's market has
indeed recovered from the recession of the early 1990s and that it
should remain strong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery that Los Angeles County has experienced,
particularly the Westside, has now spread into the Valley, and the
condo market is picking up as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of sales for the remainder of 2000 probably won't equal
the last two years for a couple of reasons. The decade closed with
exceptionally strong back-to-back markets and the supply is tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the market will stay buoyant in terms of volume of sales
as well as appreciation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects prices to appreciate 5 percent to 6 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year ended on a tepid note, with December sales declining 3
percent to 985 units from year-ago levels. Prices remained robust,
gaining nearly 11 percent to $219,900. This is 10.2 percent below
the high of $245,000 reached three times in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   One reason sales slipped at the end of last year is the
inventory. The number of homes listed for sale is not great enough
to satisfy demand, and there is no indication that listings will
increase anytime soon. For example, the number of active listings
for single-family homes fell 19 percent last month from December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Condominium listings declined 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sell what you don't have, and that in itself puts
more upward pressure on prices,'' Link said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no Disney World in Cuba. But in Cuba, the
grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez say, there is the boy's father and a
family that loves him, the familiar streets where he played and the
school where his first-grade classmates have kept his chair empty,
awaiting his return.
</P>
<P>
   It is the world, the women said, that the 6-year-old boy most
needs to recover from the accident that killed his mother last
November as they and others tried to make their way into the United
States in a boat that capsized and that left Elian clinging to an
inner tube at sea for two days before he was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not politicians,'' Maria Mariela Quintana, 51, Elian's
paternal grandmother, said in an interview early Saturday morning.
``What we want is the well-being of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're human,'' she said, referring to the relatives in
Miami who are blocking Elian's return to Cuba, ``we beg them to
think about the child's well-being too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, 51, Elian's maternal
grandmother, arrived in New York City on Friday to present a united
front against the Florida relatives who have taken care of the boy
since the Nov. 25 accident. The relatives, who are from the
father's side of the family, have argued that Elian would have a
better life in the United States than in a socialist state and
filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's decision Jan. 4 to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that anyone from Elian's family in Cuba _
which in addition to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, includes
both sets of grandparents _ has come to the United States to press
the father's custody claim. The women flew from Havana in a private
plane chartered by the National Council of Churches, an association
of 35 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations that favors the
reunification of the child with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The women were scheduled to fly to Washington on Saturday for a
meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the immigration service. Then the grandmothers were
to return to New York, where they are staying in the home of Joan
Brown Campbell, the church council's outgoing general secretary.
They said the purpose of the trip was to enlist the help of U.S.
officials in bringing their grandson back to Cuba without any more
delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they want the child to stay here after the
trauma he's been through,'' Mrs. Quintana said. ``They are not
close relatives. The person left he most loves is his father. This
child will not recover until he goes to Cuba and has the warmth of
his father, of his neighborhood, of his school.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's family dispute has escalated into a political tug-of-war
as the government of Fidel Castro and Cuban-American organizations
in the United States have seized on the case to reiterate their
spite for each other in speeches and demonstrations. In the
meantime, however, the grandmothers said they have been counting
the days since Nov. 19, when Elian and his mother, Elizabet Brotons
Rodriguez, vanished and a co-worker of the mother told the family
she had left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went crazy,'' Mrs. Quintana said. ``His father punched the
walls, screaming and crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been married for 13 years,'' Mrs. Quintana said of
Elian's parents, ``and she had had seven miscarriages. Both of them
were obsessed with Elian. They and us. We have all raised him and
spoiled him.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers said Elian's mother told no one of the plans,
and Ms. Rodriguez insisted her daughter was coerced into the risky
journey across the Straits of Florida by the man she had lived with
for a year and a half. Her daughter's boyfriend, Ms. Rodriguez
said, beat her and controlled her to the point that he persuaded
her to move out of her parents' home, where they all lived at one
time.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the women said, the family was worried sick. Then they
heard news of the accident that killed 11 people and of the rescue
of a boy. They rushed to call relatives in Miami and urged them to
take a picture of the boy to the hospital where they had taken the
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   But the joy of finding out that the boy had been saved turned to
concern as great uncles insisted the family come to Florida and
then moved to prevent the child's return. Ms. Rodriguez bristles at
assertions in Miami that her daughter would have wanted Elian to
stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one with five senses would have put a child on a boat in
bad conditions,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ``None of them knew her. How
can they know what she thought? I knew her because I was her
mother. She would have never abandoned us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the grandmothers said, family members lived within
blocks of each other in their hometown of Cardenas, and all pitched
in to raise Elian and taking him to school and medical
appointments. Elian's parents divorced three years ago _ Gonzalez
remarried and now has another son, who is 4 months old _ but their
relationship was close, ``like a brother and sister,'' Mrs.
Quintana said. Elian slept at his father's home part of the week,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents had government tourism jobs _ she as a hotel maid,
he as a hotel doorman and bartender _ and their access to dollars
ensured that the family did not suffer the economic hardship of
many others in Cuba, the women said. Asked whether she at any point
had debated the decision to press for the boy's return, Mrs.
Quintana asked: ``Why stay in the United States if all his family
is in Cuba? In Cuba he doesn't lack of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The women said they ached to see the boy but that they refuse to
go to Miami, which they consider hostile territory. They said they
want to meet him in a more neutral place. The two also said they
had been unable to reach Elian in the last four days. When they
call the relatives' home there is no answer, they said.
</P>
<P>
   After losing her only daughter, Ms. Rodriguez said, she wants to
recover her only grandson. She said she was receiving psychiatric
treatment in Cuba to deal with the family loss. ``I don't have her
but I have him,'' she said. ``But I don't have him.''

BEFORE THE DEAL, JORDAN DINED WITH THE POLLINS
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Abe Pollin could negotiate the amount of power and
ownership he would give up _ before the league's senior owner
helped convince the world's most incomparable athlete that the
Washington Wizards could be fixed _ Pollin had a much more pressing
decision: What to serve Michael Jordan for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it for a while; `What would Michael like to
eat?''' said Irene Pollin, wife of the Wizards' owner. ``We finally
settled on the salmon. We do a nice poached salmon here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, a series of intense negotiations led to
Jordan agreeing to a partial stake in the franchise and being named
head of basketball operations by the Wizards. But on Jan. 5, Jordan
was merely a well-dressed man, knocking on the front door of the
Pollins' home in suburban Washington, five minutes early for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   His re-entry into the NBA began in part that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how much it helped,'' Irene Pollin said by
telephone from her home on Friday afternoon. ``But it was nice for
my husband and I to get to know him better. We had the chance to
really talk. In most professions, you have peers to talk to about
your business. As an owner, you don't have colleagues in your city.
So just sitting down and talking to Michael about the NBA was
really nice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner with Michael began about 5 p.m. and lasted past 9.
Dropped off inconspicuously by a friend in a sport utility vehicle
and arriving alone, Jordan took many precautions to guarantee
secrecy. The Pollins, worried that star-struck neighbors might tip
off the news media, kept up their end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   They waited until 15 minutes before Jordan arrived to tell the
Portuguese couple who help take care of their home who was coming
to dinner. ``It was still daylight, and we just didn't want anyone
to know,'' Irene said. ``We were worried he was going to show up in
a big limo. He was so smart to have a friend drop him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Pollins gave their guest a tour of their home,
including the library, where a picture of Jordan was in full view.
While meeting with family in Chicago in the early 1990s, Abe Pollin
asked Jordan to take a picture with two of the Pollins'
granddaughters during a Saturday afternoon game at Chicago Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Michael,'' they said, showing him the photo as Jordan
smiled and shook his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jordan joked of his international popularity,
saying Commissioner David Stern had ruined the city of Paris for
him and his wife. ``We used to just like to sit and watch the
people go by,'' he said. ``Now I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene asked, ``Have you ever considered wearing a wig?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan laughed and said, ``I can't wear a wig.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also apparently enjoyed the story of the day Abe, a
renowned pingpong player, thoroughly beat the former Washington
player Gus Johnson during his youngest son's bar mitzvah. Johnson
was so frustrated by his inability to beat Pollin that he stormed
out, leaving his wife and a house full of stunned people behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's response was, `I would have done exactly the same
thing, except I wouldn't have left without my wife,''' Irene said.
</P>
<P>
   After spending more than four hours together, Jordan, unsure of
when his ride would show up, grew weary enough that he asked the
Pollins if he could spend the night. ``Do you have a bed big enough
for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Before they could oblige, Jordan's ride arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think he felt very comfortable,'' Irene said. ``I
know my husband did. It means something when you can look the guy
in the eye and get to know them better. And they certainly couldn't
do it in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nary a word was spoken between the two about their
well-publicized argument at a negotiating session during the
lockout in 1998, in which Jordan told Pollin he should sell his
team if he could not afford to run a franchise. Pollin became
enraged, yelling toward Jordan at one point, ``Who do you think you
are, telling me to sell my team?''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere over the course of those four hours, a 75-year-old
man who purchased his NBA team in 1964 _ a man who had seen the
league become overrun by players, their agents and multinational
conglomerates over three-plus decades _ began to view Jordan as a
likable, engaging man whom he could envision turning the Wizards
around.
</P>
<P>
   There was still hard negotiating to be done: at 4 p.m.
Wednesday, the moment the news conference announcing the deal was
scheduled to begin, the two parties were still going over details
at the agent David Falk's office. A half-hour later they had the
deal together and were on their way to the MCI Center to talk about
it in public.
</P>
<P>
   But a key compromise was made two weeks earlier. Unbeknownst to
his hosts, Jordan had never eaten salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was used to chicken and ribs, and that he had never
tried it before,'' Irene said. ``I said, `Well, too late now.'''
She added, ``Really, the whole evening was delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Pollins' doorbell rang at about 6 p.m. A
few children from the neighborhood had an important question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Michael Jordan here?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Abe said, ``Sorry, guys.'' &UR;  &LR;

DUNCAN AND HILL LIKELY TO STAY  
 GREATNESS GOES ONLY SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-JORDAN-POLLIN)

<P>
   Among his other clients, Lon Babby represents the
free-agents-to-be Tim Duncan and Grant Hill. So, more than any
agent since David Falk or Arn Tellem, Babby will alter the axis of
the NBA's power structure this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   As for his clients' leaving San Antonio and Detroit, do not
count on it. Not only does it pay for Hill to play one more season
with the Pistons before becoming a free agent _ because of salary
levels based on experience, he stands to make $20 million more over
the life of a six-year contract extension _ but Duncan, too, seems
poised to stay in San Antonio for at least a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has four more years until he can seek the contract of a
seven-year player in the league. Rather than sign a long-term deal
for less money with another team, Duncan may sign a two- or
three-year contract with the Spurs with an escape clause. This
makes sense for two reasons: He can make the maximum allowed in
three years and gauge where the Spurs are in their quest to win
another title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hidden story,'' Babby said of Duncan. ``He's going
to take a look at this after the season. He'll assess it when the
time comes. It was in his best interests to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you any prediction, other than to say he likes it
there and the team's been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hill, Babby said: ``It's the same situation in some respects.
As long as Grant thinks they're building a champion, that's what's
most important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatness Goes Only So Far
</P>
<P>
   Though hamstrung by the team's frugal owner, Clippers General
Manager Elgin Baylor has had his share of troubles as an NBA
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed found a gem now and then, like P.J. Brown, but he
also drafted Yinka Dare and Ed O'Bannon for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McHale has done good things in Minnesota, but he is also
never blamed for losing Stephon Marbury and, very nearly, Kevin
Garnett _ one of the top three players in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that being a great player translates to being a great
general manager is one of the biggest fallacies at work in the NBA.
Wes Unseld should share that thought with Michael Jordan as soon as
they try to rebuild the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   For every Hall of Fame player to make the transition, only Jerry
West has broken the mold _ building and rebuilding the Lakers into
champions, understanding the dynamics of the game on and off the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordan was given a part-ownership stake in the Wizards last
week _ and Pat Riley was given an ownership stake in the Miami Heat
before him _ you wonder why an owner has not given West a piece of
a franchise yet.

MASS GRAVES IN TURKEY DRAW ATTENTION TO TERROR CELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Police officers searching for victims of a
religious-oriented terrorist group found four bodies buried beneath
a villa in the central Turkish town of Konya on Friday night,
bringing the total exhumed so far to 17.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome search has riveted the nation's attention since
Monday, when a heavily armed police squad surrounded a building
that authorities called the group's Istanbul headquarters and
seized it after a spectacular gun battle that was broadcast live on
television.
</P>
<P>
   One man inside the building in Istanbul was killed. The police
identified him as Huseyin Velioglu, leader of a militant Islamic
group known as Hezbollah, which is believed to be unrelated to the
anti-Israeli group Hezbollah based in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ten bodies, all nude and bearing signs of torture, were found
beneath the Istanbul hide-out. According to news reports, some of
the bodies were missing limbs, and others had nails driven into
their skulls. The killers had planted onions above the mass grave
to cover the odor.
</P>
<P>
   The police captured two men who were inside the house. They also
found documents, computer disks and videotapes said to contain
scenes of torture and executions.
</P>
<P>
   All 17 victims whose remains have been found so far are believed
to have been Kurds from southeastern Turkey, which has been torn by
war and terror for years. The lone woman among them was reportedly
Konca Kuris, a writer who had often portrayed Islam as a permissive
religion that demands freedom for women.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200 residents of southeastern Turkey, most of them
businessmen unsympathetic to the cause of militant Islam, have
disappeared since August. Hezbollah _ the name means Party of God _
is now considered the prime suspect in many of these cases.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also suspected of involvement in a 1993 arson
attack in the city of Sivas. That fire killed 37 secularist
intellectuals who had gathered for a conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkey's Hezbollah is not believed to be connected to
the group based in Lebanon, the two evidently share a fervent
commitment to radical Islam. Turkish and Israeli officials believe
that both groups receive support from Iran, but the Iranian foreign
minister, Kamal Kharrazi, who was in Turkey during the Istanbul
raid, denied that his government had any connection to Hezbollah in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah emerged as a force in southeastern Turkey in the late
1980s, when a Kurdish uprising was reaching its peak. For the next
several years, the ranks of Kurdish nationalists, intellectuals and
businessmen were decimated by thousands of unsolved ``mystery
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, news commentators and academic researchers have
asserted that many of these killings may have been carried out by
Hezbollah in cooperation with the army and the police. Many of the
victims were perceived as supporters of the rebel Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, which the government was determined to wipe out.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Kurdish group's top leader, Abdullah Ocalan, has
been captured and sentenced to death, fighting in the southeastern
provinces has subsided. If Hezbollah was once an ally of the
government, it is now considered a threat because of its support
for radical Islam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah's anti-PKK stance and the sympathy it has received
for killing PKK members has put the state in the position of being
the target of the Frankenstein monster it created,'' the columnist
Gungor Mengi wrote in an Istanbul newspaper. ``We hope this
incident has taught our leaders not to use religious terror groups
under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The two recent raids may lead to new investigations into some of
the most highly publicized mystery killings. The victims included
not only Kurds, but prominent secularists like a newspaper
columnist, Ugur Mumcu, who was killed by a car bomb in 1993, and a
former minister of culture, Ahmet Taner Kislali, who was killed by
a bomb last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said operations against Hezbollah
``will continue until we have completely wiped out this murderous
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   One leading expert on Turkish terror groups, Emin Gurses, a
professor of international relations at the University of Sakarya
in western Turkey, said Hezbollah and the Kurdistan Workers Party
fought not only over ideology, but also for control of smuggling
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PKK was at the peak of its power in the early 1990s,''
Gurses said. ``Army commanders knew that it was dangerous to give
free rein to Hezbollah, but the PKK was their main concern. Central
authorities in countries around the world close their eyes
temporarily to these kinds of organizations in similar
circumstances. But now that the PKK is defeated, a decision has
been made to crush Hezbollah.''

HERE'S INSTANT ACCESS TO YOUR SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: If I use AOL Instant Messenger at work, is
there any record of my ``conversations'' on its server? Also, if I
check my home e-mail through a mail viewer on my work computer, is
there a record? _ Guilty Conscience
</P>
<P>
   Dear Guilty: OK, for the last time, never do any personal stuff
at work. Nobody's accusing you of carrying on a lurid, seamy,
disgusting online romance _ although I briefly had an interesting
fantasy about that _ but you shouldn't take the chance that your
boss is a prying weasel with no regard for your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have any. You're working on company equipment,
using company software, doing company business. Your letter to
HotPants202 is company property if you sent it from the office.
Your instant messages belong to the company, too.
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that most companies trust employees not to abuse
Internet access. Sure, everyone takes a quick surf to sites that
have nothing to do with business. Even I occasionally check the
lowest fares to Las Vegas, although I consider that to be
journalistic research in case I ever need to answer a question
about probability theory. Just be aware that the technology exists
to record your every keystroke and that any site you visit on the
Internet can be logged by a boss who really wants to.
</P>
<P>
   I was serious about that research. Honest. I even took notes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: When I send pictures via Outlook Express, all
the recipients get is a jumble of text. _ Picture Imperfect
</P>
<P>
   Dear Imperfect: Wouldn't it be nice if everybody in the world
had the same e-mail program and used the same type of computer? Of
course, pigs will be airborne long before that ever happens,
especially with the way things are shaping up for the guys at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook Express has a nice little feature that lets senders
embed pictures directly in a letter. Of course, you need a
compatible e-mail program to actually see the picture on the
receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   To send anything more complex than plain text, e-mail programs
convert files into strings of letters and numbers that represent
all the different bytes that make up your picture of Junior
drooling in his oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   While not all programs understand embedded pictures, most of
them can handle attached files. Pick ``File attachment'' instead of
``Picture'' from the Insert menu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My aunt's e-mail service carrier is Microsoft's
Hotmail, which she uses for a business. However, for the past six
weeks, she has not been able to access any e-mail. _ Not So Hot
</P>
<P>
   Dear Hot: At least you're getting a level of service
proportional to what you're paying: nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail and all those other ``free'' e-mail services are fine
for many things. They let you check mail from any computer
connected to the Internet. They let you hide behind a flashy
nickname when you request information on Viagra. They even let you
receive mail from your regular Internet provider while you're on
the road. I'd never bet the business on a freebie mail account,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Your aunt's Internet provider should have its own mail server,
and if it doesn't, it's time to open the Yellow Pages. Remember,
nobody can force you to stay with a provider that doesn't give you
good service unless you sign a long-term contract. Did I mention
that you should never sign a long-term contract? &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Dr. Emilio Bombay's editors continue to curse the day they signed
him to a long-term contract. E-mail him at
drbombay\Nstar-telegram.com (snail-mail: Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101). Fax: 390-7257. In real life, Dr.

<P>
   DOOBHER KISHANPUR, India _ The New York City cabby, a
big-bellied, fast-talking philosopher-driver with a hide as tough
as a water buffalo, stood in the doorway of a school here on a
mid-January day, sweetly bidding farewell to 180 little girls in
blue-and-white gingham who poured into a dusty brick lane at the
end of the school day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Namaste,'' Om Dutta Sharma said to them, pressing his hands
together in the prayerful Hindi greeting (pronounced
``nah-MAH-stay'') as they chorused back their own goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Sharma has barreled through the streets of New
York City in a yellow taxi, saving his crumpled tips, never taking
his wife out to eat, scrimping on new clothes for his sons, to make
this act of goodness possible. He has given his village a school
for girls and named it for his illiterate mother, Ram Kali.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Sharma and his wife are struggling immigrants. But
here in his village _ a place without even a single telephone _
their incomes, modest by American standards, make them
philanthropists. ``I'm worthless in New York,'' said Sharma, whose
father grew sugar cane on a 10-acre plot nearby. ``Here, I am
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-story brick house where Sharma, 65, was raised is now
filled with first to fifth graders laboriously scratching out their
lessons in chalk. One recent afternoon, rows of girls in bright red
sweaters sat on the roof in the warm winter sun poring over their
sums while a man on the next roof shaped fuel patties from dung.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharmas can afford to educate and care for these farmers'
daughters because money buys more here than in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma and his wife, Krishna, a nurse at Bellevue Hospital
Center, contribute the $2,500 a year it costs to run the bare-bones
school. The girls sit on the floor and write on small chalkboards.
Each of the five teachers earns just $35 to $55 a month.
</P>
<P>
   To hire a local doctor to give the girls regular checkups,
Sharma spent $500 more from the earnings of a mango orchard he
planted years ago when he and his brother inherited the family
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma is now expanding the school so that 500 girls can attend
through high school. To pay for his ambitious plan, he says he and
his brother have submitted affidavits promising to donate the
family's 10 acres of land to a charitable trust they have set up in
India. Sharma will also give half the money from the sale of his
taxi medallion, which he estimates is worth $220,000. He bought it
in 1981 for $75,000, and said he planned to sell it when he retires
in three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, more girls in the village will have a chance of
schooling beyond the primary grades, a step forward in traditional
north Indian villages like this one, where a girl's odds of
learning to read and write are much lower than a boy's.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a 9-year-old explained that her daughter would not
be permitted to go to coeducational public school after she
finishes the fifth grade at Sharma's school. Many villagers want
their girls to go to girls-only schools, even though the public
schools are open to both boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We villagers don't like that,'' said the mother, Sumitra, her
hands determinedly planted on her hips as her daughter, Nancy,
stood meekly beside her, eyes downcast. ``After fifth, it will be
necessary to hold her back. But if there is a girls' school, she
can go up to 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharmas, who live in Woodside, Queens, are educating their
own sons too these days. They have taken out $50,000 in loans to
pay for Pramanik and Prasheel's college years at St. John's
University in Queens, Mrs. Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after Sharma's mother died in 1996, he felt that the
time was right to take on the cost of educating some little girls
he did not know in a village where he no longer lived. The doors of
the Ram Kali School for Girls opened in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always getting, getting, getting,'' Sharma said. ``You
have to give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting has not always come easily to the Sharmas. After
they immigrated to New York in 1974, Mrs. Sharma, a registered
nurse, got a New York City license and readily found work. But
Sharma, who had earned a law degree in India through a
correspondence course, decided not to practice in the United States
after he found out he would have to go back to law school and pass
the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, he worked as cashier at Burger King, a
machine operator in a wood-cutting factory and an insurance
salesman, but nothing lasted long, his wife said. Then one day in
1979, he hailed a cab and the Greek man behind the wheel told him
how to get a hack license. He became a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   In his wife's eyes, her lawyer husband had fallen ``from Mount
Everest to the depths of the Indian Ocean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharma, whose father was also a lawyer, said she was
shocked by her husband's new line of work. ``In India, no
professional person would give their daughter to a driver,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharma loved the job. Most of all, he loved talking to his
passengers about politics and the meaning of life in conversations
snatched during traffic jams. He worked 12 to 15 hours a day, seven
days a week. ``If I sit at a desk in an office, I'm dead meat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was charitable, giving free rides to old people or
money to a poor family in his village to help out with wedding
expenses. Mrs. Sharma said her husband's generosity was painful for
her as they struggled to pay their mortgage and heating bills. And
she was angry that she and their two sons saw little of him during
those years when he was working such long hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here 22 years,'' said Mrs. Sharma, who stayed home in
Queens this year to save the cost of the air fare. ``I never went
to one restaurant with him. I never went to one movie with him. He
never bought me even one dress. In my living room, one of my TVs _
you can't see the picture properly. He comes home and watches it at
night. I said, `Why don't you fix the tube?' He said, `No, I have
to go to India. I may need money for the school.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the penny-pinching, Mrs. Sharma supports and admires
her husband's desire to do good. It is she who has packed her sons'
lunches to save on cafeteria food. ``Many people give hospitals and
schools,'' she said. ``But those are millionaires. How many poor
and middle-class people have done this?''
</P>
<P>
   After sparring about American foreign policy with a passenger
recently, Sharma said, he explained his motives for giving away
what he has. The passenger, exasperated that Sharma had called the
United States hypocritical for battling to stop ethnic massacres in
Kosovo but failing to stop them in Rwanda, asked him, ``If you hate
America so much, why do you live here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, this is a beautiful question you have asked, and
I'm going to give you the answer,'' Sharma replied. He reminded the
passenger about the First Amendment, which gives a talker like
Sharma the liberty to say whatever he thinks. He also told the man
he is here to help the motherland he left 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``American technology is overpowering the poor countries like
India by hook or by crook,'' he said. ``It is my moral duty to take
back some wealth, by drop, drop, drop.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two disturbances moving eastward in tandem will produce
inclement conditions from southern New England to the central
Appalachians and around the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   One center of low pressure will move quickly to the Maryland
coast by midday and this will bring an end to light snow and sleet
in the Carolinas and Virginia. Chilly, moist onshore winds will
keep occasional snow and flurries falling from Maryland to Cape
Cod, Mass. Most sections will receive 2 inches or less, but a
narrow band of 4 to 6 inches of snow is possible from western
Virginia to southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A second, somewhat stronger disturbance near Lake Huron will
bring snow showers to much of the Great Lakes region as its
circulation ushers in more cold air to the Middle West and upper
Mississippi Valley. A fresh covering of snow is expected in most
places, but heavier accumulations are likely near the lakeshore in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will cover much of the south as a front stalls near the
Gulf coast. Showers will taper to drizzle from Georgia to
Louisiana. Much of east Texas will be dull and cooler, but high
pressure building into Nebraska will sponsor sunny, cool weather in
the central and northwest Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high pressure over Idaho, clouds will dominate the
Northwest. A storm approaching the California coast will spread
showers inland Sunday morning with snow developing in the northern
Sierra. A stream of high clouds will block the sun in the Southwest
and central Rockies. Temperatures will be near seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: False Eye
</P>
<P>
   Visible satellite pictures from midday on Friday showed what
appeared to be a clear center in the midst of the fierce ocean
storm south of Nova Scotia. Indeed, a ship near Sable Island
reported a barometric reading of 28.16 inches of mercury, as low as
most category-three hurricanes. But looks can be deceptive. This
intense cyclone had successfully wrapped a pool of relatively mild,
dry air into its center of circulation, giving the appearance of an
eye. Within a few hours, the clear spot had disappeared, but the
storm continued to rage as it moved into the Canadian Maritimes.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ It is a field house, not an arena.
</P>
<P>
   Field houses are looming barns from another age, now supposedly
passe in this high-tech dot.com world _ except in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball really had its beginnings in Indiana, which remains
today the center of the sport,'' James Naismith, the Canadian who
invented the sport in Massachusetts, said in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice is the curved roof arcing gracefully
above glass and red brick. A field house. How quaint. Then there is
the 18-foot-wide basketball hanging in the warm, spacious lobby,
accurate right down to the 6,870 dimples _ a bit fanatic, but you
get the point: this is a living museum with artifacts like a
battered leather satchel from the old Indianapolis Kautskys, early
semipro champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you should be wearing Chuck Taylors in this
place,'' said Reggie Miller, referring to the old sneaker of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Every American city either has a new sports pleasure palace or
covets one _ at least until somebody asks how much it will cost the
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   This field house makes a New Yorker want to rush home and do the
Fountainhead thing by pushing the plunger on that claustrophobic
den called Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing quite like Conseco Fieldhouse, where the past
is blended with the present, so lovingly, so handsomely. There is
an acknowledged debt to Baltimore's Camden Yards, said David Kahn,
the general manager of the Pacers, who coordinated the field house.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Yards blends baseball history (Babe Ruth's birthplace is
one sultanic swat away) with consumerism (microbeers and good
sausage in the open-air food court) and a reassuring feel of
old-timey red brick and steel grillwork. So that is what they did
in Indy, too, but with a huge emphasis on real mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Since they do not add the same number of zeroes for land value
and air rights in Indianapolis as they do in Manhattan, people
could afford to dream big. Conseco Fieldhouse rises 15 stories
against a so-called skyline that until recently consisted mostly of
warehouses and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the field house begins in the lobby, where people
congregate before games, with a glow of Midwestern manners.
</P>
<P>
   At most arenas, there is a surly ``security officer,'' but here
there is a gracious ``concierge'' named Michelle Hoosier, right
there on her badge. What else would her name be?
</P>
<P>
   Over the two portals, through which all customers must enter, is
the Naismith quote, on the right, and one from Tony Hinkle, the
legendary Butler University coach, on the left: ``Some people call
basketball a craze in Indiana. It is not a craze because a craze is
something that lasts briefly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even New Yorkers appreciate Indiana basketball. Donnie Walsh,
the Pacers' president, is from the Bronx and played at North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt basketball was a city game,'' Walsh said, ``but
when I was coaching for Frank McGuire at South Carolina, I came out
here and I realized Indiana was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these little towns have their own gymnasiums. You might
have 10,000 people in the town, but the gym holds 12,000 and it is
sold out every game. This is part of their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   With old Market Square Arena lacking the amenities of the new
palaces, city officials and the two owners, Herb and Mel Simon,
agreed to build the $183 million arena based on income from major
sponsors and a bond that will not, they insist, cost the public any
money.
</P>
<P>
   The details were left to the two lawyers, Walsh and Kahn, a
reformed sportswriter from Oregon who consulted with Janet Marie
Smith, who helped build Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not make sense'' to lace basketball memorabilia in
arenas in Miami or in Los Angeles, Kahn said, ``but basketball is
synonymous with Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   The architects from Ellerbe Becket came up with a field house
with a curved roof that had obvious references to past field houses
including the first in the nation, built in Newberry, Ind., in
1916. City officials were a tad nervous. Who wanted retro in a city
already considered retro? But Walsh and Kahn, the outsiders, urged
people to be proud of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   This being the age of the theme mall, Kahn insisted that all
stands have an ancient feel, as personified by the dark-wooded
``barber shop'' where children have their faces painted with the
Pacers' colors. The three major ``pavilions'' all have Indiana
themes _ mementos from 1954, when tiny Milan High won the state
tournament; black history, including Oscar Robertson's jersey from
Crispus Attucks High here; and the Indianapolis Speedway pavilion
has two mock Indy cars that fans can drive under simulated racing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Other touches include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A photo of Robertson, John Wooden and Larry Bird, three
Hoosier icons, together at the grand opening in November. (``I
thought about it, and I dare anybody from New York to come up with
three New York figures who could match those three,'' Walsh said.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Items from the old American Basketball Association champs:
Roger Brown's jersey; great photos of billowing Afro haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pennant Walk, featuring the nicknames of the 20 schools with
the largest gyms in the state. (``I made it 20 so we could include
the Frankfort Hot Dogs, their real nickname,'' Kahn said.)
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements and details are all retro, evoking the look
when boys wore flat-top crew cuts and girls wore white bobby socks.
</P>
<P>
   In the private restaurants, the tastes are yuppified, for
example, an aromatic Tuscan bean salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are limits to retro,'' Kahn admitted.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The arena's naming rights went to Conseco, an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The field house itself is steep enough to evoke the intimate
madness of Market Square. The two layers of luxury boxes are
separated by club seats, avoiding the mausoleum effect at the
National Tennis Center in New York. Here, luxury-box fans still
roar like Indy cars.
</P>
<P>
   The brick walls and hunter green seats provide an almost austere
look, putting the focus on the glamorous athletes and gaudy
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted our team colors to be the icing on the cake,'' Kahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh believes he can help ``recruit'' free agents with the
ambience and the luxuries, including a therapeutic pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing stuff. You can rehab a torn ACL months quicker with
it,'' said Chris Mullin, the old Garden gym rat.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins, originally from Brooklyn, in his 14th and last
season, finds himself peeking up at the pregame video, which shows
a family huddled in front of an old console radio, followed by
grainy black-and-white images evolving into vivid color action
clips. The video ends with the stark pronouncement: ``In 49 states
it's just basketball. But. This. Is. Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spiritual center of basketball, they built a field house,
and the fans will come.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is running low
on options just as he approaches what could be the defining moment
in his five decades of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to outline the deal by the middle of February,
and last week, Arafat visited President Clinton at the White House,
asking for help in bringing concessions from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are
supposed to resolve the final differences between their peoples.
The so-called ``permanent status'' phase of the Oslo peace process
should define the Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat may face a stark choice: Take a deal that is unpopular
with his people or refuse it and never achieve his goal of a
Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   For American officials trying to broker the deal, Arafat's
options could determine whether there is a lasting peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters note that Arafat is a master when the odds are low.
He lived through a 1992 desert plane crash and the 1982 Israeli
siege of his headquarters in Beirut. He was isolated by the West
for supporting Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, then won a Nobel
Peace Prize for signing Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   His power among Palestinians is still unrivaled _ backed by his
control over billions of dollars and nine security forces _ and he
remains the emblem of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   But, his popularity as a president is low and he has recently
suffered a string of indignities.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Barak continues to expand Jewish settlements on
occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's entrance into peace talks with Israel have overshadowed
the Oslo process, which guides Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian
Gaza Strip and West Bank lands captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Barak announced that he was delaying the Jan. 20
land transfer to the Palestinians while he went to Washington to
negotiate with Syria. When the Syria talks were cancelled, Barak
still did not hand over the land.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's dilemma is whether he should take a deal in September,
even though it might be far less than he has long promised his
people.
</P>
<P>
   He has brought the Palestinians far. Most in the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank now live in areas under their own control _ if only
in small pockets surrounded by Israel. They have some trappings of
statehood _ an airport, visits from dignitaries, their own security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   But, the 70-year-old Arafat has always rallied his people with
promises. He told them they would return to homes they fled in what
is now Israel _ something Israel will surely not allow. He promises
a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem _ also opposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dahaisha refugee camp in Palestinian-controlled
Bethlehem, people come from areas in central Israel that their
families fled when Israel was created in 1948. They know Arafat is
not leading them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case of the refugees is forgotten,'' says 23-year-old
construction worker Mahmoud Saraneh. ``We thought we would benefit
but we were wrong. Arafat will do everything the Israelis want.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have long known that Israel is the dominant power _
that's one of the reasons they entered a peace process and are
patient with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, 20 Palestinian intellectuals penned a leaflet
alleging that Palestinian weakness in the peace process was in part
caused by the widespread corruption in Arafat's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't strong enough in the negotiations. This is because
of the absence of democracy,'' said signatory Hussam Khader, a
member of the Palestinian legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The signers were long-time critics and could have been ignored.
But, Arafat had several arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst, said Araftat's
harsh reaction came because he knows his public agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arafat) is in a very desperate situation,'' Khatib said.
``The Israelis will not make concessions because they are very
powerful and the Palestinians cannot make concessions because they
are very weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls show Arafat winning approval from
about 45 percent of the Palestinians,17 points below two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic factors may also work against Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Syria talks give Israel leverage.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel can make a deal with Syria, the rest of the Arab world
may open relations with Israel. That would take pressure off Israel
to make a deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said that Israel will focus on peace talks with
Palestinians or Syrians depending on which shows eagerness to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while Barak was expected to be friendlier to Arafat than
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, he has in some ways been tougher.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Barak has outpaced Netanyahu for the construction of
Jewish settlements. These settlements, sprawling housing
developments, are on West Bank land that Israel captured in the
1967 Israel-Arab War. Each settlement reduces the turf Palestinians
are likely to get under Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's negotiators threatened to call off talks if the
settlement construction continued, but they reversed under Israeli
and American pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political analyst Menachem Klein, an expert on
Palestinian affairs, said Arafat still has cards to play.
</P>
<P>
   He can rely on his best-ever support in international capitals.
For example, Clinton last week indicated he would try to keep Barak
on the Oslo timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Klein also said that Arafat has built networks and institutions
within Jerusalem, among the 200,000 Palestinians who live there,
that could help wrest part of the city from Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Palestinians say the Israelis are squeezing Arafat into a
deal he will have to refuse. They claim that any agreement that
does not share Jerusalem or help the 3.4 million refugees will be
too unpopular for Arafat to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is a survival person. He will not allow himself to
collapse politically,'' said analyst Khatib.
</P>
<P>
   For Israeli and American officials seeking a lasting peace, a
forced deal could be as bad as no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may create a situation where the Palestinians submit for
now, but five years from now or 10 years from now, there could be
an eruption,'' says Palestinian legislator Salah Ta'mari, who
fought alongside Arafat in warfare against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the unpaved streets of Dahaisha, frustrated 52-year-old
refugee Yusef Abdel Hafed said a bad peace could prompt an uprising
against Israel and Arafat.,
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will resist that,'' says Abdel Hafed. ``They will
resist everybody.''

DEMOCRATS LOOK FOR WAYS TO COUNTER GOP ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Democrats, facing the overwhelming financial
superiority of the Republicans, have begun an aggressive and
accelerated fund-raising and organizational effort in the hope that
the eventual Democratic presidential nominee can match Republican
spending this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win or lose in November depending on what we do in the
first quarter of this year,'' said Joe Andrew, the national
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which is meeting
here. ``We will have to win on the ground, because they will always
have superior dollars to spend on the air war.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials are operating on the assumption that the
Republicans will raise $250 million to $350 million to support
their party's nominee _ who virtually all Democrats presume will be
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Democrats cannot hope to match that
figure but are expecting to raise and spend between $50 million and
$150 million for this year's campaigns, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders hope to raise a substantial portion of the
total in the first three months of the year, to be prepared for the
long lull between the selection of the party's nominee, which will
almost certainly be completed by the end of March, and the national
convention in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers are courting big donors and hammering traditional
contributors to write their checks early. President Clinton has
promised to attend at least 10 money-raising functions before the
end of March. In just the past week, he has raised more than $2
million at events in Boston, Washington and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Edward G. Rendell, the DNC's general chairman, said in an
interview this week that the party was focusing on three major
groups of donors: established Democratic contributors, those who
have given in the past but dropped out and new donors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest challenges will be to try to corral
contributors to former Sen. Bill Bradley should he fail in his bid
to win the presidential nomination, Rendell said. Rendell, the
former mayor of Philadelphia, said many of Bradley's donors are
Republicans and friends who have not contributed to Democratic
causes before. But he said he hoped to be able to persuade them to
support Vice President Al Gore if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, said that was
unlikely, in part because of the bitterness of the current primary
campaign and in part because those donors are disillusioned with
the Clinton-Gore brand of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair amount of that financial support will not be
transferable,'' Berman said. ``What brought them to Bradley was a
desire for fundamental change in the direction of the last several
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and other officials are in Louisville this weekend to lay
out for the 50 state Democratic chairmen the party's strategy for
prevailing despite the Republicans' money advantage and what most
expect to be a relatively brief and easy nomination battle for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Andrew and other Democratic leaders said, boils down
to two areas where they believe the Democrats can leverage their
strengths into electoral advantage: message and targeting.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic polls and focus groups, as well as impartial surveys,
show a public preference for Democratic approaches to the issues
that concern most voters: education, health care, preservation of
Medicare and Social Security, management of the economy, even crime
and public safety. Those issues come up repeatedly in discussions
with Democratic officials here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win in Kentucky across the board because we're
right on the issues,'' said Nicki Patton, the Kentucky state party
chairwoman. ``Our biggest challenge is going to be to get out the
vote because I know our candidates are fundamentally closer to
where the average working American family is.''
</P>
<P>
   The message will be carried by members of Congress and local
candidates, and by an unusually early advertising campaign directed
at the 17 states that Democrats have identified as in play in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest innovation, and the area where spending is
growing the fastest, is what Andrew calls ``the customized
campaign.'' Since 1996, the national and state parties have been
compiling a computerized database that allows officials to identify
targeted voters by a host of variables, including demographic and
economic data, party affiliation, consumer preferences, religion,
education and likelihood to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The database will contain physical and e-mail addresses and
phone numbers, allowing campaigns alternate ways of reaching
voters. The party has purchased delivery data from the U.S. Postal
Service that maps out the most effective routes for door-to-door
canvassing. It also tracks cable television subscriptions, allowing
targeting of political advertising almost by neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew admits it sounds a bit Big Brotherish, but he insists
that these are merely new tools for doing old-fashioned
shoe-leather campaigning in the digital age.

GROUP OF 7 NATIONS SEEK THEIR OWN PATHS TO A COMMON GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With the exception, perhaps, of the Russians, everyone
came away from the meeting of the financial leaders of the Group of
7 industrialized countries Saturday with something they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   For the Japanese hosts, there was a statement, albeit a muddled
one, of collective concern over the potential negative impact of an
excessively strong yen on the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans conversely managed to keep their currency, the
euro, out of the final communique despite concerns among policy
makers outside Europe that its low value is being used to avoid
taking steps for painful economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Americans, there were pledges from their European
and Japanese counterparts that they would work hard to increase
their role in ensuring global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But, peeking out around the edges of collective good will, there
were reminders that the global economy is nothing more than an
uneasy federation of national interests.
</P>
<P>
   First, it became clear that in spite of an aggressive campaign
by the Germans to promote their deputy finance minister, Caio
Koch-Weser, as the next leader of the International Monetary Fund,
no signs of consensus had emerged. If anything, it seemed the
parties had moved further apart, with the French now considering
offering their own candidate, perhaps Jean-Claude Trichet or a
dark-horse candidate whose name has already surfaced, Laurent
Fabius, a former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans took umbrage at U.S. concerns over the euro, with
ministers from the region and the leader of the European Central
Bank emphatically dismissing suggestions that a weak euro had
created an export-led recovery in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic potential behind the euro is obviously greater
than that of any other currency, including the mark,'' said Hans
Eichel, the German finance minister. ``When people see how Europe
picks up, the euro-dollar relationship will change.''
</P>
<P>
   And Finance Minister Christian Sautter of France in a news
conference drew attention to a reference in the communique to
concerns about the rising level of debt among American households.
</P>
<P>
   Sautter said, ``Every country has its problems,'' and he added
that he thought it was the first time the United States has ever
countenanced any mention of its economic warts in such a document.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, seized an
opportunity to tweak the French when he commended them for taking
Britain's lead in forgiving all of the government-guaranteed debts
owed by several of the world's poorest countries that have agreed
to adopt reforms recommended by the IMF aimed at increasing
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The French said Saturday that they would forgive some 7 billion
francs worth of debts under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
initiative mounted by the Group of 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policy, the
global financial system and other matters, the ministers also
grilled the Russian finance minister on his country's progress in
reforming its economy. Russia is seeking debt forgiveness and a
resumption of a $4.5 billion loan package from the IMF that was put
on hold after the country failed to meet some of the terms. The
ministers offered a lukewarm assessment of Russia's economic
progress, attributing it to ``improved external factors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make it clear that from Germany's standpoint at
least, debt forgiveness is out of the question,'' Eichel said,
adding that further talks will depend on whether Russia introduces
credible, far-reaching reforms.

 &HT;    `Houdini' a well-rounded portrait of the man behind the magic
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If anyone deserves an hourlong
documentary, it's Harry Houdini. Talk about a fascinating and
wonderfully complex character study. Houdini would've been a
psychiatrist's dream patient. As a daring _ some might say
foolhardy _ escape artist, this driven Hungarian immigrant spent
his life cheating death.
</P>
<P>
   He hung upside-down from buildings in a straitjacket. Was
lowered into New York's East River in a crate wrapped in chains,
and locked himself inside milk cans filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   How Houdini became ``The World's Greatest Escape Artist,'' was
never as important as why? ``The American Experience: Houdini''
does a solid, as well as entertaining, job of shedding light on
that question. Through archival footage, Fox-like recreations,
on-camera interviews and Mandy Patinkin's eloquent narration,
``Houdini'' offers a well-rounded portrait _ and much needed
insight _ into this often tortured soul.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the supreme confidence he exhibited while performing,
Houdini was a man haunted by doubts, obsessions and his own
mortality. Much of who this legendary magician became can be traced
to his family life. Growing up with four brothers brought out his
competitive side. Watching his father get fired as a rabbi and
later toil in a grimy New York sweatshop gave him the will to never
fail. His close relationship with his mother filled him with the
desire to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houdini'' takes the ``Dragnet'' approach to storytelling _
just the facts. There's no gorgeous period music or lush
cinematography to complement Houdini's fascinating life story. But
that's OK, since there are enough interesting details and
insightful comments from escape artist David De-Val, biographer
Kenneth Silverman and illusionist David Copperfield to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, did you know that Houdini took icy baths where he
would practice holding his breath? Or that he was fascinated with
mutilations? Or that his ego was so big, he used elaborate
stationery and put his initials on his wallets, pajamas and floor
tiles?
</P>
<P>
   It is Copperfield, though, who sums up Houdini best: ``Everyone
understands the fear of water, the fear of being buried. Houdini
takes all these metaphors that are nightmares and turns them into
something he can escape from.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Houdini will never escape, however, is his legacy of
being one of the greatest showmen the world has seen.

 &HT;    Legendary master of escape was 'a performance junkie'
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ During a recent winter's day in
Portsmouth, N.H., with the mercury climbing to a downright balmy 40
degrees, Demetrius Klein stood nearly naked in the center of town,
chained to a pole. Surrounded by 100 curious onlookers and with a
drum roll as his cue, the Lake Worth dancer started wriggling his
way out of three shackles and two pairs of handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd held its breath. Klein struggled for 15 seconds. And
then _ presto _ he was free.
</P>
<P>
   It was a daredevil of a stunt, the last thing you'd expect from
an artist known for his serious, avant-garde work. Who did Klein
think he was? Harry Houdini?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend at the Kravis Center, Klein and a handful of
collaborators, led by the Lake Worth-based CORE Ensemble, will turn
that stunt into a full-fledged evening of music, dance and theater
with a cutting-edge twist. It's called ``Houdini: Memories of a
Conjurer'' and, rest assured, it's not your typical magic act.
Instead, it's a meditation on the man behind those marvelous
escapes, the showman who mastered the art of public relations and
became a virtual icon.
</P>
<P>
   Klein should know. He got the idea for the stunt in Portsmouth,
where the show was being tested, straight from Houdini. It gave him
a real insight into what made the man tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful feeling,'' Klein says. ``I think this guy
was addicted to the crowds. He was a performance junkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Houdini (1874-1926, real name Erich Weiss), the
Budapest-born son of a failed rabbi, was far more than a magician.
He was the first man to bring his dime-show art to a level higher
than the vaudeville circuit. And he was also the first entertainer
to truly recognize the role of the media: Houdini's career was
based on talent _ there's no simple trick to many of the
death-defying escapes he attempted _ but it was driven by hype.
</P>
<P>
   `CHAMBER MUSIC THEATER'
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a man who found a way to make himself the most famous
person on earth, and once he found it, he did it with a demonic
intensity,'' says Michael Parola, drummer for the Lake Worth-based
CORE Ensemble and producer of the show. But Parola, whose group has
devoted itself to this unique blend of music, drama and spectacle
it dubs ``chamber music theater,'' says that he was determined to
find the person behind the famous facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think of Houdini as a cardboard cutout. There
was the old Tony Curtis movie (``Houdini'') and a lot of stuff like
that,'' Parola explains. ``But he was really quite a complex man.
He wasn't formally educated, but he was quite intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Running 75 minutes and incorporating re-creations of four of
Houdini's famous escapes, ``Houdini: Memories of a Conjurer'' is
probably unlike any theatrical or cinematic treatment of the
magician's life to date. In typical CORE fashion, it's a decidedly
modernist work, blending a score by leading contemporary composer
Judith Shatin, whose music has been performed by the Kronos
Quartet, Houston Symphony and Minnesota Orchestra; a text by Itamar
Kubovy, a director of theaters in Sweden and Germany and a critic
for The New Republic magazine; and the choreography of Klein, a
recipient of grants from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National
Endowment for the Arts. And then there's CORE, the trio composed of
Parola, pianist Hugh Hinton and cellist Raphael Popper-Keizer that
has produced similar multimedia shows on topics ranging from
ecology (``Earth Studies'') to the Harlem Renaissance (``Of Ebony
Embers'').
</P>
<P>
   `TONE POEM'
</P>
<P>
   With such a team in place, Parola knew he wasn't about to stage
a mere diversion. But he was dealing with a popular figure and
didn't want to ignore that fact. ``I was interested in having a
piece that would take a commercial figure and yet it would be seen
as performance art,'' he explains. The significance of Houdini's
fame is reemphasized by Klein. ``To a person, every time I have
mentioned that I'm working on a piece about Houdini, their eyes
light up ... It's like doing a piece about God,'' he says, adding
that ``only Parola could come with the idea of getting it to work
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea, developed in collaboration with the artistic team, is
to turn ``Memories of a Conjurer'' more into a ``tone poem'' on
Houdini. The setting is drawn straight from Houdini's biography:
It's the night before the magician's 1914 return to the stage,
following a 16-month hiatus due to the death of his beloved mother,
Cecilia, the inspiration for much of his career. The rest is
fantasy: The nervous performer can't fall asleep, so he walks over
to the theater, picks the lock (he's Houdini, after all) and makes
his way to the stage. As he runs through the show, he remembers all
that has taken place in his 40 years: his voyage from Hungary to
America as a boy, his early days learning magic tricks at the tie
factory where he worked, his first public triumph when he landed a
job at Coney Island and, finally, his ultimate rise as ``the most
famous man on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   NARRATION IN HOUDINI'S HEAD
</P>
<P>
   The story is told with the broad brush strokes of Kubovy's text,
which is read as the voice inside Houdini's head. To quote one key
passage: ``For me, escape isn't just a call to get attention, an
act of protest, a death-defying challenge to the world. When I
dangle upside down from the roof of your office building, hundreds
of feet in the air, you have to wait with the crowd and look up,
even if it means you will be late. And when someone asks you where
you've been, you say `Houdini, sir, Houdini is out there doing one
of his crazy tricks.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Houdini talks _ the voice is supplied by a narrator on
tape _ Klein performs. The movement bears only a faint resemblance
to the choreographer's typically brash, elliptical style. It's more
an artful expansion on Houdini's stage show, with Klein doing
dramatic takes on the familiar escapes, freeing himself from
chains, ropes and straitjackets. ``I didn't want it to have the
Demetrius Klein shtick,'' he says, noting that he started a
weightlifting regimen to bulk himself up for the role. ``If this
starts looking and smelling like a dance concert, something is
desperately wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, composer Judith Shatin added a new element to her
classical-based style, weaving in bits of jazz and popular music _
including Houdini's favorite song, ``Auld Lang Syne'' _ to give the
score a circuslike resonance. ``I thought musically it would take
me to some places I haven't been to before,'' she explains. ``Not
just to create music that would really interact with the text, but
to create set pieces that would be inspired by and reflect aspects
of the escape act.''
</P>
<P>
   COLLABORATORS INSPIRE THEME
</P>
<P>
   But why Houdini _ and why now? Although there have been some
recent TV movies and documentaries and a book by Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer Kenneth Silverman, there's nothing to suggest
a Houdini resurgence. Parola says he was fishing for a subject as
he was nearing completion of his last project, the Central
American-inspired ``El Mozote'' which premiered in early 1999. He
knew he wanted to collaborate with Shatin and Kubovy; Shatin knew
she wanted to do something with a Jewish theme or subject. That led
Kubovy to suggest Houdini, whose Jewish roots figure in the piece
in a small way.
</P>
<P>
   As for Klein, he entered the picture when Parola was driving by
the dancer's studio one day. ``I said, `Wait a minute, why not have
Houdini portrayed by a dancer and show these great escape things as
movement?''' Parola recalls. Klein was initially skeptical _ ``I
thought he was off his rocker'' _ but eventually came around.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the collaborators talk of a larger message to the piece,
although it's there for anyone who wants to find it. ``There was a
wonderful sense that he (Houdini) had about wanting to break free
of the normal human confines,'' says Matthew Wright, a Florida
Atlantic University theater professor who's directing the show. He
views the work's theme as magic as a liberating force, a bridge to
a higher plane. Yet at the same time, Houdini was very much tied to
the here and now _ and that perhaps explains why the piece pays
close attention to his relationship with his mother. ``He was a
classic mama's boy,'' says Parola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houdini: Memories of a Conjurer'' has cost $80,000 to produce,
most of which comes courtesy of a Florida state grant and private
donors. But Parola put up the rest himself (or as he delicately
puts it, ``This is one we're doing a little more internally''). In
a way, it's a good investment. As with all CORE productions, he
hopes to tour it around the country. But unlike previous efforts by
the ensemble, this has a little more audience appeal. The Kravis
has nearly sold out both performances of ``Houdini,'' where it's
being featured in the center's ``On the Edge'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' says an incredulous Lee Bell, Kravis
programming chief. ``It's been the fastest sell of any of the 'On
the Edge' events. I was quite shocked to see how it ran out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   NO DISAPPEARING ELEPHANTS
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that Parola doesn't want presenters to
buy into the piece thinking they're getting something along the
lines of David Copperfield. ``I don't like to mislead people,'' he
says frankly. ``The escapes are there, the stunts are there, but
we're not trying to make elephants disappear on stage. There are
other elements at play.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, one of the first theaters to book the work _ after
the New Hampshire and Kravis premieres _ is in Las Vegas. All
right, it's the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, a serious
cultural presenter, but the irony isn't lost on Parola. Still, he
hopes to take the high road when it comes to his concept of
Houdini.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our supporters said we should really get this thing on
a hotel on the strip, but they already have something there called
Siegfried and Roy. We can't out-Vegas Vegas.''

 &HT;    Clinton's last State of the Union chance at redemption in
historical record
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It's loosely mandated in Article II,
Section III of the Constitution: The President ``shall from time to
time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union,
and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall
judge necessary and expedient.''
</P>
<P>
   From that phrase have sprung more than 200 annual presidential
messages to Congress, some passionate, some calm, each unique to
the president delivering it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Civil War stormed, Abraham Lincoln used it to propose
freedom for slaves. John F. Kennedy outlined plans for the Peace
Corps and Ronald Reagan apologized for the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's State of the Union address Thursday will be the
last of his presidency and the first of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   It will be, some say, one of his last opportunities to set his
place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may very well be his most eloquent,'' said Gary Nordlinger,
a Washington, D.C., political analyst and campaign consultant.
``Probably his first would be his most significant, but I think
this may be his most eloquent. I think the guy really does want to
seem more of a statesman and less as an operative, so he may take
the opportunity to try to put a historic slant on the things his
administration has accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with several decades' tradition of presidents
recapping the accomplishments of their administrations before
Congress, Clinton may reiterate the accomplishments he outlined in
his 1999 address when he said, ``Tonight, I stand before you to
report that America has created the longest peacetime economic
expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages
rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest home
ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and
the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced.
From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70
billion last year. And now we are on course for budget surpluses
for the next 25 years. Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all
of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century
and the cleanest environment in a quarter century. America is a
strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor of Campaigns and Elections magazine, said
he thinks Clinton's message will be similar to his 1999 message,
attempting ``to show how the policies he has pursued in the last
seven years have related to these good news statistical
indicators.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordlinger said he also believes that in his address Thursday,
Clinton may challenge Congress to take an activist role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he's trying to do is set up Congress so Democrats
can accuse them of being a do-nothing Congress,'' Nordlinger said.
``What voters don't want to see is feuding and gridlock like we did
last year. The more Clinton can up the ante of things he wants them
to work on this year, the better a partisan positioning he puts the
Democratic Party in.''
</P>
<P>
   Faucheux said he thinks this will be Clinton's last attempt at
redemption ``and I think he would see redemption as people saying
he was president for eight years and he did a good job. I think
that will be his message.''
</P>
<P>
   History will be by Clinton's side, transcribing every word to
add to the canon that began with the nation's first president.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, 1790, George Washington delivered the first annual
``message of the president'' to members of Congress at Federal Hall
in New York City. In the message he congratulated the congressmen
on ``the present favorable prospects of our public affairs,'' noted
the recent addition of North Carolina to the Union and emphasized
the need for a strong military, uniform currency and education.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams continued the tradition of an annual speech before
both houses of Congress, but Thomas Jefferson scorned the yearly
event as a ``speech from the throne,'' alluding to his disdain for
the country's royal past, and in 1801 began writing an annual State
of the Union letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson revived the practice of
delivering an annual speech, U.S. presidents wrote yearly letters
to Congress. In his 1823 written message, James Monroe outlined his
ideas about U.S. foreign policy, including his opposition to
European intervention in the Americas that became the Monroe
Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1862, while the Civil War was ripping the nation apart,
Abraham Lincoln wrote what is considered one of the most eloquent
presidential messages in American history. In asking Congress to
consider emancipation for slaves he wrote, ``Fellow-citizens, we
cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration,
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance,
or insignificance, can spare one or another of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the
Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to
save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We _
even we here _ hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In
giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free _
honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woodrow Wilson decided to deliver his State of the Union
address to Congress in person, the annual event took the form it
has today. Standing before a joint session of Congress, members of
the Supreme Court and the Cabinet, Wilson gave a fiery speech
calling for, among other things, tariff reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, with World War II raging, Franklin Roosevelt called for
what would become the Selective Service and assured the nation that
Allied forces would be victorious in the fight for freedom. Four
months later, Harry Truman picked up Roosevelt's torch in his first
State of the Union address, saying, ``So that there can be no
possible misunderstanding, both Germany and Japan can be certain,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, that America will continue to fight for
freedom until no vestige of resistance remains!''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the president's annual speech formally became
known as the State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Lyndon Johnson moved the speech from midday to evening
to attract a bigger television audience. During his speech that
year, Johnson assured the country that the peace of southeast Asia
was tied to peace in the United States, explaining the increasing
number of U.S. soldiers being sent to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout U.S. history, presidents have used the State of the
Union address as a bully pulpit to champion favored causes to a
large audience, especially with the advent of television when
millions, instead of the hundreds of members of Congress, were
listening. It became a forum in which the president could rejoice
and suffer with the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 address, which had been postponed for the first time
in history due to the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger,
Ronald Reagan began by saying, ``We paused together to mourn and
honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes. And I hope that we
are now ready to do what they would want us to do _ go forward
America and reach for the stars. We will never forget those brave
seven, but we shall go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton brought another historical first to the State of
the Union message last year, being the first president to address a
Congress considering his removal from office. But making no mention
of the impeachment hearings, Clinton asked Congress to shore up the
future of Social Security, bolster military preparation, reduce
violence against children and work toward meeting Americans'
long-term health care needs.

 &HT;    Georgia delegation prepares for election year
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's an adage on Capitol Hill: A presidential
election year produces a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to Georgia's congressional delegation. The
nine Republicans in the 13-member delegation are out to prove that
this will be a do-something Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And they have a very good reason for making that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control the House by a slim 222 to 212 margin, plus
one independent who usually votes Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that concern is the number of GOP lawmakers who are
retiring at the end of the 106th Congress. Republicans have 22 open
seats compared with six for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That bodes well for House Democrats since it is considered
easier to win an open seat than defeat an incumbent. The last time
the Democrats had such a large edge was in 1958 and they picked up
half of the open seats in that election.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, congressional Republicans are hoping to adopt
a legislative agenda for the coming year that will sell well both
on the congressional and presidential campaign trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly in the interest of the Republicans to do
something,'' said William Connelly Jr., professor of politics at
Washington and Lee University in Virginia. ``The Republicans are
going to feel pressure to accomplish something and the Democrats
are going to hold their feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Republicans are going to hold onto the House, they
had better start acting in a hurry, said Merle Black, professor of
political science at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are caught in a bind between arguing for tax
cuts and not presenting any new programs,'' Black said. Meanwhile,
the Democratic Party has an outgoing president who is proposing a
slew of programs to mark his legacy. Every Democrat benefits
because the president looks like he's offering ``free goods,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), a member of the Senate leadership,
said that the coming year would be marked by targeting tax cuts,
improving trade relations, securing prescription benefits for
Medicare beneficiaries and improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a large impact on what the public is thinking
about,'' said Coverdell, the Republican Conference Secretary. ``The
core work areas of Congress will be vigorously pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) is less optimistic that Congress
will accomplish much when it returns Thursday to hear President
Clinton's State of the Union Address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything substantial will be done,'' Cleland
said. ``It's all about election day 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress should be strengthening Social Security, increasing the
number of teachers in schools and holding bipartisan forums about
troop deployment, said Cleland. Instead, he predicts, a partisan
bloodbath will mark the congressional year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland is echoed by Georgia's Democrats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), as a chief deputy whip, is gearing up
for the battle to take back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Congress to send the president legislation overhauling
the nation's managed care industry, and he wants the House to vote
on his legislation that would provide more health care access to
minorities. He also wants a bill that would address gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being realistic, this is an election year and a
presidential year and I just don't see us accomplishing much,''
Lewis said. ``That's unfortunate. We should be starting this decade
and century with a new spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), whose district includes Lockheed Martin
Corp., said he would redouble efforts to win support for funding
the F-22 fighter jet. He said he would also fend off legislative
attempts to regulate guns.
</P>
<P>
   If little is accomplished this year, Barr said it would be the
fault of the Democrats. ``They want this to be a do-nothing
Congress,'' he said. ``Everything will be colored by their position
of trying to win back control of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), a member of the House National
Security Committee, said military spending would be a top priority
as would agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss plans to work with Coverdell and Rep. Sanford Bishop
(D-Ga.), to get the Senate to pass a House bill that would overhaul
the nation's crop insurance program. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) said
he would travel the country to garner support for tax reform. He is
also planning to introduce a bill that would change the way
campaigns raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, the House conference chairman during Newt Gingrich's
tenure as speaker, said that the Republicans who were elected in
the 1994 Republican Revolution have learned some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Class of 1994 learned that we couldn't get everything done
tomorrow,'' Linder said. And despite the criticism of the way the
party has handled the majority, Linder said, the country is far
more prosperous now than it was before the GOP takeover in 1994.
Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) said she would focus her attention on
human rights both across the nation and abroad. ``We want to make
sure we don't give our weapons as we have in the past to such
dictators as Saddam Hussein,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), a member of the
House Education and the Workforce Committee, said he intends to
make improving the quality of education a focal point in the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue streamlining the flow of money out of
Washington and get it right back to the classroom,'' Isakson said.

 &HT;    Iowa caucuses first stop on presidential trail
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Jimmy Carter might never have been president
without the help of Iowa voters in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's showing in the Hawkeye State transformed him almost
overnight from a little known Georgia governor into a national
contender for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Carter broke out from the pack by winning one of the enduring
oddities of the modern presidential campaign: Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   A fixture of the presidential circuit since 1972, the caucuses
take center stage in the 2000 presidential campaign for a few brief
hours Monday on what is expected to be a clear and cold January
night.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen states still use caucuses as a method of
choosing party nominees. The majority of voters in the country vote
in primaries, similar to general elections, where voters cast
ballots in the privacy of polling booths.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses are a different kettle of fish. Votes are cast
in open meetings, either by a show of hands, paper ballot or by
participants grouping themselves in corners of a room.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus itself lasts up to several hours, beginning at 7 p.m.
Each of Iowa's 2,142 precincts holds a separate caucus for
Democratic candidates and another for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Each party has its own method of voting. The Republicans vote by
paper ballot after 30 to 45 minutes of discussion. The results are
essentially equivalent to a straw poll, and as such are a fairly
accurate measure of a candidate's support.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats do things a little differently. In a Democratic
caucus, voters separate into groups according to the candidates
they are supporting. If a candidate fails to get at least 15
percent of those who have shown up, he is declared ``nonviable''
and won't be entitled to any of the delegates pre-apportioned to
each precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters who show up may declare themselves uncommitted, in
which case supporters from other candidates attempt to persuade
them to join their corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of negotiating,'' said Art Sanders, a
political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines. ``It tends
to be more intense on the Democratic side.''
</P>
<P>
   The precinct caucuses are only the first in a series, and their
results are not binding, though elected delegates usually follow
the wishes of the caucus voters.
</P>
<P>
   Precinct delegates attend county caucuses to choose county
delegates. County delegates go to a state convention to choose
delegates that go on to the two national party conventions in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus process rewards candidates who are well organized,
Sanders said. ``You have to get all of your people to all of these
precincts at 7 p.m. on a Monday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said there are two major flaws with the caucus system.
Turnout tends to be much lower in caucuses than in primaries.
Optimistic estimates call for only 10 percent of Iowa's 1.9 million
registered voters to attend a caucus Monday night. Sanders said the
turnout will likely be even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike showing up at a polling place to cast a secret ballot,
attending a caucus requires a time commitment of at least an hour
and frequently more. It draws only the most committed voters.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout contributes to the second failing of caucuses,
Sanders said. ``A small turnout allows any highly motivated, well
organized group to have disproportionate influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That disproportionate influence then gets magnified because so
much media attention is focused on the Iowa caucus results. In past
years, caucuses have allowed little known candidates to leap to the
front of the field, like Carter did in 1976 by finishing ahead of
everyone except ``undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, evangelist Pat Robertson placed second ahead of George
Bush in the Iowa caucuses. The showing energized Christian
conservative voters around the country, who ended up with a sizable
representation at the 1988 Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It maintains its role and importance because its first,''
Sanders said. ``If Iowa wasn't first it wouldn't get any
attention.''

 &HT;    Iowa firing the starter's pistol
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ There's an Iowa of hot-rodding kids in
oversize pickup trucks, of ads for triple-X video stores on small
town TV stations, of casinos packed with coin-laden retirees and
carnicerias filled with Spanish-speaking customers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the more celebrated Iowa, whose solid
citizen-representatives will make their way through the cold Monday
night _ perhaps occasionally expressing irritation as the other
Iowa zips past them on the highway _ toward the Democratic and
Republican caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It is a generally older, more homogeneous, upstanding crowd that
will turn out in libraries and recreation rooms around the state to
wave the starting flag for the fast-paced 2000 presidential
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my civics in high school right to heart,'' said Doris
Wohlenhaus, a retiree who'd driven from the western Iowa town of
Lewis up to Atlantic on a recent Sunday afternoon to hear Steve
Forbes speak in a school gym.
</P>
<P>
   The record doesn't show Iowa's time-consuming, complicated
caucuses to be a very good barometer of whom either party has gone
on to nominate. This year the political pulse has been stronger in
New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primaries Feb. 1
and has more competitive races than Iowa in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the sturdy farm couples, college professors and well-read
police officers who are the staples of caucus night have held their
ground on the political stage. Iowa accomplished this in part with
all the hoopla over last summer's Republican straw poll and, most
importantly, by moving up the caucus date 12 days to remain the
first state in the country to vote for their parties' nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Being first again ensures the lavish attention of candidates,
with the key exception of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who chose to
focus his resources on New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runners, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, each hold commanding leads in pre-caucus polls. A Research
2000 poll conducted in the final week for two Iowa television
stations had Gore leading Bill Bradley 56 percent to 32 percent,
while Bush had 46 percent to 23 percent for his closest challenger,
Steve Forbes. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable nature of the caucus process _ in which voters
can be swayed by last-minute appeals from neighbors _ and the
impact it could have on who goes on from here adds interest to
Monday's outcome, however.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate with something to lose in Iowa is Bradley, the
former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the campaign preliminaries, Bradley's
campaign has been thriftier and his fund-raising efforts
surprisingly more effective than the vice president's. That trend
has been reversed in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has visited the state more than 30 times and sunk more
than $1.6 million in television ads, a significantly greater
commitment than Gore. If he comes unexpectedly close to Gore, he
will have paid for it. If Gore maintains a double-digit lead, the
loss could deflate enthusiasm for Bradley heading into the New
Hampshire vote the next week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, a lot depends on a few percentage points and whatever
comes out of his mouth in the video clip that will air on New
Hampshire television Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has the support of most elected Democratic
officials and the AFL-CIO, although the Teamsters and United Auto
Workers, angry with the Clinton administration over free trade, are
sitting out caucus night.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the narrowest bandwidth his campaign will pass
through, and even a slight slip from expectations could have larger
reverberations for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shares similar concerns in the Republican race. He won a
convincing victory over a larger field in last summer's straw poll,
and recent surveys indicate he could better Bob Dole's record 37
percent by several points. That builds high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives play a larger role in Iowa's Republican
politics than in New Hampshire, but in this year's field they have
a large number of choices. Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes place special
reliance on church-related networks, and Mormons have one of their
own in Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of the campaign it has been conservative
publisher Steve Forbes, however, who appears to be consolidating
strength among religious and social conservatives with a barrage of
ads, restating his opposition to abortion and complimenting his
character.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rest, Bauer is probably the candidate who most needs a
third-place finish to remain viable. Hatch is likely to be bowing
out after Monday anyway, and Keyes, with a shoestring campaign, can
continue running no matter where he finishes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's absence will put to a test some of the conventional
wisdom about Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses are widely thought of as an early test of each
campaign's field operation, proving who can round up volunteers in
each precinct and organize carpools to caucus sites. The way to win
Iowans over, it's widely thought, is to present farm-friendly
policies such as support for ethanol, the corn-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's opposition to ethanol subsidies was one factor in his
decision not to show up for the Iowa ground war. Yet polls show
McCain gaining some ground. A finish of even 10 percent or better
might call into question whether retail politics and a
farm-sensitive platform matter as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are a lot fewer family farmers in Iowa this year
than there were in 1976, when Jimmy Carter slogged through the
barnyards on his way to a surprising second-place finish, behind
``undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   Hog and corn prices are disastrous, but much of the state is
more prosperous than it was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux City looks like a bustling farm town of decades ago, but
its prosperity is actually buoyed by Gateway Computers,
headquartered across the Missouri River in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ross, a retired political science professor at the
University of Iowa who has observed state politics for many years,
said the average age of those who turn out Monday night will
probably be 50 to 55. Like many Iowans, he worries that the young
aren't taking as much interest in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is so good ... they are just not as interested in
the future. For them, the future is now,'' Ross said.

 &HT;    Online learning helps some keep up with the curve
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Don Miller needed to learn a complex computer
operating system called UNIX and the computer language of Java
Script, he simply logged onto his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenient because I can do this in the evening,'' said
Miller, a technical writer who works on contract assignment through
Matrix Resources, a staffing firm. He has used computer-based
training, known in the industry as CBT, a couple of times in the
past year to update or add sought-after skills.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid changes in technology have forced workers like Miller to
update their skills continually to meet employer demands.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, more workers are opting for self-taught,
computer-based learning.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based training accounted for $1.5 billion of the $18
billion information technology training market in 1997, according
to IDC, a research firm. By 2002, that figure is expected to grow
to $7.2 billion. Computer-based training via the Internet is
expected to be the fastest-growing segment of that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' says Mac Mendelsohn, vice president for product
development in the IT corporate learning division of Cambridge,
Mass.-based Course Technology, a unit of Thomson Learning.
</P>
<P>
   Online training is an attractive option for time-pressed workers
because traditional classroom training can be time-consuming and
costly. A day of instructor-led training can run from $150 for
basic office skills up to $2,000 for higher-end IT courses such as
AS400 or networking, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a contractor, so time is money. If I were to take time
off, it would be expensive,'' said Miller, 49.
</P>
<P>
   He can take the courses at his leisure. ``I would lose several
hundred dollars if I took classes the traditional way in a
classroom setting. This is free. One of the ways you can protect
your career, in a sense, is to keep your skills current.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based training has also become a way for novices to
break into the high-tech field while still working at their current
jobs, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But experts caution that CBT is just one training option for
workers. While convenient, it can't replace the interactive
relationship found in a classroom setting. In fact, Mendelsohn
says, one criticism leveled at online learning is that some of the
programs are dull and not very interactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People learn in different ways. Some want to sit in a
classroom and learn. Others want to do it on their own time. Still
others want to learn by books,'' Mendelsohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the ongoing worker shortage, CBT has become a
good recruiting tool and a way for companies like Matrix Resources
to distinguish themselves in the competition for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix offers computer-based training free to its contract
workers. Matrix contractors are able to log onto a
assword-protected site any time and anywhere. ``Most clients today
do not want to pay for contractor training. They hire contractors
for their technical knowledge and ability to hit the ground
running,'' said Alan Sleeper, an account manager at Matrix.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers 180 courses, divided into subject areas
ranging from supporting computer operating systems to learning
advanced applications such as SAP, a hot area within information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works at Matrix: A contractor goes online to
Matrix's Web site and selects a course from its training section.
He or she then downloads the course to a home computer. Once it's
on the home computer, the trainee can use the course as often as
desired at his or her own speed. Skills tests determine how well
the trainee is doing, Sleeper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had literally hundreds of people taking the courses,''
he said. ``It's a great recruiting tool. It helps us attract new
consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   The online training market, which has just emerged in the past
five years, has become so big, in fact, that 40 percent of the 450
exhibitors at next month's Training 2000 Conference and Expo are
companies that produce online training software and materials,
conference spokesman Tom Reidy said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest business and adult learning expos in the
nation, the conference will be at the Georgia World Congress Center
Feb. 21-23. It is expected to draw thousands of training managers
and executives, instructional developers, classroom and online
trainers, performance consultants, information technology experts,
human resources and organizational development professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is not open to the public but is open to training
professionals. Information is available online at
www.training2000.com.

are a few training sites online to help you get started. Some of
the sites carry a fee and have links to even more information
online.

 &HT;    Bush, McCain take gloves off
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leading Republican presidential candidates
dropped the smiles and handshakes and went after each other last
week where it counts most _ on New Hampshire television.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush began the ad war by complaining that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax plan contains $40 billion in higher
taxes for ``working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, McCain countered in his own ad, which, more
significantly, hit Bush on the character issue. ``I guess it was
bound to happen. Now my opponent has started the political attacks
after promising he wouldn't,'' McCain says in an ad that was shot
the day Bush's hit the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   McCain maintains that ``there is no tax increase'' in his plan,
although campaign aides acknowledged that businesses would face
higher taxes as a result of the end of some business tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain campaign officials unveiled their ad Friday, Bush
fired back that McCain was the first to use negative advertising
and denied that his own ad could be characterized that way. He said
McCain had resorted to ``one of the old, tired political tricks''
to divert attention from shortcomings in his tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring between McCain and Bush is a product of the potency
of the tax issue in New Hampshire and the proximity of the primary,
set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax proposal is half as large as Bush's, but McCain
believes he has found a winning formula by devoting the bulk of
non-Social Security budget surpluses to shoring up the retirement
program and using the rest for Medicare, tax cuts and debt
reduction. Bush's plan spends all that money on tax cuts. Both
candidates would guarantee that surpluses in the Social Security
trust fund go to the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the tax issue, McCain aides relished the opportunity
to strike at Bush as a promise breaker. They presented a chronology
of Bush ads and comments in which he pledged to run a positive
campaign, including his handshake agreement with McCain at a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain uses his commercial, running on New Hampshire television
and on Boston stations that reach southern New Hampshire, to remind
viewers of his promise. ``When I began this campaign, I promised
you something better, that I wouldn't engage in attack politics.
I'm keeping my pledge,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That same line draws sustained applause at rallies in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his ad, says it is not negative campaigning to talk
about differences. ``If he says something I don't agree with, I'm
going to point it out,'' Bush says, never naming McCain in his
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ODD MAN OUT, MCCAIN KEEPING EYE ON PRIMARY
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the only candidate who will not be in Iowa for
Monday's caucuses. His name is on the ballot there, but the McCain
campaign decided for strategic reasons to bypass Iowa's
conservative, activist-dominated caucus for the living rooms and
town halls of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will have New Hampshire all to himself today and Monday,
while everyone else competes in the Iowa caucuses. But come
Tuesday, candidates will blitz the state for the last week of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms in Manchester, the largest city, were booked so long
ago by media that several campaigns, including McCain's, took rooms
in hotels out of town.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE NOT TRUSTY BAROMETERS
</P>
<P>
   Over eight days, voters in two small states with a remarkable
lack of diversity in their populations will set the tone for the
nominating process. Iowa is nearly 97 percent white and 40 percent
rural, according to the Almanac of American Politics. New
Hampshire's population is 98 percent white and 49 percent rural.
</P>
<P>
   California, New York and Ohio, the three largest states to hold
primaries March 7, have very different demographic profiles.
</P>
<P>
   California's population is 69 percent white, 7 percent black, 10
percent Asian, 25 percent Hispanic and 7 percent rural. New York is
75 percent white, 16 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic and 16
percent rural. Ohio is 88 percent white, 11 percent black and 26
percent rural.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the sway of the ``first in the nation'' states
is overstated. In 1988, the first- and second-place finishers in
the Democratic and Republican caucuses did not win their party's
nomination. In 1992, Bill Clinton won the presidency, but he didn't
win either the Iowa caucus or the New Hampshire primary. Four years
ago, Pat Buchanan won New Hampshire's Republican primary, but Bob
Dole was the GOP nominee.

 &HT;    Public speaking doesn't have to hurt
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ For some, it's a fate worse than death,
five to 15 minutes of utter, abject agony.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's cause for tortured, frantic thoughts:
``Everybody's looking at me. Everybody's looking at me and I sound
like a moron. And I'm talking too fast. So I might as well be
standing here naked, as comfortable as I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Public speaking, for a lot of people, is punishment. But it
doesn't have to be, said Marian Woodall, an Oregon-based
communications consultant and author of ``Speaking to a Group:
Mastering the Skill of Public Speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most people won't, in their lifetimes, be professional
speakers or give speeches of the magnitude of a presidential State
of the Union address, the skills required for effective public
speaking may seem foreign or unattainable, and the accompanying
nervousness unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodall said there are a few simple ways to make public
speaking easier:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Preparation,'' she said. ``That's the first thing. If you're
confident that you're prepared and your material is appropriate for
the audience, you'll feel 70 percent more comfortable. The people
who try to wing it are the ones who get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said preparation assures good content and confidence. In her
work as a corporate communications consultant, Woodall said she
recommends her clients create notes or an outline, which can help
jog a speaker's memory if he or she gets nervous.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan the first sentence or two of the speech ``so you hit the
ground running; get their attention,'' Woodall said. ``And there
are lots of ways to get attention: Challenge them with a statement,
give them a statistic, ask them a question, draw them in with
something strong and related to the subject or related to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And write it out carefully. Practice it so you can deliver it
really well, pause, then proceed to talk about whatever you're
going to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The old adage about starting a speech with a joke is wrong, she
said, because ``jokes depend for their humor on making fun of
somebody, and very seldom can you find a joke which doesn't insult
somebody in the audience. And even if you happen to have a joke
that doesn't insult somebody, then what are you going to say? `But
seriously, folks'?''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes may work in the body of the speech, she said, but never
for an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Warm up before giving the speech. Doing some stretching and
vocal exercises will help the body, tongue and facial muscles feel
limber and more relaxed ``and increase your ability to express
yourself in a lively, dynamic sort of way,'' Woodall said. ``You
can't be tense if you're flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If time permits, walk around the room and meet people before
giving the speech. This breaks down the speaker/audience barrier,
so the person giving a speech can think of the people he or she met
beforehand and talk to them as individuals, rather than speaking to
one big audience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignore that old saying about picturing the audience in their
underwear as a way to relax while giving a speech _ ``it's stupid
and distracting,'' Woodall said. ``And it isn't in any way helpful
or appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should think instead that here are some people who like me
or will like me, who want me to do a good job. Most audiences want
to help you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three years after the Taliban took control of
most of Afghanistan and introduced a harsh and unforgiving Islamic
piety that all but obliterated women from public life, relief and
development experts say that months of quiet negotiation with
Taliban leaders are beginning to dent the prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Erick de Mul, coordinator of U.N. relief programs in
Afghanistan, said in an interview last week that it might be time
to begin adjusting the picture of Afghanistan under the Taliban,
which he said had brought peace to much of a country battered by
civil war _ but then had no program to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as black and white as it's often depicted,'' said de
Mul, who was in New York for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As de Mul, who is Dutch, talked about the small advances that
the United Nations and a host of relief agencies were making in
Afghanistan, the new picture that emerged was of a strongly
absolutist movement hitting the wall of daily reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mounting pressure from the population itself,'' said
de Mul, who accepts that the Taliban were first welcomed by
Afghans, who had had enough of corrupt and violent rule by the
mujahedeen, the Muslim warriors who drove out Soviet troops in the
1980s. ``People are expecting more than peace and security. `We
want to have a better future for our children,' they say. `We want
to have possibilities to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers and the Taliban have together learned a valuable
lesson in recent years, de Mul said. When talks break down, he
said, ``we go to this point and say, OK, let's leave it for a while
and discuss it later on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very slow, and many, many times inconclusive, but the
important thing is that there is a dialogue, and increasingly it is
possible to call a spade a spade _ to go more directly to the
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools for girls are opening, some officially and many others
privately in homes, de Mul said. In recent months, he added,
Taliban authorities have not enforced an edict prohibiting foreign
Muslim women from going out in public without a close male
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts have tried to assign Muslims from other countries to
work with Afghans because of their sensitivity to the tenets of
Islam and because they offer an alternative model of Islamic
womanhood, most immediately to the Afghan co-workers. But
foreigners know that pushing too hard is counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demanding changes in law is not working yet,'' he said. ``So
the other thing is to create realities that become so strong that
eventually the reality will determine the legal framework.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not a policy supported by most human rights groups or the
Clinton administration, which has imposed sanctions on Afghanistan
because of its support for terrorism and its violations of women's
rights. The United States does not allow Americans to be assigned
there by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program _ headed by an American woman,
Catherine Bertini, who is based in Rome _ has made large strides in
bringing women into the work force in Afghanistan, de Mul said.
``WFP is pushing the right agenda in an intelligent way _ with a
lot of results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jalalabad, an eastern Afghan city near Pakistan, the closing
of smugglers' routes that brought in subsidized Pakistani wheat
created a food crisis recently. The World Food Program, with access
to donated wheat, decided to open bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to do that, we said, OK, we have to send
people out to make a survey of households,'' de Mul said. ``We said
we want to have 50 percent male and 50 percent female surveyors,
otherwise there is not going to be a bakery project. This took
about two weeks of them saying, `No, it can be done by men; there
is no need for women.' In two weeks they came around and said,
`That's fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   De Mul said that even in Kandahar, a bastion of orthodoxy and
the headquarters of the Taliban's leader, Emir Muhammad Omar,
changes are noticeable, in part because of a good provincial
governor, Mullah Hassan, who is both a devout Muslim and an
administrator in tune with popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In Kandahar province, the United Nations and private agencies
are training health workers, opening schools for girls and boys and
helping local councils known as shuras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago there was a meeting of a number of the shuras
of the southern region in Kandahar,'' de Mul said. ``It was a
three-day event where representatives of all these community
organizations came together. The Taliban authorities were invited.
The governor of Kandahar opened it.'' The meeting ended with a
statement of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority was education, and education for girls and
boys,'' de Mul said. ``Second, they wanted to have more and
better-trained traditional birth assistants, midwives. Third, they
wanted to have increased possibilities for women to be gainfully
employed, especially widows.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you take the three priorities, and almost all refer to
women. But all the representatives at the meeting were men.''

RELIGIOUS LEADERS LOOK TO BUSH TO KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gov. George W. Bush said in a debate among Republican
presidential hopefuls that Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, it stunned some viewers and media commentators but
came as no surprise to the people who knew him, including some
leading conservative religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's belief in Jesus Christ, far from mere political
posturing, is both a central pillar of his life and critical to his
vision for the nation and the way he would govern, the religious
leaders and Bush himself say. The governor's frequent campaign
refrain that ``Faith changes lives'' is not only a personal
confession but a political platform.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has supported a Christian prison
program that uses prayer and Bible study to help rehabilitate
inmates, something he has said should be done nationally. As
president, Bush says, he would ``look first'' to religious
organizations of various faiths, rather than government or secular
agencies, to attack poverty, homelessness and addiction. He has
also said he would not require religious programs to censor their
spiritual teachings to get government aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that God has a place in government, that religion
has a place in society, and it is not to be marginalized and put on
the periphery as though it is some sort of extra,'' said the Rev.
Tony Evans, senior pastor of the Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in
Dallas and a nationally known evangelist who prays with Bush.
``There is no America without a theistic world view.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Bush's Republican rivals, Steve Forbes, Gary L. Bauer
and Alan Keyes, have courted Christian conservatives whose votes
may be decisive in the Iowa caucuses on Monday. And next to that
trio, Bush has appeared more moderate by focusing less on issues
like abortion and homosexuality. But behind the scenes, some of the
nation's most prominent Christian conservatives are supporters,
friends and advisers of Bush. They say they are confident he will
promote their agenda on abortion and ``family values,'' as well as
church-state issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who once led the Moral Majority, says he
has informed his network of politically active pastors that Bush is
his choice. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, is
praising Bush at events. Ralph Reed, once the youthful face of the
Christian Coalition, is now a consultant who counts Bush among his
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. would make an awesome president,'' Falwell said in
an interview. ``I more than any other churchman in the country
would know the pulse of evangelical Christianity, and I would say
that George Bush will overwhelmingly be supported by this
clientele,'' he said, ``much like Ronald Reagan was in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   A Methodist who grew up in Bible-belt Texas, Bush speaks more
fervently in public about his faith than did his father, former
President Bush, an Episcopal Yankee from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear George W. Bush talk about his faith, he talks
about it in ways that evangelicals resonate with,'' said one
leading Southern Baptist Bush has befriended, Richard Land,
president of the denomination's Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission. ``His father does not. His father is an Eastern
establishment Episcopalian. George W. Bush may have been born in
Connecticut but he was reared in Midland, Texas, which is not
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no reflection on President Bush's faith,'' Land said,
``but in the social and cultural milieu in which President Bush
grew up, it was considered bad manners to talk about your faith in
public. It just wasn't done. In the social and cultural milieu in
which George W. grew up, it is as natural as breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, several religious leaders said that while Bush had
told them that it was not possible to pass a constitutional
amendment banning abortion, he assured them that he would do what
he could to end abortion except in cases of rape or incest or when
the life of the mother was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That position will stop 99 percent of the abortions in
America, and I would be thrilled to see a 99 percent improvement
over what we have right now,'' said the Rev. John C. Hagee, an
evangelist and a prolific author of books like ``From Daniel to
Doomsday: The Countdown has Begun'' (Thomas Nelson, 1999). Hagee
said he had been personally telephoning state Republican leaders to
persuade them to support Bush. For his part, Bush, after weighing a
request for an in-depth interview on his religious views and the
role of faith in public policy, granted a brief telephone interview
en route to an airport in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion to me is a very personal matter, and I just happen to
be in a public position where people want to have a chance to find
out something about me, and I think this'' _ his commitment to
Jesus Christ, he said _ ``is one of the defining moments of my
life. But I do so understanding that I am a lowly sinner as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he read a Bible passage daily, even on the campaign
trail. Asked if he believed the Bible was literally true, word for
word, and an infallible guide to history and science, he said,
``From Scripture you can gain a lot of strength and solace and
learn life's lessons. That's what I believe, and I don't
necessarily believe every single word is literally true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for example on the issue of evolution, the
verdict is still out on how God created the earth,'' he said, a
cautious response that would be acceptable to some creationists yet
separates Bush from the biblical fundamentalists. ``I don't use the
Bible as necessarily a way to predict the findings of science.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   George Walker Bush had a religious upbringing that is best
described as ecumenical. His father was an Episcopalian, his mother
a Presbyterian. George W., the oldest child, was only 2 when the
family moved to West Texas, where his father drilled for oil. The
Bushes joined the First Presbyterian Church in Midland, where
George W.'s father taught Sunday school and later became a church
deacon and an elder.
</P>
<P>
   When the family moved to Houston, it briefly joined an Episcopal
church, where George W. served as an altar boy. When he got older,
finished college and moved back to Midland as a bachelor _ a time
in which he has admitted living nothing like an altar boy _ he
spent Sunday mornings teaching religious school at his boyhood
church, First Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been portrayed as a heathen who saw the light at age
40. He has refused to catalog his sins, saying only that he used to
drink to excess and was known to liven up a party. But some of his
friends say he was always religious, involved in church and
committed to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too much has been made of his living some kind of
pagan life,'' said Don Evans, a friend from Midland and an oilman
who is now Bush's campaign finance manager, ``and all of a sudden
he had this big conversion. It didn't work that way. I saw things
in his life from the moment I met him, that this was a Christian
man. It was not something he wore on his sleeve all the time _ it
was the way he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush married Laura Welch, they joined her Methodist church,
and have been Methodists ever since. They maintain their membership
in Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas, a church formal
in ritual, with a large and extremely affluent congregation that
sends money to the kind of social ministries in poor neighborhoods
that Bush says he would support as president.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family counts among its closest friends the nation's
most famous evangelist, the Rev. Billy Graham, and his wife, Ruth.
The Grahams summered with the Bushes in Kennebunkport, Maine, and
took vacations with them in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attributes his spiritual awakening as an adult to Graham.
He was 39, visiting his parents in Kennebunkport, when he and
Graham took a walk on the beach. Graham asked him if he was ``right
with God,'' and Bush said he didn't think so. He spent that weekend
listening as Graham preached at St. Ann's by the Sea, and answered
questions posed by the extended family around the fireplace. This
was the weekend, Bush said, that he decided to ``recommit my
heart'' to Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not say that he was ``born again,'' because he says
his faith deepened more gradually than that term implies. But he is
fluent in evangelical language, having attended men's Bible study
meetings for years with his friend Don Evans back in Midland. As
honorary chairman of a Billy Graham crusade in the Alamodome in San
Antonio in 1997, Bush addressed the revival audience from the
stage. He prays in the governor's mansion with well-known
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he believed that the news profiles of George W. Bush
as a reformed wild child had been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a depth to him that I think they overlook,'' Graham
said. ``They think he's a man of little substance, but that's not
true. I think that he's a man of tremendous moral character to
begin with, and what they have written about his earlier years
could be true of nearly all of us.''

   PRESIDENCY _ WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to give
his valedictory State of the Union address this week, some scholars
say that government is being hopelessly outpaced as an engine of
change by the roiling confluence of technology and global capital.
The presidency, though, has become an institution of greater power,
authority and influence than any other job in the history of the
world. Only the president can rally truly global resources around
American ideals to combat the most fundamental problems of the age:
poverty, war and inequity. Analysts look at the state of the
American presidency as Clinton begins his final year in office.

IOWA NUMEROLOGY: PART SUPERSTITION, PART SCIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ This week, Iowa's biggest export isn't beef
or soybeans or even corn. It's conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   From every corner of the state, dispatches leave by modem and
microwave, bearing the latest rash of suppositions by reporters and
pundits, candidates and their surrogates: if George W. Bush does
not win the Iowa caucuses Monday by at least 10 percent, he
effectively lost. If Bill Bradley does not secure 35 percent of the
caucus votes, he is history. If Steve Forbes garners 30 percent, he
gets a bounce, but if Orrin Hatch gets less than 5, he gets the ax.
</P>
<P>
   The parsing of percentages is ruthless, the pace of
prognostication relentless. On the political talk shows, in the
political columns, the talkers and the writers offer endless
mathematical possibilities. So where do all the numbers that inform
all the guesswork come from? No one seems to have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually heard a print reporter say, `Now, we don't want to
get into the expectations game' and then proceeded into the most
specific, intricate expectations grid you could imagine,'' said
Mark Halperin, political director of ABC News. ```If it's Gore by
more than 20, Gore wins; if the difference is 10 to 20, it's a
wash; if under 10, Bradley wins.' Please, stop us before we set
expectations again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange ritual of the primary season that takes election
night out of the realm of simply who won and into the murkier
territory of who did not lose as much as the next guy. Some 200,000
Iowans may turn out on a caucus night. But in the days before the
event, the news media spins out what seems like an equal number of
pre-emptive postmortems for what the votes are supposed to mean.
</P>
<P>
   From the smallest daily newspapers to the grandest networks, the
game of creating scenarios, of placing candidates in elaborately
constructed win and loss columns and of predicting political
fortunes down to the fourth- and fifth-place finishers, is one of
the most widely played of the campaign. (This week, there was even
a story on The Hotline, the daily political bible on the Web,
speculating on why reporters would be compelled to speculate.) And
while many reporters and editors say they abhor the practice, they
don't see it coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set all of these bars, they're ludicrous,'' said Walter
Shapiro, a political columnist for USA Today. ``Obviously if Steve
Forbes, after years in Iowa and gobs of money, gets a miserable
showing, it is not a good omen, shall we say, for Forbes being
president. Beyond that, these bars are almost comic.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting candidates up for a devastating fall or a spectacular
ascension has its entertainment value, and even its democratic
function, in winnowing out the most marginal candidates, or helping
to focus voters' attention on the candidacy of an intriguing
maverick. But a more serious issue arises, many journalists say,
when what the voters say ends up counting for less than what the
political establishment and news media say they are saying.
</P>
<P>
   There does, in fact, appear to be a growing sense in the news
business that the art of political postulating has become a little
too artful. ``It's like trying to judge an 800-meter race by the
first 20 yards,'' said Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchor. Shapiro said
that a lot more embarrassed throat-clearing now occurs when
commentators go into expectation-setting mode. Others point out
that since so many ideas are promulgated, the process lacks a real
orthodoxy that might make it more insidious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep in mind that there is no formal benchmark,
there is no catechism of expectations,'' said Tom Cannon, CNN's
political director.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the handicapping is to some degree a reflection
of how pivotal Iowa has become. Echoing other news executives, Leo
Wolinsky, managing editor of The Los Angeles Times, said his sense
was that the news media and the political world are now ``making
way too much of this thing.'' Yet it remains a useful vehicle, he
added, for testing candidates' fortitude. ``It's an opportunity for
having a hook for looking at these candidates; you're seeing who's
going to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not much of a stretch to starting guessing at who will
survive. But how are these ball park parameters arrived at? Why is
Bradley a threat at 40 percent and not 35? Who decides Forbes is a
loser at 20 percent and a candidate with a future at a few
percentage points more? ``It's sort of in the air,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Brit Hume, Washington managing editor of the Fox News Channel,
called it ``some combination of osmosis and a widely shared sense
of things, and it happens every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, politicians do their part. USA Today on Friday quoted
Rob Tully, the Iowa Democratic chairman, as saying that Bradley is
``done'' if he accumulates less than 35 percent of the Democratic
vote. (Tully, the paper said, is neutral in the race.)
</P>
<P>
   The classic case that reporters and political types cite is Bill
Clinton's second-place finish in the 1992 New Hampshire primary.
Clinton, who led in early polling, lost ground after the release of
a letter that suggested he tried to avoid the draft. ``Paul Tsongas
won the primary, but the real winner was Clinton,'' said Hume, then
a reporter for ABC. ``Nobody knew what was going to happen to
Clinton. But he knew how to frame things. He pronounced himself the
`comeback kid,' and he became the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the New Hampshire primary, the Iowa caucuses lend
themselves to leaps of imaginative punditry. That is because the
caucuses are less definitive than many of the state contests that
follow: They represent only a preliminary step in Iowa's
delegate-selection process, and only about 10 percent of registered
voters participate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the caucuses are particularly prescient. Donald Kaul of
The Des Moines Register noted in his column on Friday that when
George Bush won the caucuses in 1980, he lost the Republican
nomination. Eight years later, he lost in the caucuses and won the
nomination. ``With a track record like that, you would think the
candidates and news media would have stopped paying attention,''
Kaul wrote. ``But no.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one of the nasty little secrets of political
journalism is that a lot of the out-of-towners agree with him.
``With no offense to the fine people of Iowa, the Iowa caucuses are
an absurd political institution,'' said Jonathan Alter of Newsweek
and NBC News. ``What they test is your ability to get people to
spend an evening at a meeting, instead of going to the movies or
sitting at home watching television.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet the reporters and commentators keep coming and analyzing,
trying hard not to succumb to the temptation to declare a
third-place finisher who was expected to finish fourth a big
winner. As long as the candidates continue to invest so much in
Iowa, they say they really have no choice. And expectations aside,
the test of the candidates here remains a compelling story.
</P>
<P>
   Hume said that inevitably there will be intensive analyses of
the way the press corps behaved in Iowa, that the issue of setting
expectations will be examined closely. ``I've been at this a long
time,'' he said, ``and there is always a lot of hand-wringing on
C-SPAN, a lot of mea culpas everywhere, and of course we get
lectured by Marvin Kalb. And then we go out and do the same thing
next time.''

WITH ELECTIONS IN MIND, CONGRESS PLANS AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the year's elections foremost on their minds,
Republicans and Democrats return to Capitol Hill on Monday ready to
announce a set of crowd-pleasing initiatives, few of which Congress
is likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are mainly designed to tantalize voters and to
serve as partisan weapons the two parties can aim at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House Republicans plan to push tax cuts, strengthen
the military and retool the juvenile justice system. Democrats will
focus on overhauling managed care, changing the nation's campaign
finance laws and making prescription drugs more affordable for the
elderly. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., plans to introduce a bill
to help secure health insurance for those who cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   And with polls showing that voters favor fiscal common sense,
both parties plan to hammer home the message that they are working
hard to protect Social Security and reduce the nation's debt.
</P>
<P>
   But little sweeping legislation is expected to flow from the
debate on these issues. ``Some of the major things we need to do
will have to wait for the next president and the next Congress,''
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., said this week.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart scoffed at the notion of
waiting until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes this is a year to make progress and
doesn't believe we can afford to take a year off as some have
suggested,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has vowed to push hard to persuade Congress to
support a major trade deal with China, enlisting corporate
executives for what administration officials say will be a large
lobbying effort. Republicans are wary about handing China or
President Clinton an easy victory, and many labor and environmental
groups are adamantly opposed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a congressional analyst for the conservative
advocacy group the Heritage Foundation, called this year's
Republican agenda ``minimalist.'' Minimalism may be the safest
strategy for Republicans facing a Democratic Party gunning to take
back the slim majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their watch phrase is do no harm,'' Wittmann said. ``It's a
cautious agenda because they want to avoid any potential Democratic
attacks as they move toward the fall. They don't want to give the
Democrats any opportunity to attack them and turn legislative
issues into political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittmann said Republicans want to avoid a replay of 1994 in
reverse, when they captured the majority of the House by pursuing a
strategy of obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The best course of events for Republicans would be to pass their
tax cuts and address the more contentious issues of health care and
prescription drugs, then get out of town as quickly as possible
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, who love to portray Republicans as leaders of a
``do-nothing'' Congress, will not make it easy for them. One issue
they plan to take up is prescription drugs, a topic that worries
the elderly, who say they often cannot afford the medicine they
need. The pharmaceutical industry, sensing a battle, has agreed to
work with Clinton and Congress to establish Medicare coverage of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republican leaders are following suit. Rep. Dennis Hastert
of Illinois, the speaker of the House, is forming a task force to
address the issue. ``He's very much involved and focused on this
issue, and I'm sure before the year is out he will have a bill on
the president's desk, and hopefully he will sign it,'' Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the chief vote counter in the House, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said legislation ``is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an area of concern,'' he said. ``We have a segment
of our elderly in America who are not now getting help with their
prescription drugs, and my mother is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said he disagreed with Clinton's approach, calling it
too expensive and too far-reaching. ``Sixty-five percent of the
people do have coverage in the private system, so we don't want to
do something that breaks down that access.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also keeping a close eye on legislation to revamp
health maintenance organizations, a measure that has proved popular
but also politically thorny. The legislation is in conference
negotiations between the House and the Senate, which passed a less
far-reaching bill than the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said he
hoped to bring up legislation again to retool the nation's campaign
finance laws, which passed in the House last year but was blocked
by Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties will also wrangle over schools because Congress
must reauthorize a major education bill this year. Republicans, who
once called for the dismantling of the Department of Education, say
they have made up lost ground on the issue by pushing for greater
local control and tax savings that can be used for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Lott will wrap up in the Senate is a
bill to tighten the nation's bankruptcy laws, legislation that
carried over from last year. And House and Senate leaders said they
would tackle a bill to grant American citizenship to Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy who is embroiled in an
international custody battle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said he would fight to bring more money to the
Pentagon and fix the military's health care program, which he said
has dampened morale and hurt retention.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Hastert has said he would take a different
approach to tax relief this year by dividing up last year's $792
billion tax-cut bill into smaller pieces, including separate bills
to reduce the marriage penalty paid by some two-income married
couples and slash taxes on inheritance. Republicans say they hope
that Clinton, who vetoed last year's bill as too expensive, will
have a harder time vetoing the measures separately.

SPORTS COLUMN: NFL'S HIGHLIGHT REEL WILL HAVE NEW FACES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Where is John Elway, he of the cannon arm? Where are
the Buffalo Bills, perennially proclaiming this to be their year?
Where is Joe Montana, he of the fancy feet? Where is that cold
juggernaut from Dallas, once frighteningly anointed America's Team?
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody really feel nostalgic for those familiar dynasties,
currently invisible? From this vantage point, it is quite
refreshing to have relatively new faces in the NFL conference
championship games Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams? The Tampa Bay Buccaneers? The Jacksonville
Jaguars? The Tennessee Titans?
</P>
<P>
   Who _ was it Butch or Sundance who asked it? _ are these people?
</P>
<P>
   A perusal of the histories of these franchises leads to the
unmistakable conclusion that there is not a Super Bowl winner in
the lot, with only one Super Bowl appearance among them, that by
the Rams after the 1979 season, when they represented an American
city called Los Angeles, from which nothing has been heard in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   People have been making fun of the league for the recent trend
of relocations and new Sun Belt franchises _ the downsizing of the
NFL, as it has been called in this space. Fine. The league is
currently not represented in Los Angeles or Houston, while the New
England franchise _ already a world away from urban Boston _ held a
grubby flirtation with poor Hartford, for goodness' sake.
</P>
<P>
   The league itself has mixed feelings about teams from smaller
cities reaching the conference games. This was noted by Rams coach
Dick Vermeil, who worked 14 years as a television commentator while
recovering from that most dread malady ``coaching burnout,''
self-diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the best TV markets,'' Vermeil said Friday.
``The league thinks about these things, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The league might prefer to have a New York or Chicago or even a
mythical Los Angeles team in the Super Bowl, for ratings' sake. On
the other hand, the league practices socialism by sharing the
television swag equally among all its teams, thereby allowing the
Green Bays to not only survive, but to compete, depending on
enlightened management and coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this year's newcomers to the tiny fraternity of rich
teams that baseball trots out every October. Which sport is better
serving its constituency?
</P>
<P>
   Good for the NFL. Sunday's games are a tribute to parity. There
is almost a collegiate feel to the fans wearing blue and yellow
paint and apparel, wandering around old Union Station, now
converted into a suburban-type mall.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Rams' motif calls up the images of Crazy
Legs Hirsch and Deacon Jones, scampering around with a backdrop of
Angeleno palm trees. This is the new order. The Rams are in the
heartland. The Rams are in the conference final.
</P>
<P>
   Obliterated for this year is the dance of the dynasties, that
biblical procession of coaching empires across the January screen _
St. Vincent begetting Dour Tom begetting Lantern-Jawed Don
begetting Pope Chuck begetting Wizard Walsh begetting Tough Tuna
begetting Vader II and Vader III in Dallas begetting the Holmgren
Cryogenic Packers ultimately begetting the Shanahan Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   There were some also-ran dynasties worthy of respect: Bud Grant
in Minnesota, Dan Reeves in Denver and Marv Levy, whose glum faces
are part of the picture, too. Put them all on fast-forward and it
seems like the same game, despite cameo appearances by Joe Namath
and Jim McMahon and a few other odd ducks.
</P>
<P>
   This string of dynasties shaped the minds of young fans all over
the country. Stuck indoors in the nasty Januaries of his youth in
Iowa, Kurt Warner became a Dallas Cowboys fan. This year breaks the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Unless fevered imagination is working overtime, there seems to
be a sense of zest among the players, at least the ones who can be
scrutinized up close in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate grins on the faces of Kevin Carter, the
quick sack man for the Rams, and Warren Sapp, the loquacious
quarterback hunter for the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty cool about it,'' Sapp said, noting that Tampa
Bay has a history of ``never winning this, never winning that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This year we finally broke down those `never'
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl era history of these four franchises can be
contained in one simple paragraph: One conference loss by
Jacksonville after the 1996 season; three conference losses by the
Titans when they were the Houston Oilers; one conference loss by
Tampa Bay to the L.A. Rams after the 1979 season; and six
conference losses and one Super Bowl appearance by the Rams when
they were in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   All that is ancient history now. This season is new. The players
are new. Shaun King, fresh out of Tulane, will play quarterback for
Tampa Bay in a conference championship game.

   ``This is my first year in the league,'' King said with a mature
smile. ``Everybody tells me: `Enjoy yourself. This doesn't happen
all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one of these teams is a dynasty in the making; Vermeil
himself said it is too soon to tell. For the moment, the faces and
the uniforms and the cities and the fans seem fresh. Let's hear it
for parity. Let's hear it for socialism.

PROSECUTORS PORTRAY THE STRANDS OF A BIN LADEN WEB OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.) (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors, in a series of little-noticed
court filings, have painted the most detailed picture yet of how
Osama bin Laden directed what they say was a worldwide terrorism
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The papers filed in the case depict an organization that used
international companies and a relief organization as cover for its
operations; obtained blank passports from the government of Sudan;
recruited a network of people living in the United States; and
communicated by fax, satellite phone and coded letters, often using
not-so-veiled language.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter between group members, for instance, prosecutors
say bin Laden _ the exiled Saudi financier implicated in the 1998
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa _ was repeatedly
referred to by the code name ``Mr. Sam'' or ``O'Sam,'' and the
group's members in Kenya were called ``the fish people.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI questioned one bin Laden associate in Texas in
1997, a letter went out warning that the man had been confronted by
an ``opposition company called Food and Beverage Industry based in
the U.S.'' This, prosecutors said, was a reference to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was given an extensive interview,'' the letter read. ``Give
my regards to Sam and tell him to take extra precautions cause
business competition is very fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been investigating bin Laden's operations for
nearly five years and has charged him and 16 other people with
conspiring to attack Americans, specifically in the embassy
bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which left more than 200 dead and
thousands injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is said to be living in Afghanistan, remains a
nebulous figure. Until now, authorities have revealed only snippets
from the reams of documents seized from his associates by
investigators, and it remains hazy how much control he has over
them and other followers around the world. The indictments of bin
Laden have offered few details about his organization or his direct
role in acts of terrorism with which he has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors were forced to show their hand recently,
when lawyers for one of the defendants, Wadih el-Hage, challenged
the government's assertion that he was dangerous or likely to flee
the country.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage was arrested in 1998, a year after the Kenyan police,
accompanied by U.S. investigators, raided his Nairobi home and
seized his personal papers and computer. U.S. authorities tied him
to the terrorist conspiracy, and he has been held without bail ever
since under stringent restrictions. He has been barred from talking
or writing to virtually anyone but his immediate family and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to pleas from el-Hage's lawyers for bail, prosecutors
disclosed evidence that they say shows he was one of bin Laden's
most trusted and dangerous aides, privy to his secrets and a
personal courier of his instructions.
</P>
<P>
   They say el-Hage met with bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1997, and
took orders to his operatives in Kenya to ``militarize'' for the
first time. This, the government says, led to the 1998 embassy
attacks. The revelation is the closest the government has come to
offering evidence of bin Laden's direct complicity in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also show that bin Laden used a Kenyan charity,
Mercy International Relief Agency, as a front for terrorist
operations, the prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, prosecutors suggested that el-Hage worked closely
with a Muslim religious figure in Texas, who has not been charged
in the case but who they say helped bin Laden buy a jet after he
had moved his operations to Sudan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage, like the other defendants in the case, has pleaded not
guilty, and his lawyers say the government's recent revelations
offer a distorted picture of their client. They say el-Hage, 39, a
naturalized U.S. citizen from Lebanon who lived with his American
wife and children in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, did work for
bin Laden, but only in his legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's recent submissions relating to our client,''
said Sam A. Schmidt, one of el-Hage's lawyers, ``even if you accept
them at face value _ which we do not _ have nothing to do with the
conspiracy to kill Americans, whether civilians or soldiers, but
involve indigenous conflicts overseas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not clear why Kenyan authorities decided to raid el-Hage's
house in August 1997. But the next month, the documents show, el-
Hage was interviewed at length by the FBI and federal prosecutors
in Texas, about a year before the embassy bombings. During that
interview, he disclaimed any knowledge of terrorist activities by
bin Laden and said he had gone to work for a bin Laden company in
Sudan in 1992 as director of international marketing and
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage said he had also acted as a scheduling secretary for bin
Laden in Khartoum, according to the eight-page FBI account of the
interview. He said that he had arranged appointments only for
people who had business dealings with bin Laden's company, and that
another secretary had set up bin Laden's ``secret meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   While working for bin Laden through 1994, el-Hage told the FBI,
he frequently took his family to bin Laden's farms in Sudan, on the
outskirts of Khartoum. Depicting these trips almost as corporate
retreats, el-Hage described picnics and swimming, and sessions at
which bin Laden railed against the corrupt Saudi regime.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly revealed documents emphasize the government's
belief that bin Laden's businesses have all served to conceal his
violent acts. They say el-Hage was bin Laden's primary secretary,
serving as gatekeeper in his Khartoum office, stationed at a door
behind which only bin Laden and one other senior assistant worked.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a mere business functionary, the government says,
el-Hage was a ``front man,'' creating fictitious companies to hide
bin Laden's activities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most significant allegation made against el-Hage in the new
documents is that after returning to Kenya on Feb.22, 1997, he
``played a prominent role in motivating the Kenyan cell into
organizing for violent action.'' According to prosecutors, el-Hage
met with bin Laden and other top members of his organization in
Afghanistan. One report recovered from a computer disk in el-Hage's
Nairobi house, prosecutors say, showed that he had traveled to
Kenya on bin Laden's behalf to initiate a ``new policy'' for the
cell of operatives in Kenya: ``prepare 300 `activists.''' The
report was labeled ``top secret,'' the government says.
</P>
<P>
   The report reveals that another member of bin Laden's cell in
Kenya ``then met with the `engineers' and advised them of the need
to move families to a secure region before the `activism.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report appears to be a summary of recent or proposed
operations. It notes, for example, that bin Laden's operatives
bought Russian Kalashnikov rifles, guns and bombs from their
``Yemenite brothers,'' and had carried out operations in Ethiopia,
especially in its capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of explosions in the other cities,'' the
report read, without elaboration, ``and the brothers are taking up
these operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents appear to be the first in the criminal case in
which the government has tied bin Laden's group to unspecified
violence in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The papers still do not make clear whether the government has
any direct evidence that bin Laden actually ordered the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After his return from Afghanistan, el-Hage sent a fax to an
associate of his boss' in Germany, the government says, reporting
that bin Laden's situation in Afghanistan was ``very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners of the land are cooperating with them,'' he wrote
in the fax, ``and they welcome them.'' He added, ``The situation is
very good, the security is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that ``owners of the land'' is a coded
reference to the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that
rules Afghanistan. There have been conflicting reports about bin
Laden's status. The Taliban have insisted several times that they
are restricting his movements and controlling his access to the
outside world. The memo suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers also shed new light on the long-suspected link
between bin Laden and several relief agencies around the world. The
government says in the documents that a search of the offices of
the Kenyan charity Mercy International Relief Agency turned up
records of calls between its director and bin Laden's satellite
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The government also says it seized a receipt, dated July 24,
1998, just two weeks before the U.S. Embassy bombings, that bore a
reference to ``getting the weapons from Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly revealed details in the government documents also
include information about bin Laden's network in the United States.
Prosecutors have already said he relied on U.S. citizens, in part
because their passports made it easy for them to travel overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the government believes there were two
additional Americans in the United States helping bin Laden.
Neither has yet been charged in the terrorist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and early 1998, prosecutors say, after el-Hage had moved
back to the United States, he remained in touch with bin Laden and
others in his group through the Muslim religious figure in Texas,
Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak's name first surfaced in court last year when
prosecutors identified him as a contact in the United States for
members of bin Laden's conspiracy. At the time they offered no
elaboration. Al-Hallak denied any involvement in violence, and said
he had no idea what the government was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stanley L. Cohen, even said, ``He wouldn't know
Osama bin Laden if he knocked at the door and tried to sell him
Girl Scout cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new documents, prosecutors say Al-Hallak ``provided cover
for el-Hage's business activities.'' One company, Anhar Trading,
created by el-Hage, used Al-Hallak's Texas address as its mailing
address, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   In el-Hage's notebooks, prosecutors say, they found a reference
to his using Al-Hallak to obtain a combat knife and a lock-picking
set. Finally, the government asserts that the imam aided in the
purchase of a jet for bin Laden after he moved to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said of these allegations: ``I'm fascinated to learn that
my client has been connected to an international terrorist
conspiracy led by an elusive and sinister Saudi billionaire by
providing him with a U.S. combat knife. I am sure there is a
shortage of such dangerous weapons in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that the airplane was for bin Laden's businesses,
was a ``puddle jumper'' and crashed ``as a result of an overdose of
rust.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that bin Laden's group _ in some cases
led by el-Hage _ took elaborate steps to move around the world with
illegal travel papers.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say, for example, that the group's members
operated a ``very professional counterfeiting operation and, at
times, have received blank passports from certain governments,
including Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say that during the raid on el-Hage's Kenya
office, they found a genuine-looking Kenyan travel stamp, which
could be used to make documents appear authentic, and that his
files revealed that he and another associate were providing false
passports for operatives in the Caucasus, as well as for fighters
in Somalia.

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S `CONTRARIANS' ROOT FOR THE UNDERDOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ June Larkins, a stay-at-home mother here,
takes her politics seriously. And like many other New Hampshire
voters, she says she tends to support underdogs, even when she
knows they have little chance of being elected president.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ms. Larkins, an independent free to choose which
primary she votes in, says she is torn between Sen. John McCain and
former Sen. Bill Bradley. She plans to vote for one of them, just
as she supported Paul Tsongas, whose high-water mark was beating
Bill Clinton in the Democratic primary here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try hard to figure out who the best candidate is,'' said Ms.
Larkins, one of about two dozen voters interviewed in malls and on
the streets in southern New Hampshire last week. She said she
realized it was unlikely that either of her favorites would become
president, but she added, ``That's not something I'm worrying about
now.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be a prevalent view in New Hampshire, where voters
take pride in being what Steve Duprey, the state Republican
chairman, calls ``contrarian.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tsongas, other long-shot winners in New Hampshire
have included Gary Hart, who won the Democratic primary over Walter
F. Mondale in 1984, and Pat Buchanan, who won the Republican race
against Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls show McCain of Arizona and Bradley of New
Jersey far behind nationally, but running close to and possibly
even leading Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al
Gore in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The polls bear out the theme that McCain and Bradley supporters
understand their candidacies may falter even if they win here.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post last week
found that in New Hampshire, only 27 percent of those who plan to
vote for McCain and 30 percent of those who favor Bradley believe
their candidate has the ``best chance'' of becoming president. By
contrast, the poll showed, most Bush and Gore supporters are quite
confident their candidates will be elected.
</P>
<P>
   None of the people interviewed last week said the outcome of the
Iowa caucuses this week would affect their votes on Feb. 1. ``What
happens in Iowa won't sway me one iota,'' said Wayne Palmer, a
retired carpenter who is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Linda L. Fowler, who is director of the Rockefeller Center for
Social Sciences at Dartmouth College and who conducts statewide
polls for The Associated Press, said she was not surprised that
people here were not paying attention to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most other places, Iowa is important,'' she said. ``But
there is so much information in this state, so much advertising, so
much campaigning, such a very rich media environment, the impact of
Iowa is substantially less than it is elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The last candidate in a contested race to win the most delegates
in Iowa and go on to win a primary in New Hampshire was Jimmy
Carter in 1976.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over and over in last week's interviews, people returned to the
idea that they had scrutinized the candidates and picked the one
they thought best, regardless of who they believed would actually
become president.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley supporter, Ron Aveni, a salesman from Milford, said he
especially liked the former senator's health plan. But he added:
``It's going to be difficult. I'm not optimistic. I think Vice
President Gore has the support of the party faithful, and because
of this he's got a better shot at the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cahannis, a retiree who favors McCain, made a similar point:
``I think he has no chance with the nomination because of Bush's
money. But I'm still going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Foster, a Bradley supporter, said, ``I guess it matters to
me whether he wins the nomination, but that's because if he loses,
I'll have to rethink the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, an engineer who lives in Londonderry and works in
Boston, said he had always voted Republican, but switched his
registration this year to vote for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Hampshire rules, independents may vote in either
primary, but registered Democrats and Republicans may vote only on
their party's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   John Moriarty, a software developer in Manchester, said he might
not vote this year because he had not thought to change his
registration before the Oct. 29 deadline. Moriarty, a Democrat,
said he had become a strong admirer of McCain. But in another way,
Moriarty seems quite representative of New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tend to vote for front-runners,'' he said.

SOME JAPANESE CALL 1937 MASSACRE A MYTH, STIRRING STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A conference intended to play down Japan's record of
atrocities during its occupation of China has unleashed a storm of
criticism from Beijing and drawn strong condemnation from some
historians and others in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the one-day conference, scheduled for Sunday in
Japan's second- largest city, Osaka, is the 1937 Nanjing Massacre,
which organizers have provocatively called ``the biggest myth of
the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The site selected for the meeting further stoked the ire of many
in Japan. The conference will be in the city's International Peace
Center, which houses permanent exhibits on war, including the
American atomic bombing of Japan in World War II and Japan's brutal
military campaign in China in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   For several days running, the Chinese government and news media
have bitterly attacked the conference as the work of people eager
to falsify history and raise tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``By planning the rally, Japanese rightists want to distort
history, paper over the aggression and undermine Sino-Japanese
friendship,'' said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu
Bangzao, in a statement published in the official China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Ryutaro Nakakita, an Osaka lawyer opposed to the event, said
that the organizers' intention was ``to bring chaos to a hall that
was meant to promote peace, and to muddle history.'' City officials
say, however, that the Peace Center is a public place and that to
refuse to allow the conference to be held there would be an
infringement on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers deny that the conference is meant to stir up
trouble. They say it was conceived as a debate between experts who
accept conventional accounts of the fall of Nanjing, which say that
Japanese soldiers butchered as many as 300,000 people, and those
who deny any large-scale atrocities took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, we had planned for a forum between the two sides,
in order to verify the facts,'' said Yasuhiko Yoshida, one of the
organizers. ``But those who have claimed that there was a massacre
declined to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Japanese historians of the 1930s and 1940s, the
period of Japan's aggressive militarism, say that to accept such an
invitation is akin to legitimizing the views of German extremists
or others who would deny the existence of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although casualty estimates vary, it is widely accepted among
scholars that after the sudden collapse of the Chinese defense of
Nanjing in December 1937, rampaging Japanese soldiers executed
thousands of prisoners of war, men suspected of being soldiers and
civilians, and burned the homes of Chinese to keep warm. Thousands
of Chinese women are also believed to have been raped.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing this history, parallels with Germany are
inevitably strained. Germany has broadly owned up to the horrors of
its past and has paid compensation to many of its victims. But
Japan as a society has generally avoided any deep reflection and
contrition over a period in which its army ran roughshod over much
of Asia. It has generally refused to compensate its war victims and
has even avoided paying veterans benefits to Korean citizens forced
to fight in Japan's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's aggression and the atrocities it entailed are treated
only cursorily in most schools here. Even recent concessions to
textbook reform in this area, like mention of the rape and sexual
slavery of thousands of Korean and Chinese women, is under attack
by conservatives, who cast doubt on the accounts and say these
subjects should not be taught to young Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people claiming there was no Nanjing Massacre, including
the organizers of this conference, are the people who would
maintain that Japan's war in China was legitimate, that it was not
an invasion,'' said Tokushi Kasahara, a professor of Chinese modern
history at Tsuru University in Tokyo. ``Many Japanese do not know
much about these events, and the people of this camp are trying to
influence them.''
</P>
<P>
   But while fringe figures who deny the Holocaust exist in Germany
and elsewhere, voices here dismissing or greatly playing down
Japan's wartime crimes are regularly heard from the political,
academic and media establishment. The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro
Ishihara, for one, has frequently called the Nanjing Massacre a
lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think by analogy that because Germans committed a
Holocaust, that Japanese must have done something like that, too,''
said Dr. Shudo Higashinakano, a historian of social thought at Asia
University in Tokyo. ``But you must look at the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Higashinakano, who is scheduled to speak at the Osaka
conference, said the Nanjing Massacre, also commonly known as the
Rape of Nanjing, was ``groundless war propaganda.''

 &HT;    Six-pack's a hard sell
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tabloid headlines from Vancouver to the Maritimes and
all frozen outposts in between might have indicated otherwise last
week. But word that the NHL's Canadian six-pack is in trouble
hardly should be viewed as a stunning development.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian hockey fans went from euphoric to disconsolate in a
span of 72 hours Friday after the federal government made a U-turn
on a proposal to offer financial assistance to the league's six
northern franchises: Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Edmonton, Calgary
and Vancouver. The turnaround came after a backlash from citizens
who felt the government shouldn't bail out sports franchises when
there are more important problems, which some actually may view as
refreshing. The issue clearly divided the country, and industry
minister John Manley said, ``It is now clear that the very
stakeholders who implied they might be receptive to negotiating are
not prepared to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's why even the initial proposal by the government
should not have led anybody to believe that the NHL's future in
Canada wasn't on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal money was contingent on provincial and local
governments kicking in, which wasn't likely to happen in British
Columbia (Vancouver), Alberta (Calgary and Edmonton), Quebec
(Montreal) or Ontario (Toronto). Only Ottawa, where Senators owner
Rod Bryden is well-connected, likely could have swayed votes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even if subsidies were pushed through, it would not have been
enough money to keep financially-strapped teams like the Senators,
Flames, Oilers and Canucks in place.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian teams pay a majority of their salaries in U.S. dollars
but earn revenues in Canadian dollars. That's roughly a 35-percent
loss. Such financial constraints make it difficult for teams to
compete for players in free agency or even keep the ones they bring
up through their minor-league system. A few million dollars per
year was not going to make a significant difference in accounting
books for franchises losing $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Helping NHL teams also would give leverage to baseball's
Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue Jays and the NBA's Toronto Raptors
and Vancouver Grizzlies to ask for similar tax concessions.
Politicians simply were not going to allow that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed at Manley's initial proposal was that the federal
dollars only were going to be available if others chipped in. The
federal contribution was roughly 25 percent. With the Canadian
dollar devalued and the economy so poor, local governments
realistically were not in the position to keep hockey teams afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's direct taxpayer dollars that we're talking about to go
directly to these teams, then our answer is we're not even looking
at dropping the puck in that game,'' said Alberta treasurer
Stockwell Day.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have alternatives. There will be a race to see which
one relocates to Portland. Bet on the Senators and Bryden, who has
been the most vocal in threatening a move. On Tuesday, Bryden said
he had put his ``For Sale'' sign in the garage. Three days later,
he said, ``It's still in the garage, but it's probably useful we
didn't burn it.''

 &HT;    Deja vu, comrade
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

   ATLANTA _ Remember how Jaromir Jagr would speak to a reporter
from a newspaper in the Czech Republic every time he felt like
venting about coach Kevin Constantine? The story would get
translated into English back in the U.S., and then Jagr would deny
the comments. Then when Constantine was fired earlier this season,
Jagr pretty much confirmed everything. Here we go again. The
honeymoon in Pittsburgh might be over for Herb Brooks. First the
former Olympic coach was suspended two games for shoving Colorado's
play-by-play announcer because he didn't like what was said on a
broadcast. Now, Penguins left winger German Titov has been quoted
in a Russian newspaper as saying Brooks' practice methods are
``idiotic. ...The coach has at his disposal players of the highest
caliber but spends his time on sheer nonsense,'' Titov reportedly
said. ``That means he is either incompetent or regards his players
as incompetent. Not surprisingly, our guys are thoroughly sick of
his stupid training.'' Surprise: Titov denies the remarks. Brooks'
response: ``Things have been said about me before, but never that I
didn't know what I was doing at practice.'' And here's a rumor to
get you through the week. Czech national coach Ivan Hlinka, who is
in Pittsburgh ``observing'' Penguins practices, is rumored to be
the next Pens coach.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-STAR FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said it would be ``ludicrous'' for
goalie Dominik Hasek to play in the All-Star Game without having
tested his injured groin in a Sabres game, but admits he probably
has no control over the situation. There's more than ego involved
in Hasek's desire to play in Toronto Feb. 6. He will earn a fat
bonus from Louisville if he debuts a new line of equipment. It's a
touchy situation. The Sabres don't want Hasek to worsen an injury
in a meaningless game but they don't want to tick off the world's
best goalie, either. Meanwhile, even if Hasek doesn't play in the
All-Star Game, his would-be replacement wants no part of it. St.
Louis goalie Roman Turek was snubbed for World team because of
NHL's preference to have one participant from each team and chose
Edmonton's Tommy Salo and Washington's Olaf Kolzig. ``When they
named three goalies and my name was not there., that's it for me,''
Turek said. ``If they call me next week or the week after and say,
`Hey, Dominik is not coming,' I'm not going. I'll spend the time
with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   With the Petr Nedved-for-Keith Primeau trade falling through,
the Rangers now are looking to move winger Kevin Stevens or
defenseman Stephane Quintal. ... Tampa Bay dealt for St. Louis
minor league goalie Rich Parent after coach Steve Ludzik public
questioned Kevin Hodson's work ethic. Hodson will be unprotected in
the expansion draft.

 &HT;    Waiting game for Tinordi
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the expansion draft, the Thrashers acquired the
rights to two players they had no intention of signing _ Ulf
Samuelsson and Mark Tinordi, both unrestricted free agent
defensemen. The idea was to gain compensatory draft picks when
either or both sign with another team. The plan worked with
Samuelsson, who signed, albeit belatedly, with Philadelphia. But
Tinordi remains unemployed. He has missed 96 games the past three
seasons with injuries and missed the final eight weeks last year
with a broken ankle. The ankle never healed properly so Tinordi had
surgery in October. His agent, Jeff Solomon, says ``10 to 15 teams
have called about him.'' Solomon believes Tinordi will be ready
next month. But at this point, the question becomes: How much can
he help a team in a playoff drive, having not played in a game
since February? Thrashers general manager Don Waddell can find
solace in one thing: There was nobody he wanted off the Capitals'
expansion draft list, anyway.

   WHAT'S BRUIN
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive comebacks against Atlanta (a 3-3 tie after trailing
3-0 and a two-goal rally for a 4-3 win) did not spark a parade down
Boylston Street in Boston. After the win at Philips Arena, coach
Pat Burns questioned that it would signal the start of a turnaround
for the struggling Bruins. Strangely, when asked about the
difficulty of finding an effective forward line, he turned the
focus onto himself: ``I don't think I'm a bad coach. I don't think
we're as bad as the record shows. But apparently it's not the
team.'' Burns is trying to spark a few trades by assistant general
manager Mike O'Connell. He also has not taken well to suggestions
in the media that he has lost his players _ particularly the young
core group that represents the Bruins' future: Joe Thornton, Sergei
Samsonov, Jason Allison. He named no players but says the roster is
dotted with ``mopers,'' then added, ``We're going to have to forget
about them and go with the guys who want to win.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Phoenix owner Richard Burke has put the Coyotes up for
sale. Burke has been frustrated by construction delays, financing
questions and a general lack of enthusiasm from officials in moving
ahead with a $535 million arena and redevelopment project. He
worked hard to get a vote passed to partially fund the project. But
it has become apparent that the arena cannot be completed in time
for the 2001-02 season. Burke already has burned bridges with
America West Arena and the unofficial King of Phoenix, Jerry
Colangelo. Here's the kicker: If Burke does sell, the most likely
buyer is Hollywood producer Barry Kemp, who owns six percent of the
NBA Suns and has lobbied to keep the team in America West. An
orchestrated effort? You decide. Burke claims losses of $10 million
to $15 million per year because of 4,300 obstructed seats in AWA
and limited revenue streams. SITTING DUCKS
</P>

   Anaheim dumped Dallas 3-1 Wednesday but few bold predictions are
coming out of Orange County. The Mighty Ducks had dropped three
games under .500 for the first time in a year after going 1-8-1 in
a 10-game stretch, and Paul Kariya laid into his teammates for
perceived short comings in work ethic and attitude. ``Our team is
just too loosey-goosey,'' he said. ``We don't have the desire to be
a good team right now. We have to sacrifice for more than two
periods or 50 minutes. We get satisfied with even minor success.''
Ducks GM Pierre Gauthier made a series of minor moves, waiving
winger Jim McKenzie and recalling two prospects. But the Ducks
remain largely a two-player team (Kariya-Teemu Selanne), and the
comments about being ``loosey-goosey'' could be construed as an
indictment of coach Craig Hartsburg.
</P>

<P>
   Phoenix holdout goalie Nikolai Khabibulin is back in uniform _
in the IHL. He signed with the Long Beach Ice Dogs for $100,000. He
is not close to a deal with the Coyotes. ... Dallas, wrecked by
injuries, was pursuing a scoring forward in the trade market even
before Joe Nieuwendyk suffered a separated shoulder. Nieuwendyk is
out six to eight weeks. That's why GM Bob Gainey was considering
dealing for Stephane Richer before backing off. The Stars also are
interested in Rangers defenseman Rich Pilon. ... The latest of Igor
Larionov, after contract talks broke down with Detroit:
``Twenty-five years _ what else do I have to prove? I can play at a
high level for 25 seasons on different sides of the ocean.'' ...
Nashville's Randy Robitaille (acquired from Atlanta for Denny
Lambert) has as many goals (nine) as No. 1 pick David Legwand. But
Predators coach Barry Trotz still considers Robitaille a
``one-dimensional player'' and says he will limit the rookie's
playing time until his defense improves.

   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ The bread display is a thing of beauty: fat,
crusty loaves of rye and oatmeal sitting next to baskets of
multigrain hard rolls and chewy baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   In that august culinary setting, the brand-new display of Koffee
Kup white bread and hot-dog rolls looks oddly out of place. It's
there because the Onion River Food Co-op has been trying to prove
to Burlington shoppers that the store does not sell organic bread
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll obviously have to rearrange these shelves,'' said Ned
Flinn, manager of the Onion River Food Co-op, a 3,500-square-foot
food cooperative in Burlington's Old North End. ``With all these
new products coming in, we haven't figured out where to put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flinn has many other things on his plate right now. On Tuesday,
voters here in Vermont's largest city will be asked whether they
want a new downtown grocery to be run by the co-op or by Shaw's, a
supermarket chain with stores in all six New England states. The
issue is on the ballot because of a petition drive by a group
called Friends of Shaw's.
</P>
<P>
   And if, on the surface, the contest appears to be a simple
matter of competitive capitalist enterprise, just below the surface
lies a host of issues that are charged with class differences,
ethnic and cultural diversity, the benefits of local ownership vs.
the economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have economic, racial and ethnic diversity in Burlington,
and a 15,000-square-foot store won't meet their needs,'' said Sam
Osborne, a Burlington resident and consultant for Shaw's, referring
to the proposed co-op store. ``Groups from every walk of life will
be left out under the Onion River proposal.'' He said poor
residents and the elderly were worried that they would dislike the
selection and find the prices too high.
</P>
<P>
   The Price Chopper supermarket closed in April 1999, leaving
Burlington, with a population of about 38,000, without a downtown
food store. The city sought applicants for a new market to be built
on the city-owned site of the old police station.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's Supermarkets wants to build a 45,000-square-foot store on
the site, said Bernard Rogan, spokesman for Shaw's, which has
headquarters in East Bridgewater, Mass. Shaw's says it will need to
build an underground garage, and it has asked the city to pick up
$800,000 of the bill with a bond vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contention was, and is, that you need a diverse product
line because of the diversity of the population in Burlington,''
said Rogan, calling for more ethnic foods and other products. But
the size of the Shaw's project has been a sticking point for many
city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Onion River has offered a site plan calling for 15,000 square
feet of grocery store, 4,000 square feet of office and warehouse
space, and above-ground parking.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for opening the new store is about 18 months,
Flinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Knodell, president of the City Council, was one of the
council members who voted with the majority in the 12-2 vote in
favor of the Onion River proposal at a meeting on Dec. 13. ``The
size of Shaw's would have a negative impact on the neighborhood,''
Ms. Knodell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be lots of truck traffic, huge Dumpsters. Their
site design is very suburban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that you may not get umpteen different versions of
cornflakes offered at Onion River,'' she added, ``but I'm not sure
that makes anybody's life any better anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A thorny issue has been the implications of making a natural
foods co-op the only option in town. Typically, co-ops do not carry
the standard commercial food products, particularly if they are
irradiated, processed or adulterated in some way.
</P>
<P>
   To address that, the city has told Onion River that it must
expand its product offerings at its proposed store _ and it has
already done so at its present site _ to include conventional
foodstuffs. So far, the co-op has added Crisco, Cheerios,
Grape-Nuts, American cheese _ and Koffee Kup bread, and more is
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Monte, director of the Community and Economic
Development Office for the city of Burlington, acknowledged that
``people's gut reaction is that they want a regular, big
supermarket like other people have. But when people take a closer
look at some of the issues that crop up _ loss of local control,
zoning changes _ they start to rethink that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Osborne, who founded the Friends of Shaw's
Committee. He said his polling indicated that ``seven out of eight
people we talked to wanted Shaw's. They think Onion River is too
expensive and that it won't meet their needs. The co-op won't even
sell cigarettes. People don't want to be told what they can and
can't do.''

RAMS MUST AVOID BUCCANEERS' SPEED BUMPS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was their first offensive play of the game, and
the St. Louis Rams went to their four wide receiver package against
Minnesota last Sunday in the divisional playoffs. Wide receiver
Isaac Bruce lined up in the slot, and covering him was linebacker
Dwayne Rudd. It was one of those infamous Rams mismatches. Speed
vs. bulk. This isn't Hollywood, where the outmatched hero somehow
keeps up with the faster player. A few steps for Bruce. Quick pass.
Afterburners. A 77-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing coaches tell their teams the Rams are fast. They tell
them to watch out. They tell them about the weapons. And players
listen. They really do. They take notes. They sit up straight in
meetings. Then teams take the field against St. Louis, and despite
all of the preparation, they are still shell shocked, sensibilities
are still offended.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way against the Vikings, when running back Marshall
Faulk caught a 2-yard pass in the flat, then put a move on two
players and slashed across the field, a bewildered defense in tow.
Faulk was running in one gear; the Vikings were in one much lower.
</P>
<P>
   This season the Rams have overwhelmed almost every team with
great play calling, mainly by their master strategist Mike Martz,
the offensive coordinator. But the Rams are closing in on a
championship because of quickness that makes opposing defenses look
as though they are running in a zero-gravity environment while the
Rams are not.
</P>
<P>
   It is about speed. Breakneck not-your-granddaddy's-NFL type of
speed. Fast-break, blink-and-miss,
rewind-that-darn-play-because-these-eyes-must-be-lying type of
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has ever seen an offense as fast as
ours,'' St. Louis cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``In practice, it's
like watching jets on takeoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay is the only thing standing between the Rams and Super
Bowl XXXIV. For the Buccaneers to win Sunday's NFC championship
game, they must deal with St. Louis' multiple threats, which become
all the more powerful on the fast artificial turf of the Trans
World Dome. The Bucs have a great defense, especially against the
pass, as they are rated second best in the NFL, allowing only 176
yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's leader, lineman Warren Sapp, the defensive player of
the year, has yapped all week about turning this game into a war.
And it could be. But if the Rams' on-field pedigree is any
indication, it will be a war fought through the air. Few teams have
been able to slow the Rams down at home, so unless the Buccaneers
plan on dumping several tons of sand across the field, they will
have to play the game of their lives to stop St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks we're going to lose, so there is no pressure
on us,'' Sapp said. ``The Rams sound very confident, some people
might say overconfident.''
</P>
<P>
   After his team shredded the Vikings for five passing touchdowns,
Rams coach Dick Vermeil said he felt no one could stop his offense.
Those are dangerous words, and they have made their way to the
Bucs' bulletin board. But Vermeil has reason to be so confident.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams scored 526 points in the regular season, gaining more
than 400 yards per game. They put up 31 or more points 12 times,
including the playoffs, and the offense scored a touchdown every 18
plays.
</P>
<P>
   What differentiates the Rams from recent offensive juggernauts
is their multitude of threats. Faulk set an NFL record for
all-purpose yards with 2,429. Quarterback Kurt Warner threw for a
team-record 41 touchdowns. Bruce is as good an offensive player as
there is, and St. Louis is so deep at the position that its third
and fourth wide receivers could be starters on most teams.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Martz has been an invaluable asset in the development of this
offense. There was speculation that several franchises, including
the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys, were looking for head
coaches and wanted to interview Martz when the season ended, so St.
Louis management moved quickly to make sure he didn't go anywhere.
Martz was promised that he would replace Vermeil when the head
coach retires, which will probably be after the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Martz's philosophy is to attack, from the first snap to the
last, and score, score, score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been a coordinator for many years in college,'' he said.
``And the most success I'd ever had was when we were aggressive.
Just let guys play. Just go. Don't worry about making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Rams under Martz use more shifting and motion than almost
any other team. They don't worry about establishing a running game.
That's for sissies. They don't worry about balance. That's for
ordinary teams. It's Magic and the Lakers in pads. There are short
passes, long passes, shovel passes, option pitches from wide
receivers, reverses, fake reverses, fake reverses of fake reverses.
Martz puts the football in the hands of his players and lets them
do the rest, and sometimes he will pull a few tricks out of his
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can be effective offensively is to put the
ball in the hands of the gifted people,'' Vermeil said. ``If you're
afraid to do that, you're not going to score many points. You might
as well put some slow guys out there that are 32 years old and
can't play, and put great big shoulder pads on them. That's not our
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not, and that is why the Rams may soon be on their way
to the Super Bowl. &QL;

THOUGH LAGGING, KEYES IS BUOYED BY NEW WAVE OF SUPPORT

<P>
   CLIVE, Iowa _ Watching Alan Keyes in a presidential debate is
not that different from having breakfast with him: Even over bacon
and eggs, at an hour so early the moon is still up, he mostly wants
to talk about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what his supporters, who have elevated him to third
place among Republican candidates in a couple of polls and made him
the man to watch in Monday's Iowa caucuses, say they find so
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress here at the Cracker Barrel restaurant is in tears
as she tells him that he alone is serving up the 100 percent,
like-it-or-not truth about the country's moral slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blinders are going to come off in America, Mr. Keyes,''
said the waitress, 44-year-old Sharron Gay, as he stoops to pick up
the food-order tickets she has dropped in her excitement. ``And
soon, they're going to see you for who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, this is a gratifying moment for a man who has spent
years running for president from dead last, written off by
reporters he has called a bunch of racists and ridiculed by some
fellow candidates. ``Orrin Hatch has been friendly,'' he said
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels he aced the debates _ and he clucks over the
performance of his rivals. He is picking up support, he says,
because America has a guilty conscience, a deep, post-Clinton
``moral anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not overly optimistic, either. And he is certainly not
a guy to lose his head over a little buzz: ``They've been prone to
being suicidal in the past,'' he said of his fellow Republicans,
``so they'll do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at his Des Moines campaign headquarters, volunteers are
working around the clock, even sleeping there, on cots. His fund
raising has doubled to just over $1 million in the last quarter, a
result, his supporters say, of the purity of his message opposing
abortion, sex education, gay rights and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the University of Iowa Social Science Institute
notes that ``since December, there has been a large increase in
Keyes' support,'' and shows him as the only Republican candidate
whose numbers improved over the last month _ even if only from 1
percent to 9 percent among likely caucus-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' backers also poll as highly likely to turn out on caucus
night. (As one of his volunteers, Craig Bergman, put it, ``It's
hard to be motivated for a candidate who's just going to win. Who
just has money or a family name.'')
</P>
<P>
   Connie Hair, who quit her job at Paramount Pictures to be Keyes'
press secretary, says 4,000 new volunteers have come forward just
in the last two weeks. And Keyes events typically now attract
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the candidate admits that running for president is making
him grumpy. Asked if he was enjoying himself, he said, ``Sometimes
yes, sometimes no. Some things I seriously dislike, and that puts a
strain on me emotionally and spiritually. I hate being away from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly does not seem to think much of the competition.
Steve Forbes, he calls an arriviste abortion hater. And George W.
Bush he calls ``a nice guy who doesn't fully understand,'' _ to the
great amusement of his entourage of half a dozen aides, including a
couple of bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   He was not at all surprised, he says, by Bush's comment this
week that if a friend who had been raped came to him while
considering an abortion, he would sympathize, and then, ``It's up
to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said: ``That kind of an answer confirms that whatever he
says, he's not pro-life. He can't do the job, and he's going to be
an embarrassment to us. And that people are voting for him on the
strength of his mother's recommendation? She's a nice lady, but
she's pro-abortion! She's one of these `get this issue out of
politics' people.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also took time to bat around Bush's assertion that Jesus
Christ was his favorite political philosopher. ``A philosopher is
someone who seeks truth, but if you are the truth, do you have to
look for it?''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other candidate for whom Keyes does have great
respect: Probably the most liberal man in the race, and certainly
the one with the best record in the eyes of those who support
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is a smart guy and seems to think for himself,''
Keyes says. ``He's one of the few politicians I've met whose head
wasn't filled with straw by his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to one-up even the famously private Bradley, though, in
his caution in discussing his life.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes does say he grew up an ``Army brat,'' has two degrees from
Harvard, and has worked for the State Department and as ambassador
to a U.N. Council. He is 49, works off-season as a lecturer and
radio host, and lives with his wife and three children in a
Maryland suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not engage in meaningless banter, or, for the most
part, entertain questions he cannot answer with a policy
discussion. Asked whether his old college roommate, William
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, was messy in the dormitory,
he seemed at a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I call a boxers-or-briefs question,'' he said.
``And I don't answer those.''

OUTDOORS: A DELIGHTFUL NUISANCE: STARLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY ROBERT H. BOYLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about Tweetie Bird, Robin Redbreast, Henny Penny, Chicken
Little, Jemimah Puddle Duck, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck and Jonathan
Livingston Seagull. Make way for the late Charlie Starling and the
present Dirty Harry, both starlings who could be just the darlings
to redeem the reputation of this pest species.
</P>
<P>
   Natives of Eurasia, starlings arrived in North America in 1890
when the New Yorker Eugene Schieffelin, a nut of a Shakespeare
enthusiast, let loose 60 to 100 of them in Central Park because he
wanted to see every kind of bird ever mentioned by the Bard flying
around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the starlings first nested under the eaves of the
American Museum of Natural History, and from there they multiplied
and eventually spread all the way to Alaska. North America is now
home to more than 200 million of these avian aliens, a third of the
world population. Notoriously gregarious, up to 150,000 starlings
have roosted under the 125th Street Viaduct near the West Side
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they flock, their screeches, whistles, hoots, crazy
songs and voluminous droppings can drive people bonkers. Very
aggressive, they often dispossess native species from nesting
holes, notably the bluebird, the official New York state bird. They
can also ravage crops of apples, grapes and other fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Capable of astounding aerial acrobatics, they can converge into
a dense feathered ball equivalent to an aerial torpedo. In 1960 in
Boston, a flock flew into a Lockheed Electra airliner, and the
plane crashed killing 62 people.
</P>
<P>
   Given all their undesirable attributes, starlings have no
protection under the law. They're worthless pests, right? Wrong!
They belong to the Sturnidae, the same family as the mynah bird,
whose imitation of human speech excels that of parrots, and, like
their mynah cousins, starlings can talk. That is why Shakespeare in
``King Henry IV,'' Act I, Scene III, has Hotspur declaim, ``I'll
have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but `Mortimer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Imprinted as a nestling by a human, a starling makes a
fascinating pet. As John Gould, the great British ornithologist,
wrote more than 160 years ago, this ``bold and spirited little bird
... soon becomes reconciled to confinement, where it not only sings
sweetly, but may be taught to articulate words and even
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, starlings have been known to imitate the songs and calls
of almost 70 other birds, from the tufted titmouse to the
red-shouldered hawk, as well as duplicate a ringing telephone, a
dog barking and a cat meowing.
</P>
<P>
   Our first starling, Charlie, was 5 years old when my wife,
Katya, and I got him from Heinz and Elizabeth Meng, who were
overbirded with a half-dozen hawks and falcons and a loquacious
parrot named Gaby. A biology professor at SUNY-New Paltz, Heinz
adopted Charlie after the 10-day-old bird fell out of a nest in
Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's vocabulary included such words and sayings as
``Hello,'' ``It's a nice day today,'' ``Pi r squared'' and ``Stop
that, Gaby,'' which he picked up when the Mengs told their parrot
to stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   With Katya and me, Charlie played a feathered Pavarotti. Common
household noises _ the brrhhh of the vacuum cleaner, the click of
the computer printer _ were enough to get him singing, but he was
especially joyful when accompanying Mireille Mathieu singing ``La
Marseillaise,'' one of Dvorak's Slavonic dances and the drinking
song from ``La Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   During a heat wave one night last July, I put Charlie's cage
outside on our 10-foot-high deck, and, alas, a raccoon managed to
climb up and eat him. We were devastated, but Heinz got us with
another nestling, soon named Dirty Harry by Katya because of, shall
we say, his personal habits, the least of which is ripping apart
the papers lining the bottom of his cage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Dirty Harry is an exceptional bird. Although only
6 months old now, in no way does the put-down birdbrain apply to
him. When Katya or I catch a moth or a house fly and call out,
``Insect, insect!'' Dirty Harry hops excitedly from perch to perch,
sticks his beak out between the bars and takes the offering from
the hand.
</P>
<P>
   We keep his cage hanging from a 10-foot ficus tree in our
library, where the radio plays classical music for him. He is too
young to sing along or say words _ that should come with the mating
urge next spring _ but he quickly figured out how to escape from
the cage by using his beak to unhinge the top bar of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   After he escaped two days straight, I inserted a paper clip in
the gate and twisted it to keep it shut. His head cocked toward me,
his bright brown eyes alert, Dirty Harry watched closely. Three
days later, he escaped again by pushing against the gate and
squeezing through.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling like Elmer Fudd, I gave the paper clip a couple of added
twists after putting Dirty Harry back in his cage. After he escaped
yet again, I locked the gate with a big safety pin. Again he
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Now we let Dirty Harry out every day to fly around the house.
When Katya holds up her hand, he alights on it. From there he flies
to the ficus tree or the top of my bald head, shielded by a
baseball cap. Much of the time _ well, some of the time _ he will
come when called.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 minutes of his aerial antics, we put him back in his
cage. To make certain that he can't escape, I close it tight with a
bolted lock and key. Katya and I have agreed that if he can escape
from that, we'll change his name from Dirty Harry to Harry
Houdini. &QL;

ABSESTOS MAKERS SECRETLY SETTLE 2 LARGE LAWSUITS  
 (EXCLUSIVE) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Texas, Ohio, Ind., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months ago, a coalition of the nation's leading
asbestos makers secretly agreed to settle two of the largest
asbestos personal-injury cases, lawsuits filed in a state court in
Mississippi that involved nearly 4,000 plaintiffs from five states.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement accepted by the lawyers from Texas and Mississippi
who filed the cases required the 18 companies to pay $160 million,
and was the largest per-victim settlement reached in an asbestos
suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement, which has not previously been disclosed,
included an unusual formula for allocating the award, based more on
where the plaintiff lived than on the injuries he or she suffered.
For reasons that the plaintiffs' lawyers would not discuss, victims
who lived closest to the courthouse received many times more than
those who lived in other states.
</P>
<P>
   For example, $263,000 went to each of 246 plaintiffs who live in
four counties in Mississippi and who suffered serious injuries; but
2,645 residents of Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania who were injured
just as badly each got $14,000. The seven Texas plaintiffs with
similar problems got $43,500.
</P>
<P>
   For plaintiffs who were less seriously injured, the relative
scale of payments was similar: Mississippi victims received
dramatically more than those from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which was sealed by the parties and a court
order but recently given to The New York Times and to congressional
aides in Washington by one of the parties, now figures prominently
in the debate in Washington over legislation that would overhaul
the way courts handle asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's supporters say the Mississippi settlement
demonstrates how arbitrary the current system can be, and why a
federal solution is needed to correct the vagaries of the state
systems for addressing the claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court and some legal experts have said that such
lawsuits have been clogging dockets around the nation, with most of
the money available for relief going instead to lawyers for
plaintiffs and defendants. It is not unusual for victims to die
before their cases are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In state and federal courts, more asbestos claims are pending
than any other kind of product-liability case. The cases have
proved to be a particular challenge for judges and the courts
because of the nature of the ailments that the substance causes.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to asbestos in the workplace _ from construction sites
to shipyards _ may not manifest itself in harmful ways until
decades later, and illnesses it may cause range from the relatively
minor to the deadly. The AFL-CIO estimates that as many as a
million current and retired members were exposed to asbestos and
that many of them will suffer from debilitating or deadly ailments,
and a judicial study cited by the Supreme Court last year predicted
that there may be as many as 265,000 asbestos-related deaths by
2015.
</P>
<P>
   Last June Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that the
inability of the courts to promptly and equitably resolve asbestos
injury claims ``cries out'' for a legislative solution of some
kind. Republican leaders in Congress say they hope to complete a
bill this year proposed by one of the largest defendants, GAF
Corp., which would limit company liability to the most severe
cases. The legislation has been opposed by trial lawyers and labor
unions, who say it would unfairly limit their access to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation say that the Mississippi cases and
their settlement demonstrates why the system is such a crap-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who wrote the Mississippi settlement resolving the
two cases, David Cosey vs. E.D. Bullard and LeRoy Rankin Jr. vs.
A-Bex Corp., declined to talk about it. The two plaintiff's lawyers
who struck the $160 million settlement, Robert A. Pritchard of
Mississippi and Robert G. Taylor II of Texas, did not return
repeated phone calls last week seeking an explanation about why
they had decided to craft an agreement that favored their
Mississippi clients over their clients in other states.
</P>
<P>
   And the defendants say the decision over who gets paid how much
is not their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allocation issue is one between the plaintiffs' lawyers
and their clients,'' said Michael F. Rooney, who signed the
agreement as president and chief executive of the Center for Claims
Resolution, the consortium of 18 defendants, which included
Armstrong World Industries, Pfizer, Union Carbide and United States
Gypsum, a subsidiary of USG Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos cases began migrating en masse to Mississippi two years
ago after Gov. George W. Bush of Texas signed a law that made it
harder for state courts there to hear product liability cases
involving out-of-state parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi courts in some counties have been a natural
favorite for plaintiffs' lawyers because they offer a number of big
procedural advantages. Juries in those counties rarely, if ever,
rule against plaintiffs in product liability cases, and defendants
do not have the right to perform medical examinations on any
claimants. Under Mississippi law, there are no provisions for class
actions, but instead plaintiffs' lawyers can join large groups of
individuals with very different kinds of claims. (And unlike class
action settlements, settlements in individual cases do not have to
be approved by a judge or made part of a public court proceeding).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the long-arm jurisdictional rules of Mississippi are
so loosely construed that once a case is filed by one state
resident, a lawyer can find dozens or even hundreds or thousands of
other people with no ties to the state but suffering similar
injuries. And defense lawyers say the only way they can challenge
the constitutionality of the jurisdiction rules in Mississippi is
by first taking a case to verdict and risking huge potential
punitive damages, a risk they are not willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that there are state courtrooms in Mississippi
which have become notorious for awarding outlandish verdicts to
asbestos claimants who are not sick and as a result, asbestos cases
from all over the country tend to migrate there,'' said Richard A.
Weinberg, general counsel of GAF Corp., which refused to join the
18 other companies in settling the lawsuits, and is now trying to
attack the case in a proceeding in federal court. ``The Mississippi
settlement is a dramatic illustration that asbestos victims are
mere pawns in a chess game in today's asbestos litigation of the
asbestos lawyers, by the asbestos lawyers and for the asbestos
lawyers.''

 &HT;    The rap on Master P
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That falling star you saw was Percy Miller's No Limit
Sports and Entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's relationship with NBA players is virtually ruined.
Charlotte's Ricky Davis confirmed he has dropped the agency.
Denver's Ron Mercer, expected to be one of the most highly
sought-after free agents this summer, did the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell apart when he started playing basketball and stopped
concentrating on the business,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, also known as rap musician Master P, has continued to
play minor-league basketball after being dropped by Charlotte and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said New Orleans running back Ricky Williams'
incentive-laced contract, universally criticized in NFL circles,
had a bearing on his defection.
</P>
<P>
   PITINO IS SECURE
</P>
<P>
   There are rumblings about Rick Pitino's personnel moves among
Celtics brass, but his position as coach and president is not in
jeopardy. Understand that the remainder of his contract (nearly $29
million after this season) is payable the day after he is let go.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pitino insists deals for Tony Battie and Vitaly
Potapenko were not made unilaterally. ``I don't want a
</P>
<P>
   dictatorship. ...Chris Wallace is the general manager. Every
decision that has been made has been made by Chris Wallace, his
staff and myself. There hasn't been a decision made by me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   RECASNER'S SILENCE
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge Recasner still has not spoken to Derrick Coleman three
months after Coleman drove his car into a truck, leaving Charlotte
teammate Recasner with a collapsed lung and fractured shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't talked to Derrick,'' Recasner said after
rejoining the team for workouts. ``But that's a personal thing. The
team is going through enough right now. ...There were a lot of
things that happened that I was furious about, but what can you do?
You've got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Recasner has more on his mind. His wife's grandmother was
diagnosed with terminal cancer a month after his accident. And his
mother and sister were involved in a car accident on Christmas Eve
in which his sister fell into a coma, suffering minor brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   NOT JOINING JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons' Grant Hill closed the door on the fantasy he might
be a Wizard someday. ``No,'' he said flat-out when asked if he was
intrigued by Michael Jordan's attempt to run the team. ``The
question is, why? Why is he doing this? But, really, I am not
thinking about it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for coming home to play: ``I would probably see too much of
my parents and I don't know if that's good or bad.'' CROSHERE
PRODUCES
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere continues to surprise with Indiana, scoring in
double figures in 11 of his past 13 games and 14 of 19. He's
averaging 9.9 points and 6.3 rebounds overall, replacing Antonio
Davis' 9.4 and 7.0 of last season.

 &HT;    War of words between Riley, Brown
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't invite Miami's Pat Riley and Philadelphia's
Larry Brown to the same trading party. Riley is ripping Brown for
going public with a trade that might or might not happen. Brown has
taken exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've had a hard time with is this: I have a very hard
time with other management that leaks information,'' Riley said,
essentially accusing the Sixers of doing just that. ``That really
bothers me, because you can't trust anybody. And then we're asked,
`Could that possibly take away from the deal?' Well, I'm not going
to get into any of that. But it doesn't help matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said, ``If you have conversations with a team, things
shouldn't be handled publicly. And I'm going to be honest with you:
Over the last 10 days, we've had a lot of conversations with a lot
of teams because we're not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown countered, ``I don't appreciate Riley saying that one bit.
I don't like it at all. We've always dealt with teams up-front.
We've been very honest with them and very sincere, and we'll
continue to be that way. All this stuff about (Jamal) Mashburn and
the Heat did not come from us. It never came from us _ I can
guarantee you that. We didn't say anything. And if Riley has a
problem, he could've called us. We would've told him just that. But
we haven't heard from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Involved in speculation: Miami's Mashburn and the Sixers' Larry
Hughes, Billy Owens, Bruce Bowen and Nazr Mohammed in return.
</P>
<P>
   BACK IN TIME
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets went back in time to acquire Dale Ellis
from Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Ellis is the oldest player in the NBA. The Hornets hope
he will give them the same kind of spark he provided earlier in his
career when he was a sharpshooter in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who declined to return to the Atlanta area and play for
the Hawks two years ago, got limited chances with the Bucks, going
14 games without an appearance at one stretch, then sinking three
triples in a game against the Hawks when George Karl let him off
the leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice opportunity,'' Ellis said. ``It's a great
situation. There's a lot of talent on that team. I think they have
a great chance of winning the Eastern Conference. That's very
appealing to a veteran player like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade was completed Wednesday, and on Thursday, Ellis took a
six-minute turn with the Hornets without putting up a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee was never a place that I wanted to be,'' Ellis said.
``I expressed those same thoughts this summer when I tried to
discourage the trade (from Orlando).''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Stephon Marbury said the Knicks never would go
anywhere with Charlie Ward as point guard. Wednesday, Ward made the
big plays in New York's 90-89 victory over Marbury and the Nets,
scoring 19 with seven assists. ``It's not about me,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Sean Elliott to exhibit some common sense instead
of trying to rush back to action with the Spurs five months after a
kidney transplant. No-nonsense coach Gregg Popovich won't hear of
it ``until I see things in writing.'' Only then is Elliott cleared
to play.

BUSH FOLLOWS IN THE MISSTEPS OF HIS FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ It is sometimes said that the sins of the
father will be visited upon the son.
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, may the syntax.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush of Texas campaigns furiously through this
state in the final days leading up to its caucuses on Monday, he is
amassing examples of twisted verbiage and oratorical bloopers that
bring to mind his famously tongue-tied father's forays into
linguistic limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable one came Friday night, as he addressed a
crowd in Council Bluffs. Bush was entering the span of his speech
in which he normally compares the foreign policy paradigm of
yesteryear, when the country's enemy was the former Soviet Union,
with the situation today, when threats are posed by less
predictable sources.
</P>
<P>
   But he skidded off the rails and into a bog of free-floating
pronouns and absent antecedents. ``When I was coming up,'' the
Texas governor said, ``it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly
who the they were. It was us vs. them, and it was clear who them
was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are, but we know they're
there.''

<P>
   Bush also caromed through a standard riff about how well his
wife, Laura, reflects on him. ``If people can judge me on the
company I keep,'' Bush said, ``they would judge me with keeping
really good company with Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous day, in Pella, family values and grammatical ones
diverged when Bush touted parenthood by saying that he and his wife
understood that their most important job ``is not to be governor or
first lady, in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   That followed a fanciful twist to an oft-used metaphor about
giving people in China a ``whiff of freedom'' or letting them
breathe freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, he got carried away with his oxygenated example
and described the heady possibilities ``when you inhale freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also fond of saying that free trade and the Internet
will ``let freedom's genie out of the bottle.'' Call it the Aladdin
Doctrine.

 &HT;    The real Mookie
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mookie Blaylock finally is having an impact on the
Warriors after early-season injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Hawks point guard averaged 18.3 points and 8.8 assists
over six games after coach Garry St. Jean said he asked Blaylock to
take up more of the team's offensive load because of the rash of
injuries the Warriors have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're beginning to see the Mookie Blaylock we made
the trade for,'' St. Jean said. ``He loves to defend. You give him
the license to operate (defensively). You give him the space and
let him deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBING ISSEL
</P>
<P>
   Dan Issel has become a pariah to NBA officials. He was ejected
for the third time in Denver's first 36 games when he protested a
basket by Jason Kidd in Phoenix. All Kidd did was catch a long
in-bounds pass, turn, take one dribble and put up a shot in less
than five-tenths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Bruce Alexander ejected Issel and when assistant coach
Louie Dampier took a step in Alexander's direction without a word,
Alexander zapped him, too. It was the first technical in Dampier's
career as (ABA star) player or coach.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, NBA top cop Rod Thorn said he reviewed the videotape
frame by frame and determined Kidd had, indeed, gotten off the shot
in time.
</P>
<P>
   PIPPEN STRANGENESS
</P>
<P>
   After comments critical of Michael Finley fueled the Mavericks
to an upset of his Trail Blazers, Scottie Pippen came up with an
even bigger surprise. He requested a meeting with Dallas
owner-to-be Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban told Pippen's agent that he wasn't interested. But Pippen
drove to Cuban's mansion the following morning and waited outside
before eventually being turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban was as upset as anyone in the Mavericks organization about
Pippen's suggestion that he ``wouldn't consider (Finley) an
All-Star just because he's putting up numbers.'' REVENGE FOR
FRANCIS
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets went on a four-game winning streak, there was a
good reason. Rookie Steve Francis averaged 25.8 points, 11 assists
and 5.5 rebounds in that streak. When the Rockets arrived for their
shoot-around in Chicago, Francis walked to midcourt, slammed a ball
into the cross-eyed bull and said, ``You should have taken me.'' He
scored 19 in the first quarter and finished with 27 points, 11
assists in the Houston victory. ... Since Malik Sealy was inserted
into the lineup 15 games ago, the Timberwolves have gone 12-3.
Before Wednesday's win in Utah (where he had 19 points on 5-of-13
shooting), Sealy ranked first among NBA guards, and seventh
overall, in field-goal accuracy (51.2 percent). He was averaging
15.4 points and shooting 57 percent over his last 17 games. The
difference in Sealy this season? ``My confidence is back,'' he
said.

OWNERS GIVE NEW POWERS ONLY TO SELIG

<P>
   Maybe one of these millenniums the owners will get it right.
</P>
<P>
   At about this time six years ago, the owners, acting on the
report of a restructuring committee, altered the powers of the
commissioner. They said they had enhanced the commissioner's
position, but details of the committee's report indicated the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig was one of those owners who denied that the
commissioner's powers had been eroded. ``By clearing up the
ambiguities,'' Selig, who happened to be acting commissioner, said
at the time, ``I really believe the commissioner, in total, is as
powerful as he ever was, and one could make a case for his being
more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did the owners do what they did last week?
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with the erosion of competitive balance, the owners
changed the commissioner's powers to make Selig more powerful than
a locomotive, a third-world dictator and even Kenesaw Mountain
Landis, the first commissioner Major League Baseball employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are different,'' Selig, the commissioner, said. ``But I
would say now there's no question that the commissioner's powers
are greater than they've ever been going back to 1921.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about his view in 1994 that the changes made the
commissioner more powerful?
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas that was absolutely true,'' Selig said. ``But
there were other business areas, as time went on where there was no
question if the powers were not eroded, they certainly were
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Payroll disparity is the reason the owners acted last week to
reverse that direction. Low-revenue clubs felt they faced a bleak
future trying to compete with the high-revenue clubs, and they
wanted the commissioner to be able to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a resolution that asked Selig to use his new
powers and ``take such action as he deems appropriate to ensure an
appropriate level of long-term competitive balance in Major League
Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   One official said, ``If Bud feels competitive balance is
affected, he could do whatever he deemed appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In all of the changes, the clubs acted with trust in Selig and
with confidence that he would not take any outrageous action. ``Bud
builds consensus; he doesn't do anything without talking to the
clubs,'' an executive of one club said.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain or enhance competitive balance, Selig will not
direct the Yankees to send Mariano Rivera to the Minnesota Twins or
the Mets to send Mike Piazza to Milwaukee. But he could alter the
equal distribution of revenue from the central fund so that the
Twins and the Brewers would get more money than the Yankees and the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the high-revenue clubs would go for drastic
distribution differences, but they apparently went along with the
changes. ``I think they understand whatever I do will be in the
best interests of baseball,'' Selig said. ``I have an obligation to
help all 30 franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   But the owners also know that revenue-sharing matters are
subject to approval by the players association because revenue
sharing is included in the labor agreement. Even the commissioner's
best-interests-of-baseball powers can have some checks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, skepticism arose instantly on the other side of
the labor fence. The owners enhanced Selig's powers, according to
one conspiracy theory (not the union's), as a prelude to the next
negotiation with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the owners raised the maximum amount of fines the
commissioner can impose, one lawyer said, ``They're basically
giving him leverage to keep people in line, make them do what they
want done.''
</P>
<P>
   What they want, this lawyer and other players' representatives
speculated, is to negotiate legally to impasse, which they failed
to do in 1994, then implement a salary cap. That step would
precipitate a strike, and there they would go again.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball official scoffed at the suggestion, asking why
having a strong commissioner has salary cap implications. A club
executive said if he were on the other side, he would be concerned
because of the owners' history of labor strategy. But he quickly
added, ``I don't think anyone in ownership can take another work
stoppage.''
</P>
<P>
   The new leverage Selig has to ``keep people in line'' is the
ability to fine a club $2 million, up from $250,000, and an owner,
officer or employee of a club $500,000, up from $25,000. But the
owners went even further.
</P>
<P>
   In the same section where the commissioner is empowered to levy
those fines, among other disciplinary measures, for conduct he
deems ``not to be in the best interests of baseball,'' one
open-ended provision was added: ``such other action as the
commissioner may deem appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, that new provision will last only as long as
Selig is commissioner. It will disappear with his successor,
indicating how much the owners trust Selig but are not prepared to
trust someone sight unseen. The other changes are designed to
remain in the Major League Constitution, which is the new name for
what always had been called the Major League Agreement.

   MOZDOK, Russia _ The commander of Russia's Interior Ministry
troops, which have the main responsibility for clearing Grozny of
separatist fighters, was replaced Saturday as Russian forces
continued to encounter stiff rebel resistance in the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian advance has gone slowly as Russian forces have been
engaged in costly house-to-house fighting. The military said
Saturday that it controlled about one-third of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir Putin signed the order removing
Col.-Gen. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov as commander of Russia's Interior
Ministry forces. He was replaced by Col.-Gen. Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, who commanded Russian troops in Chechnya toward the end
of the 1994-1996 war, which left the nominally Russian republic
with de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Gromov, the Kremlin press secretary, said that
Saturday's command shift was intended to improve coordination
between the Interior Ministry forces and the army.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the most powerful and visible proponent of the military
campaign in Chechnya. His political fortunes soared when the
popular war against the militants got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Russian forces have become bogged down as
they have fought for control of the Chechen capital, and questions
have been raised about the military's capabilities and tactics and
about the low official death toll for Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia renewed its assault on Grozny early last week, vowing to
seize the city in a matter of days. On Saturday, Russian forces
claimed to control Minutka Square in central Grozny. But they also
conceded that success is measured in terms of yards and that some
objectives in the city have changed hands several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy battles are being fought for every house, most of which
the rebels have turned into fortresses,'' Bislan Gantamirov, the
leader of a paramilitary Chechen group allied with Moscow, told the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian military's battle plan, Interior
Ministry troops are doing most of the fighting inside the city.
That is in keeping with the Russian government's contention that it
is establishing order on Russian territory and not waging a war
against its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The army, by contrast, has surrounded the capital and is
supporting the Interior Ministry assault with artillery and
airstrikes. In their drive to take the capital, Russia's military
has poured on the firepower, demolishing apartment houses and
sending thick black clouds of smoke over the city.
</P>
<P>
   There has not, however, always been adequate coordination
between the two forces. One of Gantamirov's fighters recalled
Saturday that his men had asked for Russian artillery support when
they were battling in the streets of Grozny. But instead of
shelling the militants facing Gantamirov's fighters, the Russian
shells fell behind them, blocking their retreat and leaving the
rebels untouched.
</P>
<P>
   According to official figures, Russia's casualties have been
minimal. But those figures are generally regarded to be a gross
underestimate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia also experienced a setback last week when one of the
commanders of its Grozny operation, Army Maj. Gen. Mikhail
Malofeyev, was declared missing in the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers believe he was probably killed in the fighting.
According to one account, he was with the 245th motorized infantry
regiment in the Zavodskoi neighborhood in the western outskirts of
Grozny. Malofeyev hid in a building with some officers and soldiers
when the unit was attacked and was killed, this account said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels claim to have taken him prisoner. Either way, his
disappearance was embarrassing and raised questions about Russian
tactics and coordination among its forces.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the fighting in Grozny Saturday was fierce, the Russians
did better in the southern mountains. They repelled an effort by
the rebels to break through the Russian lines at Duba-Yurt. Russian
forces have blocked the rebel forces in the Chechen highlands, but
the militants are trying to break out and link up with their
comrades in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russians finally captured the village of Vedeno, the
hometown of Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel leader. The village
had been surrounded for some time, and the rebels recently said
that they were withdrawing. Nonetheless, the Russian military
trumpeted the capture as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vedeno is fully under the control of federal troops,'' a
spokesman said.

NEW TACK BY STEINBRENNER 
A BUYER'S MARKET
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-COMMISSIONER-POWER) 
(rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and the New York Yankees are expected to sign their
historic contract this week. The shortstop's seven-year, $118.5
million contract will very likely be eclipsed by the end of the
year, when Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez sign new contracts,
but it is a remarkable step for George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Not the lucrative nature of the deal, but the idea that the
owner is giving that kind of contract to a player before he has to.
Steinbrenner squandered millions with his previous stance against
giving young player multiyear contracts. Other clubs, most notably
the Cleveland Indians, have saved millions by following that
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Bernie Williams of the Yankees and Jim Thome of
the Indians have had parallel careers. In their first five years,
the Yankees paid Williams, working with one-year contracts,
$17,225,000, while the Indians paid Thome, who had two multiyear
contracts, $10.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could have made the math on Jeter's deal easy by
making it worth an even $119 million, or an average of $17 million
a year. But Steinbrenner wanted to stay under $17 million so the
average annual value will be $16,928,571.
</P>
<P>
   A Buyer's Market
</P>
<P>
   Before he signed with Tampa Bay 10 days ago, Steve Trachsel was
surprised that he didn't get more offers as a free agent. In fact,
the pitcher, who earned $5.25 million last year, wound up accepting
a one-year contract that guarantees him only $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what would very likely have happened in past
winters, no one wanted to give an 18-game loser $6 million or $7
million a year for three or four years. Combined with the signings
of several other free-agent pitchers, it appears that clubs
decided, or were persuaded, to avoid the foolish practice of
overpaying for pitchers, desperate though the teams may be for
pitching, just because they were available.
</P>
<P>
   When the free-agent market opened, some of the better starters
available sought what they said was the market price, $8 million a
year, based on the four-year, $32 million contracts Al Leiter
signed with the Mets and Todd Stottlemyre with Arizona last winter.
</P>
<P>
   But only Chuck Finley reached that number, signing with
Cleveland for $9 million a year for three years. Among the others,
Kenny Rogers (Texas) and Aaron Sele (Seattle) came closest at $7.5
million a year, though, as with Finley, some of Rogers' money is
deferred without interest, making the present-day value lower.
</P>
<P>
   Was it smart shopping by the clubs, or was something else at
work?
</P>
<P>
   Some agents suspected something else, whispering the dirty word
collusion, an illegal practice clubs engaged in during the late
1980s that cost them $280 million when arbitrators found them
guilty. But unlike those years, these free agents were able to
change teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not movement collusion, but it was price collusion,''
one agent said, adding that the market initially appeared to be
strong but slowed dramatically at the winter meetings last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, responded Robert Manfred, Major League Baseball's top
labor executive. ``Every once in a while we're entitled to have a
buyer's market,'' Manfred said, suggesting there was greater supply
than demand.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, a busy agent, said he saw no signs of collusion.
``Not at all,'' he said. ``In collusion there was a barrier. In
this market there was merely patience. If there's anything to be
patient with, it's pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras represented four starting pitchers. Two of them, Rogers
and Andy Benes, he said, accepted lesser deals to go to teams they
wanted to play for, Rogers to Texas, Benes to St. Louis for $18
million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares re-signed with Oakland for two years and $8
million but, Boras said, has the option to leave after one year and
seek a more lucrative deal if he has a good year. The agent's other
client, Darren Oliver, signed with Texas for $19 million over three
years after rejecting an end-of-season four-year, $24 million offer
to remain in St. Louis. Boras said he wanted either a three-year or
five-year deal for Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sele could have signed with Texas for four years and $28
million, but he was looking for $8 million to $9 million a year.
The Rangers signed Rogers instead (Oliver came later), and Sele
wound up getting two years and $15 million from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Jocketty, the St. Louis general manager, attributed the
generally smaller contracts to the quality of the crop and the
decreasing number of teams in a position to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope people are trying to be a little more prudent in
how they do their business,'' he said. ``So many people have been
burned on long-term contracts with pitchers.''

A STEALTH CAMPAIGN FOR MCCAIN? UNLIKELY  
 BUSH FINDS 1ST PRIMARY IS NO LAUGHING MATTER  
 NO VOTES CAST YET, BUT RESULTS ARE IN  
 THURMOND QUASHES RETIREMENT RUMORS  
 BRISK WALK HIGHLIGHTS RUN FOR THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H., S.C.)  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Though he is not competing in the Republican
caucuses that will take place in Iowa on Monday, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona is nevertheless a political presence here. The state's
newspapers and newscasts frequently feature reports about him
campaigning elsewhere and, more to the point, most Iowa polls have
him pulling around 8 points, good enough for a third place tie with
two other candidates, Alan Keyes, the conservative commentator, and
Gary L. Bauer, the family values advocate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end in the Iowa caucuses it is not the polls that
count. It is turnout. And in caucuses past, candidates who were a
``presence'' but did not actually participate, that is, candidates
who registered reasonably well in the polls but did not show up
here and had no organization on the ground trying to roust out the
vote for them, mostly ended up little more than political
footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not shown up except for a couple of the nationally
televised debates. And he has no organization here.
</P>
<P>
   Or does he?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that keeps popping up because in states where
the senator is competing, such as New Hampshire and South Carolina,
veterans groups are organized, energized and working hard for him,
showing political solidarity with a man who survived Vietnam. He is
relying heavily on them, and it is tempting to speculate that
veterans in Iowa must also be working for him, quietly but
earnestly, hoping to boost him to a surprise finish on caucus day.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, leaders of Iowa's veterans organizations say they have
had no contact at all with the McCain campaign and have seen no
signs at all that individual veterans or small groups of veterans
are working to get out the vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not happening, however intriguing,'' said Mark
Strack of the Iowa chapter of the American Legion. ``There's no
stealth veterans campaign, no secret phone banks or Web sites or
last-minute mass mailings. McCain said he didn't have the time or
money to come here, and he's stuck with it. And since he hasn't
been working the state for himself, nobody, not even veterans, is
working it for him. Iowa is like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Finds 1st Primary Is No Laughing Matter
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the competition is now like in New Hampshire between
McCain, who leads there, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is
struggling to catch up before primary day, Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when The Telegraph of Nashua asked the governor
whether New Hampshire should always be allowed to hold the nation's
first presidential primary, he replied, ``I'll tell you how happy I
am with the system after the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that quote the next day, Mike Dennehy, McCain's New
England political director, wondered whether it was another of
those George W. jokes, and if so, how it might sit with proud
Granite State voters, who have their own special appreciation for
humor, but not in great measure when it comes to who gets to hold
the first primary. Better, did the Bush quote offer a political
opportunity to McCain, a man of considerable humor himself?
</P>
<P>
   Answering his own questions, Dennehy fired off a news statement
headlined ``Bush Won't Protect New Hampshire's First-in-the-Nation
Status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think a candidate would be a little more clear regarding
the first-in-the nation primary,'' he asserted. ``John McCain
supports New Hampshire's first-in-the nation primary. Now and
forever. He'd move to New Hampshire if he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, amused, or maybe not, fired back with his own
press release, declaring:
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said from the very beginning of this campaign, I
support New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status. As
president, I will continue to support it. As president, I'll
continue to tell jokes. I hope no one loses their sense of humor in
the final weeks of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough already, said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's no sense of humor in the New Hampshire
primary,'' he lamented. ``If there isn't, then we've all got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   No Votes Cast Yet, But Results Are In
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on presidential campaigns is always the
Electoral College tally, with 270 votes needed to win. The official
tally of the Election 2000 votes won't be released until next
January, of course, but an unofficial tally, or sorts, is already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, The Hotline, a popular political tip sheet, takes
a look at the latest presidential campaign polls available (polling
is underway in about two-thirds of the states) and, pretending
those results are the final Election Day results, computes an
Electoral College tally.
</P>
<P>
   The latest calculation was made Friday from 34 polls that pitted
Vice President Al Gore against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But in
only 24 of those polls was the leader safely ahead, that is, ahead
by more than the possible margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner (using only the 24 polls):
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with 256 electoral votes, only 14 shy of the number needed
to move into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He carried 23 of the 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore carried only New York, good for 33 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the tally of all 34 states, with the margin of error not a
factor, Gore manage to pick up five more victories. But Bush still
won that theoretical count going away, 285 electoral votes to 120
for Gore.

   Thurmond Quashes Retirement Rumors
</P>
<P>
   The politics rumor mill never stops grinding, and lately it has
found Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to be good grist.
</P>
<P>
   To hear what the mongers have to say about the 97-year-old
Republican, his estranged wife, Nancy Thurmond, a former beauty
queen who is 44 years his junior, has recently been telling him it
is finally time to retire and, in the same breath, has been
suggesting that she is the logical person to be appointed to fill
out the remaining three years of his eighth term.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond may be 97 and all that. But he has been something of a
fitness fetishist going back to the days when he was a paratrooper
(he jumped into Normandy on D-Day), and he takes huge pride in
being the oldest and longest-serving senator in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, when he had finally had a surfeit of rumors, he
struck back, taking the unusual step of issuing a press release
headlined ``Resignation Rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax,'' he told die-hard constituents who might be concerned
he would cave and leave before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recently received inquiries regarding my so-called
resignation from public office,'' he went on. ``I would like to
clarify for everyone that the fine people of South Carolina elected
me to serve as their U.S. senator for six full years and, God
willing, I have every intention of doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Thurmond also called the rumors ``absolutely false,''
telling The Post and Courier of Charleston that she and the senator
were on good speaking terms and that she had never suggested that
he clear the way for her to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, even if Thurmond resigned, there is no
certainty Mrs. Thurmond would be appointed his successor by Gov.
Jim Hodges. He's a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk Walk Highlights Run for the Senate
</P>
<P>
   A progress report ...
</P>
<P>
   Duane Sand, a Republican political novice who is walking the
wintry breadth of North Dakota (346 miles) to call attention to his
campaign to unseat Sen. Kent Conrad, a veteran Democrat, reports
that he crossed the half-way mark on Thursday, just east of
Bismark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going good, real good,'' he said by cell phone. ``I'm
averaging between 15 and 20 miles a day, meeting a lot of nice
people, spending nights in a Winnebago that's trailing along. Looks
like I'm going to finish at the end of the month, right on time.
And I'm going to win this election.''
</P>
<P>
   But the weather, Duane, the weather in North Dakota in January?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that ... well it's really not a problem,'' he reassured.
``Gets a little blowy and snowy at times. But I'm all bundled up.
Did go down, though, to 50 below the other morning, with the wind
chill. But mostly it's been in the low teens, which is really nice.
That way I don't overheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch you later, Duane.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ We asked two experts with an eye for dramatic flair
how the leading presidential candidates could liven up their acts:
How would you advise the leading presidential candidates to liven
up their acts?
</P>
<P>
   THE EXPERTS:
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Leon, 43: Actor, 43, artistic director of the Alliance
Theatre, and co-producer of the Disney musical ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wolper, 72: Producer, 72, of the miniseries ``Roots,'' the
Los Angeles 1984 Olympic ceremonies and New York's 1986 Liberty
Weekend extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE
</P>
<P>
   Leon: He speaks only with his upper body, which can make his
voice sound thin and defensive. He needs to get out from behind the
podium and use his lower body _ push the air from the diaphragm for
a more resonant delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Wolper: He needs to break out of his standard delivery style,
and more humor would help. I'd run ads that show him in a very
casual, personal setting, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Leon: He's the opposite of Gore in delivery: needs to tighten
up. Maybe he should use the podium more, grab it with both hands
for a sense of stability. He can actually make the audience laugh
too much, needs to close on a very serious note.
</P>
<P>
   Wolper: He needs the weight of history behind him, including his
own experience as governor of Texas. The ads could show that FDR
and Ronald Reagan were both governors of big states, and hey: Texas
is a lot bigger than Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Leon: He's relaxed but he also has the big person's shyness
about his size. He should trust and use that size, move freely away
from the podium. He could really use those big arms to dramatize
big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Wolper: I saw something on the news where Bradley appeared with
several basketball stars, some of whom he played against, and the
guys were just so charming _ compelling speakers, too. They should
run lots of testimonial ads with these guys, which would bring his
image down to earth and broaden his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Leon: He, too, often comes across as angry. I sense there's love
in his heart so we need to see it clearly in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Wolper: America is so hungry for a hero and here's a guy with a
heroic military story _ built-in drama. In the ads he should let
someone else tell the story for him. Can you imagine how effective
it would be if, say, Colin Powell told it?

 &HT;    Political theater: The drama gap
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The story goes that a famous performer, in his final
days, was asked the key to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerity,'' he replied. ``When you can fake that, you've got
it made.''
</P>
<P>
   There, in a nutshell, is one of the toughest challenges facing
the presidential candidates. How to come across as ``real'' in a
political process loaded with the tricks of theater _ that is, the
Unreal? How to bring a rough edge of authenticity to the campaign _
as ``Rent'' and ``The Blair Witch Project'' did in the
entertainment world _ without being too ``fringe''? How to hold
voters' attention in a zillion-channel age while satisfying their
post-Monica yearning for honesty, stability, character?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more skeptical now about a bold assertion made
behind a podium, especially since `I did not have sex with that
woman,''' says Tom Key, the artistic director of Theatrical Outfit,
who learned a lot about the theater of politics in his portrayals
of Harry Truman. ``I tell actors, `Reveal the part of you that's in
the character, don't struggle to be something you're not.' That's
what the candidates need to do _ to show us who they really are,
warts and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Key is one of several producers and directors from the
entertainment world who were given this assignment: Pretend you've
been hired to coach George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley on their dramatic delivery and the theatrical effectiveness
of their ads. As the campaign moves from the rehearsal rooms of
Iowa and New Hampshire onto the broader national stage, how would
you wake up an electorate that seems too cynical, out of touch or
busy tallying its stock earnings to care?
</P>
<P>
   If there's a consensus, it's that these Republican and
Democratic front-runners need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember an election with such mediocre
communicators,'' says David Wolper, the distinguished producer
(``Roots,'' the 1984 Olympic ceremonies) who began his career as a
Democratic campaign-ad producer for California Gov. Pat Brown in
the 1960s. ``You know you've got a flat campaign,'' Wolper added by
phone from his Los Angeles office, ``when the only decent,
passionate orator, Alan Keyes, is so far down in the polls that the
public hardly knows him. The TV ads will have to provide the drama
that the candidates' personalities lack.''
</P>
<P>
   Without that quickening pulse, constituencies who feel
unrepresented in the campaign _ minorities and the young, for
example _ may stay away from voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``These candidates need an agent from William Morris or
something, because political apathy is the worst I've ever seen in
the African-American community,'' says Elizabeth Williams Omilami,
an Atlanta stage and film actress who served as legislative
assistant to her father, Hosea Williams, when he was in the Georgia
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the swiftly changing landscape of political theater,
traditional oratorical skills still matter: witness that four of
the last five presidential elections were won by politicians
especially skilled as communicators: Ronald Reagan (a former actor)
and Bill Clinton. Like Mark Antony in Shakespeare's ``Julius
Caesar,'' their power to sway audiences through emotion and
argument struck fear in their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the case could be made that Clinton and Reagan might
have won with no speech longer than a sound bite: Reagan's voice
wasn't even heard on his devastatingly effective 1984 ``Morning in
America'' ad, a glowing minidrama of Norman Rockwell images.
Clinton's mastery of subtle body language helped clobber George
Bush in a 1992 debate: He stepped deftly from behind the podium to
approach a young girl questioner, while Bush was caught glancing at
his watch.
</P>
<P>
   The directors had a frequent refrain for the younger Bush _
``Stop smirking, get serious'' _ but tended to see Gore as the most
theatrically challenged, so to speak. ``People seem to like Tipper
because she seems less packaged than Al,'' says Chris Coleman of
Actor's Express, a master at eliciting truthful performances, ``so
she should be a visible presence in his ads and public
appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Key noted that Gore looks uncomfortable in front of large groups
(example: his recent, pained ``swaying'' with Coretta Scott King to
``We Shall Overcome'' at Ebenezer Baptist Church). Thus, Key
reasons, ``Al should be shown speaking one-on-one, or with his
family, or to the camera. With Al, quieter might actually be
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Gore's awkwardness could be a strength because it's
so not Clinton. In the wake of Iran-Contra and Monicagate, there's
growing distrust of the orator who is too good, too slick. Former
candidate Elizabeth Dole realized this and, in stage terms, broke
the fourth wall to create theater-in-the-round, roving the stage to
send the message, ``I'll meet you halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, political theater has evolved even further toward the
illusion of nontheater, showing the candidate as rumpled, candid,
cranky, real. Bradley and McCain are cultivating a ``Real Guy''
image, not unlike an off-Broadway producer or independent studio,
to challenge the more carefully groomed front-runners, Bush and
Gore. It's a tricky, risky approach: witness McCain's
controversial, from-the-hip remark about gays recently, and
Bradley's grouchy refusal to answer questions that might
theatricalize and cheapen his private life.
</P>
<P>
   As proven by ``Rent,'' ``Blair Witch'' and ``reality TV'' shows,
the public is gasping for jolts of fresh air _ even with some grit
in it _ and these supposedly ``noncommercial'' shows can be
surprise gold mines. McCain and Bradley appear to be gambling on
this possibility because _ unlike Republican candidates Steve
Forbes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch, whose nontheatricality can be
seen as just plain dull _ McCain and Bradley raise their
unartfulness to an art.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-THEATER THEATER
</P>
<P>
   Directors, like the press, respect this unscripted quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley's really a better actor than Gore, in the
sense that he doesn't seem to be acting at all,'' says Lisa Adler,
co-artistic director of the Horizon Theatre. ``With Al, I can
always tell the things he truly believes in, and the things his
people told him to say. In theater terms, Bradley can do better
improv _ think on his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Key is similarly impressed by McCain's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he continues a tradition begun by Truman, making a
point not to be poised and polished all the time,'' continues the
co-creator of ``Cotton Patch Gospel.'' ``I once heard a dancer say,
`Always lead with your heart, your chest.' That's the open body
language I get from McCain. It's the opposite from, say, Nixon,
hunched over with his arms crossed over his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley represent two very different strains of
anti-theater theater: rough vs. smooth, common-sensical vs.
intellectual. ``Intellectual'' is usually death at the polls.
Alexis de Toqueville, who in 1830 prophesied so well the American
political character, wrote, ``The fittest men would probably have
too much reservedness of manners and severity of morals to secure
an election resting on universal suffrage.'' This truth was borne
out at the polls for such ``class act'' presidential losers as 1952
and 1956 Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson, and it may lurk behind
the published complaints from some Iowa voters that Bradley's
``reservedness of manners'' comes across as aloofness.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniels of Dad's Garage Theatre, 27, has a solution:
``Bradley needs to challenge someone _ perhaps Phil Jackson, coach
of the Lakers and one of his supporters _ to a one-on-one
basketball game. Even a crazy tie would help _ anything but a red
tie! First guy to wear a fish tie would at least take New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   As one who stages improv comedy while serving beer in buckets,
Daniels never reveals when he's putting you on, but his thoughts on
basketball and fish ties have a germ of truth. It's more useful to
see something silly and real than something solemn and dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman recalls that Georgia's Lester Maddox used to beguile
voters by riding a unicycle. Even the usually strait-laced Hillary
Rodham Clinton helped her senatorial cause by cutting up with David
Letterman _ a far, far cry from the Sunday morning ``talking head''
shows that used to be the candidates' sole window in
televisionland. If Minnesota, once considered the most sober of
political arenas, can send a wrestler (in other words, a loud actor
with muscles) to the Governor's Mansion, then what might we soon
expect from, say, Florida and California?
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE THINGS IN REAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   If we are living in an age of irony, cynicism and political
noncommitment, as law student Jed Purdy argues in ``For Common
Things'' _ a recent book of essays both hailed and condemned _
perhaps the next hot presidential candidate will be a thinking
showman who can mix drama and comedy, serious issues and fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaded youth voters want to see politicians as they really are
_ Clinton playing sax on the `Arsenio' show was the best move he
ever made,'' Daniels says. ``The ads need to be big and visually
stimulating _ they could learn a lot from rock videos, as long as
they don't obviously `pander to the MTV generation.' They could
show quick clips of people prospering through the candidate's
programs; the candidate hiking outdoors, meeting celebrities,
playing sports. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads now are all slow and glossy and show the candidates
helping the elderly,'' Daniels adds. ``Why not rap music while
they're helping the elderly?''
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical shaping of TV ads may play a larger role than
ever in the general election, if for no other reason than to fill
the drama gap that the two major nominees are likely to leave. The
last time two unimpressive communicators faced off for president
was in 1988: George Bush and Michael Dukakis. It could be prophetic
that that campaign's most influential GOP ads, according to
Kathleen Hall Jamieson in ``Packaging the Presidency,'' contained
little of the voice or image of the candidates themselves. One ad
was a miniature melodrama noir _ about ``Willie Horton,'' the
murderer furloughed in Dukakis' Massachusetts _ and one was a
comedy, showing Dukakis' head in a loose-fitting helmet sticking
out of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Another invitation for theater to play a large, perhaps
mischievious role in a campaign is when there is general peace and
prosperity and few compelling platform differences. Jamieson notes
that in 1960 the Democratic and Republican nominees _ John F.
Kennedy and Richard Nixon _ were quite close in the polls and on
many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Looming especially large before the camera, then, were Kennedy's
sparkling eye and jaunty toss of the head; Nixon's seemingly shifty
eye and bead of sweat on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   Little things in real life _ big things in terms of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Something to keep in mind, perhaps, as the candidates of 2000
roll toward November, polishing their acting skills.

   ``People are much more skeptical now about a bold assertion made
behind a podium, especially since `I did not have sex with that
woman,''' says Tom Key, the artistic director of Theatrical Outfit,
who learned a lot about the theater of politics in his portrayals
of Harry Truman. ``I tell actors, `Reveal the part of you that's in
the character, don't struggle to be something you're not.' That's
what the candidates need to do _ to show us who they really are,
warts and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Key is one of several producers and directors from the
entertainment world who were given this assignment: Pretend you've
been hired to coach George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley on their dramatic delivery and the theatrical effectiveness
of their ads. As the campaign moves from the rehearsal rooms of
Iowa and New Hampshire onto the broader national stage, how would
you wake up an electorate that seems too cynical, out of touch or
busy tallying its stock earnings to care?
</P>
<P>
   If there's a consensus, it's that these Republican and
Democratic front-runners need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember an election with such mediocre
communicators,'' says David Wolper, the distinguished producer
(``Roots,'' the 1984 Olympic ceremonies) who began his career as a
Democratic campaign-ad producer for California Gov. Pat Brown in
the 1960s. ``You know you've got a flat campaign,'' Wolper added by
phone from his Los Angeles office, ``when the only decent,
passionate orator, Alan Keyes, is so far down in the polls that the
public hardly knows him. The TV ads will have to provide the drama
that the candidates' personalities lack.''
</P>
<P>
   Without that quickening pulse, constituencies who feel
unrepresented in the campaign _ minorities and the young, for
example _ may stay away from voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``These candidates need an agent from William Morris or
something, because political apathy is the worst I've ever seen in
the African-American community,'' says Elizabeth Williams Omilami,
an Atlanta stage and film actress who served as legislative
assistant to her father, Hosea Williams, when he was in the Georgia
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the swiftly changing landscape of political theater,
traditional oratorical skills still matter: witness that four of
the last five presidential elections were won by politicians
especially skilled as communicators: Ronald Reagan (a former actor)
and Bill Clinton. Like Mark Antony in Shakespeare's ``Julius
Caesar,'' their power to sway audiences through emotion and
argument struck fear in their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the case could be made that Clinton and Reagan might
have won with no speech longer than a sound bite: Reagan's voice
wasn't even heard on his devastatingly effective 1984 ``Morning in
America'' ad, a glowing minidrama of Norman Rockwell images.
Clinton's mastery of subtle body language helped clobber George
Bush in a 1992 debate: He stepped deftly from behind the podium to
approach a young girl questioner, while Bush was caught glancing at
his watch.
</P>
<P>
   The directors had a frequent refrain for the younger Bush _
``Stop smirking, get serious'' _ but tended to see Gore as the most
theatrically challenged, so to speak. ``People seem to like Tipper
because she seems less packaged than Al,'' says Chris Coleman of
Actor's Express, a master at eliciting truthful performances, ``so
she should be a visible presence in his ads and public
appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Key noted that Gore looks uncomfortable in front of large groups
(example: his recent, pained ``swaying'' with Coretta Scott King to
``We Shall Overcome'' at Ebenezer Baptist Church). Thus, Key
reasons, ``Al should be shown speaking one-on-one, or with his
family, or to the camera. With Al, quieter might actually be
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Gore's awkwardness could be a strength because it's
so not Clinton. In the wake of Iran-Contra and Monicagate, there's
growing distrust of the orator who is too good, too slick. Former
candidate Elizabeth Dole realized this and, in stage terms, broke
the fourth wall to create theater-in-the-round, roving the stage to
send the message, ``I'll meet you halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, political theater has evolved even further toward the
illusion of nontheater, showing the candidate as rumpled, candid,
cranky, real. Bradley and McCain are cultivating a ``Real Guy''
image, not unlike an off-Broadway producer or independent studio,
to challenge the more carefully groomed front-runners, Bush and
Gore. It's a tricky, risky approach: witness McCain's
controversial, from-the-hip remark about gays recently, and
Bradley's grouchy refusal to answer questions that might
theatricalize and cheapen his private life.
</P>
<P>
   As proven by ``Rent,'' ``Blair Witch'' and ``reality TV'' shows,
the public is gasping for jolts of fresh air _ even with some grit
in it _ and these supposedly ``noncommercial'' shows can be
surprise gold mines. McCain and Bradley appear to be gambling on
this possibility because _ unlike Republican candidates Steve
Forbes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch, whose nontheatricality can be
seen as just plain dull _ McCain and Bradley raise their
unartfulness to an art.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-THEATER THEATER
</P>
<P>
   Directors, like the press, respect this unscripted quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley's really a better actor than Gore, in the
sense that he doesn't seem to be acting at all,'' says Lisa Adler,
co-artistic director of the Horizon Theatre. ``With Al, I can
always tell the things he truly believes in, and the things his
people told him to say. In theater terms, Bradley can do better
improv _ think on his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Key is similarly impressed by McCain's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he continues a tradition begun by Truman, making a
point not to be poised and polished all the time,'' continues the
co-creator of ``Cotton Patch Gospel.'' ``I once heard a dancer say,
`Always lead with your heart, your chest.' That's the open body
language I get from McCain. It's the opposite from, say, Nixon,
hunched over with his arms crossed over his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley represent two very different strains of
anti-theater theater: rough vs. smooth, common-sensical vs.
intellectual. ``Intellectual'' is usually death at the polls.
Alexis de Toqueville, who in 1830 prophesied so well the American
political character, wrote, ``The fittest men would probably have
too much reservedness of manners and severity of morals to secure
an election resting on universal suffrage.'' This truth was borne
out at the polls for such ``class act'' presidential losers as 1952
and 1956 Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson, and it may lurk behind
the published complaints from some Iowa voters that Bradley's
``reservedness of manners'' comes across as aloofness.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniels of Dad's Garage Theatre, 27, has a solution:
``Bradley needs to challenge someone _ perhaps Phil Jackson, coach
of the Lakers and one of his supporters _ to a one-on-one
basketball game. Even a crazy tie would help _ anything but a red
tie! First guy to wear a fish tie would at least take New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   As one who stages improv comedy while serving beer in buckets,
Daniels never reveals when he's putting you on, but his thoughts on
basketball and fish ties have a germ of truth. It's more useful to
see something silly and real than something solemn and dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman recalls that Georgia's Lester Maddox used to beguile
voters by riding a unicycle. Even the usually strait-laced Hillary
Rodham Clinton helped her senatorial cause by cutting up with David
Letterman _ a far, far cry from the Sunday morning ``talking head''
shows that used to be the candidates' sole window in
televisionland. If Minnesota, once considered the most sober of
political arenas, can send a wrestler (in other words, a loud actor
with muscles) to the Governor's Mansion, then what might we soon
expect from, say, Florida and California?
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE THINGS IN REAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   If we are living in an age of irony, cynicism and political
noncommitment, as law student Jed Purdy argues in ``For Common
Things'' _ a recent book of essays both hailed and condemned _
perhaps the next hot presidential candidate will be a thinking
showman who can mix drama and comedy, serious issues and fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaded youth voters want to see politicians as they really are
_ Clinton playing sax on the `Arsenio' show was the best move he
ever made,'' Daniels says. ``The ads need to be big and visually
stimulating _ they could learn a lot from rock videos, as long as
they don't obviously `pander to the MTV generation.' They could
show quick clips of people prospering through the candidate's
programs; the candidate hiking outdoors, meeting celebrities,
playing sports. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads now are all slow and glossy and show the candidates
helping the elderly,'' Daniels adds. ``Why not rap music while
they're helping the elderly?''
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical shaping of TV ads may play a larger role than
ever in the general election, if for no other reason than to fill
the drama gap that the two major nominees are likely to leave. The
last time two unimpressive communicators faced off for president
was in 1988: George Bush and Michael Dukakis. It could be prophetic
that that campaign's most influential GOP ads, according to
Kathleen Hall Jamieson in ``Packaging the Presidency,'' contained
little of the voice or image of the candidates themselves. One ad
was a miniature melodrama noir _ about ``Willie Horton,'' the
murderer furloughed in Dukakis' Massachusetts _ and one was a
comedy, showing Dukakis' head in a loose-fitting helmet sticking
out of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Another invitation for theater to play a large, perhaps
mischievious role in a campaign is when there is general peace and
prosperity and few compelling platform differences. Jamieson notes
that in 1960 the Democratic and Republican nominees _ John F.
Kennedy and Richard Nixon _ were quite close in the polls and on
many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Looming especially large before the camera, then, were Kennedy's
sparkling eye and jaunty toss of the head; Nixon's seemingly shifty
eye and bead of sweat on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   Little things in real life _ big things in terms of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Something to keep in mind, perhaps, as the candidates of 2000
roll toward November, polishing their acting skills.

ARRESTS IN GUATEMALA FOLLOW NEW PRESIDENT'S PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Guatemala's new president, Alfonso Portillo,
took his oath of office on Jan. 14, he pledged to solve the murder
of a Catholic bishop and vigorous human rights activist who was
bludgeoned to death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a week later, Portillo has moved to make good
on his promise. On Friday, the police arrested father and son
military officers, retired Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada, 58, and
Capt. Byron Lima Oliva, 30, and charged them with homicide in the
death of Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' arrest is a victory for human rights groups in
Guatemala, which conducted their own investigation of the killing
and have long pointed to the Limas as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led away in handcuffs by police officers, Lima Oliva
said he was innocent and called the evidence against him
groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a soldier, and I will cooperate with the justice system,''
he said, Reuters news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi's killing was traumatic for Guatemala. It was the most
important assassination of a public figure after peace accords in
1996 put an end to a ferocious civil war that had gone on for 36
years. The killing raised the possibility that Guatemala might
return to the political hatred and violence, especially by the
military, that marked those years.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, who was 75, was beaten to death in his garage on
April 26, 1998, just two days after he released a huge report that
concluded that the armed forces and other government bodies were
responsible for 80 percent of the 200,000 deaths and disappearances
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lima Estrada had been in charge of military intelligence, and he
was a field commander in several strategic rural garrisons during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo was once a scholar of Marxist thought, but he is
associated with the political right in Guatemala that backed the
military governments that unleashed a brutal counterinsurgency
campaign against leftist guerrillas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing the arrests of the Limas to go forward, Portillo
seemed to be seeking to assuage Guatemalans who feared that his
rise to power would bring new tolerance for military violence. The
president has made no public comment about the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who had been a church cook for the assassinated bishop,
Margarita Lopez, was also arrested, as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, government investigators shied away from
charging any military officers in the crime. At one point they
jailed another priest who was Gerardi's housemate, Mario Orantes
Najera, on charges that he used his German shepherd dog, Baloo, to
commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Constable Gerson Lopez, the federal police spokesman,
said the police were also pursuing warrants to re-arrest Orantes
and to arrest Obdulio Villanueva, a former military officer.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes was freed after seven months in jail when forensic
examiners appointed by human rights groups determined that Gerardi
had no dog bite marks on his body.
</P>
<P>
   It was also discovered that a phone call made from the bishop's
residence right after the killing went to a public phone near a
military base, and that a car seen near the residence belonged to
the military.
</P>
<P>
   According to press accounts in Guatemala, a new witness who
connected the Limas with the crime came forward last summer after
hearing a statement by Portillo that he would reopen the
investigation.

FINAL FOUR TEAMS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE 
NO FANFARE NECESSARY 
DIFFERENT APPROACH 
WHY REEVES RETURNED 
REWARDS FOR COLTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League wanted new blood in the playoffs,
and that is exactly what it got. The league is justifiably proud of
its final four because St. Louis, Tampa Bay and Tennessee, and to
some degree even Jacksonville, have overcome traumatic experiences
in their history to reach this point.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have endured years of losing. There have been bad
personnel decisions, bad drafts and bad coaches. That has all
changed and now the conference finalists, some of whom have
blundered for years, have a chance to be excellent for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a while to reach this day.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis began the season with a 45-99 record for the decade,
the worst in the league. Even worse than the hapless Cincinnati
Bengals'. St. Louis turned things around because Coach Dick Vermeil
stubbornly stayed with his offensive philosophy, which preaches
speed and wide-open play.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's history has been so bad that the team was once
nicknamed the Yuccaneers. The franchise was born 24 years ago and,
in its first season, went 0-14. From 1983 to 1994, Tampa Bay had 12
straight seasons with 10 losses or more. This is Tampa Bay's first
conference title game since the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers' fortunes changed with the arrival of Coach Tony
Dungy, a former defensive assistant with Minnesota. His emphasis on
building a solid defense helped erase what had been a pathetic
20-year history of defensive collapses, especially in close games.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rams and the Buccaneers meet in the National Football
Conference title game on Sunday, it will be a clash of
philosophies. But it will also be an impressive statement of how
two men went about things differently and achieved the same
results: giving their respective teams a chance to win a Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is close to the ultimate prize as well, and the most
unusual part of the team's success is its rabid fan support. In the
1980s, when the Titans were the Oilers and played in Houston, the
team had some of the most vocal fans in the league. That support
fell off in the mid-1990s, when the team was still in Houston.
Running back Eddie George remembers several years ago when the
Oilers returned from a road game and two fans were waiting to greet
the players at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the team has played in four different
stadiums in the past four years, so building a fan base has been
difficult. Now, the team has stabilized in Nashville, and Coach
Jeff Fisher's belief in the running game, which is why he drafted
George in the first place, has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Of the conference finalists, only Jacksonville has not undergone
any significant growing pains. Tom Coughlin has been an excellent
coach and evaluator of talent, drafting such players as the Pro
Bowl offensive tackle Tony Boselli. The only bump in the road for
the Jaguars was Coughlin's early coaching style, which was
military-like, and it irked players. Some spoke about how Coughlin
needed to relax, which he eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   These four teams are set up to do well over the next few years,
perhaps more so than traditional powers like Dallas and San
Francisco. That is because many star players on the final four
teams, like George and the Rams' Marshall Faulk, are young, and the
teams are in excellent salary cap position.
</P>
<P>
   So get used to having Tampa Bay and St. Louis hanging around the
top. It could be that way for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Different Approach
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing last week that Michael Jordan had become president
for basketball operations of the Washington Wizards, as well as
part owner, an NFL owner raised an interesting question: why
haven't more prominent, high-profile NFL players entered into
management, or become part owners?
</P>
<P>
   It has happened in the NFL, but it is uncommon, and the reasons
are both simple and complicated. The simple answer is that most NFL
players, even well-known ones like Joe Montana and Lawrence Taylor,
never made the kind of money that Jordan did, which in turn allowed
him to buy into the Wizards. Jordan made hundreds of millions of
dollars in salary and off-field endorsements. NFL players never
earn that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated answer is that National Basketball Association
owners, for the most part, welcome the input and participation of
former players, who have become head coaches, scouts and general
managers more readily than their professional football
counterparts. There remains a bias among some NFL owners and
executives that owners should own, general managers should manage
and players should play, and that any mixture of the three does not
work.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there are exceptions. The Baltimore Ravens' personnel
department is headed by the Hall of Fame tight end Ozzie Newsome.
The Giants, on the other hand, have mostly shied away from letting
former players hold key management positions.
</P>
<P>
   Why Reeves Returned
</P>
<P>
   Why will Dan Reeves return to coach the Atlanta Falcons next
year, after briefly considering retirement? One reason is money.
Reeves has two years remaining on his contract, which pays him $2
million a season. There are few people who can walk away from that
sort of money, no matter how tired they may say they are.
</P>
<P>
   But the other reason has to do with winning, which Reeves
believes the Falcons can do again next season. The key is running
back Jamal Anderson, whose rehabilitation on his injured knee is
going well. With a healthy big back, and a healthy quarterback in
Chris Chandler, the Falcons could easily win 10 games or more next
season. Reeves would like to make one more run, before dropping his
coaching duties and becoming strictly a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Why Reeves Returned
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in NFL history, both conference championships
will feature black starting quarterbacks. This fact has received
little news media attention, and maybe that is a good thing, a sign
of the times. Black players are no longer being prevented from
playing quarterback in the pros, as they were for decades.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee's Steve McNair beats Jacksonville, and Tampa Bay's
Shaun King leads the upset of St. Louis, there will be two black
quarterbacks in the Super Bowl, another first. Doug Williams became
the only black quarterback to win a Super Bowl when he led
Washington past Denver in Super Bowl XXII.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and King are only the fifth and sixth black quarterbacks
to start in a conference title game. James Harris played for the
Los Angeles Rams in the 1976 NFC championship, and Williams'
Buccaneers and Redskins teams went to the conference title
contests, in the 1979 and 1987 seasons, respectively. Randall
Cunningham took the Vikings to the NFC championship game last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards for Colts
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Colts were rewarded handsomely for reaching the
divisional round of the playoffs. Team owner Jim Irsay bought a BMW
worth nearly $90,000 for Coach Jim Mora. The players each received
a DVD player.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Seven presidential contenders scattered
across the flatlands of Iowa on Saturday in a chase for the unsure
and the uncommitted before voters finally have their say in this
state's precinct caucuses on Monday, the first crucial test of the
2000 primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will wound some candidates, embolden others and set
the expectations for the nation's first primary, in New Hampshire,
just eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Since polls have consistently found that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Vice President Al Gore are widely favored in their
parties' voting here, the question among political strategists has
been how much support they can attract. Despite the confidence of
prognosticators, however, polls in this state are notoriously
unreliable because it is difficult to identify caucus-goers. The
judgment day that counts, of course, is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since 1988 that both parties have had
spirited contests here. Buoyed by the support of unions and the
state's top elected Democrats, Gore is trying to pile up a sizable
lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has made Iowa
a priority and pumped more than $2 million in resources here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also has waged an aggressive drive, is trying to beat
back an unflagging challenge from Steve Forbes, the wealthy
publisher who has built a vast organization in Iowa. Bush's
supporters also hope that an impressive showing on Monday will help
him halt any surge in New Hampshire for Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. McCain skipped Iowa and is concentrating on New Hampshire,
where he leads Bush in some surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates are battling Bush and Forbes, largely for
the loyalty of religious conservatives: Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official; Gary Bauer, who headed a conservative
organization, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The die is cast,'' said Steffen Schmidt, a professor of
political science at Iowa State University, who noted that poll
after poll had found Gore and Bush comfortably ahead. ``And I think
that any dramatic reversal of the way things are would be
astonishing. The place has been polled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   As they crisscrossed the state Saturday on planes, vans and
buses, contenders sought to energize their supporters by unleashing
some of their best-known backers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bradley of offering a limited vision and sought to
rally liberals by stumping in Waterloo, northeast of here, with
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Forbes underscored his
conservative credentials by appearing in Sioux City, on the western
border with Nebraska, with Phyllis Schlafly, the anti-abortion
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also in Sioux City, began his day by presenting himself as
an antidote to the embarrassment of the current administration.
``The state of Iowa is the first step in ending the Clinton era,''
he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continued on a bus tour across eastern Iowa and, at a
stop in Maquoketa, suggested that he would be a more visionary
leader than Gore. ``I know we're behind,'' he said. ``Maybe we'll
surprise a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of polls and punditry, the caucuses represent a
transfer of power to ordinary citizens who will make their way to
meetings at places like schools, churches, homes and American
Legion posts in each of the state's 2,131 precincts. Yet for all
the national attention the caucuses draw, only about 200,000 of
Iowa's 1.8 million registered voters are expected to forsake their
Monday night in the name of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While critics argue that Iowans have too much clout, there is no
disputing that many voters here have scrutinized the candidates up
close, because the White House hopefuls have stumped here
tirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fake a few meetings in a giant state where you have a
TelePrompTer,'' said Kayne Robinson, chairman of the Iowa
Republican Party. ``But you can't just fake it here.'' Comparing
the process to inspecting chickens, he added, ``We take their
feathers off.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of taking part in caucuses is far more elaborate
than merely voting in an ordinary primary. The Republicans simply
cast ballots. But the Democrats endure a complicated, often
tedious, procedure in which groups of supporters openly discuss
whom to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to all the caucuses and always have,'' said Gary
Prochaska, 60, a landscape designer from Ames who backs Gore. ``The
caucus is the first choice we have for deciding who runs for
government office. And it is important to me that I am part of that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Faisal, 57, a youth counselor in Des Moines, said she
probably would not decide between Bradley and Gore until she got to
the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the caucus might help me make my decision,
listening to different people talk about the candidates,'' she said
when she came to hear what the vice president had to say at a rally
in Ames on Friday night. ``I really like Bill Bradley, but I don't
know if he can win. The thing that pulls me to his side is that he
is a big thinker.'' But, she added, ``Al Gore is a very intelligent
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Charlson, 25, a graduate student studying genetics at Iowa
State University, said he was vacillating between Forbes and Bush.
``I'll be listening to the remarks this weekend to decide,'' he
said. ``But I will go to the caucus even if I haven't decided
positively on a candidate. It is part of the process _ and part of
the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be ``listening to the candidates this weekend,
right up to the last minute. I mean, on the Republican side we have
six candidates, which is interesting because you hear so many
different sides of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the closing days the Republican contenders have
clashed mostly over who has the strongest stand against abortion.
And the Democrats have tussled over who put forth the best
health-care and education plans _ and would do the most to help
family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Rob Tully, the state party chairman,
said Gore was far better positioned than Bradley. But he left open
the possibility that Bradley would successfully woo new voters who
had not taken part in the caucuses before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president comes out of here with 60 percent and
Bradley comes out with 32 percent, that's a huge win for the vice
president,'' Tully said. ``And I think it may well take Bradley out
of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Tully's Republican counterpart, Robinson, was far more reluctant
to handicap his party's field. But he said he did not expect any
deviation from the basic lineup in the polls of a victory for Bush,
followed by Forbes, with the others well behind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a smidgen of drama left, Robinson could
not keep a straight face when he said, ``The suspense is who's
going to win, of course.'' He added: ``I have to say that; I'm the
chairman. But the only thing that's left is to play a spin game of
how much somebody wins by.''

</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the excitement here was in August, when the
state party staged a straw poll that attracted 25,000 Iowans. The
results were nonbinding, and the competition was largely over which
candidate could transport the most supporters to the event with
enticements of sumptuous food and entertainment. Former Vice
President Dan Quayle and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee,
who had stumped in this state for years, were spurred by their
lackluster showings to withdraw from the race.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the straw poll replaced the actual caucuses in
weeding out the field. Bush placed first in the event, followed by
Forbes and by Elizabeth Dole, who has since quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a cliffhanger may explain why the Heartland Poll,
made public on Friday by the University of Iowa, found that the
number of potential caucus participants was declining rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   A report examining the survey suggested that many Iowans thought
the outcome was ``a foregone conclusion.'' The report went on: ``In
the absence of any burning issues, a significant number of Iowans
will apparently find some other activities more personally
demanding or relevant than the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Iowa is largely one of expectations, so all the
contenders are trying to low-ball their potential. But since Bush
and Gore are the favorites, anything short of decisive victories
for either could make them appear vulnerable as the campaign moves
to a fast-paced calendar of contests. The nominees could emerge by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to tamp down expectations in the final hours of battle,
Bush insisted that he would be delighted if he matched the 37
percent that Bob Dole drew here in a six-candidate field in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that I thought 37 percent would be a pretty good
total,'' Bush said. ``After all, that's the highest that any
person's gotten in the caucuses in a crowded field _ and I hope I
can do that. Sometimes victory may not mean victory. I hope it
means it in my case.'' With a touch of concern, the governor added:
``I'm worried about getting the vote out. The biggest threat is the
people of Iowa not going to the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on Monday, a triumph in Iowa is not
necessarily the first stop on the road to the White House. Bob Dole
was victorious here in 1996, followed by Pat Buchanan and Lamar
Alexander. Buchanan went on to beat Dole in New Hampshire, but Dole
won the nomination and lost the race to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the last time there was a contested Democratic race
here, Dick Gephardt won, followed by Paul Simon and Michael
Dukakis. Dukakis won the nomination but lost the general election.
</P>
<P>
   As campaigns toiled around the clock this weekend to prod their
supporters to the polls, several organizers cited one factor over
which they had no control: the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it snows that night?'' asked Steve Hildebrand, who
runs the Gore campaign in Iowa. ``Our greatest strength is from
seniors _ and it would dramatically hurt our percentage. Seniors
are not going to go out when it snows. They're worried that they'll
slip on the ice and break their hips.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who is stumping here for
Bradley, would not mind a blizzard: ``Maybe if there was an all-out
snowstorm he might even win, because his supporters really do
believe in him.''

DREAM RIDE TAKES HEWITT TO 4TH ROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ ``So do you ever pinch yourself and say,
`Is all this really happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   The question was directed at Lleyton Hewitt shortly after he had
won his 13th tennis match in a row. He has won them all in
Australia, where he grew up and where he is still growing up at age
18. His news conferences at the Australian Open and his forays to
downtown restaurants now draw crowds; his every public utterance is
now scrutinized like evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened so quickly, and I suppose over the last three
weeks particularly,'' Hewitt said. ``It is a dream come true,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Hewitt lost a singles match was in the Davis Cup
finals in Nice, France, in early December, but Australia still won
the cup. And after a very short off-season, which included a
victory parade in Melbourne, he won the tournament in his hometown
of Adelaide and then won the title in the future Olympic city of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, tennis' latest young man in a hurry put himself
into the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time. He
did so with a 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 victory at the Australian Open against
Adrian Voinea of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Australian with the ball cap on backward simmered
but never boiled: a significant change from the sort of
fist-clenching, adrenaline-pumping demeanor that has earned him his
share of hecklers and snippy comments from his fellow
professionals. Hewitt has been working with his coach, Darren
Cahill, on internalizing, on channeling his emotions and energy
into his strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appears to be making a conscious effort to slow down,''
said Peter Smith, one member of Hewitt's sizable entourage when he
plays at home. ``He's not walking about like a caged lion before
every point.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those gathered together in the players' box at Rod Laver
Arena Saturday night were his parents, Glynn and Sherilyn; his
sister, with whom he is playing mixed doubles here; Cahill and
Smith, who has worked with Hewitt since he was 6 years old and
still helps him on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people think he has an effervescent kind of attitude
all the time, but you see him in the caf downstairs and he's not
like that at all,'' Smith said. ``He's just sitting quietly and
getting ready to go play his match.''
</P>
<P>
   In Adelaide, he was booed by some members of the crowd when he
questioned a line call against a fellow Australian, Dejan Petrovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stupidity of the Australian public to knock the
better players,'' Hewitt said afterward. ``I'm not going to change
for a couple of idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was not well received in Australia, which likes its
sports heroes with a healthy dose of humility. Even a
non-Australian, Todd Martin of the United States, recommended that
Hewitt ``be careful'' about his comments. But the public at
Melbourne Park does not seem to hold much of a grudge. He was
cheered unabashedly when introduced, and except for the occasional
sarcastic remark from the stands _ ``Put your hat on the right way
and get serious'' _ there was little to indicate trouble at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to make a brat out of him, but we don't see
it that way,'' Smith said. ``We think he's searching for perfection
out there, and he's not going to take it out on other people as
much as he's going to take it out on himself. A lot of people have
been comparing him to John McEnroe because of his fieriness, but we
really see him as much more of a Jimmy Connors type with the way he
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong whiff of Connors in Hewitt's game: the
attacking baseline style, the two-handed backhand, the medium-size
physique, the effective but hardly overwhelming serve, the
marvelous footwork. And like Connors, who rarely gave points away,
Hewitt is forcing opponents to work particularly hard at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Voinea was no exception, and Hewitt will now face another player
on a roll _ Magnus Norman of Sweden _ in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   That match, scheduled for Monday, will attract plenty of
attention, but the fourth-round match that Australians are most
interested in will take place Sunday, when top-seeded Andre Agassi
faces Mark Philippoussis, the strapping man from Melbourne who is
seeded 16th but has been playing better lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll definitely have a look on TV, because it's going to be a
great match,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt was not the only teen-ager to win at the Australian Open
Saturday night. Serena Williams, the reigning U.S. Open champion,
defeated Sabine Appelmans, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2), to reach the fourth
round. Though Williams did not look particularly sharp in her first
two matches, she was more impressive Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played better and was more mentally stable,'' she said. ``I
still, however, feel that I'm a little rusty, and there is so much
more improvement I can do still.''

CAYARD'S COMPETITIVE ZEAL GIVES AMERICA ONE THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After hundreds of races, a rash of
toppled masts, dozens of blown-out sails, a near sinking, the
elimination of nine teams and the requisite measure of controversy,
two crews in the challenger's trials for the America's Cup remain
standing.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   For on Tuesday, in this charming seaside city that is to yacht
racing what Green Bay, Wis., is to football, sailors from Italy's
Prada Challenge will line up against San Francisco's America One
syndicate in the five-of-nine-race final round for the Louis
Vuitton Cup. The victor will face Team New Zealand for the
America's Cup beginning Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   It's an intriguing matchup. The Prada campaign is financed by
Patrizio Bertelli of the family-owned fashion giant for which the
syndicate is named. Bertelli has good taste and good sense, which
he exhibited when he chose the American-born naval architect Doug
Peterson to head his design team. Peterson's boats have won the
last two America's Cups, with America3 in 1992 and New Zealand in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, America One is led by the lifelong Bay Area
resident Paul Cayard, who, curiously, is more popular in Italy than
Prada's skipper, Francesco de Angelis. Cayard was at the helm of
the Italian Cup challenger Il Moro de Venezia in 1992. Though Il
Moro lost in the finals, Cayard and his crew made a spirited run
that captured the country's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a hero there,'' Bruno Trouble, the former cup
skipper who is chairman of the Louis Vuitton series, said. And
Cayard did nothing to diminish his status Saturday. Before heading
out for a practice session, he conducted a news conference for
European journalists in fluent Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard is more than a talented linguist. According to observers
_ including the New Zealand agency that regulates legal sports
wagering in the country _ he is the odds-on favorite to advance to
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a streetfighter,'' Trouble said. ``It will be very
interesting to see this streetfighter sailing against these
graceful Italians. It won't be very good for them if the racing is
close, because that's what Cayard wants. He gets bored if he's
ahead. But when it's close, no one is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada and America One have met five times thus far in the
challenger's tournament, with America One holding a 3-2 edge in the
series. But Prada lost one race when the boat dropped its mast, and
was only eight seconds behind in another. Clearly, when it comes to
boat speed, the teams reside in a close neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity between them was underscored Friday when, like
boxers disrobing at a prefight weigh-in, the security curtains that
cover each boat's underwater appendages were dropped to reveal the
respective keels, bulbs, wings and rudders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hull forms are similar in beam, though Prada's probably a
touch narrower,'' said the American yacht designer David Pedrick,
who has two America's Cup designs on his resume. ``They have
similar appendages, with squashed cigar-shaped bulbs at the bottom
of a central fin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rudders are just beautiful, elegant blades. America One's
may be a little bigger. They seem to do well accelerating out of
tacks and maneuvering. In that respect, Cayard may have an upper
hand. But the biggest difference is their paint jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble believes the Italians may have a slight edge in winds
ranging from 8 to 12 knots, an advantage that may cancel out
America One's reputation for close-quarters prowess _ and which may
say more about aggressive sailing than about boat design. But
Trouble also knows that Prada cannot depend on receiving a steady
diet of optimum conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather here is very strange,'' he said. ``You can get
four seasons in one day. And America One is the better all-around
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be an unbeatable combination: a versatile yacht captained
by a driven skipper who has won everything in the sport, with the
exception of the America's Cup. And those who know Cayard say he is
acting like a man approaching a date with destiny. So, one asks, is
there anything to stop him from it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only potential problem that I see with Cayard is that he's
doing everything in the compound,'' Trouble said. ``He's raising
money, he's head of the syndicate, he drives the boat. He's
superhuman, but he has a lot on his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Prada triumph, as Trouble knows, the victory will have
historic implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the first time in 149 years that there is no
American boat in the America's Cup,'' he said. ``And that would be
something.''

   NEW YORK _ Had Sammy Maldonado yielded to cultural tradition, he
would have followed the cleat prints of thousands of other Latino
kids onto the baseball field. But fate stepped in when Maldonado
was 8 years old and placed the youngster on a football field.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this son of a diminutive Puerto Rican immigrant is
considered one of the greatest high school running backs in New
York state history and one of the top 20 high school football
players in the nation. Maldonado, who attends Harrison High School,
is only the second high school player in the state to run for more
than 7,000 yards in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Along with rushing for 7,581 yards, Maldonado set a state record
for most touchdowns in a career with 99 _ 15 more were called back
because of penalties _ and is the first player in state history to
win two high school Heisman awards. He also led the Harrison
Huskies to a 12-0 season and the Class B state championship.
</P>
<P>
   After weighing full-scholarship offers to Ohio State, Penn
State, Syracuse and Miami, Maldonado plans to sign a letter of
intent in early February to attend Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Maldonado has been embraced as a role model by New York's
Latino community, from the South Bronx, where his parents made
their first home, to Harrison, where he grew up. In this
soft-spoken, seemingly all-American boy who is more fluent in
English than Spanish, Latins have found a great hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare say that this kid may become the first Latino American
to win the Heisman Trophy,'' said Julio Pabon, founder of Latino
Sports Ventures, a sports marketing firm that promotes Latino
athletes. ``Sammy has managed to excel in a sport that is not
abundant with Latinos _ except maybe as place-kickers. We're going
to see an Hispanic last name on a jersey in collegiate Division I-A
football and maybe one day in the National Football League, and
that is going to be great for the Latin community.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, members of New York City's Latin community and
beyond attended a luncheon thrown by Maldonado's father, Rafael, at
Mickey Mantle's restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. The senior
Maldonado said the celebration was his way of saying thanks to
coaches, teachers, relatives and friends who have supported his son
during his high school career.
</P>
<P>
   But his invited guests, including Jose Torres, the former
light-heavyweight champion, and Freeman McNeil, the former Jets
running back, seized the moment to pay tribute to Maldonado's son,
who received Estrellas del Suturo award (Stars of the Future) from
Latino Sports Ventures and was honored by Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer for his contributions to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy has South Bronx milk,'' Ferrer said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the boy readily accepts the responsibilities that
come with carrying a people's hope on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to rise to the challenge,'' Maldonado said in an
interview. ``Pressure really doesn't affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch, 220-pound Maldonado appears to be the
prototype running back. According to his coach, Art Troilo Jr., the
teen-ager has soft pass-catching hands and a formidable combination
of speed, strength, agility and smarts. A highlight video that was
played for luncheon guests showed one play in which Maldonado took
a handoff on the 15-yard line, darted up the middle, sped around
the left cornerback and dragged the right defensive back into the
end zone with him for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which of his physical attributes was his best asset,
Maldonado said, ``all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run over you or away from you,'' he said
matter-of-factly. ``Whatever comes naturally at the time, I do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Ohio State over Syracuse because he prefers playing on
natural grass. The Carrier Dome, Syracuse's home field, is
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hurt at Syracuse in his last game'' _ a 28-26 victory
over Lackawanna for the state title _ ``he sprained his ankle,''
said his mother, Nereyda, who hasn't missed any of her son's games
and doesn't plan to start now, even though he will be playing
several hundred miles away. ``He said he liked Ohio State because
they like to run the ball a lot and it's more like the high school
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, two of his idols, running backs Eddie George and Archie
Griffin, attended Ohio State. Each won the Heisman Trophy _ Griffin
managed to do it twice in 1974 and 1975 _ and both went on to play
in the pros, George currently with the Tennessee Titans and Griffin
with the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of following in their footsteps,'' Troilo said.
``Sammy has that kind of God-given ability that you can't teach. He
can play anywhere on the football field: defensive back,
linebacker, halfback, fullback. He's a special player. But the best
thing he does is run with the football because of his size,
strength and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Maldonado always knew his youngest of three sons _ Rafael
Jr. is 28 and Thomas is 25 _ had talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since he was 8, he just loved football,'' said Maldonado.
``He played basketball and baseball, but he liked physical
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Maldonado came to New York in 1967 at the age of 17,
discovered he liked the cold weather and decided to stay. He moved
with a cousin to the South Bronx, got a job washing dishes and
moved up the economic ladder to a good-paying job managing 40
parking garages in Manhattan. Shortly before Sammy was born in
1982, the family moved from the South Bronx to a house in Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give the boys a better education,'' their father
said.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Maldonado, who was named New York state Gatorade
Player of the Year, was flown to Hawaii to attend the Hula Bowl on
Saturday. It was his first trip without his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only four days,'' his mother said with a sigh. ``The only
thing is that he will be alone on his birthday on Jan. 22. But it's
good for him to go.''

NETS FIND THE ANSWER TO CEBALLOS' GAME IN BEATING MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ New Jersey Nets coach Don Casey tried
begging and screaming, throwing different defenders and different
strategies at Dallas Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos. But for 44
minutes Saturday afternoon, he could not come up with anything that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Then Casey handed the assignment to the 6-foot-5-inch Kendall
Gill, asking him to slow the inside-outside attack of Ceballos.
What Gill did was take over the game.
</P>
<P>
   First, he poked the ball loose from Ceballos as the burly
forward tried to pound his way to the basket. Then, on the other
end, when Scott Burrell's layup missed, Gill found himself among
three Mavericks and somehow tipped the ball three times in traffic,
finally grabbing it. He then bulled his way to the basket, putting
in a layup and drawing a foul to pull the Nets back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets survived the Ceballos onslaught and their own
lackluster effort to escape with a 98-95 victory over the Mavericks
at Continental Arena. By the final seconds, the problems of the day
were forgotten and Stephon Marbury was leading the crowd in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Gill matched his season high with 23 points and his steal
against Ceballos was his sixth of the game. After Casey switched
the assignment to Gill, Ceballos scored just one more basket in the
final minutes to finish with 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were still not able to secure this victory until Dirk
Nowitzki's desperation 3-pointer fell short as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   After Gill's 3-point play had closed the gap to 91-89, Marbury
tied the score with a jumper with 2 minutes 23 seconds to play.
Dallas moved in front again on a Michael Finley jumper, but Kerry
Kittles hit a 3-point field goal to give the Nets their first lead
since the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, 94-93, with 1:29
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos gave the Mavericks the lead one more time by hitting a
long jumper with 1:11 left after Gill had crossed to the other side
of the floor to double-team Finley. But the next trip downcourt,
Kittles helped out in the lane and swatted a Ceballos layup away,
and Marbury went the distance with the ball to put the Nets in
front to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos came off the bench and hit his first four field-goal
attempts. By halftime, he had piled up 15 points on 7-of-9
shooting. While the Nets switched defenders on him, Ceballos
continued to almost single-handedly match the Nets shot for shot,
adding 15 more points in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn was limited to just nine first-half minutes after
committing three quick fouls, also drawing a technical foul after
arguing an offensive foul call that sent him to the bench. Just
4:36 into the third quarter, Van Horn was on the bench again after
being called for another offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   When he was on the floor, he could do little to handle Ceballos.
Van Horn watched in vain as Ceballos dropped in three consecutive
long jumpers midway through the fourth quarter, prompting the
defensive change after Van Horn was hit with his fifth foul.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who finished with 20 points and eight assists, notched
his 2,000th career assist in the third quarter. &QL;

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI, CUBA RELATIVES REMAIN SPLIT OVER BOY'S FATE, AS
GRANDMOTHERS MEET WITH RENO
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The grandmothers of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez met with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington
Saturday, but hopes for a family meeting that might break the
stalemate over the boy's future still seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us ... returning Elian to his family will honor his
mother's memory, return the family to normality and, more
importantly, return Elian to the normality of life with his father,
brother, family, friends at school, his toys, dog and parrot,'' the
women wrote in a letter they gave Reno during their 45-minute
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be no real progress toward that goal
Saturday. Instead, the grandmothers' visit seemed mired in the war
of words and political posturing that has surrounded the case for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   As his grandmothers met with Reno in Washington Saturday
afternoon, Elian played in the yard of the modest Little Havana
home where he has lived with his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off
Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Family members repeated their hopes that the grandmothers would
come to the house to see Elian, but also repeated their
unwillingness to take the boy elsewhere to meet the women.
</P>
<P>
   According to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez, there has been
no contact between the branches of the family since the
grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, arrived in New
York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't called,'' he said. ``Tell the National Council of
Churches to let them come meet with us, one on one, without that
translator they brought from Cuba. They still are not free to say
what they truly feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, however, told the New York Times Saturday that
they have called the relatives' Miami home over the last four days
but there has been no answer.
</P>
<P>
   The women's trip to the United States was arranged by the
National Council of Churches in Christ, one of the nation's largest
inter-denominational Protestant groups. An affiliated church group
in Cuba asked the U.S. organization to assist in the case, hoping
it might act as a go-between for the boy's return to his home.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, the two grandmothers, both 51,
made no remarks to the press. Church group officials spoke briefly,
saying that they were immediately taking the women back to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   It was Meissner's decision in early January to send the boy back
to his father that triggered the latest round of angry rhetoric and
protests over the case. Both Reno and President Bill Clinton back
the decision to return Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed a federal lawsuit to block
Meissner's decision, with an initial hearing on the case perhaps to
be scheduled in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is expected to be on the agenda when Congress
convenes on Monday, with several representatives saying they plan
to introduce bills to grant Elian citizenship or permanent
residency, which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement to Reno, the grandmothers indicated that they
would go back to Cuba soon _ perhaps within days. They may be
anxious to leave the United States out of concern that Elian's
Miami relatives might file court motions to subpoena them in the
legal proceedings surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not
to his distant family, where they (sic) had not been a previous
relationship,'' the women said in their letter to Reno. ``We only
have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see him, but we
also want to return with him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances of that seemed slim, with the two sides of the family
not communicating and neither side willing to compromise on when or
where they might meet. Indeed, relations seemed to grow only icier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the family say they know best what Elian's mother
_ who drowned on the voyage from Cuba _ would've wanted for the
boy. Both sides say their goal would best honor her intentions and
memory. Both claim the first-grader has told them that he wants to
do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives insist the Cuban side of the family is
being manipulated by Cuban President Fidel Castro, and can't speak
their true feelings. They also say the Cuban relatives have shown
little sorrow over the death of Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the barbs aren't coming from just one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not politicians,'' Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela
Quintana told the New York Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is the well-being of the child. If they're human,
we beg them to think about the child's well-being, too,'' she said,
referring to the Miami side of the family.

RUHIYYIH RABBANI, 89, A LEADER OF BAHAI AFTER HUSBAND'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruhiyyih Rabbani, who became the pre-eminent member of the Bahai
faith after the death of her husband, the last official leader of
the faith, died Wednesday in her home in Haifa, Israel. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahais, who number more than 5 million and believe in the
unity of all religions and the oneness of humanity, emerged in Iran
in the mid-19th century. Mirza Hoseyn, known as Baha Ullah, meaning
Glory of God, is considered the religion's founder.
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandson and Rhiyyih Rabbani's husband was Shoghi
Effendi Rabbani, known to Bahais simply as Shoghi Effendi. Since
his death in 1957, the Bahais have been governed by a legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rabbani, a tall woman with striking blue eyes, had
nonetheless been treated as a link with Bahai's spiritual roots and
accorded special respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was totally venerated by millions of people,'' said Dr.
Firuz Kazemzadeh, a Bahai and former professor of Russian at Yale.
``There grew up over the years an adoration for her, unlike anybody
else in the Bahai community.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lewis, a Bahai and professor of Middle Eastern Studies at
Yale University, said that pilgrims to Haifa, the center of the
Bahai faith, regularly sought out Mrs. Rabbani, who almost always
wore a head scarf to fit in with Muslim women in Haifa. ``People
treated her recollections and interpretations of doctrine with a
special degree of reverence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were at least equally impressed with what Lewis termed her
charisma. ``She was the last of the grand old dames,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Web site for Bahai women (www.bahaiwomen.com), a message
was posted on the day of her death: ``Today is such a sad day _ we
lost the lady of ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sutherland Maxwell was born in New York in 1910 and was the
only child of William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian architect, and
his American wife, May Bolles. Victoria Jones, a spokeswoman for
the American Bahais, said that Mrs. Maxwell was frail and might
have come to New York to give birth as a medical precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxwells were prominent Bahais and visited Haifa several
times. Their daughter met her future husband as a little girl. On a
family visit a few years later the parents were surprised, to put
it mildly, when Rabbani asked for her hand.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no dating, but neither was the marriage arranged.
``The impression one gets is that he sort of knew her and decided
that it was time that he should get married,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Her family's roots in the faith were unusually deep for
Americans, which may have made the East-West match more likely.
Shoghi Effendi's grandfather, Abd ol-Baha, who preceded him as head
of the faith, met Mrs. Rabbani's grandmother in 1898 when she
visited Haifa with a dozen Bahais. It was the first group of
Western Bahais to visit Haifa, and included Phoebe Hearst, mother
of William Randolph Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rabbani worked tirelessly as her husband's researcher and
secretary, drafting hundreds of letters in response to theological
queries. He would suggest what he wanted to say, she would put it
into words, and he would correct it. Many letters ended with a
handwritten note from Shoghi Effendi. Kazemzadeh emphasized that
theological books were entirely Shoghi Effendi's work.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children, and a direct descendant would not
necessarily have become head of the faith anyway; Abd ol-Baha had
skipped a generation to appoint Shoghi Effendi.
</P>
<P>
   But Shoghi Effendi did appoint a group of 30 Bahais to become
what the religion calls Hands of the Cause. They elected nine of
their number to run the religion until a permanent council, called
the Universal House of Justice, could be established in 1963. Mrs.
Rabbani was one of the nine ``hands'' selected. Although she had no
more standing than her colleagues, historians suggest she
automatically had more influence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there was also a deep loneliness. Though she
filled up the years working for environmental causes and traveling
the world to promote Bahai, frequently meeting with heads of state,
acquaintances say she always missed her husband. She wrote a
biography about him called ``The Priceless Pearl'' and a small book
of very sad poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grieved inside, but you wouldn't have known about it
unless you read those poems,'' Kazemzadeh said. ``She was a very
strong person.''

president of B'nai B'rith International in Washington in 1977. He
left in 1987 to become chief executive of the National Council on
Aging, retiring in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Casablanca, Morocco, he arrived in the United States in
1941 and graduated from Queens College in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Thursz was a board member of Sage Publications of California,
publishers of academic journals. During the past two decades he
served on panels like the policy committee of the White House
Council on Aging and the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Hadassah Neulander
Thursz; three daughters, Deborah T. Bleiweis of Cortlandt Manor,

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors, in a series of little-noticed
court filings, have painted the most detailed picture yet of how
Osama bin Laden directed what they say was a worldwide terrorism
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The papers filed in the case depict an organization that used
international companies and a relief organization as cover for its
operations; obtained blank passports from the government of Sudan;
recruited a network of people living in the United States; and
communicated by fax, satellite phone and coded letters, often using
not-so-veiled language.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter between group members, for instance, prosecutors
say bin Laden _ the exiled Saudi financier implicated in the 1998
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa _ was repeatedly
referred to by the code name ``Mr. Sam'' or ``O'Sam,'' and the
group's members in Kenya were called ``the fish people.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI questioned one bin Laden associate in Texas in
1997, a letter went out warning that the man had been confronted by
an ``opposition company called Food and Beverage Industry based in
the U.S.'' This, prosecutors said, was a reference to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was given an extensive interview,'' the letter read. ``Give
my regards to Sam and tell him to take extra precautions cause
business competition is very fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been investigating bin Laden's operations for
nearly five years and has charged him and 16 other people with
conspiring to attack Americans, specifically in the embassy
bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which left more than 200 dead and
thousands injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is said to be living in Afghanistan, remains a
nebulous figure. Until now, authorities have revealed only snippets
from the reams of documents seized from his associates by
investigators, and it remains hazy how much control he has over
them and other followers around the world. The indictments of bin
Laden have offered few details about his organization or his direct
role in acts of terrorism with which he has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors were forced to show their hand recently,
when lawyers for one of the defendants, Wadih el-Hage, challenged
the government's assertion that he was dangerous or likely to flee
the country.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage was arrested in 1998, a year after the Kenyan police,
accompanied by U.S. investigators, raided his Nairobi home and
seized his personal papers and computer. U.S. authorities tied him
to the terrorist conspiracy, and he has been held without bail ever
since under stringent restrictions. He has been barred from talking
or writing to virtually anyone but his immediate family and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to pleas from el-Hage's lawyers for bail, prosecutors
disclosed evidence in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan that
they say shows he was one of bin Laden's most trusted and dangerous
aides, privy to his secrets and a personal courier of his
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   They say el-Hage met with bin Laden in Afghanistan in early
1997, and took orders to his operatives in Kenya to ``militarize''
for the first time. This, the government says, led to the 1998
embassy attacks. The revelation is the closest the government has
come to offering evidence of bin Laden's direct complicity in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also show that bin Laden used a Kenyan charity,
Mercy International Relief Agency, as a front for terrorist
operations, the prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, prosecutors suggested that el-Hage worked closely
with a Muslim religious figure in Texas, who has not been charged
in the case but who they say helped bin Laden buy a jet after he
had moved his operations to Sudan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage, like the other defendants in the case, has pleaded not
guilty, and his lawyers say the government's recent revelations
offer a distorted picture of their client. They say el-Hage, 39, a
naturalized U.S. citizen from Lebanon who lived with his American
wife and children in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, did work for
bin Laden, but only in his legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's recent submissions relating to our client,''
said Sam A. Schmidt, one of el-Hage's lawyers, ``even if you accept
them at face value _ which we do not _ have nothing to do with the
conspiracy to kill Americans, whether civilians or soldiers, but
involve indigenous conflicts overseas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not clear why Kenyan authorities decided to raid el-Hage's
house in August 1997. But the next month, the documents show, el-
Hage was interviewed at length by the FBI and federal prosecutors
in Texas, about a year before the embassy bombings. During that
interview, he disclaimed any knowledge of terrorist activities by
bin Laden and said he had gone to work for a bin Laden company in
Sudan in 1992 as director of international marketing and
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage said he had also acted as a scheduling secretary for bin
Laden in Khartoum, according to the eight-page FBI account of the
interview. He said that he had arranged appointments only for
people who had business dealings with bin Laden's company, and that
another secretary had set up bin Laden's ``secret meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   While working for bin Laden through 1994, el-Hage told the FBI,
he frequently took his family to bin Laden's farms in Sudan, on the
outskirts of Khartoum. Depicting these trips almost as corporate
retreats, el-Hage described picnics and swimming, and sessions at
which bin Laden railed against the corrupt Saudi regime.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly revealed documents emphasize the government's
belief that bin Laden's businesses have all served to conceal his
violent acts. They say el-Hage was bin Laden's primary secretary,
serving as gatekeeper in his Khartoum office, stationed at a door
behind which only bin Laden and one other senior assistant worked.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a mere business functionary, the government says,
el-Hage was a ``front man,'' creating fictitious companies to hide
bin Laden's activities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most significant allegation made against el-Hage in the new
documents is that after returning to Kenya on Feb.22, 1997, he
``played a prominent role in motivating the Kenyan cell into
organizing for violent action.'' According to prosecutors, el-Hage
met with bin Laden and other top members of his organization in
Afghanistan. One report recovered from a computer disk in el-Hage's
Nairobi house, prosecutors say, showed that he had traveled to
Kenya on bin Laden's behalf to initiate a ``new policy'' for the
cell of operatives in Kenya: ``prepare 300 `activists.''' The
report was labeled ``top secret,'' the government says.
</P>
<P>
   The report reveals that another member of bin Laden's cell in
Kenya ``then met with the `engineers' and advised them of the need
to move families to a secure region before the `activism.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report appears to be a summary of recent or proposed
operations. It notes, for example, that bin Laden's operatives
bought Russian Kalashnikov rifles, guns and bombs from their
``Yemenite brothers,'' and had carried out operations in Ethiopia,
especially in its capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of explosions in the other cities,'' the
report read, without elaboration, ``and the brothers are taking up
these operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents appear to be the first in the criminal case in
which the government has tied bin Laden's group to unspecified
violence in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The papers still do not make clear whether the government has
any direct evidence that bin Laden actually ordered the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After his return from Afghanistan, el-Hage sent a fax to an
associate of his boss' in Germany, the government says, reporting
that bin Laden's situation in Afghanistan was ``very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners of the land are cooperating with them,'' he wrote
in the fax, ``and they welcome them.'' He added, ``The situation is
very good, the security is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that ``owners of the land'' is a coded
reference to the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that
rules Afghanistan. There have been conflicting reports about bin
Laden's status. The Taliban have insisted several times that they
are restricting his movements and controlling his access to the
outside world. The memo suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers also shed new light on the long-suspected link
between bin Laden and several relief agencies around the world. The
government says in the documents that a search of the offices of
the Kenyan charity Mercy International Relief Agency turned up
records of calls between its director and bin Laden's satellite
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The government also says it seized a receipt, dated July 24,
1998, just two weeks before the U.S. Embassy bombings, that bore a
reference to ``getting the weapons from Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly revealed details in the government documents also
include information about bin Laden's network in the United States.
Prosecutors have already said he relied on U.S. citizens, in part
because their passports made it easy for them to travel overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the government believes there were two
additional Americans in the United States helping bin Laden.
Neither has yet been charged in the terrorist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and early 1998, prosecutors say, after el-Hage had moved
back to the United States, he remained in touch with bin Laden and
others in his group through the Muslim religious figure in Texas,
Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak's name first surfaced in court last year when
prosecutors identified him as a contact in the United States for
members of bin Laden's conspiracy. At the time they offered no
elaboration. Al-Hallak denied any involvement in violence, and said
he had no idea what the government was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stanley L. Cohen, even said, ``He wouldn't know
Osama bin Laden if he knocked at the door and tried to sell him
Girl Scout cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new documents, prosecutors say Al-Hallak ``provided cover
for el-Hage's business activities.'' One company, Anhar Trading,
created by el-Hage, used Al-Hallak's Texas address as its mailing
address, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   In el-Hage's notebooks, prosecutors say, they found a reference
to his using Al-Hallak to obtain a combat knife and a lock-picking
set. Finally, the government asserts that the imam aided in the
purchase of a jet for bin Laden after he moved to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said of these allegations: ``I'm fascinated to learn that
my client has been connected to an international terrorist
conspiracy led by an elusive and sinister Saudi billionaire by
providing him with a U.S. combat knife. I am sure there is a
shortage of such dangerous weapons in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that the airplane was for bin Laden's businesses. He
said that it was a ``puddle jumper'' and crashed ``as a result of
an overdose of rust.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that bin Laden's group _ in some cases
led by el-Hage _ took elaborate steps to move around the world with
illegal travel papers.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say, for example, that the group's members
operated a ``very professional counterfeiting operation and, at
times, have received blank passports from certain governments,
including Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say that during the raid on el-Hage's Kenya
office, they found a genuine-looking Kenyan travel stamp, which
could be used to make documents appear authentic, and that his
files revealed that he and another associate were providing false
passports for operatives in the Caucasus, as well as for fighters
in Somalia.

will get its first verdict from voters, as the citizens of Iowa
gather in libraries, living rooms and other caucus centers
throughout their state. It is always worth noting that Iowa and New
Hampshire, which votes in 10 days, are rural, conservative and
largely white states with an exaggerated role in the nomination
process. But both states have lively political cultures, and their
voters have shown themselves to be attentive listeners with good
questions for the candidates. As a result, Gov. George W. Bush,
Sen. John McCain, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al
Gore all seem stronger campaigners than they were six months ago,
and their differences are clearer.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Iowa served more to winnow out weak candidates
than to assure victory for strong ones. But potentially strong
Republicans like Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander
have already dropped out, leaving only Bush and McCain as plausible
party nominees. McCain is not even contesting Iowa, reckoning that
his opposition to ethanol subsidies makes it impossible for him to
win there. Accordingly, the only question to be decided Monday is
whether Steve Forbes will do well enough to slow the front-running
Texas governor down in his battle the following week in New
Hampshire, where McCain is ahead in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where a strong organization is needed to get voters
to caucuses, Forbes has built up a sizable Iowa operation, and paid
for it out of his own pocket. Both he and Bush are pursuing the
evangelical vote by stating their opposition to abortion, which
could hurt the party among independent voters in November. Both
also support ethanol subsidies, a favorite of Iowa corn growers,
which shows that their belief in smaller, less expensive government
turns out to be rather selective. That position could also undercut
Bush's message of fiscal discipline should he get the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley and Gore have emerged with
almost complementary strengths and weaknesses. The former New
Jersey senator's most appealing characteristics are his idealism,
his broad-brush policy approach and his determination not to adjust
his understated campaign style according to political winds.
Bradley supporters like to contrast these qualities with what they
see as the vice president's willingness to do almost anything it
takes to win. But the Al Gore who has emerged in recent weeks has
also shown real determination and energy, and a sense of engagement
that his boosters find attractive in comparison with Bradley's
remoteness. Gore's ability to scrap one campaign strategy and adopt
another bespeaks a flexibility and responsiveness to the public
mood that can be as valuable a leadership quality as idealism.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for each party to have only two competitive
candidates at the time of the Iowa caucuses. The vote Monday is
thus not expected to be decisive in the fortunes of any of the four
main contenders. There is an axiom in the political season that the
most important primary season is always the one that occurs next.
This time, it seems safe to say that New Hampshire will be a
sterner test than Iowa for the endurance of McCain and Bradley as
they face candidates with more money and deeper party support.
After the Iowa caucuses, the nominating process explodes into a
more open phase. It could also be over quickly _ as early as March
7, when a mammoth series of primaries occurs across the country.
Voters should be paying close attention to the returns Monday.
Their choices for president in November could be decided in the
next six weeks.

REAL ESTATE: FURNISHING AN APARTMENT ABOVE A STORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Fernando and Amy Saralegui were looking at the
brownstone house on West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth
avenues, one of the loveliest blocks in Greenwich Village, the
broker pulled Fernando Saralegui aside and asked if his wife was
going to cry.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't, but she was far from eager to snap up the warren of
dirty little rooms on two floors that didn't really qualify for the
label ``apartment.'' The place, unused for a while, looked as if it
had been a shooting gallery for drug users, Fernando Saralegui
says. As he walked his pregnant wife through the two-story,
1,800-square-foot space, he cheerfully said, ``And this is where
the baby's room will be,'' and, ``We can put a kitchen here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether or not they were happy about the place, they
almost had to take it, because in the special mathematics of the
Manhattan real estate market, it was a bargain. Fernando Saralegui,
who was looking for space to open a restaurant, was interested in
the empty restaurant downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, Steve Abramowitz, were able to rent the
entire building, including the 120-seat restaurant _ which was
filled with all the necessary equipment _ for $12,000 a month. So
the two floors above almost seemed free. They would have to
renovate, but with a 20-year lease, it seemed worth the investment.
</P>
<P>
   So they signed the lease in April 1998, did cosmetic renovations
to the restaurant, and in October of that year opened L-Ray, a Gulf
Rim bistro that serves such Louisiana specialties as popcorn shrimp
and blackened fish, as well as some dishes that reflect Fernando
Saralegui's Cuban roots, among them slow-roasted pork and Cuban
pressed sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999 they were ready to start work on the space
upstairs. the Saraleguis were living in a one-bedroom apartment on
West 54th Street that rented for $2,300 a month, and they had a
deadline to leave because the place was being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Saralegui didn't have a lot of time, or a lot of money.
Acting as his own general contractor, he had the apartment totally
gutted and began the process of adding new floors and walls,
turning the space into a sunny loftlike duplex.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Saralegui, who until recently worked in marketing for Ralph
Lauren, was able to buy the company's line of furniture at very
deep discounts at a silent auction for employees, so their
floor-through living area is furnished with vivid green Ralph
Lauren couches in front of one fireplace, and an elegant white one
in front of another.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor has a master bedroom, a bedroom for their
daughter and a fairy-tale nursery for the child who is expected on
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling _ with cream, pale blue, and pale green walls _ is
one of serenity, a vast change from its prior incarnation. On one
mantel are simple glass boxes filled with walnuts. A wall fitted
with a long piece of molding at shoulder height holds a row of
paintings and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A Basque kitchen cabinet in the living room, bought from Cobweb
on Houston Street, reminds Fernando Saralegui of his heritage. At
the back, a door leads to a roof that will someday hold a large
terrace.
</P>
<P>
   The Saraleguis had to move in last April, well before the place
was finished. ``You know everything everyone tells you about how
you shouldn't move in until it's finished?'' Saralegui asks.
``Well, they're right.'' Their furniture was quickly filled with
dirt and grime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they were grateful to have furniture at all.
The apartment does not have its own entrance from the outside but
is reached by a narrow staircase from inside the restaurant. When
moving day arrived, and their new appliances and furniture reached
10th Street, it became clear that nothing big would fit up the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Saralegui hired a construction worker with a cherry picker to
come over and hoist each big piece up through the windows, which
were being replaced and hadn't yet been put in.
</P>
<P>
   When they had finally finished renovating last fall, or thought
they had, they had the fireplaces inspected by a chimney cleaner.
It wasn't cold yet, but they were told that if they had turned on
their heat, they would all have died of carbon monoxide poisoning
because the ventilation was inadequate. That forced them into
another renovation, with the walls over the chimneys being torn
apart, and a bill of $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the Saraleguis say, they ran out of money, having
spent $120,000 to renovate. But their results look anything but
bargain basement. In the kitchen, they couldn't afford cabinets
overhead, but at a flea market in the Hamptons they found a large
plate rack that holds their dishes. Some wire racks were found in
the basement of the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As an island, they are using an antique restaurant cart that
Fernando Saralegui bought years ago in New York, with a chopping
block on top that he brought from Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where
he once worked as a bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Saralegui, who left Cuba with his family when he was a
year and a half, grew up in Bronxville and was seduced by the food
of the Gulf Coast during a trip to New Orleans. Mrs. Saralegui, who
grew up in Texas, had just moved to New York, working in
advertising for Texas Monthly, when she met him through friends at
Alva, a restaurant he owned with Charlie Palmer, the well-known
chef of Aureole.
</P>
<P>
   Their attraction, she said, was not instant; maybe, she says
jokingly, it was his ``pleather'' jacket, made of plastic to look
like leather.
</P>
<P>
   She told him she was new to the city and really wanted to meet
people. He called a week later, said he was cooking Tex-Mex for his
family, and invited her to come over. Seven months later they were
married.
</P>
<P>
   Now, working downstairs from his family, Fernando Saralegui can
run upstairs during breaks. Although he studied architecture and
set design at the University of California at Berkeley, he always
loved restaurants, beginning as a busboy in Bronxville, continuing
at Chez Panisse as he worked his way through college, and later in
New York, where he worked at Raoul's and Cafe Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   L-Ray, whose name is an anglicization of El Rey, meaning ``The
King'' in Spanish, has to be a success, he says, because his family
is ensconced upstairs, with furniture and appliances that simply
can't leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' he says, ``like the boat in the bottle.''

REAL ESTATE: AN OLD HOUSE AS A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHERYL P. WEINSTOCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the late 1980s, Margaret Noto lived in a
split-level house in New City in Rockland County and Lester Clark
lived in a contemporary brick ranch in New Windsor in Orange
County, where he enjoyed lounging on his favorite L-shaped,
banana-colored leather couch. Then they met, married and spent
months deciding where to live.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to stay in Rockland County, where she was a real
estate appraiser. He said that he would only move to Rockland
County ``if you find an interesting home for us to live in.'' So,
Ms. Noto Clark said, ``I lured him into the county'' by showing him
what had been built more than a century before as Boulderberg
Mansion, and later operated as a restaurant called Boulderberg
Manor in Tompkins Cove, the northern part of the Town of Stony
Point in Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,500-square-foot Gothic, three-story poured concrete
building, set on four-and-a half acres overlooking the Hudson
River, was built in 1858. There were turrets, nine fireplaces _
seven with marble mantels and one with rosewood _ a widow's walk,
and architectural embellishments inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered coming to the restaurant one night in the 1970s
when the snow was falling, the fireplaces were going and the
libations were good,'' said Clark. ``How could it not be appealing
to live there? Sure, from the building side it was a monumental
challenge of reconstruction. We had a plasterer and painter working
every day here for four years. But life has been good here.''
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed their nightly walks down to their fish pond, walks
that eventually had to be ended as Mrs. Noto Clark became
incapacitated by illness in recent months. And they shared a new
hobby over the decade: going to auctions and fairs throughout New
York and New Jersey to furnish their home with antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was once passionate about his modern leather couch
said that he wasn't sad that it had been barred from a home filled
with eclectic antique and traditional furnishings. ``We've enjoyed
all the times we spent virtually all day at an auction to find that
right piece,'' said Clark
</P>
<P>
   Owning an old or historic home isn't for everyone. Repairs on it
can sometimes be costly, and maintaining its integrity can be
tedious. But many who buy one find that an old, rambling homestead
is conducive to quiet evenings, meaningful roots, and new-found
interests such as antiquing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes learning and sharing good times in an old home can
affect children, too.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Michael Nemirov, an assistant manager at the ABC
Carpet and Home warehouse in New York City, and his wife, Stefanie,
who is in charge of visual displays at the company's store in
Westbury, closed on a 1920s arts-and-crafts house in the Long
Island village of Sea Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Living with her mother and stepfather in two different village
Victorians for 24 years helped shape her job and her own choice of
a home, said Ms. Nemirov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mom definitely had an influence on me,'' she said.
``She would dress me in Victorian clothes when I was little. We
would always go antique hunting. She taught me how to sew. She
helped me appreciate and understand the past and, except for a few
teen-age years, I never felt I had to do something different and go
the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My new home isn't Mom's dream. It's mine. I fell in love with
the beautiful plaster walls and architecture right away because I
respect the past and admire it.''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,
N.J., links the interest in older homes with deeper needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation as a whole is a generation looking for
community,'' he said. ``Many baby boomers have been raised in tract
houses in suburbia and have fond memories of Grandma's house.
They're searching for a sense of community, a place more than a
faceless white-bread suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This translates into their search to live in older
municipalities with older housing stock and viable downtown focal
points. These locations have a good number of historic houses that
have become real treasures after having many green fields bulldozed
over the last 30 to 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of truly antique homes is quite limited. ``There are
less than a dozen 18th century homes on the market in Westchester
County currently available and approximately 50 additional pre-1850
homes,'' said Frederick Rock, a Weichert Realtors agent in White
Plains who specializes in the sale of older and historic homes in
Westchester County. Such houses, he said, range from the low
$200,000 for a fixer-upper to $3 million for prestigious Hudson
Valley estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often these homes are works of art and cannot be compared with
regular wood homes made of plywood and pressboard,'' he said. ``The
only way to preserve these historical homes is to find responsible
buyers for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that one payoff for the buyers is that these homes
can be wise investments. ``I believe within the next five to 10
years you're going to see the prices of these older homes
accelerate to match what has happened in the antiques market,''
said Rock, who is also an antiques dealer, ``because they're an
extension of that market, which has seen prices quadruple in the
last few years. Because their inventory is limited and the
workmanship that is involved in most of these early homes cannot be
reproduced, their value can only increase.''
</P>
<P>
   While the costs of keeping an older house up to current
standards can be a major factor, the investment is worthwhile,
according to Diana Jacob-Rouhoff, educational director of the
National Association of Master Appraisers, based in San Antonio.
``I think an older home that has been properly maintained and
periodically renovated to meet today's standards can net a similar
return to that of a newly constructed dwelling,'' she said, ``and,
in many cases, for a lot less dollars invested.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jacob-Rouhoff said that appraisers ``look at effective age,
not actual age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective age is how the market views that property today
based on maintenance and renovation, not the year it was born,''
she explained. ``In many cases old houses have higher quality
construction than new construction. If we had to build the exact
same house again, the cost would be prohibitive.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, Elyse and Andrew Karlin bought a
seven-bedroom, six-bathroom 1914 arts-and-crafts Tudor in New
Rochelle. Their house has ceramic-tiled mantles, leaded glass
windows, pocket doors between rooms and built-in benches to
disguise radiators.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Karlin, who grew up in a 1930s house in Teaneck, N.J.,
laughed when she recalled the first days in her new home with her
husband, Andrew, an anesthesiologist who grew up in a two-bedroom
apartment in New York City. ``Andrew pulled the covers over his
head and was terrified of what we had gotten into,'' said Mrs.
Karlin.
</P>
<P>
   But within a short time, Andrew Karlin said, ``I began to
appreciate the nature and personality of the house with its simple,
clean style. In a way, this house has brought out things in myself
and called my attention to things that I didn't think were there.
It seems like this is the place I had been looking for lots of
years and couldn't find. It's a place I always look forward to
coming home to.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife added: ``It feels like we were always meant to live
here and our home has changed our lives completely. We share the
riches of the house separately and together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Karlin, who had always been interested in antique jewelry,
became an expert in arts-and-crafts jewelry. She wrote books about
it and is the editor of an antique jewelry newsletter. Together the
Karlins collect arts-and-crafts artifacts, have visited the Gustav
Stickley House in Parsippany, N.J., and twice have gone on vacation
to meetings of collectors and dealers held at the Grove Park Inn,
in Asheville, N.C., a grand monument to the arts-and-crafts style.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes living in an older house can open surprising doors.
Twenty years ago Elisabeth and Richard Voigt bought a 1941
cinder-block home built on 12 acres of woodlands in the Rockland
County hamlet of New City. The house itself had been designed by
the artist Henry Varnum Poor with large, open rooms,
floor-to-ceiling windows, and oak beams.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual aspects of the house include a three-part, pierced tile
overmantel in the living room, a sculptured basin in the downstairs
bathroom and ceramic tiles around the windowsills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is a continuation of what I wanted to accomplish in
my life,'' said Mrs. Voigt, who was formerly an interior decorator.
She was entranced by her home's property and since she always loved
gardening and wanted to enhance the landscape, she went back to
school to learn about how to plan her own garden. Eventually, Mrs.
Voigt became a garden designer and a botanical painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a designer all my life,'' she said with a laugh. ``I
just went from the interior to the exterior because of my home's
own special exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy and Joseph Lillis and their three children moved into a
1911 Italian Renaissance home in the Westchester County village of
Sleepy Hollow three years ago. Their gray, stucco home has large
Georgian columns around the doorway, ironwork over the windows, and
a red, gabled tiled roof.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it has ornate plaster ceiling reliefs, a butler's
pantry, a greenhouse and sleeping porches. It was one of the first
homes built in the Philipse Manor section , said Joseph Lillis, a
corporate loan officer at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lillis said her pride in owning the house has been well
worth the small sacrifices her family has had to make. ``More
things can break in an older home, so every year we set aside about
$5,000 for home maintenance. When something does break it may cost
a little more to fix because it has to be customized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But far from being a burden, their home became a labor of love.
One day while they were working in their yard the grandson of the
man who built the house stopped by with old photographs of it, and
the three had lunch and talked for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Then the home that first appealed to the couple because of its
space and character became more than just a home, but an
interesting link to the past and a new way to relate to people,
said Mrs. Lillis, an elementary school teacher in the Irvington
school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would share the things we learned about our home with our
neighbors and they would share their stories with us,'' said Mrs.
Lillis.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, documenting the history of his home by hanging in it
original maps of the site, a photograph of the house from 1913 and
the first Christmas card sent from the first owners turned into
more than just a hobby for Joseph Lillis. Last year he wrote a
paper commemorating the 100th anniversary of the sale of the
Kingsland Estate in 1899 that led to the creation of Philipse Manor
and he became a trustee of the village Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The path from buying an old house to a more active involvement
in local history is one frequently taken, according to Dean Hughes.
``If it's an extraordinarily long-term project that the couple is
engaged in,'' he said, ``by the time they're done living through
the ordeal, they're going to want to protect that home with a
vengeance, leading many of them to become community
preservationists and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   One community that has benefited by such activism is Sea Cliff
on Long Island's North Shore, which is known for its Victorian and
carpenter Gothic houses. ``People used to suffer living in old
white elephants that no one valued,'' said Gerard Izzo, president
of the Sea Cliff Landmarks Association, which was begun by a group
of village preservationists in the 1970s. ``They were then either
horribly remodeled or torn apart to make room for new housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by sponsoring house tours, how-to clinics and monthly
meetings on local history and architecture, we've reinvented our
suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``when you visit Sea Cliff it's like walking into
a Norman Rockwell painting.''

EDITORIAL: FIGHTING FOR TEACHER QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 23:
</P>
<P>
   This country is facing an extensive teacher shortage and will
need to hire more than 2 million instructors over the next 10
years. But the recruitment effort will be wasted unless the states
raise standards for what teachers need to know, commit themselves
to hiring only qualified teachers and revamp schools of education
that are often no more than diploma mills, offering watered-down
courses and marginal preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has an important role to play in this
process, given that it spends $2 billion each year to subsidize
colleges of education through the Higher Education Act and $8
billion more through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act to provide impoverished children with special courses
like remedial reading and math. Unfortunately, attempts to mandate
better teacher education in exchange for federal aid are meeting
with stubborn resistance, both in Congress and in the states.
</P>
<P>
   The uneven nature of the teacher corps is on vivid display in
the new issue of Quality Counts, an annual study by the magazine
Education Week, which this year focuses on teacher training.
Despite universal agreement that teachers should have basic
literary skills and know the subject they teach, Quality Counts
finds that the states are playing ``an elaborate shell game'' by
setting standards for teachers that are routinely ignored at hiring
time. The study shows that 39 states require prospective teachers
to pass basic-skills tests _ but 36 have loopholes that permit
people who fail those tests to teach anyway. The loopholes are used
most often in inner cities, which typically have more than twice as
many uncertified teachers as affluent districts in the suburbs do.
</P>
<P>
   There is confusion in Congress about how to address this
problem. The House proposes to amend Title I by requiring that
teachers who are hired with federal funds pass state tests on
subject matter. It would also require schools to send notices home
to parents in cases where students are being taught by uncertified
teachers. But this sensible plan is in doubt in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress took a first cut at this problem in the 1998 Higher
Education Act, which included amendments that encourage the states
to improve their schools of education and rely less on unqualified
teachers. One provision of that law requires the states to provide
the federal government with a ``report card'' that rates teachers'
colleges on the basis of how their graduates fare on the
certification exams. Low-performing schools of education would then
be labeled as such _ so that students could choose successful
schools instead _ and could eventually lose federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Texas are all complying
with the law. But several states that fought the legislation in
Congress continued to do so even after it was passed. The federal
Department of Education recently announced that the report cards,
originally due out in April 2000, would be a year late. Several
states and universities have failed to reveal the information
needed for the report card, fearing that exposure will cost them
prestige and federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this legislation was to renovate the teacher corps so
that every child in the country had access to a qualified teacher
by the year 2004. If the federal government backs down now _ or
lets up even slightly _ it will undermine the school reform process
for years to come.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI, CUBA RELATIVES REMAIN SPLIT OVER BOY'S FATE, AS
GRANDMOTHERS MEET WITH RENO

<P>
   MIAMI _ The grandmothers of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez met with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington
Saturday, but hopes for a family meeting that might break the
stalemate over the boy's future still seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us ... returning Elian to his family will honor his
mother's memory, return the family to normality and, more
importantly, return Elian to the normality of life with his father,
brother, family, friends at school, his toys, dog and parrot,'' the
women wrote in a letter they gave Reno during their 45-minute
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be no real progress toward that goal
Saturday. Instead, the grandmothers' visit seemed mired in the war
of words and political posturing that has surrounded the case for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   As his grandmothers met with Reno in Washington Saturday
afternoon, Elian played in the yard of the modest Little Havana
home where he has lived with his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off
Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Family members repeated their hopes that the grandmothers would
come to the house to see Elian, but also repeated their
unwillingness to take the boy elsewhere to meet the women.
</P>
<P>
   According to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez, there has been
no contact between the branches of the family since the
grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, arrived in New
York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't called,'' he said. ``Tell the National Council of
Churches to let them come meet with us, one on one, without that
translator they brought from Cuba. They still are not free to say
what they truly feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, however, told the New York Times Saturday that
they have called the relatives' Miami home over the last four days
but there has been no answer.
</P>
<P>
   The women's trip to the United States was arranged by the
National Council of Churches in Christ, one of the nation's largest
inter-denominational Protestant groups. An affiliated church group
in Cuba asked the U.S. organization to assist in the case, hoping
it might act as a go-between for the boy's return to his home.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, the two grandmothers, both 51,
made no remarks to the press. Church group officials spoke briefly,
saying that they were immediately taking the women back to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written
statement the grandmothers ``made a very compassionate and
heartfelt plea'' but that the matter now is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship
between parent and child and that family reunification has long
been a cornerstone'' of U.S immigration law as well as Immigration
and Naturalization Service practice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Meissner's decision in early January to send the boy back
to his father that triggered the latest round of angry rhetoric and
protests over the case. Both Reno and President Bill Clinton back
the decision to return Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed a federal lawsuit to block
Meissner's decision, with an initial hearing on the case perhaps to
be scheduled in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is expected to be on the agenda when Congress
convenes on Monday, with several representatives saying they plan
to introduce bills to grant Elian citizenship or permanent
residency, which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement to Reno, the grandmothers indicated that they
would go back to Cuba soon _ perhaps within days. They may be
anxious to leave the United States out of concern that Elian's
Miami relatives might file court motions to subpoena them in the
legal proceedings surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not
to his distant family, where they (sic) had not been a previous
relationship,'' the women said in their letter to Reno. ``We only
have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see him, but we
also want to return with him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances of that seemed slim, with the two sides of the family
not communicating and neither side willing to compromise on when or
where they might meet. Indeed, relations seemed to grow only icier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the family say they know best what Elian's mother
_ who drowned on the voyage from Cuba _ would've wanted for the
boy. Both sides say their goal would best honor her intentions and
memory. Both claim the first-grader has told them that he wants to
do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives insist the Cuban side of the family is
being manipulated by Cuban President Fidel Castro, and can't speak
their true feelings. They also say the Cuban relatives have shown
little sorrow over the death of Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the barbs aren't coming from just one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not politicians,'' Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela
Quintana told the New York Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is the well-being of the child. If they're human,
we beg them to think about the child's well-being, too,'' she said,
referring to the Miami side of the family.

   MOZDOK, Russia _ The commander of Russia's Interior Ministry
troops, which have the main responsibility for clearing Grozny of
separatist fighters, was replaced Saturday as Russian forces
continued to encounter stiff rebel resistance in the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian advance has gone slowly as Russian forces have been
engaged in costly house-to-house fighting. The military said
Saturday that it controlled about one-third of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir Putin signed the order removing
Col.-Gen. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov as commander of Russia's Interior
Ministry forces. He was replaced by Col.-Gen. Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, who commanded Russian troops in Chechnya toward the end
of the 1994-1996 war, which left the nominally Russian republic a
de facto independent territory. The current war erupted after
Islamic insurgents based in Chechnya invaded Dagestan, a Russian
republic on Chechnya's eastern border, and after a series of
bombings attributed to Chechen terrorists killed almost 300 people
in Russia and Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Gromov, the Kremlin press secretary, said that
Saturday's command shift was intended to improve coordination
between the Interior Ministry forces and the army.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the most powerful and visible proponent of the military
campaign in Chechnya. His political fortunes soared when the
popular war against the militants got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Russian forces have become bogged down as
they have fought for control of the Chechen capital, and questions
have been raised about the military's capabilities and tactics and
about the low official death toll for Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia renewed its assault on Grozny early last week, vowing to
seize the city in a matter of days. On Saturday, Russian forces
claimed to control Minutka Square in central Grozny. But they also
conceded that success is measured in terms of yards and that some
objectives in the city have changed hands several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy battles are being fought for every house, most of which
the rebels have turned into fortresses,'' Bislan Gantamirov, the
leader of a paramilitary Chechen group allied with Moscow, told the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian military's battle plan, Interior
Ministry troops are doing most of the fighting inside the city.
That is in keeping with the Russian government's contention that it
is establishing order on Russian territory and not waging a war
against its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The army, by contrast, has surrounded the capital and is
supporting the Interior Ministry assault with artillery and
airstrikes. In their drive to take the capital, Russia's military
has poured on the firepower, demolishing apartment houses and
sending thick black clouds of smoke over the city.
</P>
<P>
   There has not, however, always been adequate coordination
between the two forces. One of Gantamirov's fighters recalled
Saturday that his men had asked for Russian artillery support when
they were battling in the streets of Grozny. But instead of
shelling the militants facing Gantamirov's fighters, the Russian
shells fell behind them, blocking their retreat and leaving the
rebels untouched.
</P>
<P>
   According to official figures, Russia's casualties have been
minimal. But those figures are generally regarded by many,
including the Russian soldiers themselves, to be a gross
underestimate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia also experienced a setback last week when one of the
commanders of its Grozny operation, Army Maj. Gen. Mikhail
Malofeyev, was declared missing in the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers believe he was probably killed in the fighting.
According to one account, he was with the 245th motorized infantry
regiment in the Zavodskoi neighborhood in the western outskirts of
Grozny. Malofeyev hid in a building with some officers and soldiers
when the unit was attacked and was killed, this account said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels claim to have taken him prisoner. Either way, his
disappearance was embarrassing and raised questions about Russian
tactics and coordination among its forces.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the fighting in Grozny Saturday was fierce, the Russians
did better in the southern mountains. They repelled an effort by
the rebels to break through the Russian lines at Duba-Yurt. Russian
forces have blocked the rebel forces in the Chechen highlands, but
the militants are trying to break out and link up with their
comrades in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russians finally captured the village of Vedeno, the
hometown of Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel leader. The village
had been surrounded for some time, and the rebels recently said
that they were withdrawing. Nonetheless, the Russian military
trumpeted the capture as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vedeno is fully under the control of federal troops,'' a
spokesman said.

   RYLSTONE, England _ It would hardly occur to someone looking for
exhibitionists to come to the Yorkshire Dales village of Rylstone,
a picture perfect collection of cottages and a duck pond on the
road between Skipton and Kettlewell.
</P>
<P>
   Much less would someone seek them out among the sisterhood of
the Women's Institute, a wholesome rural service organization known
for ``jam and Jerusalem'' _ the home bottled preserves from English
country kitchens and the Blake poem enshrining ``England's green
and pleasant land.''
</P>
<P>
   So it provoked some wide-eyed interest when word went forth from
this pastoral place that 11 members of the Rylstone and District
chapter of the Women's Institute, ages 45 to 66, had decided to
substitute the usual images of watery sunsets and hiking paths
bursting with buttercups on their annual calendar with pictures of
themselves with no clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   But what proved even more surprising than the event was the
response to it.
</P>
<P>
   The women had come up with the attention-getting notion as a way
of raising money for leukemia research, a mission that took on a
poignant urgency after the husband of one of their members died of
the illness. They hoped that by the deadline of their campaign
sales of the $8 calendar might reach $2,000. It reached $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another unexpected reaction, their calendar, a discreet and
tasteful sendup of the garage mechanic model, brought forth
thousands of letters from middle-age women saying that the serenity
and confidence of the village women had restored their own flagging
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our 50s, and it doesn't bother us, and that seemed to
come across,'' said Tricia Stewart, co-owner with her husband of a
medical software firm. She introduces herself these days as Miss
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to say, how absolutely bloody marvelous!'' wrote a
Bristol woman in her mid-40s. ``I have no intention of reaching my
50s, 60s, 70s or more and lying down for the rest of my life, and I
know that a lot of other women out there need to see that they
aren't expected to either.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Liverpool said, ``It makes us oldies feel better
about ourselves _ quite uplifted, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A man from the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland said the
calendar had enabled him to convince his 47-year-old wife that a
recent mastectomy didn't make her ``any less desirable.'' And
another man exulted, ``How wonderful to see real women instead of
stick insects with pouty lips and pipe cleaners for legs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The women, who call their fund-raising effort the Calendar Girl
Campaign, have seen their own daily calendars fill up with events
ranging from agriculture and amusement fairs to network television
interviews to the annual Woman of the Year dinner in London and
modeling appearances on the catwalks of fall fashion week. Like all
successful enterprises, they started a Web site
(www.daelnet.net/rylstonewi/).
</P>
<P>
   Royal courtiers in London, hearing the women were in town,
invited them to Buckingham Palace to hand-deliver calendars for the
queen and the queen mother to a gold-braided equerry. ``A really
dishy young chap,'' confided Angela Baker, 54 (Miss February).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But none of it seems to have gone to their heads. When Matthew
Freud, great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, who is the moment's hottest
celebrity public relations man in London, invited them in to
discuss corporate sponsorship, they gleefully told him they had
never heard of him. ``The whole time,'' Ms. Baker said, ``I thought
his name was Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   They also won't be doing another calendar. ``We couldn't repeat
the success, and we'd lose the novelty,'' said Moyra Livesey (Miss
May), a 51-year-old nursing home manager.
</P>
<P>
   The women first thought up their daring venture in 1997, a time,
they said, before any of them had heard about ``The Full Monty,''
the hit film about a group of men who bare it all in nearby
Sheffield. ``We partly did it out of devilment,'' said Lynda Logan
(Miss July), a 56-year-old painter. ``But the top and bottom of it
was that we were so shocked by John's death that we would have done
anything to draw attention to the tragedy of his illness.'' John
Baker, 54, a national park officer in the Yorkshire Dales, died in
July 1998, only five months after falling ill.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan was to have Ms. Logan's husband, Terry, a former
professional photographer, set up the shot, then duck into a side
room while she snapped the shutter. But on the day of the shoot
itself, the women overcame their inhibitions with generous amounts
of red wine and let Logan, 61, go ahead and do the whole job
himself. ``We're all great friends, so there was no
embarrassment,'' Ms. Livesey said. ``In fact, watching each other
covering ourselves strategically with sieves and plants and apple
presses and the like was tremendous fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The women maintain their Women's Institute image by wearing
pearls in all the shots. The pictures are in black and white,
except for the presence of a bright yellow sunflower in every
frame, a symbol that commemorates John Baker, who busied himself
planting sunflower seeds during his illness but didn't live to see
them bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The calendars were a hit from the moment they were published in
April, and no objections came even from quarters the women were
wary of. Their husbands and children all applauded their
initiative, and the chairman of the parish council said only,
``Well, I've seen more than that over the garden fence.''

<P>

<P>
   Reporters from the London tabloids who showed up with money to
pass out for gossip found no one to spend it on. A television
interviewer, frustrated that not even the local churchman had a bad
word to say about the appearance of strippers in his flock, said,
``So will it be Methodist ministers posing this way next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the Rev. Keith Hopper responded. ``They'll pay us to
keep our clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The urge to bare all has now spread to other organizations
around England, many with causes of the same traditional bent as
the Women's Institute. Those stripping for charity have included
Countryside Alliance chapters, pro-hunting groups, sports clubs,
farmers from Devon, chefs in Suffolk, a Royal Air Force pilot team,
a fire brigade in suburban Manchester and the Sir Watkins
Williams-Wynn's Hunt in Cheshire, which Prince Charles has often
ridden with.
</P>
<P>
   With all this shedding of cricket whites and jodhpurs going on
across Britain, the only reported moment of embarrassment occurred
in the countryside outside Prees Higher Heath in Shropshire.
</P>
<P>
   David Higham, 41, an editor of a hunt supporters' magazine, was
being photographed astride a mountain bike driving feverishly
across a stream with his arms bent low against the handle bars and
his bottom, clad only in a black bikini brief, held high in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a passing neighbor, he waved.

   First-time home buyers often find they need to learn some terms
of art when shopping for a house. Someone in the market for a house
in move-in condition, for example, may not want to spend time
looking at a property that ``needs a little TLC.''
</P>
<P>
   But decoding ads for houses is child's play when compared to
figuring out the terminology used when people are selling a co-op
or condominium apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no uniform, accepted standard for sales
advertisements for apartments,'' said Arthur I. Weinstein, a
Manhattan lawyer who is also vice president of the Council of New
York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ``And that can sometimes create
a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vexing issues that arise when a co-op or
condominium is being sold, Weinstein said, relates to the way the
size of the apartment is measured and expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four different concepts floating around,''
he said. ``And while they all describe the size of the apartment in
terms of square footage, they each calculate square footage using
different methods.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Weinstein said, while a ``rational standard'' for
describing the size of an apartment might seem to be to measure
only the usable space in the apartment, that is not the measurement
used in most listing agreements and sales advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually use the gross square footage standard,'' he said,
explaining that with such a standard, the entire footprint of the
apartment is included in the calculation of its size. That means
that rather than just measuring each room in the apartment and
adding up the measurements, gross square footage often includes
closets, alcoves, interior hallways and even the floor space
occupied by interior walls.
</P>
<P>
   It is thus easy to see, he said, that the difference in total
size using each of the two methods can be significant. And if that
isn't confusing enough, he said, there are other measurement
standards used for condominiums _ such as adding the unit's share
of common areas of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concept from the commercial real estate field that
has spilled over into the condominium sales market whereby an
apartment's total square footage includes that unit's share of
common areas of the building,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it would not be unusual for the floor
plans of a condominium to include in an apartment's square footage
calculation the apartment's proportionate share of exterior
hallways, stairwells, elevator shafts, ventilation shaft and
mechanical rooms. In fact, he said, some condominiums even include
proportionate shares of common areas like lobbies, laundry rooms
and storage rooms in individual apartment-size measurements.
</P>
<P>
   And if that isn't problematic enough, there are even differences
in the points from which measurements are made.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Binder, principle of Bellmarc Companies, a Manhattan
brokerage, said that one common calculation method directs that
measurements be taken from the exterior face of the building to the
center line of the hallway that lies outside the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen an apartment that had a couch located at the
center line of the outside hallway,'' Binder said. The only thing
worse than having an ``official'' measurement that does not
accurately reflect the usable size of an apartment, he said, is
having an ``informal'' calculation based upon the seller's own
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times sellers will tell brokers that they have, say,
an 1,800 square-foot apartment and the broker will then rely upon
the seller's statement,'' he said. ``But if it later turns out that
the seller was wrong, the broker could have a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the issue of apartment size has become so confusing
and, at times, contentious, that some brokerage firms _ Binder's
included _ have directed their agents to exclude
total-square-footage representations of an apartment's size from
advertisements and listing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our customers have been frustrated that they cannot
get a representation as to the exact size of an apartment,'' said
Clarke Halstead, president of the Manhattan brokerage that bears
his name. ``But we live in a litigious world and if a broker
provides an incorrect representation about the size of an apartment
to a buyer, and the buyer later experiences buyer's remorse, he can
try to use the broker's misrepresentation as a way to get out of
the deal or even sue the broker if the deal has already gone
through.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Halstead said, his agents are now being directed to
provide buyers only with the measurements of major rooms in an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And since ceiling height is a valuable virtue of an
apartment,'' he said, ``we even have to be careful about saying how
high the ceilings are.''
</P>
<P>
   And while size clearly matters for purchasers of New York City
apartments, there are other matters that can cause problems if
buyer, sellers and their agents aren't clearly understanding one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very careful about pet and sublet issues,'' said
Halstead, explaining that a representation by a broker that a
building has a ``liberal sublet policy,'' or ``allows pets,'' could
come back to haunt the broker if the policy turns out to be less
liberal than the seller makes it seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues that buyers should talk over with their
lawyers,'' Halstead said, adding that even if an existing policy is
what the seller says it is, that is no guarantee that the policy
will be the same on the day of closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules often change, and they sometimes change without
notice,'' he said. ``One day the board may decide that there are
too many Fidos in the building, and that's the end of the old pet
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that another area
that creates some confusion among buyers relates to the use of
exterior spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apartment may be advertised as having a terrace, a balcony,
a patio or a roof garden,'' Cholst said. ``And at times, some of
the terms are used interchangeably.''
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter, he said, there are varying rights that a
shareholder or unit owner may have to exterior space. In most
cases, for example, a balcony is considered to be part of an
individual apartment, thereby providing the apartment owner with
the exclusive right to use the area. A terrace or patio, however,
can either be all private or part private, part common area.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cholst said, while owners of adjacent apartments
may have exclusive rights to use the portion of a terrace, patio or
roof garden outside their apartment, there may be other portions of
the space that are considered common areas available for use by
other shareholders or unit owners.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, it is not uncommon for the owner of a
penthouse apartment to have the exclusive right to use a portion of
the space outside the apartment. But, Cholst said, if the roof
space beyond the penthouse owner's exclusive use area can be used
by other shareholders or owners, then it is critical for a
prospective buyer to obtain a specific representation as to the
area to which he or she will have exclusive rights.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, even having the right to use a portion of the
area outside one's apartment exclusively provides no guarantee that
a neighbor's use of his or her space _ or everyone else's use of
common areas _ will not diminish the value of the amenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the house rules allow nightly parties with music,'' Cholst
said, ``a buyer who needs to get up early on weekends might want to
think twice about buying an apartment near the swimming pool.''

EDITORIAL: PUTIN'S RISKY COURTSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 23:
</P>
<P>
   By striking a parliamentary deal with his presumed arch foes,
the Communists, Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, has
deepened the mystery over what he believes and how he intends to
lead Russia. The alliance seems to reflect cynical opportunism on
both sides rather than ideological affinity. But Putin would have
done better to join forces with centrist groups committed to
political democracy and market-oriented reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In parliamentary elections last month, Putin's Unity party came
close to ousting the Communists as the largest single voting bloc.
His closest allies then seemed to be a variety of small centrist
groups broadly favorable to reform. If Unity had formed a coalition
built around these groups, as expected, it would have marginalized
the power of the Communists and ended their ability to block needed
economic measures like tax rationalization, bank restructuring and
stronger bankruptcy laws. A reform alliance might also have
permitted ratification of the 1993 nuclear arms reduction treaty
with the United States, which has been blocked by Communist
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Such a coalition would not necessarily have been easy. The
majority it produced would have been thin and vulnerable to
defections. It might have awarded the parliamentary speaker's chair
to one of Putin's few remaining formidable political rivals, like
Yevgeny Primakov, or another former prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin. But for all its potential problems, a centrist alliance
would have better served Russia's long-term interests. Putin has
given an unfortunate boost to the Communists' waning power.
</P>
<P>
   While the Communists are more numerous, more disciplined and
perhaps even more docile than the fractious centrists, they are not
a force for reform. Their role could become even more reactionary
if Putin decided to move in an authoritarian direction. In that
case the Communists might prove all too willing to back additional
powers for police and intelligence agencies and new restrictions on
individual and press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reform and centrist parties, unexpectedly frozen out
of power, have boycotted the parliament's initial sessions. Several
may now field candidates to challenge Putin in the March 26
presidential elections, a healthy development.
</P>
<P>
   Those elections, if nothing else, will further clarify Russia's
political course. There remains a real but remote possibility that
someone will win an upset victory over Putin. That would make the
current alliance between the Kremlin and the Communists largely
irrelevant. If, as widely predicted, Putin emerges with a strong
electoral mandate and a four-year term of his own, he will then
have to decide whether he wants to maintain this alliance, and if
so, how he means to use it.  &QL;

JETS START TURNING ATTENTION TO FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fractured state of the New York Jets is starting
to heal with the likely ascension of Al Groh to head coach. That
announcement is expected Monday and will give the club a field
leader for the first time since Bill Belichick shocked just about
everyone by resigning on Jan. 4 after a day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Groh's elevation should stabilize a jittery coaching staff that
understandably feared drastic changes if the new owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV, had decided against Bill Parcells' recommendation of
Groh, and went outside the organization for his head man.
</P>
<P>
   It is also expected to have a ripple effect on the team, since
several free agents could be influenced to stay knowing that their
roles, and their coaching staff, will remain largely intact.
Certainly, cornerback Marcus Coleman has said that will be a factor
in his decision. It is less certain what impact this stability will
have on linebacker Mo Lewis, who could be asking $2 million more
than the Jets are offering.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets aren't on the field these days. And while the front
office has continued to operate under Parcells _ he dispatched his
coaches and scouts to the Senior Bowl after his scouts had also
worked the East-West Shrine Bowl _ the next order of business is
determining how long Parcells wants to be the boss.
</P>
<P>
   It is his choice. Johnson says it will be for as long as
Parcells wants. But Parcells is apparently not interested in being
a longtime caretaker. Last year, he told Leon Hess, the Jets' owner
who died in May, that he would retire after the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has a proprietary feel for the club, though, not only
because he made winners out of losers and changed the course of one
of football's most troubled franchises. He has spoken of the
Belichick mess as occurring ``on my watch.'' He feels a
responsibility to Hess and he has come to respect Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for the near term Parcells wants to get everything
righted. Groh has never dealt with the new reality of free agency,
which now is as important as the draft in building a club. Parcells
is also familiar with the nettlesome issues of salary cap and
long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 58, Parcells has made one major career decision:
he won't coach. Now the question is, does he take the Jets for the
next few months into the draft _ as the Dolphins' Jimmy Johnson is
doing with his replacement, Dave Wannstedt _ and then step down? Or
does Parcells continue into the season, and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to free agency, and the draft, Parcells will be
actively involved in the expected compensation battle with the
Patriots for Belichick's services. Although NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue has been unable to broker an agreement between the two
teams, representatives of the Jets and the Patriots were talking
over the weekend. The Jets could turn the tables on New England,
which received four draft choices, including a first-round pick,
over three years to allow Parcells to become the Jets' head coach
and master in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What is Belichick worth as coach and general manager of the
Patriots? New England could make a low offer, but then what would
that say about how the Patriots regard him?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots choose 16th in this year's draft, while the Jets
choose 18th. The Belichick situation is going to consume Parcells
for the next few days after the Groh announcement. And then comes
the free-agency period.
</P>
<P>
   Groh understands what it is like to work for Parcells. He has
been with Parcells for nine NFL seasons, starting with the 1989
Giants and continuing at New England, before the Jets. The pair
actually go back to 1968, when they were assistants together at
West Point. They hooked up again in college at Air Force in 1978,
when Parcells was the head coach and hired Groh as his defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The first move Groh is likely to make is to promote Romeo
Crennel to defensive coordinator. Crennel, who was with Groh and
Parcells in the Giants and Patriots days, is also being considered
for that post with Cleveland. If Crennel remains a Jet, he may also
continue to coach the line, although he would probably get an
assistant to help at the position. Belichick held the dual roles of
defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach, but Eric Mangini
helped out with the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Groh will need to find a linebackers coach and also someone to
coach the defensive backs. So while the transition to Groh is the
smoothest the Jets could have made under the circumstances _ unless
Parcells had picked up the reins again _ there will still be some
upheaval among the coaches.

MARGARETE SCHUETTE-LIHOTZKY, NOTED AUSTRIAN ARCHITECT, 102 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margarete Schuette-Lihotzky, an Austrian architect known for her
work in Weimar Germany and for being jailed for her role in the
Austrian resistance against Nazism, died on Tuesday at a hospital
in Vienna. She was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scheifinger, president of an organization of Austrian
architects and related professionals, summed up her importance in
an Austrian daily newspaper, Der Standard: ``With her concern for
social welfare and her unyielding anti-fascism, she erected
socially significant road signs for the Republic of Austria that
extended beyond her artistic field of endeavor.'' Miss Lihotzky was
born in Vienna, the daughter of an Austrian civil servant. In 1915
she enrolled in what is now the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna.
She studied architecture and went on to design structures including
public housing for working people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926 she moved to Germany. There she became a member of a
team assembled by Ernst May, who was Frankfurt's architect and
overseer of city planning in the late 1920s. Peter G. Rowe, a
Harvard professor of architecture, wrote about her work in his book
``Modernity and Housing.'' A particularly interesting and
praiseworthy achievement of hers, Rowe wrote, was her innovative
design of a standardized kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kitchen in the form of a laboratory, with specific
types of work surfaces, drawers, and cabinets for specific
functions and utensils,'' he wrote. Mass production of her kitchens
began in 1927; 10,000 of them were added to housing units in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 she married Wilhelm Schuette, and the couple moved to
the Soviet Union in 1930. Her work ranged from architectural
designs for kindergartens to planning for heavy industry centers.
In 1938 she took a post with the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul
and designed school buildings. In the late 1930s she joined the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 she journeyed from Turkey to Austria on a clandestine
mission involving Austria's Nazi resistance. Accounts of her
resistance activity differ, but a Swiss newspaper, Neue Zuercher
Zeitung, reported last year that she went to Austria to intensify
the relationship between the Istanbul section of the Austrian
Communist Party and the resistance network inside Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vienna she worked closely with the leader of the resistance
movement, Erwin Puschmann,'' the Swiss newspaper said. But during
the war, ``She was arrested and condemned to death,'' the account
said. ``At the last moment, her sentence was commuted to 15 years
in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the newspaper said, she was released from a
prison in southern Germany. An Austrian television film about her
experiences, ``One Minute of Darkness Does Not Make Us Blind,'' was
made in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 she returned to Austria, where she became the leader of
the Federation of Democratic Women, which was close to the
Communist Party, to which she still belonged. Her party membership
prevented her from getting more than a handful of architectural
assignments in that period of Cold War tension.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1980 she received the Architecture Award of the City of
Vienna. She went on to receive other honors and was much written
about by the press at the time of her 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 she was offered the Austrian Medal for Science and Art,
but she declined it then because it would have been presented by
Austria's president at the time, Kurt Waldheim, who had been
accused of suppressing his Nazi-era past. Years later, she accepted
it.

`SENATOR HILLARY' IS BAIT IN MAYOR'S PLEA FOR CASH ACROSS U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of conservatives across the country have been
receiving frequent fund-raising letters in recent months from a
newfound pen pal back East. ``Does Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
sound good to you?'' begins one, and if that scenario does not make
the recipients wince and lunge for their checkbooks, another is
soon presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most political observers,'' the letter warns, ``believe that
Hillary Clinton is merely using this race as a steppingstone to
even higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters are signed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's
probable opponent in the New York Senate contest, and they have
been very successful at coaxing political contributions. Giuliani's
campaign announced last week that it had collected $12 million in
1999, by far a record for the year before a Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani is hoping that his accomplishments as mayor will
convince voters that he deserves to go to Washington, he is
discovering that when it comes to amassing a treasury, an equally
formidable asset is Mrs. Clinton, otherwise known in these letters
as ``leader of the ultra left-wing Democrats,'' ``darling of the
left-wing elite'' and ``champion of every left-wing cause you can
imagine.'' Not to mention purveyor of ``radical schemes for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups began using Mrs. Clinton's probable
candidacy as a direct-mail fund-raising vehicle nearly a year ago,
but the Giuliani campaign started only last June, and the strategy
promptly proved to be a bonanza. The mayor's advisers say 40
percent of the donations collected by the campaign originate from
direct mail, while the rest come through fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers decline to say what percentage of the direct-mail
donations are from outside of New York, but they acknowledge that
it is significant. So even as Giuliani tars Mrs. Clinton as a
carpetbagger with no ties to New York, his own campaign is thriving
from out-of-state money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers describe the language in the letters as
outlandish, saying the mayor is collecting political money by
pandering to arch-conservatives out of touch with the views of most
New Yorkers. The mayor's advisers respond that people support him
largely because of his record, and say Mrs. Clinton's supporters
have made vitriolic attacks on him that she has not denounced.
</P>
<P>
   Most Senate candidates seek donations through mass mailings.
They rarely harvest much money out of state. What it takes is a
polarizing figure like Mrs. Clinton or, on the other side, Sen.
Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is the bete noire of
liberals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is very probable that anyone running against Mrs.
Clinton would be flooded with donations from across the nation,
political consultants say. When Giuliani ran for re-election in
1997, he did little, if any, direct-mail fund-raising. About 85
percent of the money he took in was donated by New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to learn how to press the right partisan buttons, the
Giuliani Senate campaign has retained Richard A. Viguerie, who is
considered a mastermind of conservative direct-mail solicitations
and has turned demonizing the Clintons into a standard appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Viguerie, who helped draft the Giuliani fund-raising letters,
has worked for Helms, Pat Buchanan and others with far more
conservative views on abortion and other social issues than the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Viguerie spearheaded the direct-mail operation in 1994 for
Oliver North, the Iran-Contra figure who set a record for
fund-raising in a Senate race by a nonincumbent. North, a Virginia
Republican, collected $21 million, much of it in small donations,
in his losing bid to unseat Sen. Charles Robb. It is likely that
Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton will each collect more, in what could be
the most expensive Senate race ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign has also bought lists of potential
contributors from a company that offers ``Anti-Clinton Republican
Revolutionaries,'' ``Dole Supporters'' and ``Capitalist
Contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will generally not receive these letters. In fact,
the Giuliani campaign is mounting something of a two-pronged
direct-mail effort. In writing to New Yorkers, the campaign takes a
less pointed approach, mindful that even Republicans in the state
have not been as hostile to president and Mrs. Clinton as their
brethren elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The New York letters dwell more on the mayor's record on such
issues as crime, welfare and the economy and often note his ties to
New York. There are fewer references to the ``left-wing'' ideology
of Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who has lived in New York most of my life and
understands the needs and concerns of the people,'' he writes, ``I
think I'll have a very powerful advantage as I take my message to
the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which has raised $8 million, has also
undertaken a strenuous direct-mail effort outside of New York, and
her celebrity has no doubt helped her to raise far more than a
first-time candidate would otherwise be expected to collect. But
because Giuliani does not evoke such passionate feelings outside of
New York, the Clinton campaign has not tried to construct its
appeals around the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign's appeals generally do not refer to
Giuliani, instead denouncing attacks by unnamed opponents. ``They
can launch an anti-Hillary Web site,'' she wrote in a recent
letter. ``They can use their limitless war chests to run negative
television ads. They can publish mean-spirited books and press
releases. But they can never stop me for standing up for what I
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers said they had expected that Giuliani
would try to capitalize on antipathy toward Mrs. Clinton
nationally, conceding that among some conservatives, she was even
more unpopular than her husband. But, they said, they were taken
aback by the language in some of the letters sent by the Giuliani
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fund-raising letters are filled with vicious attacks
against Hillary,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton
campaign. ``They sound like they were written by Jesse Helms or
Rush Limbaugh. It's clear that the mayor is working very hard to
cozy up to the far right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager and an
architect of his direct-mail strategy, said such criticism was
hypocritical. He said some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters had
publicly insulted Giuliani, without drawing any protests from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme a break,'' Teitelbaum said. ``For the past six months,
Mrs. Clinton's surrogates have been bashing the mayor in the most
pejorative terms _ that includes James Carville, who referred to
the mayor's supporters as goons and thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum disputed comments from Mrs. Clinton's advisers that
the mayor was tapping into a ``network of right-wing donors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When are they going to stop claiming everything is a result of
a vast right-wing conspiracy?'' Teitelbaum said. ``Our support is
here and across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides sniped over the phrasing in the letters,
political consultants were marveling at the response. When most
campaigns begin direct-mail operations, they lose money on their
first round of letters because the donations _ generally 1 or 2
percent of recipients respond _ total less than the cost of the
lists, postage, printing and other items.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaigns often make money on subsequent mailings
because they focus on those who gave in the first round. A donor
who contributed $100 is much more likely to give again before the
election than an untested prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most campaigns, Giuliani's began earning money on its
first round of mailings, campaign officials said. By the end of
1999, it had accumulated a list of 90,000 donors, most of whom gave
small amounts and could be expected to donate more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal situation is running against a polarizing candidate
who is known nationally,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican
consultant not involved in the Senate race. ``Suddenly, instead of
being able to raise money in the district or state, your universe
is anybody who is alive. In all likelihood, Giuliani has only
scratched the surface.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one room, visitors pretend to be police officers
and are suddenly confronted by a gunman who fires at them, on film,
with the unfaltering aim of a desperate criminal.
</P>
<P>
   In another room, they watch as brainstorming police chiefs,
speaking from multiple video monitors, grill a precinct commander
about a rising burglary rate.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, at a mock crime scene, visitors examine the
broken glass, forgotten crowbar and grimy carpet of an apartment
where there has been a burglary to test their analytical skills
against those of veteran detectives. And around the corner they
pause at a wall of tributes to several of the 580 New York City
officers who have died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   With interactive exhibits, computer simulations, vintage
uniforms and antique badges, the New York City Police Museum, which
officially opened last week on lower Broadway in Manhattan,
presents a multifaceted view of the rigorous, clearly dangerous, at
times political and often tedious life of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the museum, which is privately run with city
support, is to preserve artifacts of New York Police Department
history, to educate people about the history and sacrifice of
police work and to correct what some police officials say are
distortions in the portrayal of the police by members of the media
fascinated by the sensational or scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said at its opening
on Wednesday, ``will show young people and the citizens of the city
what the NYPD really does, not as it's shown in TV shows or the
movies.'' The real story, Safir said, is that ``police officers
don't join the force for adventure, they join it for service.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the museum comes as police officials are striving
to focus attention on the recent achievements of the department,
including a historic reduction in crime, that have been
overshadowed often in the last year by accusations of brutality and
racial insensitivity rising out of the fatal shooting of Amadou
Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents and tourists alike will now have a place they can go
to find out the real stories behind the best police department in
the world,'' Safir said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians who visited the museum, however, said they felt
the exhibits were too sunny in their depiction of the police. Some
police scandals are passed over too lightly, they said. Others are
completely omitted. For example, none of the exhibits touch on the
story of Frank Serpico, the officer whose revelations about police
payoffs led to the Knapp Commission hearings in 1970. Similarly,
there is no mention of the 1930 Seabury Investigation into
widespread organized-crime payoffs to politicians and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a puff piece, a self-delivered valentine,'' said Mike
Wallace, a historian and a co-author of ``Gotham: A History of New
York City to 1898'' (Oxford, 1998), a Pulitzer-Prize winning book
that devotes many of its pages to the story of the police in New
York. Wallace said he believed the Police Museum was obligated to
treat its subject matter in a more complex fashion that paid
attention to all sides of a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are interested in raising some important questions
about the history of the police, this is not the place to get it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another historian, however, said that museums of this type often
avoid airing any dirty laundry. The Fire Museum in New York, for
example, does not chronicle blunders that might have led to
firefighter deaths, nor does the Transit Museum catalog fatal
subway accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at what are your expectations when dealing
with a police museum that is sponsored by a municipality,'' said
Andrew Darien, a historian who was associate curator of ``New
York's Finest,'' an exhibit about the police at the New-York
Historical Society in 1998. ``I have been to many police museums
and none of them deal with what you and I may think are historical
questions about substantive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Police Museum, Steven Rubenstein, said its
curators were interested in presenting a variety of material but
were hampered by limited space. ``They could not address
everything,'' he said. But the museum is considering rotating
exhibits that may touch on issues of corruption as well as efforts
by the Internal Affairs Bureau to combat it, he said.

HEALTH CARE ISSUES DOMINATE STATE LEGISLATURES

<P>
   BOSTON _ When Massachusetts lawmakers returned to work this
month, these jumbo-sized, hard-to-chew items were on their
legislative plate: the financial meltdown of the state's biggest
health maintenance organization, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care;
rising prices for prescription drugs, and the lack of an HMO
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   And more: the confidentiality of medical records; prompter
payment by insurers; long-term care; nursing salaries, and on and
on, for at least 400 bills related to health care.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplated the labor ahead, the Massachusetts
legislators could at least console themselves that they were far
from alone.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
health care issues made up a greater proportion of bills in state
legislatures around the country than any other topic in 1999, about
27,000 bills out of about 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 of those health care bills became law last year.
Although fewer state legislatures are in session this year _ 44 as
opposed to 49 _ already 16,000 health care proposals, again the
largest proportion of 104,000 bills on the table, have carried over
or been introduced for 2000. A good percentage will pass, said Lee
Dixon, director of the health policy tracking services of the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every likelihood that the states will continue to
enact legislation that addresses the concerns of the citizens of
the states around access to care, managed care and cost of health
care,'' Dixon said. ``It's a populist issue. It's not a Republican
or Democratic issue. It's state legislators and legislatures trying
to address the needs of their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Congress is stuck on many critical health care
questions, some state lawmakers say they feel as if they are
bearing the brunt of the burden, struggling to fill the most gaping
holes in the medical system. They cannot wait for Congress, they
say, to tighten controls over managed care, to expand health
insurance coverage, to begin addressing the rise in demand for
long-term care, and more.
</P>
<P>
   While the states can serve as laboratories for what later
becomes federal policy, some legislators say the load is feeling
awfully heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As state lawmakers, we recognize that this has fallen to us,
but I think you would be hard pressed to find many legislative
leaders in the country who don't think the time is ripe for a
national health policy of some sort,'' said state Rep. Gerard M.
Martineau, the Democratic majority leader of the Rhode Island
House. ``Some sort of solution is necessary. It's just too big, and
we've been doing the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, lawmakers have just finished helping to assure
the transition of 125,000 patients to new health care plans after
Harvard Pilgrim pulled out in an earlier admission of financial
defeat. In the coming weeks, Martineau said, lawmakers will try to
fashion some relief for companies whose health insurance premiums
have gone up from 12 percent to 60 percent as a result. They are
considering a plan to help small companies form groups to gain
lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now, Martineau said, is how the state can prevent such
crises in health maintenance groups and ``how we can act as a
facilitator to improve the affordability and accessibility of
health care to our citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar focus prevails in Wisconsin, where state Sen. Russell
S. Decker, a Democrat, said that three competing proposals to help
older people pay for prescription drugs were in the works, along
with plans for a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the speaker of the House of Representatives is
proposing a broad program to expand health insurance coverage for
working people and children.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it is not clear how extensively Gov. George Pataki
and the Legislature will deal with the issue in the current
session, particularly because they have enacted a host of laws
intended to protect patients in managed care plans. The laws ranged
from one requiring medical plans to release detailed information
about their policies and another making it easier for people with
debilitating illnesses to receive treatment from specialists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature is expected to deal with a related measure
this year. It would give consumers better access to doctors'
disciplinary and malpractice history. HMOs do not include such
information with the names of the doctors on their provider lists,
and doctors are usually reluctant to volunteer the information to
patients. HMOs are are not required to provide the information.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has already been passed by the Democrat-led Assembly,
but has yet to be taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is also wrestling with health care issues, including
a $150 million bailout of the HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, a
Democratic push for an HMO bill of rights, and Gov. Christie
Whitman's veto of a bill that would have required health insurers
to cover infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the Connecticut Legislature, Democrats in the House of
Representatives are proposing measures that would expand the reach
of a state health care program for children and lower the cost of
prescription drugs for the elderly. Last year, the Legislature
passed a law that created an Office of Managed Care Ombudsman,
appointed by the governor, to look into patient complaints against
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly are
pushing for prescription drug subsidies for the elderly and greater
rights for members of health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures in almost half the states this year will be
considering bills concerning the quality of health care provided,
most focusing on managed care, said Dixon of the conference of
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislatures, said Dixon, are ``where we have seen,
over the last four or five years, the nation's health policy is
really kind of shaped.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Few states seem to be in quite the health care fever that
prevails in Massachusetts, where the current crises mix with a
tradition of leadership on innovative health care laws. The state
extended health insurance coverage to children in 1996 when the
Legislature increased the cigarette tax to finance the cost. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., used the bill as a model in helping to
write federal legislation that allowed millions of children to have
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Massachusetts Legislature voted to subsidize small
businesses that paid 50 percent of the insurance premiums for
lower-income employees. The same law offered the employees
financial help in paying their share.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mark C. Montigny, a Democrat and the chairman of the
Senate Ways and Means Committee, said, ``I expect the first quarter
of the year to be heavily dominated by prescription drug issues and
HMO reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature enacted a law last year protecting patients
whose health groups failed _ just in time for the financial crisis
at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Harvard Pilgrim, one of the oldest
and most respected nonprofit HMOs in the country, disclosed tens of
millions of dollars in losses early this month and was placed in
court-ordered receivership, leaving 1.3 million members in
Massachusetts in a health care quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is also still coping with the aftermath of a
federal judge's ruling that the state's HMOs are not required to
provide an option of full prescription drug coverage to older
citizens. The state is moving toward a plan to buy drugs in bulk to
help get discounts for the elderly and others, but the issue
remains a burning one.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the pharmacy issue, the federal government has just
abdicated its role,'' said State Rep. Harriette L. Chandler, a
Democrat and chairwoman of the Legislature's Joint Committee on
Health Care. ``I think the prescription issue should be handled at
the federal level, and I think people are saying, `The system is
broken, and how do we fix it?'''
</P>
<P>
   So heavy is the focus here on health care that Montigny _ who
admits he has a passion for the topic _ estimates that he spends
more of his own time and his staff's time on it than any two or
three other issues combined.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Massachusetts lawmakers said they put such heavy
emphasis on health care in response to demands from their
constituents. They are ``closer to the ground'' than their
congressional counterparts, they say, and when a doctor tells
unhappy patients to complain to their local politicians, the state
lawmakers tend to get the phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published on Wednesday,
voters named health care as among their top concerns, with 32
percent of 1,027 surveyed saying the price of health care was
``extremely important'' to them and 31 percent saying the same
about the number of Americans with no health insurance. In
addition, 26 percent said that medical care available in health
maintenance organizations was extremely important to them.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, all the state action on health care is good, said
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national group
for health care consumers. Their explorations of various options,
Pollack said, ``augur well for more comprehensive action, either by
additional states or by the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as broadening health insurance coverage for children,
Pollack said, the states have been leaders in passing protections
for patients in managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``As both these examples illustrate, you can't
systematically achieve the kind of change that's needed without
partnership from the federal government,'' particularly because of
the enormous amounts of money needed to expand health care
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislatures do have certain advantages. They are not
as hampered by the lobbies that often block federal health care
bills, state lawmakers say, and they tend to work in a more
bipartisan fashion on health care than Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so much they can do, they say, and they
foresee no respite soon.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no major federal change in health policy soon,
``you'll see this real frenzy in the state legislatures,'' Montigny
said. ``I don't see any lightening up of that over the next couple
of years.''

REAL ESTATE: SEATTLE ISLAND SUBURB IS AFLOAT IN AFFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARRIET KING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCER ISLAND, Wash. _ Wealthy buyers, many of them young and
paying cash, have created a brisk market for million-dollar
mansions on this island in Lake Washington connected by bridges to
Seattle's downtown _ a six-minute drive to the west _ and to the
high-tech centers of Bellevue and Redmond to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Construction crews are working through the cold and rainy winter
on palatial homes, many with 7,000 square feet of space, along the
shores of the 5-mile-long island where 21,550 people live. Other
secluded homes are terraced into the steep, forested shoreline
hillsides, capturing stunning views of the lake, Seattle's skyline
or the Cascade and Olympic mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The average asking price for the 532 new and existing homes on
the island that came on the market in 1999 was $965,586. Of the 58
homes listed for sale in January, 40 percent have asking prices of
$1 million or more. The most expensive listing in January, at $9.25
million, was for a gated waterfront estate with parklike grounds,
pool, spa, gym and indoor pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are high because we have almost no vacant land left,''
said Richard Hart, the island's director of development services.
``Most development is through teardown of existing homes and many
of the lots are subdivided so that two or more homes can be
built.'' The city expects the population to hit 25,000 within 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil Mercer Island has been considered a prestigious
address, attracting company presidents, bankers and doctors, since
the second of two major bridges was built in the 1940s connecting
it to Seattle. There is little crime, the three country clubs have
waiting lists, and the island has the feel of a small, friendly
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's market is driven by high-tech buyers,'' said John
Deely, managing broker with Coldwell Banker Bain Associates, ``with
a number from Microsoft and Amazon.com, and we also saw a number of
people come in with the Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas merger.''
He said the new buyers were willing to pay a premium for housing in
the center of the vibrant metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The selling prices for Mercer Island's 8,300 residences soared
17 percent last year and builders and real estate brokers are
bracing for an active market this year. Many of the deals are for
cash, with young buyers financing their purchases with proceeds
from stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Betty DeLaurenti, an agent with John L. Scott Real Estate, last
year sold for cash three Mercer Island homes ranging from $2.5
million to $6 million. ``It's wild. I have never seen a market like
this,'' she said. ``Prices since 1996 have been on a steady uphill
climb.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bennett, who heads First Edition Homes, builds a dozen
Mercer Island houses a year at prices of $1 million to $5 million.
``We do a lot of building on speculation with no buyer lined up,''
he said. ``You would not take that chance in many other cities, but
on Mercer Island, buyers show up pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is currently building a north shore water-view home
priced at $1 million, which he sold just two months after starting
construction. The house is covered with blue tarps to keep the
exterior dry so workers can paint. Nearby, waves lap at the yard
and boat dock of a $4.5 million home that he is building and that
sold soon after groundbreaking last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Up the hill a block, Kingston Corp. is doing site work on the
last of six homes built on a parcel that earlier contained two
small houses. Each of the new 3,600-square-foot homes has four
bedrooms, three baths and a three-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Yax, a sales agent who represents the developer, said the
first of the six homes sold in December 1997 for $761,000. But as
home prices skyrocket on Mercer Island, the last two homes to be
built are each selling for $1.1 million. She estimates that the
same home elsewhere in metropolitan Seattle might cost $500,000 to
$600,000.

</P>
<P>
   On Mercer Way, the road that rings the island, Aspen Homes is
building two houses: One is on the water and is priced at $5.8
million; the other has a water view and is priced at $1.85 million.
They are just a couple of blocks from the estate of Paul Allen,
Microsoft's co-founder, who also owns the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team and the Seattle Seahawks football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Allen amassed several adjacent properties along the island's
west shore and in the last several years has built not only a
spacious home but also a gym that seats 250 people, a home for his
mother and a private library. He has two other large residences
under construction, including a home for his sister. The taxes on
Allen's property, assessed at $68.7 million, total $757,557 a year.
</P>
<P>
   When property changes hands on the island, bidding wars are
frequent. ``We've seen some instances of offers of $100,000 to
$200,000 over the asking price for existing homes in the $1 million
to $1.5 million range,'' said Deely, the Coldwell Banker official.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Island's first home priced in seven figures hit the
market in the '80s, said Delores Erchinger, secretary of the Mercer
Island Historical Society, who was working in real estate at the
time. ``Everyone wanted to go tour it to see what a million-dollar
home looked like. It was very elegant _ and we all left our shoes
in a box by the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders say the public schools, which the district says post
the highest test scores in the state, are a selling point for young
buyers. Thirty percent of Mercer Island residents are between the
ages of 25 and 44, and 60.8 percent are college graduates, a
quarter of whom have advanced degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers are mostly older people who have retired. It is not
uncommon for them to realize a $500,000 profit on water frontage.
Some no longer want to maintain a large home and others want to be
free from high property taxes. (An owner of a home with five
bedrooms and 100 feet of waterfront assessed at $3 million would
pay $31,500 a year, said Matthew Davis, a customer-service
representative of Transnation Title Insurance Co. Five years ago,
he said, the property might have been assessed at $2 million and
taxed about $21,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The lack of housing affordable for buyers with modest incomes
troubles town officials. ``This is a tough issue and all King
County communities are trying to deal with it,'' said Hart, the
island's director of development services. Planners in many King
County cities say they face a housing crisis because some people
who work in the county, which includes Seattle, can't afford to
live there and have to make long commutes from more affordable
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of homes sold in King County last year was
$291,422, compared with $208,364 in Snohomish County adjacent to
the north, $159,541 in Pierce County adjacent to the south, and
$181,937 in Kitsap County, a ferry ride away to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Island's answer is to allow homeowners to build accessory
dwellings such as attached additions or free-standing structures
with up to 1,500 square feet that can be rented, says Hart. He says
there about 120 such structures, adding that rents reportedly run
from about $500 to $2,500 a month, depending on condition and size.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lowest priced new developments on the island is the
15-home South Village subdivision now under construction by the
Mercer Village LLC development company. John O'Shay, one of the
company's principals, said the three-bedroom homes would be priced
from $500,000 to $600,000 and contain about 2,400 square feet, plus
a garage.
</P>
<P>
   The homes are on the plateau center of the island and do not
command a water view. They are adjacent to a small 30-year-old
shopping center that the developers recently bought and are in the
process of expanding and modernizing.
</P>
<P>
   South Village buyers are expected to be Mercer Island
empty-nesters who are selling larger homes, and young families
moving onto the island. The developers will sell the first lots to
builders in the spring and the first homes will be constructed by
fall. ``We've had a lot of interest from all over the island,''
said O'Shay.
</P>
<P>
   First settled in the late 19th century, Mercer Island still has
numerous modest cottages built in the post-World War II era. Many
are coming to the market now and will continue to do so in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be able to build,'' said Bennett, the speculative
builder, ``by tearing down these old houses.''

FRANCES M. MINER DIES AT 94; TENDED TO YOUNG GARDENERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frances Messersmith Miner, who for 43 years nurtured
tulips, radishes and children at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, died
Monday in Utica, N.Y., her brother said. She was 94 and lived in a
nursing home in nearby Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Miner learned of the Brooklyn children's garden, the first
to be included within a scientific botanic garden, as a freshman at
Smith College when her botany professor mentioned it. She made a
note that that was ``something I'd like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, in 1930, she began working at the children's
garden under the tutelage of its founder, Ellen Eddy Shaw, who
began it in 1914 on a single acre of the 52-acre Brooklyn Botanic
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Miner, tall, slender and less frail than she seemed, looked
as if she belonged in a garden: she favored straw hats and print
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   She relished getting down on her hands and knees to weed at a
time when not many women did. Her title was curator of instruction,
but she was called ``the botanic lady'' by generations of
youngsters, some of whom were inspired to become influential
gardeners as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, she seemed to know everything,'' said Helen Mattin, who
almost seven decades ago began crossing Washington Avenue as an
8-year-old to take classes and is now a major benefactor to the
garden. ``It was great to be with someone who just poured out love
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Appell, who started gardening at 9 in 1963 and is now
educational director at the Horticultural Society of New York,
emphasized that Miss Miner provided much more than engaging
baby-sitting. There were written tests, badges and medals for high
achievement. Well-kept children's plots were marked with signs with
a white star on a green background; those needing work got a sign
with a blue question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to class on Saturday, it was just like being in
school,'' he said. ``It was not informal at all. It was very hard.
We were taught a sense of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   A tangible example of the responsibility Miss Miner demanded was
the care of gardening tools. Hoes, rakes and trowels dating back
more than 80 years can be seen gleaming on the racks of the
Children's Garden House, which last year was refurbished and named
for Miss Miner.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when tomato stakes needed painting, she bought green paint
and asked the children to do it. Naturally, everybody went home
green, but ``she knew that if the children painted the stakes, they
would take better care of them,'' said Daphne Welch Day, a longtime
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Miner summed up her approach in a publication for the
Brooklyn garden. ``I believe that students, especially beginners in
this adventure, should be participants rather than spectators,''
she wrote. ``A feeling of ownership and a sense of responsibility
for the care of a plant `pet' elicit an entirely different kind of
response than viewing displays of plants, no matter how
spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Miner was born in Plainfield, N.J., and grew up in Oriskany
Falls, N.Y. After graduating from Smith, she worked briefly with
the Girl Scouts in Elmira, N.Y., then accepted a post at the
Brooklyn garden as an educational assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Friends quickly came to appreciate her sometimes quirky
approach. She liked to be known by her initials, F.M.M. Each day
she would jot notes on the subway to and from her home on 110th
Street in Manhattan. They would be daily distributed to ``D.W.,''
``A.B.,'' and her other colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her brother Charles of Oriskany Falls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing about botanical topics for publications
like the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society in England, she
wrote a 95-page children's book called ``The Adventure Book of
Growing Plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Her joy was seeing a child learn a lesson about plants. She
wrote of a boy named Johnny who despaired because his plants were
thriving and healthy but lacked tomatoes. It turned out that Johnny
was meticulously picking off the blossoms, which he called ``old
yellow flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny learned the hard way that a blossom is necessary to
fruit production and that fruits lead to seed which in turn lead to
new plants and more flowers,'' she wrote. ``Johnny took home more
than tomatoes.''

TALIBAN'S RULES FOR WOMEN SAID TO BE SOFTENING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete photo note)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three years after the Taliban took control of
most of Afghanistan and introduced a harsh and unforgiving Islamic
piety that all but obliterated women from public life, relief and
development experts say that months of quiet negotiation with
Taliban leaders are beginning to dent the prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Erick de Mul, coordinator of U.N. relief programs in
Afghanistan, said in an interview last week that it might be time
to begin adjusting the picture of Afghanistan under the Taliban,
which he said had brought peace to much of a country battered by
civil war _ but then had no program to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as black and white as it's often depicted,'' said de
Mul, who was in New York for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As de Mul, who is Dutch, talked about the small advances that
the United Nations and a host of relief agencies were making in
Afghanistan, the new picture that emerged was of a strongly
absolutist movement hitting the wall of daily reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mounting pressure from the population itself,'' said
de Mul, who accepts that the Taliban were first welcomed by
Afghans, who had had enough of corrupt and violent rule by the
mujahedeen, the Muslim warriors who drove out Soviet troops in the
1980s. ``People are expecting more than peace and security. `We
want to have a better future for our children,' they say. `We want
to have possibilities to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers and the Taliban have together learned a valuable
lesson in recent years, de Mul said. When talks break down, he
said, ``we go to this point and say, OK, let's leave it for a while
and discuss it later on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very slow, and many, many times inconclusive, but the
important thing is that there is a dialogue, and increasingly it is
possible to call a spade a spade _ to go more directly to the
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools for girls are opening, some officially and many others
privately in homes, de Mul said. In recent months, he added,
Taliban authorities have not enforced an edict prohibiting foreign
Muslim women from going out in public without a close male
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts have tried to assign Muslims from other countries to
work with Afghans because of their sensitivity to the tenets of
Islam and because they offer an alternative model of Islamic
womanhood, most immediately to the Afghan co-workers. But
foreigners know that pushing too hard is counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demanding changes in law is not working yet,'' he said. ``So
the other thing is to create realities that become so strong that
eventually the reality will determine the legal framework.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not a policy supported by most human rights groups or the
Clinton administration, which has imposed sanctions on Afghanistan
because of its support for terrorism and its violations of women's
rights. The United States does not allow Americans to be assigned
there by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program _ headed by an American woman,
Catherine Bertini, who is based in Rome _ has made large strides in
bringing women into the work force in Afghanistan, de Mul said.
``WFP is pushing the right agenda in an intelligent way _ with a
lot of results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jalalabad, an eastern Afghan city near Pakistan, the closing
of smugglers' routes that brought in subsidized Pakistani wheat
created a food crisis recently. The World Food Program, with access
to donated wheat, decided to open bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to do that, we said, OK, we have to send
people out to make a survey of households,'' de Mul said. ``We said
we want to have 50 percent male and 50 percent female surveyors,
otherwise there is not going to be a bakery project. This took
about two weeks of them saying, `No, it can be done by men; there
is no need for women.' In two weeks they came around and said,
`That's fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   De Mul said that even in Kandahar, a bastion of orthodoxy and
the headquarters of the Taliban's leader, Emir Muhammad Omar,
changes are noticeable, in part because of a good provincial
governor, Mullah Hassan, who is both a devout Muslim and an
administrator in tune with popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In Kandahar province, the United Nations and private agencies
are training health workers, opening schools for girls and boys and
helping local councils known as shuras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago there was a meeting of a number of the shuras
of the southern region in Kandahar,'' de Mul said. ``It was a
three-day event where representatives of all these community
organizations came together. The Taliban authorities were invited.
The governor of Kandahar opened it.'' The meeting ended with a
statement of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority was education, and education for girls and
boys,'' de Mul said. ``Second, they wanted to have more and
better-trained traditional birth assistants, midwives. Third, they
wanted to have increased possibilities for women to be gainfully
employed, especially widows.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you take the three priorities, and almost all refer to
women. But all the representatives at the meeting were men.''

JOHN NEWLAND, 82, TV ACTOR KNOWN FOR `ALCOA PRESENTS'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Ill.)  (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Newland, an actor and director best remembered as the
dignified host on the ``Alcoa Presents'' television series, an
early venture into programming about the paranormal, died Jan. 10
in Los Angeles. He was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Newland directed and was the host of all 99 segments of ``Alcoa
Presents,'' which ran from 1959 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   A precursor of Rod Serling's ``Twilight Zone'' and later, ``The
X-Files,'' the show dramatized case histories of occult phenomena
like premonition, possession and ghosts. Tall and handsome, with a
mellifluous voice, Newland lent an air of authority to the series
as its host and as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Newland, who was born in Cincinnati, began his career in Chicago
as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He was an apprentice with the Stuart Walker Stock Co. and
performed with the Vikings, a vaudeville song-and-dance troupe
decked out in gold capes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he moved to New York to study acting, he won a job
with Milton Berle, appearing at the Roxy, Loew's State and Capitol
theaters before touring vaudeville houses across the country.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II, he made
his film debut in 1946 in ``Adventures of Dusty Bates.'' He had
small parts in other movies, but described his short Hollywood film
career as ``an immediate failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took to television, appearing in dramatic
anthologies like ``Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ``Philco
Playhouse,'' ``Studio One'' and ``Kraft Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying his hand as the director of several of those plays,
he moved to Los Angeles to direct ``The Loretta Young Show,'' the
first of many television episodes and movies he directed over three
decades. Among his credits were ``Bachelor Father,'' ``Night
Gallery,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``Police Woman,''
``Wonder Woman'' and ``Fantasy Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Newland was 51 when he directed his first film, ``My Lover, My
Son,'' a 1969 British feature about incest, starring Romy
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Areta; two daughters, Hillary
Alexander of Los Angeles and Karen Kissler of Larkspur, Calif.; and
a granddaughter.

HOTEL PLANNERS HOPE TO JOLT NEW YORK ARCHITECTURE SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to provoke more cutting-edge creativity in New
York City, Cooper Union, a school specializing in architectural
design and engineering, and Ian Schrager Hotels have chosen a team
of innovative European architects for a new hotel and theater on
Astor Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take a stand for great design,'' said John Jay
Iselin, president of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of
Science and Art, which owns the parking lot where the hotel will be
constructed over the next two years, across Cooper Square from its
own landmark Foundation Building.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas is to collaborate on the Astor
Place project with the Swiss firm Herzog &AMP; de Meuron.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas wrote ``Delirious New York'' (Oxford, 1978), an
influential ``retroactive manifesto'' on the evolution of urban
design. But he has never before built from the ground up in New
York. Neither has Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, whose first American project
two years ago was a winery in northern California with walls made
of loose stones behind wire mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is impossible to predict what Koolhaas, Jacques
Herzog and Pierre de Meuron will come up with collectively, it
seems safe to say that their design will cause a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just the point. ``Make no mistake,'' Schrager said.
``We want to be provocative and shake things up. But by no means do
we want to be indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager, chairman and chief executive of the hotel company that
developed the Paramount, Royalton and Morgans, said he was drawn to
Koolhaas in part because of ``Delirious New York.''
</P>
<P>
   As a finale in that book, the architect offered an imaginary
Hotel Sphinx for Times Square: a highly stylized, two-block-long,
red sphinx, forelegs on 47th Street, hind legs on 49th, with a
swimming pool in its head, terraces along its flanks, wings over
48th Street and twin 40-story towers for a tail.
</P>
<P>
   The Astor Place project will probably not go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which design proposal is chosen, the hotel might be
12 stories or so, with 75 to 140 rooms. On the ground floor and two
floors below will be what Schrager calls a cultural magnet: three
to six screening rooms, operated in collaboration with Robert De
Niro, for independent, foreign and art films; a bookstore, and a
restaurant or two.
</P>
<P>
   The building will have about 100,000 square feet of space.
Construction might begin by the end of the year, to be finished in
2002. Schrager would not put a price on the project.
</P>
<P>
   He and his development partner, Related Cos., will lease the
site for 99 years. Cooper Union is to receive a total of $9.6
million in rent. The money is needed, Iselin said, to support the
school's policy of offering a free education, or full scholarship,
to all of its 900 students.

TWO SIDES TRADE CHARGES ON HARBOR-DREDGING PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A much-heralded agreement that allowed dredging of
channels in New York Harbor to resume after 10 years is showing
signs of fraying, with a new battle flaring over how to clear
contaminated mud from the dominant seaport on the East Coast
without threatening efforts to clean up the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old agreement, reached in negotiations presided over
by Vice President Al Gore and signed at a Washington ceremony,
allowed disposal of dredge material to continue for a time at an
ocean site six miles off the tip of Sandy Hook, N.J. It also set
stricter standards for the level of contamination that would be
allowed, and it barred disposal there of all toxic material.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the document, which was dubbed the Gore Agreement,
gave port operators and shipping interests the assurance that they
could do what was necessary to keep the port competitive. For the
environmentalists, it offered the promise of an eventual cessation
of all dumping of dredge material at the ocean site, and in the
meantime, a reduction of risk of contamination from a century of
unregulated or weakly regulated disposal.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and port interests now are charging each
other with violating the letter as well as the spirit of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, one of New Jersey's senators, a congressman
representing the Sandy Hook area, and Clean Ocean Action, the group
based in Sandy Hook that was the main environmental signer of the
agreement, have objected to permits to dump dredge material from
two locations in New York City into the ocean waters.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the levels of certain contaminants in the
soupy mud are unreasonable and that federal regulators have reneged
on promises to create stricter standards for what can be disposed
of at the site.
</P>
<P>
   For officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
as well as the unions representing tens of thousands of port
workers, the memory of years of stalled dredging is still fresh,
along with images of shippers diverting their vessels to other
ports to avoid the costly lightening of their loads at sea before
venturing up shallow channels of the New York area ports.
</P>
<P>
   They are angry and fearful of a new standoff that could stymie
ambitious programs to dredge most of the ports' 240 miles of
channels and prepare for an expected increase in cargo over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   And coming as it has in a presidential year, when Gore is
seeking his party's nomination, some port interests are fearful
that he is likely to be pressured by some environmental groups at a
time when he is most politically vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will face off Monday when the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which reviews dredging and disposal projects, holds a
hearing at Fort Monmouth, N.J., on continuing one of the two
pending New York dredging projects.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was hastily called after Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long
Branch, N.J., who along with Clean Ocean Action has grown
disenchanted with the agreement, complained that his office was not
notified about applications for some of the disposal programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of the International Longshoremen's Association are
taking the threats to the agreement seriously and plan to have
their members show up en masse at the hearing, nearly halting for a
day the loading and unloading at area ports.
</P>
<P>
   Others also are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this seriously because these channels are our
lifelines, the arteries through which our blood flows,'' said
Lillian Borrone, director of the Port Commerce Department of the
Port Authority, which oversees the movement of $60 billion worth of
goods annually that amount to 57 percent of all North Atlantic
maritime cargo. ``This makes us think that the environmentalists'
real goal is to stop all disposal in the ocean now. And if that is
so, it gives us no predictability about the future of our necessary
dredging projects and it means that the environmentalists can't
sustain their commitments to much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the agreement was worked out, some 3 million cubic yards
of dredged material has been dumped at the ocean site known as the
Mud Dump, a 15-square-mile area off the coast that once accepted
the highly toxic material from dredge sites in the region.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that the Gore Agreement banned the most contaminated
material from being dumped there and called for capping of the site
over time with Category One dredge material, as the Environmental
Protection Agency designates the least contaminated dredge material
that is unlikely to be absorbed into the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Zipf, executive director of the Clean Ocean Action, with
the support of Pallone and Sen. Robert Torricelli, however, has
objected to the latest plan to take to the disposal site material
dredged from the Brooklyn Marine Terminal and the Castle Astoria
Terminal, a large heating-fuel depot on Steinway Creek at the
northern tip of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zipf said that the dredged mud contains several of the 62
contaminants monitored by the EPA in quantities higher than is
found at the disposal site now and higher than is allowed by the
EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marked the first time under the agreement that they were
sending material that was more contaminated than what was already
there,'' Ms. Zipf said. ``Plus, they promised to tighten the
standards from Category One material and they haven't. They
promised us a cleaner ocean but that's not what we are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators and others familiar with the agreement
dispute Ms. Zipf's contention that there was a promise to change
the standards by which they measure the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   They also insisted that the mere fact of higher levels of some
contaminants in the dredged material did not necessarily add to the
overall contamination at the disposal site. Even some other
environmentalists believe that Clean Ocean Action is demanding
impossible purity in what is used for the protective cover of the
Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
   James Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund,
who is knowledgeable about dredging, said that both sides in the
dispute are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy Zipf wants no ocean dumping or the dumping of completely
clean, uncontaminated material, and that is just unrealistic,'' he
said. ``And the other side seems to want to just keep putting the
Category One stuff there even if it is higher in some contaminants
and low in others. Some fine-tuning is in order so we can, using
pragmatic science, come up with a subset of material that is
acceptable to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such an agreement will be possible may have more to do
with politics than with pragmatic science, conceded Rep. Robert
Menendez, one of the architects of the Gore Agreement, whose
district includes many of the more active New Jersey port areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that the environmental
community is using the presidential election as a weak moment when
they can gain some advantage by pulling Gore into the process,''
said Menendez. ``It's a shame, because even if they succeed, it
will make people wary of striking agreements with them in the
future.''

ALAIN POIRE, 82, FRENCH PRODUCER WITH EYE FOR BOX OFFICE APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Alain Poire, a legendary figure in the French movie
industry who produced more than 250 films during a 55-year career,
died on Jan. 14 at his home in the Paris suburb of
Neuilly-sur-Seine. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Poire, who spent most of his life working for Gaumont and was
director of Gaumont International for the last 40 years, always had
an eye for movies with box office appeal. Most recently, he
produced Francis Veber's ``Diner de Cons,'' released in the United
States as ``The Dinner Game,'' which was France's most popular
movie in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris on Feb. 13, 1917, Poire studied law and worked in
publicity and theater direction before entering the movie industry
when France was liberated in 1944. In the 1950s, he produced movies
by Sacha Guitry, Robert Bresson and Roberto Rossellini, although
Poire pointedly steered clear of the young directors who brought
the French New Wave in the late 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   His taste for the commercial, though, did not dissuade him from
backing four screen versions of Marcel Pagnol's stories of his
childhood in Provence. And Poire's instinct proved right. All four
films _ Claude Berri's ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon des
Sources'' in 1986 and Yves Robert's ``Gloire de Mon Pere'' and ``Le
Chateau de Ma Mere'' in 1990 _ were box office successes in France
and widely seen abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Poire is survived by his wife, Yvette, and two sons, Jean-Marie
and Philippe. Jean-Marie Poire directed ``Les Visiteurs,'' Philippe
Poire is president of Expand, a French television production
company.
</P>
<P>
   Poire continued to work until close to his death. His final
film, ``La Vache et le President,'' or ``The Cow and the
President,'' will be released shortly. And he was preparing a new
film starring Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil.

FOR RANGERS' NEDVED, THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRADE IS NO LONGER A BIG
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The chances are remote that the Rangers will pry
Keith Tkachuk from the Phoenix Coyotes in a proposed three-way
deal. The Carolina Hurricanes' owner, Peter Karmanos, has all but
made sure of that. But Petr Nedved has heard the talk. And this
time, he is shaking it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game,'' Nedved said before the Rangers played
the Blues here. ``It's something that doesn't bother me anymore. If
it happens, it happens. It wouldn't be the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction was considerably different a month ago, when
speculation was rampant that Nedved was headed for Carolina for the
unsigned center Keith Primeau. Then, Nedved was in the throes of a
slump and was clearly bothered by the trade talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard I was going to Phoenix, I was getting my tanning
lotion out,'' Nedved said. ``Then, when I heard it was Carolina, I
was going to bring my golf clubs with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved can probably put both his lotion and his clubs away. For
Phoenix to trade Tkachuk to New York, the Rangers would first have
to get Primeau from Carolina. And Karmanos _ who has apparently
decided to take a hard line _ has done everything in his power to
ensure that such a deal will not happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's agent, Don Reynolds, said Friday that he doubted a
trade would occur, even though the Rangers are believed to be
offering Nedved and perhaps Manny Malhotra to Carolina. The
Hurricanes are also being offered Rod Brind'Amour by the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Karmanos is trying to control it all,'' Reynolds said.
``He's trying to control the contract that Keith will sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmanos has told both the Rangers and the Flyers that he will
not trade Primeau unless those teams promise not to offer Primeau
more than a two-year, $7 million contract. Earlier this season, the
Coyotes had come to an agreement with Primeau on a four-year deal
worth a little more than $17 million, which would have led the way
to a deal for Tkachuk, who has 20 goals and 17 assists this season.
But Karmanos rejected that.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is still trying to find a way around the salary limit
Karmanos is dictating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith would now prefer a five-year deal,'' Reynolds said, one
that would be worth in excess of $21 million. The objective is a
contract that pays an average of $4.5 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's services are probably worth that, based on the market.
Nedved, for example, is making $3.5 million this season, $4 million
next season. Tkachuk is making $4.2 million, but next season that
jumps to $8.3 million, the main reason the Coyotes are trying to
trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager, said he
did not think talk of a trade should bother Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a trade rumor in New York,'' he said. ``There
always will be. That's just the way it is. I've been through this
many times. I don't think it will affect the performance of the
team. If anything, it should motivate them to play well so we don't
want to make any trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, who has 12 goals and 24 assists in 41 games, is now
playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess it doesn't really matter if I play well or not,''
he said. ``We've played well as a team and well as a line. It's
something you can't control. And you can't worry about something
you don't have absolute control over. The only control I thought I
had was playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if there's anything to these rumors, then I am surprised.
But although I would like to stay in New York and I want to stay in
New York, this is not exactly a life-or-death experience. When I
hear something like that, I don't panic or start stressing out.''

FRAUD TRIAL ON PAYMENT FOR FERTILITY TREATMENT OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As insurance fraud cases go, the federal government's
case against Dr. Niels H. Lauersen is far from typical.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen, a well-known Manhattan gynecologist and fertility
expert, did not deal with Medicare or Medicaid, the government
insurance programs that often attract fraudulent billing schemes.
And prosecutors acknowledge that unlike doctors in most medical
fraud cases, who bill for procedures that never took place or for
patients who do not exist, Lauersen treated real patients who were
desperately seeking remedies for real conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In what legal experts say is new territory for health-care fraud
cases, Lauersen is accused of billing insurance companies for
routine gynecological procedures to cover for what he was really
doing: fertility surgeries for women who could not otherwise get
pregnant. Over the course of 10 years, law-enforcement officials
say, the doctor submitted hundreds of false bills amounting to
roughly $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility experts and gynecologists, as well as their patients,
say that false billing is common among doctors who specialize in
exacting and costly fertility procedures, because insurance
companies often do not pay for them. But legal experts say they
know of no other case in which a doctor was criminally prosecuted
over such practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is paying attention to this case,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the American Infertility
Association. ``It is very upsetting to many patients when a doctor
is, through their eyes, being persecuted for trying to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal law-enforcement officials, their power broadened by
recent legislation governing health-care fraud, are sending the
message to doctors that efforts to dodge rules set by insurance
companies will not be tolerated. The Clinton administration has
made the prosecution of health-care fraud a priority, as a
cost-saving measure. Since 1995, health-care fraud convictions have
increased nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has invested huge amounts of resources in
health-care fraud in the last four years,'' said Thomas Mayo, an
associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. ``Congress has clearly moved to lump all health-care fraud
together and is increasingly giving prosecutors tools to convict.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which begins Monday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, brings together several health-care issues that have
been hotly debated in the last few years. They include ethical and
financial quandaries over who should pay for fertility treatments
and conflicts over the types of health-care issues that merit
government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The case also illuminates the quiet but common practice by
doctors in many areas of medicine who tweak their bills to get
approval or payment for treatments that they believe patients need
but for which insurance companies do not reimburse. A recent study
in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that 57 percent of 169
doctors who were polled said they would use deception to secure
approval for certain treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen, who was indicted more than a year ago with his
anesthesiologist, Magda Binion, is accused of billing insurers for
procedures like cyst removals and treatments of fibroids, in place
of the in vitro fertilization therapies that he was actually
performing. According to the indictment, Lauersen told patients to
lie about their care to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in question were not among the wealthy or
high-profile women who came through his office, who almost
certainly paid cash for these fertility procedures, but rather
middle- and working-class women who generally were insured by
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Few states have laws that require insurance companies to pay for
infertility treatments, and many lawyers and policy professionals
concerned with women's health say the lack of such coverage is
discriminatory. Lauersen's lawyers are almost certainly counting on
a jury that is sympathetic to that point of view, whether or not he
actually committed fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 30 years I have dedicated my life to helping women
have healthy babies and to fighting those insurance companies that
discriminate against women by refusing to pay for their health
care,'' Lauersen said through his lawyer, Ted Wells. ``It is
ridiculous that insurance companies will pay for a man to have
Viagra but refuse to pay for a woman to have fertility treatments.
I am completely innocent, I have never committed insurance fraud
and I am confident the jury will acquit me.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, gynecologists who are the subject of civil and even
criminal cases tend to attract support from a wide range of
patients, who often feel an emotional connection because the
doctors helped bring their children into the world. This feeling is
often magnified when a doctor has helped them conceive a
one-chance-only baby.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen was certainly this kind of hero to many of his
patients, but his clinical history is not spotless. Last year he
resigned under pressure from Lenox Hill Hospital after a difficult
delivery. He had tried to deliver the baby with forceps, but the
delivery ultimately ended with a Caesarean section, and Lenox Hill
administrators found that he had not followed hospital procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen, whose practice is on Park Avenue, now admits patients
through St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney would not comment on why the
government chose to prosecute Lauersen. But in 1996, Congress
enacted tough statutes intended to curtail health-care fraud. In
1995, the federal government pursued 1,247 health-care fraud cases
and obtained 158 convictions, according to Department of Justice
reports. In 1998, those numbers increased to 1,866 investigations
and 219 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there has been a flurry of legal activity
around infertility procedures. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled
that reproduction was a ``major life activity'' and that when a
person's ability to reproduce is medically hampered, she is
protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case actually had little to do with infertility _
it was a complex legal strategy employed by a woman with AIDS who
was denied dental treatment _ advocates of fertility coverage have
tried to use that ruling to support their long-held contention that
infertility is a disabling medical condition that should be covered
by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, the city of Chicago was ordered to cover $1.5
million in claims for fertility treatments for its employees after
a case was filed by a police officer who had spent thousands of
dollars to conceive her two children, none of it covered by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen's lawyers have latched on to those cases as part of
their defense. In documents submitted to the judge, the defense
wrote: ``The insurance companies allegedly victimized by this
scheme were unlawfully discriminating against Lauersen's female
patients by refusing to provide coverage for a `disability'
affecting a `major life activity _ reproduction.' In so doing,
these insurance companies violated fundamental civil rights
protected by'' the disabilities act.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies say that they do not mean to discriminate
against women, but that covering fertility treatments is too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 states that mandate coverage of fertility procedures,
only six have strong laws that force insurance companies to pay for
them. Even in those states, there are limits, like restrictions on
how many times a woman can undergo the therapies, or exclusions for
health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman vetoed such a law last
week. In New York, insurance companies are required to pay for all
gynecological problems deemed medically correctable, but not for
procedures that are strictly used to get people pregnant, like in
vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters are the insurance companies that
refuse to pay for therapies and surgeries that relate to fertility
but are perhaps sought by women for other reasons. Fibroid tumors,
for example, are often painful and debilitating, but insurers
frequently reject claims for their removal if they see that
treatment as related to fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen's lawyers are likely to put his patients on the stand
to try to sway the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is problematic for the government,'' said Leonard J.
Nelson III, a professor at the Cumberland School of Law of Samford
University in Birmingham, Ala., ``because if you are dealing with
middle-class people who really want children, it is compelling. It
is still fraud. But there is a good chance that the jury will
respond positively when they see real people up there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government's goal is to set an example with Lauersen,
however, a conviction, which almost surely carries prison time, may
well have the desired impact, several legal experts said. ``If you
take out a high-profile person and nail them, that has a deterrent
effect,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical and legal experts on infertility will be watching the
case closely; the number of infertility clinics has more than
doubled in the last 10 years, as technology has improved and more
older women have sought to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government seems to be sending a message to physicians and
patients in states without clear legal protections,'' said Susan
Crockin, a lawyer in Boston who specializes in reproductive
technology issues. ``But it is interesting, because if infertility
were treated as a medical condition, it wouldn't be the subject of
criminal indictments.''

BUSH SAYS HE SUPPORTS THE PARTY'S STRONG ANTI-ABORTION STAND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Saturday he
supports the abortion plank in the Republican Party's platform as
it is written, wording that calls for a constitutional amendment to
ban the procedure and makes no mention of exceptions for rape,
incest or danger to the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life
plank the way it's written now,'' Bush said, adding that those who
drafted such an amendment would fine-tune the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be up to the Congress, if America is ever
ready for a constitutional amendment,'' Bush told reporters as he
arrived to make a speech at a hotel here. He added that what was
important, for now, was for Republicans to nominate somebody who
can lead the country ``toward a better understanding of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step,'' Bush added, ``is to convince Americans that
we ought to value life, and that's exactly what I intend to do as
the leader of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush layered his statement with nuances that
signaled he was not readying himself for any kind of battle for an
all-out ban on abortions. Further characterizing the kind of leader
Republicans should choose, he said it should be a person ``who is
willing to find a common ground on issues, such as partial-birth
abortion and parental notification.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third day in a row that Bush had made statements
about abortion that sounded emphatic in one sense, but hazy in
another. His remarks seemed at once to underscore Bush's desire to
send a sympathetic message to religious conservatives, who
represent an important voting block in the precinct caucuses here
on Monday and in other Republican primaries, and his interest in
letting other Republicans know he is not on a crusade against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has long said that he favors a constitutional amendment to
ban abortion but that he would not press for one because the public
support for it does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said he supported exceptions in the case of rape,
incest and danger to the life of the mother. But the party platform
makes no mention of those. Bush acknowledged that Saturday but did
not elaborate on that apparent discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   His communications director, Karen P. Hughes, said Bush
supported the plank because it envisioned ``a human-life
amendment'' and he believed Republicans should lead Americans
toward that ideal.
</P>
<P>
   She said Bush did not view the plank in the platform as contrary
to his own views about what such an amendment might say, because
``it doesn't itemize how that amendment would be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes and other aides said Bush was not saying anything he
had not said before, and distributed a longstanding position paper
with this explanation of Bush's position on the platform:
</P>
<P>
   ``While Governor Bush respects those with differing views, he
believes the current Republican Party platform plank on abortion is
an important statement of pro-life ideals, and he does not believe
it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The plank represents a viewpoint on abortion more rigid than the
one Bush has portrayed as his own.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Bush has said he would not use opposition to
abortion as a litmus test in making nominations to the Supreme
Court, the plank says, ``We support the appointment of judges who
respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The plank also says, ``The unborn child has a fundamental
individual right to life which cannot be infringed.'' It does not
mention any exceptions, but it also does not say that there can be
no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush arrived in Iowa earlier this week, he has been
pressed repeatedly to elaborate on his views about abortion, in
part because his chief rival here, the publisher Steve Forbes, is
portraying Bush as soft on abortion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is making an effort to appeal to religious conservatives,
a group that Bush also would clearly not like to alienate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an unwavering opposition to abortion, and a
clear statement of intent to work toward banning the procedure,
might diminish Bush's appeal to centrist voters in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did seem to edge away from his longstanding views on
Thursday when he was discussing judicial appointments and said,
``Roe vs. Wade was a reach,'' referring to the 1973 Supreme Court
ruling that established the right to abortion.

 &HT;    Gore working Iowa like underdog
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DODGE, Iowa _ On the last weekend before the first crucial
test of the 2000 primary season, seven presidential candidates
fanned out across Iowa in search of support in Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic front-runner Al Gore took nothing for granted. From
sunup to sundown, an exuberant Gore campaigned Saturday as if he
were 20 points behind challenger Bill Bradley instead of 20 points
ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Starting here, at an oatmeal breakfast, and at nearly every stop
that followed across snow-covered Iowa, he cautioned his supporters
about being too confident in a Gore victory in the Democratic
voting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   His message: ``I need your help. ... Go to the caucus. ... Stand
up for me. ... Help me become president.''
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll shows the vice president with a lead of
58 percent to 38 percent among Iowans, with an error margin of plus
or minus 5 percentage points. A WHO-TV poll has similar results.
</P>
<P>
   But at a rally Friday night at Iowa State University, his
largest yet, with more than 1,000 students screaming their support
for him, Gore warned: ``We can't take anything for granted.''In
fact, Gore himself plans to spend part of today joining hundreds of
supporters in door-to-door canvassing to persuade Democrats to
brave Iowa's frigid weather Monday night to vote for him in the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But he also is relying on the help of union leaders and the
political organizations of hundreds of local Democratic
officeholders to get Gore supporters to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rival, Democrat Bill Bradley, campaigned across eastern
Iowa on Saturday telling voters a strong showing for him in the
caucuses could ``surprise a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, appearing in Dubuque to push for campaign finance
reform, cast himself as the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to nibble around the edges, I'm not your guy,''
Bradley told about 90 supporters at an earlier appearance in
Clinton. ``If you want to do something big, come along with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley didn't mention Gore by name in either of his morning
appearances, both of which were well attended with cheering
supporters. But he repeatedly sought to contrast his vision of
America with what he called the ``politics of distortion and
misrepresentation, partisanship and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ... don't care about where our democracy is heading as
long as your guy wins no matter how, and in winning he distorts the
whole process and demeans himself by the means it's done, you are
in the wrong place,'' he told nearly 300 people in Maquoketa.
Bradley faced no questions about his health Saturday following his
disclosure Thursday that he's had reoccurrences of a
non-life-threatening heart condition known as atrial fibrillation.
And his campaign was eager to refute suggestions that Bradley's
campaign was flagging at a time when it needed to be surging.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was endorsed late Friday by the Iowa Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, an AFL-CIO affiliate that has 700 members in
Iowa. The campaign was also eager to point to the endorsements last
week of feminist Betty Friedan, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber and
Charleston, S.C., Mayor Joe Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks this campaign is slowing down is wrong,''
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. Like Gore, Republican
front-runner George W. Bush alsostressed turnout at campaign stops
Saturday. ``Every vote matters!'' he said in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   And for a third day, Bush tied to burnish his anti-abortion
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters, Bush said he was in favor of a party
platform that recommends a constitutional amendment banning
abortion. ``I think that the Republican Party ought to keep its
pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape,
incest and when the mother's life is in danger. Those exceptions
are not in the plank, but Bush said the details of the amendment
could be worked out later. Steve Forbes, expected to finish second
to Bush in the caucuses, fought the wintry mix of wind and snow
Saturday. Forbes' plane made two false approaches to the Mason City
runway and pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in
the murky weather.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment
is not going to stop us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah gave a foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters
and set the lowest of expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going
to have to do better than sixth here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer _ like Bush _ all stressed
opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who needs a strong third-place showing to bolster his
sagging campaign, suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the
anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three
years ago and believed something different today,'' Bauer said in
Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist
said, ``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he
wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining GOP presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, has not actively campaigned in Iowa, though he is on the
ballot.

EX-COACH KNOX A BIG RAMS FAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the St. Louis Rams go for a Super Bowl appearance today in an
NFC title game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a gentleman who
was an important part of their Southern California history, Chuck
Knox, will be observing the proceedings on television with intense
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be rooting hard for them,'' says Knox, coach of
the team during its final three unfortunate years in Anaheim when
it struggled to a 15-33 record. ``Dick Vermeil is a very good
friend of mine. We chat on the phone at least once a week. He was
on my staff the first time I coached the Rams. A good guy and a
bright guy. I'm happy for him. And the team's offensive
coordinator, Mike Martz, was my receivers coach in 1994 with the
Rams. A very intelligent, well-rounded guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knox coached the Rams a total of eight seasons, winning
five consecutive NFC Western Division titles during his first tour
of duty between 1973 and 1977 when he rolled up a 57-20-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite all the early success he enjoyed with the Rams,
none of his teams made it to the Super Bowl, always being
eliminated at the end by either the Minnesota Vikings or Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the biggest disappointment of my coaching career
was not making it to the Super Bowl,'' says Knox, one of only eight
men during the 76-year existence of the NFL to be a head coach more
than 20 years in the league (Knox's 22 seasons also included stops
in Buffalo and Seattle). ``We came close, but just never quite got
there. Frustrating, yes. Still, a lot of great memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knox says he has watched every Ram game this season on TV
from his home in La Quinta, often with other retired football
figures who live in the Palm Springs area like George Blanda and
John Brodie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams have just been awesome,'' salutes Knox. ``They're a
team built to play indoors with all the speed they have. The
indoors eliminates the weather factor. Remember that great San
Diego Charger team of 1981 with Dan Fouts and Chuck Muncie and all
those guys. No one could stop them, either, but the freezing
weather did in Cincinnati. The Rams are fortunate. They don't have
to concern themselves with the elements. Everything is going their
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox has first-hand knowledge about bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his Ram teams were eliminated in the playoffs in such
conditions twice in the frozen tundra of Minnesota and once in a
driving rainstorm in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, Chuck Knox is amazed by the magical work
being dispensed by Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is something else,'' says Knox. ``What you have to
ask yourself is: If everyone knew this guy had that kind of talent,
why would the Rams leave him unprotected in the expansion draft? If
the Rams knew he had that kind of talent, they never would have
traded for Trent Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing a guy like this can fall through the cracks.
The only explanation I have is that scouts have a tendency to
converse with one another. They basically all the have same
opinions on players. And, as a result, big mistakes are made on
draft day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so nice about the Kurt Warner story is that it's going
to give a lot of other guys who'd ordinarily never be given an
opportunity a chance to play in the NFL. Everyone is out there now
looking for another Kurt Warner. What a great story. It's like that
small high school in Indiana winning the state championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you what can happen if you never give up, if you
have resilience, if you just keep on trying to reach your goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Rams are a lot different than those sadsack teams
that Knox coached in the early 1990s in Anaheim, although there are
a few players D'Marco Farr, Todd Lyght, Isaac Bruce and Keith Lyle
still remaining from Knox's days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed with everything these Rams do,'' says Knox.
``You kick off to them, and they'll return it for a touchdown. You
punt to them, and they'll return it for a touchdown. And when they
have the ball on offense, it's impossible to cover all their
weapons, especially with Marshall Faulk able to come out of the
backfield and catch the ball so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Dick Vermeil was going to get it done. I knew if he was
going to be allowed to do his thing, that the Rams would start
winning. I think you have to give Dick Vermeil a lot of the credit.
He allowed Mike Martz to expand the offense and take advantage of
all the speed that is on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like Dick Vermeil, you don't like apple pie and
ice cream. There's no BS with Dick. What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Rams moved out of Anaheim after the 1994 season, Chuck
Knox was not asked to accompany the team to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not even the faintest hint of bitterness in Knox
over the way he and the Rams parted company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but great memories working for the Rams,'' says
Knox, ever the diplomat. ``What complaints do I have? I had a great
coaching run. I coached a total of 32 years in the NFL. I had great
times and disappointing times. I'd have loved to have the kind of
speed and kind of quarterback that Dick Vermeil now has. I didn't,
but I'm happy the team is doing so well. Obviously, I have special
feelings about the Rams because of my long association with the
organization. Why, if they beat Tampa Bay, I might even go to the
Super Bowl.''

   LIMA, Peru _ After 18 hours of chaos that began when dissident
military officers and Indian groups overthrew the elected president
of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad, the country's vice president assumed
power early Saturday when a rival military faction intervened on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Noboa Bejarano took office after Gen. Carlos Mendoza,
the Ecuadorean armed forces chief of staff and acting minister of
defense, abruptly announced that he was dissolving the three-man
junta he briefly led in Latin America's first military overthrow of
a sitting civilian president in more than a decade. Mendoza said he
was acting to ``prevent the international isolation of Ecuador,'' a
reference to demands by the United States and Latin American
countries that constitutional rule be preserved in a country
undergoing severe economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the laws laid out in the constitution, I find myself
under the obligation to assume the presidency of Ecuador,'' Noboa,
who becomes the country's sixth chief of state in four years, said
Saturday morning at a news conference in Quito, the capital. ``I
have the support of the armed forces and the national police.''
</P>
<P>
   Naboa's assumption of power was formally ratified by the
Ecuadorean Congress in Guayaquil Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, a 50-year-old former mayor of Quito, left the
Presidential Palace under military escort on Friday afternoon and
resurfaced Saturday morning on television to condemn the coup. He
described it as a ``Cantinflas comedy'' that exposed Ecuador to
international ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   But he did acknowledge Noboa's authority and wished him luck.
``A deposed president neither resigns nor abandons his post; he is
deposed,'' Mahuad said. ``I will never be an obstacle for the vice
president to assume the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant television speech on Friday, Mahuad had refused to
resign, challenging the military by saying it would have to
``remove me by force,'' a show of bravado undermined by his total
lack of political support.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a military unit took him to an air force base where
he was first threatened with arrest and then urged to flee the
country, before he escaped, took temporary refuge in the Chilean
Embassy and then made his way to what he described as a ``private
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The military coup was immediately condemned by the Clinton
administration and the Organization of American States, both of
which threatened sanctions against any military-led government.
Peter Romero, the State Department's top official for Latin
America, warned the coup leaders on Quito radio Friday that they
faced ``political and economic isolation'' akin to Cuba if they
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Romero, a former ambassador to Ecuador, described
the situation as ``chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Noboa, a 62-year-old former dean of the Catholic
University of Guayaquil and former governor of the country's most
important province, would be under enormous pressure ``not to do
anything'' to fix the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The insurrection against Mahuad originated in Ecuador's worst
economic crisis in more than 70 years. The economy contracted by
7.5 percent last year, the worst performance in Latin America.
Inflation was more than 60 percent for the second consecutive year,
and the country defaulted on half of its $13 billion in foreign
debt in September.
</P>
<P>
   Indians, who make up more than one-third of Ecuador's 12.5
million people and are largely peasant farmers, have been hit
particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Vargas, leader of the country's most powerful Indian
group, had lobbied the government for $42 million in debt
forgiveness and new loans, but was turned down. He quickly turned
into one of Mahuad's most ferocious critics, accusing him of
inflicting ``massive impoverishment'' on Ecuadoreans.

<P>
   Hoping to secure financing abroad, Mahuad responded to the
recession with an austerity program that further eroded his
popularity and included two especially controversial measures: He
froze the life savings of thousands of Ecuadoreans during a banking
crisis last March and, in a radical and desperate move on Jan. 9,
declared his intent to replace the nation's currency with the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on Ecuadorean radio Saturday morning,
Noboa said that he intended to continue with the dollarization
program. But he criticized other aspects of Mahuad's rule and vowed
to take quick action against what he described as rampant
corruption, a central opposition demand.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Mahuad government began Friday morning when
Indian protesters marched on the national Congress in Quito. A
military unit assigned to guard the legislative building stepped
aside instead, allowing Vargas and his supporters to enter, seize
control of offices there and proclaim the overthrow of Mahuad and
the dissolution of Congress and the Supreme Court, and their
replacement by a ``people's parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of more than 50 junior military officers led by Col.
Lucio Gutierrez immediately joined the Indian group, and other
officials began arriving and adhering to the uprising, among them
Col. Fausto Cobo, commander of Ecuador's military academy. With
television cameras broadcasting the takeover, Vargas announced the
formation of a new governing junta composed of himself, Gutierrez
and Carlos Solorzano, a former Supreme Court chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   The military high command had initially expressed lukewarm
support for Mahuad. But as more and more colonels, majors and
captains in charge of provincial military units rose in rebellion,
the generals were forced to reverse course, and by midafternoon
they had issued a new statement urging the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with an Ecuadorean television reporter, an
unidentified military officer who had joined the insurrection
complained that since Mahuad took office in August 1998, the value
of the officer's salary had declined from $1,100 a month to less
than $300. Gutierrez, for his part, vowed to replace ``this
ignominious model of government'' with one that would attack
``corruption and impunity'' by the bankers Mahuad was seen as
protecting.
</P>
<P>
   After Mahuad left his offices, the junta announced plans to
march on and seize the Presidential Palace a few blocks away. But
the military high command acted before it could get there, with
Mendoza and the army commander, Gen. Telmo Sandoval, sending troops
to take control of the building and deploying tanks in the square
in front of it to block the protesters' advance.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he had acted in order to ``avoid a social
explosion.'' Just before midnight, following several hours of
negotiations with Vargas and Gutierrez and their supporters, he
emerged to announce that the country would be governed by a
``triumvirate'' in which he would replace Gutierrez but Vargas and
Solorzano would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, however, he had moved to undercut his two partners
in the junta, who said they remained opposed to Noboa taking power
and called for the arrest of Mahuad. Salvador Quishpe, an aide to
Vargas, argued that Ecuador needs to ``undergo a process of
purification,'' condemned Noboa as ``one of the politicians
responsible for this debacle,'' and said his group planned to
continue its protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to negotiate a peaceful solution to the situation by
agreeing to become a member of the junta,'' Mendoza said Saturday.
``I ask my companions in the armed forces to re-establish the
juridical order through a presidential succession.''

HOPING FOR A VISIT FROM THE SOPRANOS, THE ROYAL (IF FICTIONAL)
FAMILY OF N.J.
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Santiago owns the East Coast Fitness Center on Garibaldi
Avenue, a nice, bright place in Lodi, N.J., with a maze of weight
machines and mirrors. So it's curious that he would invite in a
crew known for foul language, hair-trigger tempers and messy
murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't bother me,'' he said. In fact, he would welcome
it.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago is another guy angling for a visit from New Jersey's
First Family. Not Christie and John. But Tony and Carmela.
</P>
<P>
   The Sopranos, the mythical mobsters of television fame, seem to
be on everyone's A-list. The show has been swamped with invitations
to film scenes at countless homes and businesses. Perhaps it's not
surprising. In real life, only a special few are ``made'' members
of the Mafia, and only a slightly wider circle can claim to be
``connected.'' But ``The Sopranos'' offers everyone virtual
connectedness, gangland-style.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when the show's scouts stopped by the Brookstone
store at Garden State Plaza in Paramus last year looking for a
location to stage some unpleasantness, they got the red carpet
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your show is so good, you could use one of our products to
`whack' someone and I'd still be happy (stab someone in the eyes
with a BBQ fork?),'' Gustavo Pena, Brookstone's marketing director,
later wrote to the show's producers. Pena, with an eye toward
marketing, said he had in mind a stainless steel fork designed to
test when meat is done. The scene was ultimately shot at the
Sharper Image in the mall. But, Pena said, ``I understand Tony this
season will be using a Brookstone scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Michael Bucco offered a vacant house he owned in
Cliffside Park, N.J., as a dynamite site for a fiery mob rub-out.
``Actually, they'd be doing me a favor if they blew it up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret McGuigan of Harrison, N.J., recently wrote to offer her
three-family house after getting a notice that the show was
scouting her neighborhood. She was on the Town Council at the time,
so ``I used my stationery, thinking that might help.'' The show
didn't bite, but she heard that an acquaintance turned down a
$1,000 offer from ``The Sopranos'' to shoot a coffin being carried
out of her house.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGuigan, 79, was incredulous. ``I wouldn't care if they put
me in the coffin for $1,000,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kamine, the show's location manager, says he thinks viewers
feel unusually close to the show because much of it is shot in the
real world, rather than in a studio, and because the characters are
flawed in recognizable ways. ``People feel like they know these
characters, they know the area, and some people even feel like they
can be part of it,'' Kamine said.
</P>
<P>
   That probably accounts for a letter from one viewer to the
show's creator, David Chase, a New Jersey native. ``I, like you,
have always had a fascination with the Pulaski Skyway,'' the letter
began. ``Its stark beauty is something to behold.'' He suggested
various filming locations, saying his house ``in Glen Ridge would
make for great exterior shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' plays on two themes of life in New Jersey and
those Jersey wannabe places, like Long Island: the myth of placid
suburban lives and the suspicion of a gangster in every
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a New Jersey thing,'' said Rob Ciuppa, the manager of the
Hugo Boss store at Garden State Plaza. ``That's why we all want to
be in it.'' When ``The Sopranos'' was shooting at the mall, Ciuppa
said, one of his bosses told him, ``I don't care if they spread
blood all over the floor, let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But letting the Sopranos into your life can get old. Kamine said
that the owner of the Sopranos' supposed house (secretly located in
North Caldwell) told him: ``I used to be known as a good
businessman and a nice guy. Now I'm known as the guy who lives in
Tony Soprano's house.''
</P>
<P>
   If he ever bails on the show, others are waiting. In fact,
several people paid ``fees'' to a man who posed as an agent
registering locations for the show. As truth imitates television,
it turns out it was a scam. The crew of ``The Sopranos'' and the
police are on the man's case. Maybe they just ought to put him in
the show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGEBURG, S.C. _ It was a day that sounded to the revelry call
of military themes as Sen. John McCain campaigned across South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   First thing Saturday morning in Aiken, the Arizona Republican
was met at his campaign bus by an honor guard of men from the
Marine Corps League standing at attention in their red jackets and
veterans caps.
</P>
<P>
   In audience after audience veterans rose to be recognized at the
command of McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   And at a campaign barbecue here, Rep. Mark Sanford called McCain
the best candidate for president because ``if you're going to be
commander-in-chief of the armed services and put young men and
young women in harm's way, then you yourself should have been in
harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though South Carolina has a tradition of sticking with the party
establishment, McCain is trying to use his gripping personal story
to appeal to the state's 450,000 veterans and enlisted military
personnel and edge out Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the Feb. 19
primary.
</P>
<P>
   At several events Saturday, McCain fielded questions about the
United Nations, veterans benefits, gun control and even foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made some serious mistakes,'' he said about
foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a place for assistance to countries that need
it,'' he said, ``but I think a lot of that aid is better done in
public-private partnerships.''

 &HT;    Robertson puts crash behind him
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Marcus Robertson looks you in the eye when
he talks, speaking with intensity and passion about the Tennessee
Titans defense.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to return the gaze without flinching a bit at the
scars that criss-cross his handsome face.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, the day after the Titans beat Jacksonville
41-14, the defensive back had a motorcycle accident no more than 30
yards from his home in Nashville. Robertson's only injuries were to
his face. He has one scar above his left eye, a deeper gouge below
it and a scar above his lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Mondays, I just take the bike for a spin around the
corner,'' Robertson said. ``This (particular) Monday, I just
happened to lay it down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a routine ride that the safety wasn't thinking
about, well, safety. He didn't fasten the chinstrap on his
motorcycle helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I fell it popped off,'' he said. ``It happened so
quick _ I can honestly say I felt my face on the gravel. ... I
think I slipped on an oil patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he immediately thought his career was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't even dawn on me that I would get the
opportunity to be part of this team after the accident until, I
guess, I actually got back out there against Buffalo (two weeks
later),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-year veteran from Iowa State, he was so embarrassed by
the incident that he holed up at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher called three days later asking him to
come to the training complex. He didn't go. Two assistant coaches
then came to his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke down in tears; it meant a lot,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his teammates ``gave me comfort. They said, `Hey Marcus,
you're going to be all right, it's not as bad as we initially
thought.' All those things made me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who ranked third on the team in tackles with 92, is
grateful to Fisher for bringing him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's ever questioned Marcus Robertson's toughness,''
Fisher said of the man who played the second half of the Sept. 26
Jaguars game with three teeth missing after knocking out a bridge
in the second quarter. ``We questioned his decisions regarding the
incident, as did he.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt the sooner Marcus was able to come back in the
building and reunite himself with his teammates, the quicker he
would get on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson missed one game, then had four tackles against
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the first piece of contact to get over the hump and
put it behind me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's put his motorcycle behind him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get it fixed and sell it,'' Robertson said. ``I'm
not going to ride it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a safety advocate, ``I'm looking to put myself in the best
four-wheel drive vehicles that I can find.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robertson won't have plastic surgery to hide the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just live with whatever scars I have,'' he said.

 &HT;    Dungy's defense will be tested
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Tony Dungy switched from quarterback to safety
during his first season as an NFL player in 1977. The Tampa Bay
coach has remained a defensive-minded convert.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy's bias toward defense was a key factor in his hiring by
the Buccaneers four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was probably never any doubt that I was going to stress
defense if I got hired,'' Dungy said. ``Tampa Bay already had some
good defensive people in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons (general manager) Rich McKay hired
me is because there were already some good defenders around here
and he thought I knew something about defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dungy knew about defense. He had spent the previous 16
years as a defensive assistant before landing the top job at Tampa
Bay. He and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin have been the
masterminds behind the No. 3 defense in the NFL this year. Some say
the Buccaneers are the best because of their speed and tackling
ability.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the NFC Championship Game, the Tampa Bay defense faces
one of its toughest challenges in the Dungy era. The St. Louis Rams
have the league's top-ranked offense and are loaded with weapons
such as quarterback Kurt Warner, tailback Marshall Faulk and
receivers Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the Rams are quick and fast,'' Tampa Bay defensive
tackle Warren Sapp said. ``They can do a lot of things very well.
The best thing about this game is that there are not four footballs
out there at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you stop the Rams? Warner is the NFL's Most Valuable
Player, but Tampa Bay's game plan begins with slowing Faulk. He is
likely to be shadowed by Pro Bowl linebacker Derrick Brooks
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing they have special is (Faulk),'' Sapp said. ``He
can do so many things for that ballclub, but we've got to eliminate
their rushing attack. If we do that, then it becomes a matter of if
we can pass rush and cover ... and we feel real confident in that
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers also are known as one of the best tackling teams
in the NFL, which is important, especially against the Rams _ who
thrive on making big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of speed and because of that, when we miss
tackles, there is usually someone there to make it,'' Dungy said.
``That's what we try to emphasize: Just go aggressively, and if you
miss, someone else will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy lavished heavy praise on St. Louis this weekend, saying
the Rams had the fastest offense and defense the Buccaneers had
seen this season. Dungy said the task of beating the Rams is
daunting but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a lot of flaws with the (St. Louis offense), but
that team has lost three games this season,'' Dungy said.
``Hopefully, they will lose a fourth after all is said and done
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers proved they could shut down a powerful team,
beating the league's second-ranked offense in the Washington
Redskins last week. The Buccaneers limited the Redskins to 157
total offensive yards.

GORE SEEKS TO LINK BRADLEY TO THE REAGAN ERA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR FALLS, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore sought Saturday to
link his Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley, with what
he said was a negative direction that President Ronald Reagan took
the country in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that Bradley has said he wanted to model his
leadership style after that of Reagan, who focused on just a few
big issues. Gore then recounted several matters that he said Reagan
had ignored, allowing a quadrupling of the national debt, a rise in
AIDS cases and an increase in unemployment, implying that a Bradley
presidency would have the same disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``By contrast, in the last 7 1-2 years, President Clinton and I
have not turned our backs or turned away from any of the major
fights that were important to the American people,'' Gore declared
to 1,000 people at a rally at a campus field house here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has premised much of his newfound strength in the
Democratic primary on being a fighter, and he has faulted Bradley
for ``quitting'' the Senate, which he retired from in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's portrayal of himself as a fighter, in contrast to Bradley
as a quitter, has become the central theme of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He hammered it Saturday in a busy day of bus rides and plane
trips across north-central Iowa to rally voters for Monday's Iowa
caucuses. He campaigned in Fort Dodge with his wife, Tipper, and
was joined here by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While casting Bradley as a man of limited vision, Gore cast
himself as caring about a range of issues and offered voters a
veritable grab-bag of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore said in Fort Dodge: ``My expectations would be not to
focus on just one issue but to keep on fighting for all of your
interests against every challenge that the American people face,
and move our people forward by focusing on health care and
education, child care and Medicare, cleaning up the environment and
keeping our economy strong. We need to keep our prosperity going,
and we need to lift up the working people of the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Is discussing other topics, Gore called for more money for
research into cancer and diabetes, spoke out against discrimination
against gays and railed against striker-replacement laws.

&HT;     GORE URGES STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED LABOR TO TURN OUT FOR
CAUCUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR FALLS, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore blitzed across
central and eastern Iowa Saturday in an effort to bolster his
support among students and organized labor for what polls suggest
may be a Monday night landslide for him in the state's party
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning visit to Ft. Dodge, Gore appeared in this
college town at the University of Northern Iowa with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., who won 31 percent of the Democratic vote in the
Iowa caucuses in 1980 in his fruitless challenge to then-President
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Although all of Gore's Saturday events were billed as open to
the community, they appeared aimed at union workers and students,
two key groups whose heavy turnout could provide the vice president
with the big win he is seeking in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   At his first stop, Fort Dodge, he appeared at Iowa Central
Community College. After Cedar Falls, he went on to Cedar Rapids _
Iowa's second largest city _ where he spoke at a Teamsters union
hall. And in Dubuque, he spoke at Dubuque Senior High School.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, college seniors who are 18 by Election Day this
November are eligible to participate in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   In a converted gymnasium here, Kennedy admonished the crowd
composed mostly of students and members of organized labor to turn
out Monday night, joking that if they do, ``I'll forgive you`` for
the 1980 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Late polls show Gore solidifying his lead over former Sen. Bill
Bradley 48 hours before the caucuses get under way in 2,100 voting
precincts across Iowa. A statewide poll by WHO-TV in Des Moines
showed Gore with 53 percent to Bradley's 32 percent. A University
of Iowa poll put Gore at 63 percent to Bradley's 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters in the University of Iowa poll said they
thought Gore was stronger than Bradley was on international
affairs, the economy and even health care, an issue where Bradley
has tried to out-distance Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's standing among voters on international matters has grown
steadily since November, while confidence in Bradley on this issue
has dropped, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Poll director Arthur Miller said previously undecided Democratic
voters were breaking for Gore by a 2-1 margin. And Gore's advantage
over Bradley on handling the economy has more than doubled from a
15-point difference in late summer to more than a 35-point
difference now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really struck me the most is how much shifting
around is going on in the closing of the race,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally here, a high school band blasted ``Let's Twist
Again'' as Gore entered with Kennedy. Appearing relaxed in an
open-collar blue shirt and white trousers, Gore took the cordless
mike and walked out from behind the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that some candidates were playing the ``expectations
game`` where candidates try to low-ball predictions of how they
will do election night so they can claim momentum if they do better
than expected. For example, Bradley last week sought to lower
expectations when he told reporters he would feel good about Iowa
if he got 31 percent of the vote, the same as Kennedy did in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said that kind of expectation wasn't for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are that the people of Iowa and the United
States will speak out loudly and clearly (for) ...revolutionary
improvements in our public schools,'' the vice president said,
repeating the ``my-expectations-are'' riff for Medicare
prescription coverage, regulation of managed care health plans,
support for family farmers and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Kennedy took a swipe at Bradley, saying that
when he got 31 percent of the vote in 1980, ``I don't remember
giving a victory speech.''
</P>
<P>
   This college community is adjacent to Waterloo, Iowa's fifth
largest city. The site of sprawling tractor and pork-production
plants, Waterloo is expected to go strongly for Gore because of
organized labor's strength there.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd had been contacted to attend the rally by the
cadre of labor organizers working in tandem with the Gore campaign
to guarantee a big Gore night at the region's caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very labor-oriented community,'' said Kevin Powers,
president of the local postal workers union. Support for Gore by
AFL-CIO unions as well as the Iowa chapter of the United Automobile
Workers ``definitely helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign and organized labor have been so thorough in
contacting union members that some labor officials worry that
workers will be turned off by receiving too many calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting innundated (by calls) is the only negative reaction
we've seen,'' said one union official sent to the region from
Washington, and who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president and presidential candidate, Gore has worked
this area assiduously.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Pat Harper said she supported Gore not only because
she agrees with him on education _ she's a former math teacher _
but also out of a ``sense of loyalty.'' Gore contributed to her
campaign in 1997 and telephoned her after she won.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is doing well, it is important for him to pour it
on in the last days of the campaign to drum up his base of support,
said campaign spokesman Chris LeHane. ``Our goal is to inspire
today, so that people will perspire for Gore on Monday night,'' he
said.

FORBES EMPHASIZES POSITION AGAINST ABORTION AND TAXES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ Exchanging his trademark two-bus caravan for
a DC-9, Steve Forbes spent Saturday on an air tour of Republican
strongholds in north and west Iowa. Accompanied by the
anti-abortion activist Phyllis Schlafly and conservative Rep. Bob
Barr of Georgia, Forbes continued to rally supporters on his twin
themes of anti-tax and anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life begins at conception and should end only with natural
death,'' said Forbes, who repeated the same phrase at campaign
events in Mason City and Council Bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When any one of us is vulnerable, we are all vulnerable. The
consequences of Roe vs. Wade is that when afflicted, we will be
told we need euthanasia, assisted suicide. This leads us to a
darkened world.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' remarks came on the 27th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion. To highlight his anti-abortion
stand, Forbes appeared with Ms. Schlafly before a crowd of about
650 _ his largest to date _ in Sioux City. The appearance of Ms.
Schlafly and Barr, was not announced in advance, and their presence
energized an already enthusiastic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noted all the candidates are now saying they are pro-life,''
Ms. Schlafly said. ``But the difference is if they are going to do
something about it. You have the candidate who will.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been criticized by some conservatives for being a
latecomer to the anti-abortion position. To cement his ties to Ms.
Schlafly, the campaign distributed handouts at the Sioux City
gathering, showing a beaming Forbes shaking hands with Ms.
Schlafly.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Forbes also hit his anti-tax promises.
</P>
<P>
   To a crowd waving signs saying ``Scrap the Tax Code,'' Forbes
got a cheer when he declared in Mason City, ``we're overtaxed in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with snow swirling outside, he drew a laugh when he said,
``I suppose they haven't found ways to tax the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Monday night, the tax code will be history,'' he said.
``We'll get rid of it and put in real tax cuts for real working
people.''

 &HT;    Crowd, turf suit St. Louis
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As if their offensive potency isn't daunting enough,
the Rams again will have another advantage today. They'll display
all that speed on their favorite fast track. The artificial surface
of the raucous Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know now how our fans react to a home game in the
playoffs,'' said St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil, whose team plays
host to Tampa Bay in the NFC Championship Game. They'll react as
the record crowd of 66,194 did in last Sunday's 49-37 divisional
playoff victory against Minnesota, the first home playoff game in
St. Louis football history. They'll be LOUD.
</P>
<P>
   Ear-shatteringly loud. ``They were so loud it was hard for us to
hear when we were making our checks,'' Rams defensive end Kevin
Carter said. ``That's all right; (the Vikings) couldn't hear
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the crowd noise caused a fumble by Minnesota quarterback
Jeff George on a snap. The reason the dome crowds are so loud? In
this most unexpectedly spectacular season in Rams history, they are
dominant at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are 9-0 in the Trans World Dome this season; their
overall home winning streak of 10 in a row is the second-longest in
franchise history. The noise is one factor. So is the turf that
makes St. Louis' team speed even faster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams outscored opponents 362-139 in the dome, scoring an
average of 36.9 points per game while yielding 13.9. They've
outscored opponents 83-19 in the first quarter at home, torching
Minnesota for a 77-yard Kurt Warner-to-Isaac Bruce touchdown pass
on the Rams' first play and Marshall Faulk's 41-yard score on a
screen pass on the fifth play.
</P>
<P>
   A repetition of those quick strikes could prove costly for the
low-scoring Bucs, who allow 14.7 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermeil said he doesn't foresee that, not even with his
team's superior speed. Especially at home. ``I think we have a
very, very fast football team,'' he said. ``Tampa Bay's defense is
very quick and moves well, and plays a bend-but-don't-break style.
I don't think we'll have as big an advantage (in speed) as we do
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   QUOTABLES
</P>
<P>
   _ Bruce on the reputation for physical play by the Buccaneers
secondary, especially John Lynch, one of the hardest-hitting strong
safeties in the NFL: ``Lynch is the guy who probably thinks he can
put us on our backs. I don't think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynch, in reply: ``We'll have a chance to meet. I think I'll
greet him with a nice Tampa hello.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynch again, on some of the comments emanating from Rams Park
this week: ``They're confident and have a right to be. But some of
the things are surprising. I've never heard a coach say (as Vermeil
did), ``I don't find any weaknesses on my team.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warner on the $500,000 bonus he received from the Rams at the
end of the regular season: ``I haven't spent a dime. I invested it
so I can take care of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   QB, OR NOT QB?
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Saturday that the Rams
likely will trade Trent Green in the offseason. Green was to be
their starting quarterback after signing a $16 million free-agent
contract in February. But he was lost for the season after tearing
up his knee in the third pre-season game. Warner became the first
undrafted player in league history to be named the NFL's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Green's agent, Jim Steiner, is pushing for a trade, and the Rams
are glad to oblige.

 &HT;    Turf toe bothering McNair
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Before Steve McNair can get a Super Bowl
ring on his finger, he has to worry about his toe.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's turf toe, a sprain of his big left toe, kept him out of
practice Friday and he was on the team injury report as
``questionable.'' However, coach Jeff Fisher said he expected him
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' said McNair, who aggravated the toe on the
artificial turf at Indianapolis and in the Titans' practice bubble
Thursday. ``It's a bit swollen. Come Sunday, I don't think it's
going to hold me back.''
</P>
<P>
   He again wore the gray protective boot to help the toe heal.
Last year, McNair wore a plastic shield over the top of his shoe to
keep the toe from further injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not there yet,'' he said. ``I'm going to try to stay away
from that one.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if it rains today, he won't be able to wear his shoe of
choice. McNair prefers baseball cleats because they don't push up
through the sole of his shoe as much as football cleats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it rains, I'll go with the seven-stud cleats, and that's
probably one of the worst shoes that I can wear,'' McNair said.
``The baseball shoe doesn't hold up well on the wet surface, so
I'll have to deal with whatever effects there are after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans win, however, he can start thinking about dressing
up his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some guys across the league that you see every
summer, going to different celebrity functions,'' McNair said,
``and before you see them, you see their Super Bowl ring.''
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO STAR
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Chris Sanders and his family will appear in
Madonna's new video, her remake of ``American Pie.'' Madonna had
originally agreed to sing the song at the Super Bowl, but canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a video dealing with families, and they picked us to be
the All-American family,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Madonna's penchant for controversial topics, Sanders said,
``At first I was kind of skeptical, like this is against what I
believe. But she says something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The video's producer called Sanders' wife, Stacie, who is an
actress. They appear briefly with their two children, ages 3 and 10
months. DO I KNOW YOU?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee defensive end Jevon Kearse and Jacksonville running
back FredTaylor are friends. They talk often during the season and
have even discussed plans to vacation together.
</P>
<P>
   But when they take the field today, Kearse said, ``We're not
going to be buddy-buddy and `I'll pull up on you if you pull up on
me.' I don't know if we'll talk trash or not, but all that
friendship thing we have to put aside for a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   TABLE TENNIS TITAN
</P>
<P>
   Larry Brown expected the Titans to set up table tennis Saturday
at the team hotel, just as they did at a team gathering New Year's
Eve in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the rookie tight end from the University of Georgia
further impressed his teammates with his athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play around with it a little bit,'' he said modestly, as
locker room neighbor Kevin Dyson egged him on. ``I let a couple of
people beat me so somebody would want to play me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you play like this,'' said Dyson, pretending to hold
the paddle in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Brown. ``I palmed it. They said I'd been
cheating. They tried to diminish my skills by saying I can't serve
a certain way.''

 &HT;    Sapp says to forget spread
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some Tampa Bay players have sarcastically suggested
that they shouldn't suit up for today's NFC Championship Game
because many experts have said the Buccaneers are going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is listed as a 14 1/2-point favorite and the ``heavy
underdog'' talk has been thrown in the face of the Buccaneers all
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, (the Rams) don't get those (14 1/2) points on the
scoreboard,'' Warren Sapp said. ``When we walk into the Trans World
Dome (today), the scoreboard is going to say 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go to war for 60 minutes with the Rams and
then look up at the scoreboard and see what it says.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what (the prognosticators) say, you still have to
play the game,'' linebacker Derrick Brooks said. ``We've got a big
challenge, and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, teams favored by 10 points or
more have won seven out of eight times. As far as those same teams
covering the spread, half of them have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change what you are,'' Sapp said. ``We are a (14 1/2
point) underdog. That's fine. No one has to believe we can win
except for the 53 guys in this lockerroom. We have the faith and
belief that we can go out and get it done (today).''
</P>
<P>
   SLOW STARTERS
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Buccaneers trail early in today's
game. It has been an unwelcome sight for Tampa Bay, which has
trailed its opponent going into halftime during five of its past
six games. The Buccaneers were down 13-0 to the Washington Redskins
in last weekend's NFC divisional playoff before rallying for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew the answer to (getting off to slow starts),''
coach Tony Dungy said. ``We've started quickly just a couple of
times all year. Obviously, it would be great to start off fast
(today).
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we don't...we've been in that spot all year, where
we've had to play from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   PROVEN WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay roster is stocked with key players from the
state's ultra-successful colleges of Florida, Florida State and
Miami. The standouts include Sapp (Miami), Brooks (FSU), and the
receiving duo of Jacquez Green (Florida) and Reidel Anthony
(Florida).
</P>
<P>
   Have those players being part of those perennial college powers
helped spread a winning attitude?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it bodes well for you when you come from a winning
program because you are accustomed to winning, and winning brings
confidence to you,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have won as many games as Miami, FSU, and Florida
have won over the years, you know what it takes to win in big
games. I think all us have done a good job of transferring the
winning in college to the preparation that we have to go out and
win games in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers rookie quarterback Shaun King has acted like Mr.
Cool, but he has been really cool since arriving in St. Louis,
where highs have been in the high 30s. ``It's kind of chilly. But
it won't matter in the dome.'' ... Fullback Mike Alstott paid
homage to the St. Louis defense, which has been virtually ignored
in light of the Rams' high-powered offense. ``(The Rams' defense)
is very confident. We have to be aggressive against them and set
the tempo of the game.''

 &HT;    Fast start could be decisive
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ At no time is it more vital than today. Get
a quick start in a conference championship game and the momentum
usually carries over.
</P>
<P>
   With a wired-up home crowd behind them, the Jacksonville Jaguars
are well aware of the advantage of gaining an early lead on the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in order to get your fans completely in the game, you
have to give them a reason right off the bat,'' coach Tom Coughlin
said. ``They're excited before the game, and then you really need
to follow up with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' said running back Fred Taylor, whose 90-yard
touchdown run last week helped deflate the Miami Dolphins early in
their AFC divisional game on the way to a 62-7 victory. ``We like
to get the ball in the end zone very early, real quick, to get our
fans in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ROAD WARRIORS
</P>
<P>
   While nothing is quite the same in the playoffs, the home-field
advantage in regular-season games between the Titans and Jaguars
has been no factor. In their 10 meetings in five seasons, each team
is 4-1 on the road.... Coughlin, on losing the lead in the fourth
quarter to the Titans in their first meeting of the season, with
Tennessee winning 20-19 in Jacksonville: ``That's a game we should
have won. We lost the game. I lost the game. It's just a bad
memory.'' ... For all the talk of Jacksonville as a potential Super
Bowl city, this week's AFC Championship Game indicates its
shortcomings. With a cheerleaders convention downtown filling
hotels, the NFL had to designate the Ritz-Carlton at Amelia Island,
almost an hour from downtown, as its official hotel. The NFL
requires 17,500 hotel rooms within a 60-minute drive of the Super
Bowl site and Jacksonville remains about 3,550 rooms short.
Confident of closing that gap soon, Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver
said, ``This weekend will be a very persuasive argument that this
city is equipped to put on a Super Bowl event.''... Coughlin is
thankful the NFL reinstituted the instant replay system, but he
believes the system ``still has to be tinkered with.''... Defensive
end Tony Brackens had the flu during the last game against
Tennessee, when he was dominated by offensive tackle Brad Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   SCALPED TICKETS RETURNED
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors returned about 60 tickets that had been
confiscated from scalpers this week to the Jaguars ticket office,
preferring that they wind up in the hands of fans rather than
allowing seats to go empty. Copies of the tickets were made by the
authorities for use in the scalping cases. One man was arrrested
with 37 tickets in his possession.... Jaguars linebacker Kevin
Hardy, on Titans quarterback Steve McNair: ``A lot of people say
McNair's not the type of guy who's going to throw the ball a lot on
you, but if you look at us, he threw five touchdowns against us
last time. It doesn't make any difference what anybody else
thinks.''... Mark Brunell, on how the two losses to the Titans this
season affect the Jaguars: ``It certainly is a motivational factor
for us to know that up until now they've had our number.''... Both
teams have taken criticism for the quality of their schedules. The
Titans were the only team with a winning record the Jaguars played
during the regular season, and the Dolphins, in last week's playoff
game, were the first team with a winning record that they beat.
Tennessee played two teams other than the Jaguars with a winning
record, beating St. Louis 24-21 and losing to Miami 17-0.

CLIPPERS SUSPEND CLOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In today's episode of ``Where's The Boss?''
Clipper fans will learn where Keith ``Boss'' Closs wasn't Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At practice.
</P>
<P>
   And his bosses, while attempting to be sensitive to recent
Closs-related events, have reacted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith has been suspended indefinitely,'' said Joe Safety, the
team's vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is Closs' reward for the cumulative sins of
miscommunication and failure to appear. The wayward backup center
has followed a trail of absence and childbirth for the past several
days.
</P>
<P>
   Following last Monday night's loss to San Antonio at Staples
Center, in which the 7-foot-3 Closs scored a season-high 13 points,
the Clippers boarded a plane and flew to Sacramento. But the flight
was delayed an hour; not coincidentally, Closs was an hour late in
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, teammate Michael Olowokandi was
uncharacteristically free from foul trouble, so Closs played six
minutes vs. the Kings and didn't score. Back at Staples the
following afternoon, he skipped out early during a required
weight-lifting session. That move earned a fine. Thursday, he
failed to show for a practice at Carson, and also failed to call
anyone associated with the team. Another fine.
</P>
<P>
   He missed Friday morning's shoot around, but did call that
afternoon to say the birth of his son, Keith Closs III, would
preempt his appearance at Friday night's game with Minnesota. The
absence was excused.
</P>
<P>
   But Closs failed to appear at Staples on Saturday for a
scheduled practice and a meeting with Coach Chris Ford. He also
failed to contact anyone associated with the team. Another fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Clippers play the Orlando Magic at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   The betting line on a Closs sighting has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   FAST BREAKS: A sore foot kept shooting guard Derek Anderson off
the practice court and in the training room. ... Reserve forward
Anthony Avent (migraine) also missed Saturday's practice.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The ingredients for Texas A&AMP;M's 30th
consecutive loss to a ranked team all were in place Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, ranked No. 12 in the nation, came to Reed Arena
with four seniors in its starting lineup. The Aggies started four
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were limiting teams to 38.2 percent shooting from
the field and forcing an average of 19.6 turnovers. The Aggies had
shot under 37 percent in three of their last four games and were
averaging 17.6 turnovers per game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies pulled off their biggest victory in more than a
decade, showing poise beyond their years down the stretch to upset
Oklahoma State 62-57. After the game, a horde of long-suffering
Aggies in the crowd of 5,563 stormed the court to celebrate with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big step for us,'' said A&AMP;M freshman point guard
Jamaal Gilchrist, who had 12 points, seven assists and six
rebounds. ``I don't want to always be in the position of trying to
beat a ranked team. I want to be a ranked team in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' last win over a Top 25 team came in 1987, when they
upset No. 15 Texas Christian in the first round of the Southwest
Conference postseason tournament. Since then, they were 0-29 _
including 0-3 this season _ against ranked teams. The last time
Texas A&AMP;M beat a team with a higher ranking was in 1982, when they
upset No. 5 Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stretch (against Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma
State in the last two weeks) has been brutal, but we've grown up
some,'' Aggies coach Melvin Watkins said. ``We hope this is the
beginning of what Aggie basketball is going to be all about. Maybe
people won't be as shocked when we beat a ranked team.''
</P>
<P>
   What is shocking is Texas A&AMP;M (6-10, 2-3 Big 12) turned the ball
over only nine times and won despite hitting only 15 of 31 free
throws. In the first 35 minutes, the Aggies were a miserable
5-of-19 from the line. Down the stretch, they were 10-of-12,
including 5-of-6 by Gilchrist and 3-of-4 by Aaron Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, Bernard (King) and I joke about hitting pressure
free throws,'' Gilchrist said. ``I wanted to get fouled. I wanted
to prove I could step up and hit pressure free throws. I wanted to
take some pressure off the guys who were missing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies trailed 55-50 with just more than five minutes left
in the game. With experience on their side, it looked as if the
Cowboys (14-2, 3-1) would be able to sneak away with the victory.
Instead, A&AMP;M held Oklahoma State to only four points the rest of
the way, going 2-of-7 from the field and 0-of-3 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrist and Jack, one of only two seniors in the Aggies'
nine-man rotation, took control, each scoring five points down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuck around and when the momentum changed, they bit us
like a wounded dog,'' Oklahoma State guard Glendon Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 38-35 lead in the first half behind 12 points
from Desmond Mason, Oklahoma State twice had chances to blow open
the game in the second half. They went ahead 43-35 in the first
minute of the half, but the Aggies went on a 13-2 run to take a
48-45 lead behind seven points by King, who led Texas A&AMP;M with 17.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Mason picked up his third and fourth fouls in a
two-minute span and left the game with 11:54 left. Without their
leading scorer, the Cowboys had problems on offense. Mason had a
game-high 19 points on 7-of-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Aggies struggling both from the field and at the foul
line, Oklahoma State went ahead 55-50 when point guard Doug
Gottlieb scored his only basket of the game at 5:16. Again, A&AMP;M
resisted a chance to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the more experienced Cowboys faltered down the stretch.
Oklahoma State was coming off a 73-65 victory over Texas on
Wednesday night, and coach Eddie Sutton admitted his team might
have taken the Aggies lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some concerns after beating Texas,'' Sutton said. ``If
you have an emotional, physical game like that, if you're not
careful there can a letdown. The coaching staff respected this
team, but maybe the players didn't have as much respect as they
should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up too many offensive rebounds (17) and just didn't
play well enough to win. They outplayed us down the stretch when
they suddenly realized they could upset us. Don't get me wrong, I'm
disappointed that we lost, but I have to take my hat off to Texas
A&AMP;M. This is the kind of stuff you can really build.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies will find out if this win was a one-shot wonder, or
if they can sustain some momentum. They play games at Iowa State on
Wednesday and Missouri on Saturday, two of the toughest road venues
in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to us not to get too big-headed,'' Gilchrist said.
``We can't settle for just one win over a ranked team. We've got a
lot more on our schedule, but I think we're on the way up.''

BRADLEY VOWS TO SPREAD ECONOMIC GAINS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ On a bus tour across eastern Iowa, former Sen.
Bill Bradley tried to energize his supporters and win over
undecided voters Saturday by hammering home the central theme of
his campaign: that he would spread prosperity to people who have
not benefited from the roaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time all of us got on this prosperity train,''
Bradley told 150 people at a school in Maquoketa, arguing that
``the politics of plenty'' made it possible for government to do
more to help low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   At each of his stops, Bradley, who is thought to be trailing
Vice President Al Gore by a wide margin in this state, urged
supporters to make calls this weekend to get friends and neighbors
to attend the caucuses on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're behind,'' Bradley said in Clinton. ``Maybe we'll
surprise a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he tried to avoid mentioning Gore by name, Bradley
repeatedly drew implicit contrasts with the vice president,
suggesting that he would be a more confident, visionary leader than
Gore. Throughout the campaign, Bradley has asserted that his
proposals to restrict gun ownership, expand health care and reduce
poverty were more sweeping than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out there and I say, `What's at stake here in this
election?''' Bradley said. ``It's whether we're going to do
something big or whether we're going to nibble around the edges. If
you want to nibble around the edges, I'm not your guy. If you want
to do something big, come along.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Gov. Tom Vilsack, a popular first-term
Democrat, appeared with Bradley before a boisterous crowd of 300
people at an event here promoting campaign finance reform. Vilsack
is neutral in the race, but his wife and many of his aides have
endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier, Bradley was asked if he thought
his campaign had missed opportunities in Iowa. He said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will leave here with the knowledge that we have run a
strong campaign,'' he said. ``I was never somebody who after a game
would wake up in the middle of the night wondering what could have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, some of Bradley's own supporters have been
critical of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Davenport, for instance, Bill Gluba, a volunteer
for Bradley, complained that the campaign had spent too much money
on commercials in Iowa _ $1.5 million _ and not enough on
get-out-the-vote operations. ``You don't go spending hundreds of
thousands on ads and then only give us three phones,'' Gluba said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides disputed assertions that the campaign was
struggling, saying Bradley had recently picked up the endorsements
of two small unions representing social workers and locomotive
engineers. ``People are coming on board,'' said Eric Hauser,
Bradley's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the enthusiastic crowds that greeted him Saturday,
there were indications of the uphill road facing Bradley on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton and Maquoketa, the crowds of 100 to 200 people were
swollen by scores of volunteers from other states who cannot vote
here, including a group of about 40 students from Wheaton College
in Illinois who were helping the campaign as part of political
science project.
</P>
<P>
   Among Iowa residents, it was unclear how deep Bradley's support
ran. In Clinton, for example, one audience member, Mike Jargo, said
he liked Bradley but would probably vote for Steve Forbes, a
Republican. Seated next to him, Larry and Margo Ketelsen said they
were torn between Bradley and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And seated in front of Jargo, Willard Larsen said he would like
to vote for Bradley but probably would not make it to the caucuses.
``I have another commitment that night,'' he said.

RILEY OUGHT TO LOOK IN MIRROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami coach Pat Riley has always been a master of spin, but even
someone as slick (phony) as Riley took things to a new level when
he sparked a feud with Philadelphia coach Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a proposed trade between the Heat and Sixers that
would have sent Larry Hughes, Billy Owens, Nazr Mohammed and Bruce
Bowen to the Heat for Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal stalled, Riley went on Miami talk-radio Thursday,
and blasted Sixers management for leaking the trade to the media.
He didn't merely deny the deal, he tried to embarrass the Sixers in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he had ``a very hard time with other management that
leaks information. That really bothers me, because you can't trust
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds reasonable. Unless you consider that Riley is as adept as
anyone at leaking information to the media. Last week, he was
telling reporters in Miami that a proposed three-way deal for the
Lakers' Glen Rice was not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just doing it for honesty's sake, he was trying to
relieve pressure to make a deal for the former Heat star.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Riley wasn't about to get the last word with an
adversary like Sixers coach Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed somebody would take a shot at us,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   This being the NBA, a few insults aren't about to stop a deal,
so there still is plenty of momentum for the trade going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody will make a trade if it makes their team
better whether it's Pat Riley or George Karl or anybody,'' Brown
said. ``That's the responsibility of every team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is also a great double-talker, then decided it was
his turn to take a couple of parting shots at the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys aren't ever held accountable. You hear something and
you report it,'' Brown said. ``Then you go on to the next thing. I
don't think any of you ever worry about the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair for you guys to keep speculating and not be held
accountable. It's not right. I'm keeping tabs. So far, you guys are
about 0 for 25. They'd fire you if you were the Eagles coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brown didn't notice that Sixers GM Billy King acknowledged
to reporters he had talked to Heat GM Randy Pfund.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he shouldn't be shopping Hughes all over the league if
he doesn't want to read about proposed trades.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is: What are the Sixers really thinking?
Hughes plays a position (point guard) that is possibly the hardest
to fill on a roster and still has plenty of potential in only his
second year in the league. Mashburn has seen better days and
remains a bit of an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   Philly obviously is looking at bigger things down the road and
may just want Mashburn's salary slot for a run at Toronto's Tracy
McGrady after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen-squeak: Wherever he goes, Scottie Pippen seems to make a
fool of himself sooner or later. When Portland played Dallas last
week, Pippen said Mavericks forward Michael Finley didn't deserve
to be on the All-Star team, because he plays on a losing team.
</P>
<P>
   Finley then went out and had 32 points, eight rebounds and six
assists as the Mavs upset the Blazers. Finley refused to shake
Pippen's hand after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's response? ``Mike's playing on a bad team, that's a true
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   No Mo deals: According to a published report, Clippers forward
Maurice Taylor has put out word through agent David Falk that he
will not re-sign with any team that trades for him before the Feb.
24 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's reasoning? He's angry that the Clippers refused to
offer him a $71 million extension, and wants to make sure that he
leaves at the end of the season without the Clippers getting
anything in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons remain the front-runner to sign Taylor after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Diplomatic: Vancouver forward Othella Harrington drew the
ire of fans after a proposed deal to sell the Grizzlies fell
through, meaning the team would not move to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day in Vancouver,'' Harrington said. Since being
traded to the Grizzlies in the Steve Francis deal, he has
complained about the weather, taxes and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful city when you can see it,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After enraging normally placid Canadians with his comments,
Harrington refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I really care what people call me?'' Harrington said. ``I
just want them to appreciate what I do on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rules: Just when Michael Jordan's sweetheart deal with
the Wizards hit a snag, new Dallas owner Mark Cuban decided to
offer His Airness a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it my best, just to see,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he was given ``two seconds'' with Jordan but was told
the Wizards deal was too far into the process to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Word is Cuban may now set his sights on Isiah Thomas as a
minority owner and team president.
</P>
<P>
   Staples review: Minnesota coach Flip Saunders was asked before
Friday's game against the Clippers his opinion of Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there's a lot of Clippers influence, with all
the purple seats. It looks like the Lakers,'' Saunders said.

HARD TO FIGURE OUT THIS SHELL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Art Shell is a proud man and rightfully so. He
was also a perplexed one _ and rightfully so _ as he stood along
the sidelines at the Senior Bowl practice sessions last week.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Shell, as a head coach, took the Raiders to the
playoffs three times and had only one losing season, he has yet to
have a chance at another head job.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is a Hall of Fame offensive tackle who played for Oakland,
became a longtime NFL assistant, and went 54-38 as the Los Angeles
Raiders' head coach from 1989-94, taking his team to the AFC
championship game in 1990, after which he was named Coach of the
Year. He was fired after going 9-7 in 1994 and missing the playoffs
by a half-game to Kansas City despite having an offense that scored
625 points, the best in the league that season.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, Shell has earned a second chance to be a head
coach. That chance has never come.
</P>
<P>
   Other than last offseason's brief dalliance with the Patriots to
come in as assistant head coach (and executioner, which he had no
interest in being), Shell has not been called to interview since he
left the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frustrating,'' Shell acknowledged in the low-key
way he approaches nearly everything besides pro football. ``I'm
trying to be patient, but I hear the names and look at the records
and I wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's no wonder that he's wondering.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have not had a winning season since he left. While
guys with losing track records, such as Bill Belichick, are fought
over, and ones like Dave Wannstedt are elevated without question,
Shell is still in Atlanta coaching the Falcons' offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Despite job openings in Dallas, New Orleans, New England (sort
of), New York (sort of), Green Bay (for two weeks), and Miami (for
10 minutes), Shell's phone has not rung once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should call AT&AMP;T,'' he joked. ``People ask me why. I
don't have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   What compounds this situation is the fact that Shell is an
African-American in a league in which 70 percent of the players are
black but only two of the head coaches are, since the firing of Ray
Rhodes in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Jesse Jackson, who heads the Rainbow Coalition and
Operation PUSH, immediately called the Packers to task for firing
Rhodes after an 8-8 season, claiming black coaches were being held
to a different standard than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy immediately countered Jackson's
claim, stating that the teams that should be criticized are not
ones like the Packers who have hired black coaches, but the
overwhelming majority that have not.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers have long had black offensive and defensive
coordinators, although it's likely they won't both survive the
hiring of Mike Sherman, an untested assistant who was named head
man despite not having worked as a head coach since he ran a high
school program 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to Sherman, who is known to be a disciplinarian
(which the Packers were seeking) but when does a .000 winning
percentage beat .587, which Shell earned with the Raiders?
</P>
<P>
   Since Shell was fired, he has worked as an offensive line coach
in Kansas City and Atlanta while teams have awarded head jobs to
less-proven coaches such as Andy Reid, Steve Mariucci, Chan Gailey,
Wannstedt (twice), and Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   That fact speaks directly to the issue raised by Jackson, and it
is a question commissioner Paul Tagliabue insists he is working on.
Maybe so, but the fact is that among the serious candidates being
mentioned at this week's Senior Bowl workouts for head jobs in
Dallas, New Orleans, New England, New York, and Green Bay, not one
was a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis and ex-Oakland
defensive coordinator Willie Shaw were given cursory interviews in
New England, but everyone knows owner Bob Kraft plans to hire
Belichick unless there is a tremendous price to pay in compensation
to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   However, it might be a wise thing for people like Lewis and Shaw
to play along, to get their names into circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The sad reality is that there is little opportunity for black
coaches to reach the top in the NFL if a man like Shell cannot even
get an interview when nearly 20 percent of the head coaching jobs
are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Wannstedt (40-56 with the Chicago Bears) replaced
Jimmy Johnson without another candidate even being considered.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Kraft made Belichick (37-45 in Cleveland) his
one and only candidate from the day he decided to fire Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, word is either Dave Campo or Joe Avezzano, both
longtime assistants, will replace Gailey, who failed in his first
attempt at head coaching.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, word is Saints owner Tom Benson would love to
bring in Dom Capers, the Jacksonville Jaguars' defensive
coordinator (who went 31-35 as head coach of the Carolina
Panthers).
</P>
<P>
   In New York, new Jets owner Robert Johnson was trying to lure
Bill Parcells back to replace Belichick, who quit one day after
moving in. Parcells is the most qualified coach of any candidate,
but he insists he's not interested. Johnson insists he'll have a
coach by the end of the week; so the Jets' next choice is expected
to be Parcells's longtime assistant, Al Groh.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is clear: The NFL continues to talk a far better
game than it delivers when it comes to equal opportunity in
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, six teams will hire new head coaches this year
and none will be black.
</P>
<P>
   The white men who own football teams and the white ones who run
them have never been inclined to put black men in charge of their
product. And, it seems, they never will be.
</P>
<P>
   12 into 11
</P>
<P>
   Here's how bad it got last season as the New Orleans coaching
staff began to sink in a sea of defeat and mistrust. One of the
coaches came to believe offensive coordinator Dan Abramowicz was
paying no attention to the weekly breakdowns of opponents'
defenses, so one week he handed in a report with 12 men lined up on
defense against every Saints formation. Abramowicz, reportedly,
never said a word about it . . . Word is Cleveland tackle Orlando
Brown had witnesses rolling on the floor at his hearing with
Tagliabue as he fought to answer questions about pushing down the
official who accidentally hit him in the eye with a penalty flag.
Apparently, the man called Zeus wasn't successful at doing it
without cursing, but he may end up with only a one-game suspension
and the return of one game check because he made clear to
everyone's satisfaction that he did not go back on the field to
attack the official but rather to return to the huddle. According
to Brown, he grew enraged only after he again saw the official who
had injured his eye and that it was then that he pushed the
official . . . Agent Tom Condon appeared to be in a ticklish
situation, representing both the officials' union and Brown, but he
said he did not see a conflict. ``I helped the officials form an
association and I advise them on those matters, but I represent
Orlando in contract negotiations and on enforcement of that
contract,'' Condon said. ``There was no conflict at all.'' . . .
San Diego Chargers GM Bobby Beathard said last week that he felt
his team will be stronger at quarterback next season, and that may
not be because of the presence of Ryan Leaf. ``I think we'll be
better there, but I don't know if Ryan will be the one playing,''
Beathard said. ``He's put himself in a difficult situation. He has
to win the team back. What he needs to do is just come in and do
what everyone else is doing without trying to find ways to get out
of things. If he can just do that and show that he's working hard
to get better, I think everything else can work out. But first he
has to show he's willing to do that.'' Leaf was sidelined by a
shoulder injury this season and has had several blowups with
Beathard. Just when Leaf appeared to be rounding into shape, he was
caught lying for the second time about doing a weight workout.
There will be no third chance with his teammates, including the
team's spiritual leader, Junior Seau, who remains angry with him.
``We have good leaders in Junior and (safety) Rodney (Harrison),''
said Beathard, ``and the players love (first-year coach) Mike
(Riley),'' who held the team together through a midseason swoon. .
. Beathard said he was not surprised with the fine play of Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning, who has totally outshined Leaf after
the two were drafted 1-2 two years ago. ``We all knew Peyton's
background and how he would handle adversity,'' said Beathard. ``We
knew if the Colts took Peyton that that part of it wasn't as clear
with Ryan. We didn't know how he would react to adversity. So far,
he hasn't handled it very well.'' . . . One of the most impressive
players at the Senior Bowl workouts was Southern Cal wide receiver
R. Jay Soward. Although many rate him well below Florida State's
Peter Warrick, Soward is quick, has good hands, and had one NFC
scout who specializes in receivers saying, ``He's special. The guy
can really run, and he has played hard in every workout.'' Although
small, Soward is listed among the top three receivers in the draft
by most teams.
</P>
<P>
   No blood, no foul
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated power struggle between 49ers general manager
Bill Walsh and Mariucci failed to materialize because Walsh saw the
handwriting on the wall and conceded some of his power over
personnel decisions to the young head coach. Had he refused,
somebody was leaving, and it might have been Walsh . . . Here's
another reason why Bob Kraft and most of his players want to see
Belichick coaching in New England in September. Titans defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams watched every Colts game to prepare a
plan for last weekend's playoff showdown between the teams. Which
film helped him the most? The Jets' 13-6 loss to Indianapolis Nov.
28. ``Bill Belichick was not afraid to challenge them,'' Williams
said. ``The big thing we felt was that 85 percent of their offense
was built around playing against zone coverages. Most people aren't
as fast as we are and are afraid to play man coverage on them.
Belichick did, and it worked. Once our guys understood that they
were zone-concept pass routes and they didn't have a lot of options
against man-to-man, it was really an easy sell.'' . . . Now here's
a first. Former Raiders assistant trainer Jonathan Jones has filed
a $250,000 lawsuit against his ex-team seeking overtime pay. Jones
claims he is owed $82,000 in overtime and vacation pay between 1996
and 1998. A court date has been set for October but look for a
settlement because one thing the NFL doesn't want to have to start
worrying about is honoring overtime statutes . . . The final
numbers are in on No. 1 draft choice Ricky Williams's first year in
the NFL, and they aren't good. At least not by the standards of
rival running back Edgerrin James. Williams received $3.6 million
of his $8.84 million signing bonus last spring and gets another
$3.6 million in May, but he earned only the minimum $175,000 salary
and reached only one of his 26 incentives. He earned an extra
$50,000 for playing in 35 percent of the Saints' games but reached
none of the excessive production numbers. He did rush for 884 yards
in just 12 games, with injuries keeping him out of the rest. It is
likely he would have reached 1,000 yards had he been healthy, but
even if he did, it would not have been enough to kick in any other
incentives. Meanwhile, in Indianapolis, James hit all three of his
incentives worth $4.75 million, in addition to earning a signing
bonus of $9.85 million that included a $350,000 reporting bonus
(what was he going to do, not report?) and a base salary of
$175,000. James hit so many of his incentives that, a year into his
contract, the Colts are looking to renegotiate.
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the players trying to impress the 650-odd NFL scouts,
personnel directors, and coaches attending the Senior Bowl, perhaps
none had higher numbers and a lower profile than running back
Travis Prentice, the NCAA's all-time leading scorer. Problem is,
Prentice scored his 78 touchdowns (73 of them rushing) while
running the ball for the wrong Miami _ Ohio instead of Florida _
and hence has gone as unnoticed as a back can while rushing for
5,596 yards. Although Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, Virginia's Thomas
Jones, and Alabama's Shaun Alexander all got more publicity, only
four backs in history have rushed for more yards than Prentice.
``I'm used to it,'' said Prentice. ``I can surprise some people who
have never heard of me. I can do a little something.'' Of all his
stats, the one Prentice is proudest of is the 154 ``trucks''
counted by the Miami coaching staff. That's how many times the
220-pounder ran over an opposing tackler . . . Two longtime
teammates probably played their last game together Saturday when
Chris Redman and Ibn Green played together in the Senior Bowl. They
have been teammates since they were in the eighth grade in
Louisville, Ky. They played youth football, high school football,
and then at the University of Louisville together . . . Patriots
director of football operations Bobby Grier was on the sidelines at
Mobile all week along with most of the team's coaching staff and
personnel assistant Dave Uryss. Grier never dropped by to say
hello. ``It's a little tense,'' one of the Patriots assistants
said. ``We're all trying to do our jobs, but we all know what went
on here. I have never been associated with a team whose players had
less accountability than in New England, and that wasn't all Pete's
doing. The way that organization is structured will never work.''

ORR SUBMITS CREATIVE IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost a quarter-century removed from his playing days, Bruins
great Bobby Orr offers this assist to today's game:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let 'em play.''
</P>
<P>
   Has a tinge of that Al Davis ``Just win, baby,'' doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The ``'em'' here is everyone. Peewees. Midgets. Juniors. NHLers.
From his view behind the blue line, Orr looked at the game as no
defenseman before had, often lugging the puck in all three zones
and attacking the net whenever the opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here in hockey's mixed-message age of passive aggression,
with teams anchored in traps, left-wing locks, and contrived speed
bumps, Orr sees a game that needs to allow its players the freedom
to skate and create plays.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK, Orr reminds, to play the puck. Somewhere, the name of
the game became goal prevention. The legend from Parry Sound has
seen too much puck parry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some players, we don't know how good they are,'' said
Orr, who hooked up in a conference call last week to push a
MasterCard/Canada promotion pegged to the development of the
Canadian Hockey League _ the country's three top Junior A programs.
``It's all defense, defense, defense. Now please understand, you
have to pay a little attention to defense, I know that. But if an
offensive player is able to create, we have to let 'em do it _ at
every level. Let 'em go. Let 'em play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at the NHL level, we don't know how good they are,
because they're not allowed to do it. After a while, they say, `The
heck with it' and just shoot it around the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players, Orr senses, are afraid to apply their skills
because they fear their coaches will bench them. If they break
form, stray from the coach's schematic, they could see their ice
time diminished, their opportunity to play disappear. That's a
problem, said Orr, but that doesn't stop him from encouraging
players and coaches to relax a little, have fun, push the puck _
and ultimately keep the fans a little closer to the front of their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not the lone soldier in this,'' said Orr, employed
these days as a player rep at Woolf &AMP; Associates. ``I think a lot
of people feel the same. But if you writers keep talking about it .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Can we have a collective sigh here? While we're at it, can you
give me an amen? Finally, someone with some real clout, the
ex-player with perhaps the greatest name recognition in the game,
has taken the bold step to hold up a mirror to today's
watered-down, logjammed, mind-numbing game. Politely, but firmly,
Orr underscored that we are not watching hockey as it was meant to
be played.
</P>
<P>
   A good number of hockey writers throughout North America, yours
truly included, have been decrying the dumbing down of the game for
going on 10 years now. But we all know change comes from within.
Writers from Back Bay to Silicon Valley can bang the drum of
reform, but Orr's spoken words carry weight far beyond any soap-box
daily dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   The game's broke, folks, and it's time to fix it. Don't believe
me? OK, fine. Then believe the guy who stepped into the league
nearly 35 years ago and virtually etched reform into the ice with
every stride of his legs. His style and dynamic play lifted hockey
to a new level, changed the way offenses were shaped and executed.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the fading out of the Oiler dynasty toward the
start of the '90s, the artistry and electricity of the game have
been negated by overzealous expansion (thinning player stock) and
coaches who believe taking risks on offense is a quick trip to a
short plank. Every coach gets fired eventually. After a while, you
wonder why at least a few don't realize that and try to accelerate
the product. Who knows? It may work. They could succeed and stay on
the job longer that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players are so afraid to make a mistake they won't try
anything,'' said Orr, whose own risk-taking led to the occasional
error but who is remembered best for his many flawless rushes.
``Hey, you're going to make mistakes. But let 'em try. The player
eventually will be more confident with the puck. Maybe it sounds
silly to say an NHL player isn't confident with the puck, but you
see some of them, they handle it like a hot potato. It's shoot it
in, shoot it out. I'd like to see them attempt to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   About those calls . . .
</P>
<P>
   It probably shouldn't come as a surprise, amid all the hooking,
grabbing, and trapping that has become de rigueur in recent
seasons, that penalty shots are significantly on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last week, with some 500 games still to be played
this season, a total of 25 penalty shots had been whistled. All
last season, there were only 27. The league record, 34, was set in
1997-98. At this rate, there will be about 45 penalty shots called
this season _ shattering the record.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all about? Bryan Lewis, the league's supervisor of
officials, isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be because many of our games now have a second
referee?'' said Lewis from his Toronto office, mulling the
possibility that an added set of eyes simply catches more
transgressions. ``I'm reluctant to say that's the case, but I don't
want to say no _ because it does stand to reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know the answer. I'd love to sit here and make
the claim, `Yeah, the officials are more aware of these calls, and
they're making them,' but I can't. Sure, they're aware, but they've
always been aware.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis, a conference call some 10 days ago, hooking
up 91 on- and off-ice officials with his office, placed no added
emphasis on calling penalty shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no concerted message delivered,'' said Lewis.
``We had everyone on that conference call except the Zamboni
drivers, and the topic was never brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience pays off
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sutter's Calgary Flames, at the Vault Monday night,
slapped an impressive 6-1 loss on the Red Wings Tuesday night,
extending a recent home success slate to an impressive 12-1-1. One
key has been the play of diminutive netminder Fred Brathwaite, once
an Oiler free agent signee, who finally has come into his own in
his seventh pro season. Unlike forwards and defensemen, goalies are
allowed a long learning curve in this league. It's a perfect
example of supply and demand. If there were a need for, say, 8-12
goalies per team, none of the 28 clubs would be waiting around for
six years or more for a prospect's talents to season . . . A recent
New York Post story suggesting that Canucks boss Brian Burke was
seeking to trade Mark Messier had Burke asking team lawyers last
week to investigate the possibility of suing the tabloid. ``I think
it was reckless and dishonest,'' said Burke, quoted in USA Today,
``to run that article without asking us whether there was any truth
to it.'' Burke is among a very small group of refreshingly
forthright GMs in the league. If front office personnel could be
counted on to tell the truth about trades _ some would deny a deal
has been made while the new guy is skating in warmups _ then the
rumor mill would be a much better, and quieter, place. Until then,
however, hearsay will rule the day . . . Word around the league is
that the Blackhawks will be among the clubs that attempt to pry
Alexei Yashin from the Senators as the March 14 trading deadline
approaches. Makes sense. Big market, lots of money, in need of an
anchor player to stabilize the franchise and restore
respectability. From a salary standpoint, it also would make sense
for the Hawks to try to move Alexei Zhamnov (at 29, he's three
years older than Yashin), but if the Senators could get interested
in such a swap, the more likely targets on their wish list would
include Tony Amonte and Eric Daze . . . Jeff Schulman, assistant
athletic director at the University of Vermont, which last Friday
folded its hockey program for the season in wake of new information
about an October hazing incident, once was a supplementary draft
pick of the Bruins. ``It was somewhat of a shock to me,'' said
Schulman, ``because I never had any intention of playing pro
hockey.'' Prior to heading to Burlington for his collegiate career,
Schulman grew up around Buffalo and played on youth teams with
former Bruin defenseman, now broadcaster, Bob Beers . . . In
Dallas, Guy Carbonneau, who turns 40 in March, keeps chugging along
as the oldest player in the NHL. ``I'm not trying to prove
anything,'' said Carbo, still among the best faceoff specialists in
the league. ``I don't intend to go after Gordie Howe's record _ I'm
not stupid. I know (retirement) is getting close. I'll know when
it's time to quit.'' When that time comes, he said, he won't tell
anyone _ the same thing Wayne Gretzky did last year and similar to
the way Ray Bourque plans his exit here in Boston . . . No doubt
Ranger GM Neil Smith has grown sick of spending (payroll now over
$60 million). But ever so quietly, Doug Gilmour has regained some
of his scoring touch (41 points in 46 games). It's the kind of
production Gretzky had with the Blueshirts last season. Gilmour
could be the guy who triggers Theo Fleury. The Rangers no doubt
would want to move Petr Nedved, which, if nothing else, would save
them a bundle of dough . . . The Avalanche would look more
formidable with some added grit behind the blue line. If the right
guy is available, the logical guy to go could be Adam Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek on the horizon
</P>
<P>
   This is not good news for the other half-dozen-or-so clubs,
including the Bruins, who are in a chase for one of the last
playoff spots in the East: Buffalo netminder Dominik Hasek pulled
on the pads early last week and fielded some shots. The Sabres are
back from a road swing this weekend and the Dominator hopes to
begin wading into more serious workouts _ his initial steps back
following a severely torn groin. Hasek is still penciled in to play
for the World Team in the All-Star Game next month _ as chosen by
the fans. If he still can't play, the logical sub would be fellow
Czech Roman Turek, so strong this season in the St. Louis net. But
Turek was on record last week as saying he won't accept a late
invitation, preferring instead to spend time with his family . . .
Don't look for ex-NHL coach Harry Neale to extol the virtues of
working behind an NHL bench. ``The only place a guy should coach is
in college,'' he said. ``You get a crop of new kids every year and
none of them has heard your spiel.'' . . . Colorado coach Bob
Hartley cut his teeth coaching in the Quebec League and saw enough
of Matthew Barnaby in juniors to understand why others might be
suspicious when Barnaby hits the ice. The trainer on Barnaby's
Junior A team, said Hartley, ``had more ice time than the
third-line guys, going out on the ice to pick him up.'' Barnaby,
now with the Penguins, was the center of attention recently when
Avalanche broadcaster John Kelly accused him of ``embellishing'' a
fall. Pittsburgh coach Herb Brooks then confronted Kelly after the
game, earning a two-game suspension . . . The All-Star Game would
be better with Chris Drury there . . . Orr, his conference call
held only hours before Michael Jordan signed on as head Wizard and
sorcerer in Washington, said he doesn't have any aspirations of
joining an ownership group . . . A nickname looking for just the
right trio: The ``Three Dogs-a-Night'' Line.

CITY'S LUCK HAS CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For the second Friday in a row, six or seven of them
had gathered with the fans on a RAM-page, thousands of them at
Union Station in St. Louis, all decked out in blue and gold,
sinking a Viking ship one week and then piercing a Buccaneer in
effigy with all kinds of objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had won that game on the road,'' said Jim Hart, one of
the six or seven, ``and if we had come home to a playoff game here,
it might have been like this. But we didn't win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   They are as much on a RAM-page as any of the bandwagon jumpers,
turning off that section of I-70 in downtown St. Louis that has
been renamed Mark McGwire Highway, and heading toward the hysteria.
The arches of Busch Stadium have been lit in blue and gold lights,
just as the skyscrapers in One Bell Center downtown spell out ``Go
Rams,'' thanks to maintenance workers with walkie-talkies who
raised and lowered shades to get the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of bittersweet,'' said Mary Hart, the wife of one of
the six or seven. ``Back when Jim played, you had to take the pulse
of the fans in Busch Stadium. But last Sunday, when the Rams were
winning like they did, I got goose bumps at the TWA Dome. I
definitely got goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The mania is manic. KFNS, the local sports talk station, has its
talkers burn sage, a fad that started back in August when
quarterback Trent Green, who was to revive this team from the
depths, was injured and lost for the season. A talk-show host
called an Indian mystic down in Oklahoma and recited the woe after
woe that had befallen the St. Louis Rams in their brief history,
convinced that if anything bad could happen, it would happen to the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The prophet suggested a tried-and-true remedy from pre-Dome
days, pre-football days. ``Burn sage,'' was the message, and
negative vibes might be transformed into positive ones. So every
Sunday, sage has been burned on the shores of the Mississippi
River, and aromatherapy never has had a better sales force than the
St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Sage is burned; the Rams never lose in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Burning sage . . . can Simon and Garfunkel be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   As usual, everyone has jumped aboard. Lenders now sells
gold-and-blue bagels, and Domino's takes $1 off its pizza for each
touchdown the Rams score. Few teams in history have scored like the
Rams, and last Sunday against the Vikings, St. Louis scored seven
TDs; on Monday, large pizzas were going for 99 cents, and even
after some 130,000 were sold by Monday night, Domino's said it
still loves its promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Jack Youngblood,'' said Jim Otis, another of the
loyalists from the past. ``I was going out for a pass on the play
and I never even saw Jack Youngblood. I wasn't even looking for
him. He was down on the ground somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 24 years ago that Jim Hart threw that pass in the Los
Angeles Coliseum to his fullback, Jim Otis, and 24 years ago that
Jack Youngblood seemingly rose from the dead and picked it off and
ran it back for a late touchdown that gave the playoff game to the
LA Rams over the St. Louis Cardinals, ``the Cardiac Cardinals'' of
coach Don Coryell, tight end Jackie Smith, quarterback Jim Hart,
fullback Jim Otis, and exciting returner Terry Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going in for the winning score,'' Hart mused. ``We
were the Cardiac Cardinals. If we had only won that game, we might
have seen something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a wonderful, strange winter here in St. Louis; such a
strange irony, too. The Rams are here, but not the old Rams, the
Rams of Jack Youngblood, Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen, Ron Jessie,
Henry Ellard, Vince Ferragamo, Roman Gabriel, and so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Such a wonderful, strange winter here in St. Louis; such a
strange irony, too. The Cardinals are not here, but the old
Cardinals are _ Dan Dierdorf, Jackie Smith, Jim Hart, Roger Wehrli,
Jim Otis, and so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Proud Cardinals all of them, but not a one ever glancing toward
Arizona where the Cardinals now fly. And all are rooting for the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The team that beat them, 35-23, back on Dec. 27, 1975, and
prevented them from ever having a home playoff game. The team that
kept the mobs from swarming over Busch Stadium to see their
Cardinals. The team that really kept St. Louis from being a true
football city.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The replacements
</P>
<P>
   Jim Otis is now a real estate developer in St. Louis, but 25
years ago he was as dependable a fullback as there was in the NFL
on third and 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have play-action passes on third and 1 those days,''
said Otis. No, just hand the ball to Otis and the chains would be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would let myself be stopped,'' he said. ``I always
thought if I didn't get the first down Woody Hayes would be coming
out onto the field and getting me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me a `former' Cardinal, not an `old' Cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Otis looks on at the mania that has swept St. Louis, he
muses, ``It would have been nice to have had a home-field advantage
like they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL Alumni chapter in St. Louis ``is very active,'' said
Otis, full of old Cardinals, of course, and not old Rams, Hart down
there across the Mississippi at Southern Illinois University in
Carbondale, Smith working as spokesman at the Casino Queen
riverboat docked just across the Gateway Arch on the Illinois side
of the Mississippi, and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be a while there, `Cardinals who?' but we're all
proud Cardinals,'' said Otis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals left St. Louis 13 years ago and none of these
Cardinals can say the name ``Bidwill'' without almost an audible
sneer in their voice. Smith, of course, refused to go out to
Arizona to be honored and one and all say that Bill Bidwill, the
Cardinals' owner, did little when he was in St. Louis and has done
nothing about keeping alive the Cardinal tradition since moving to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1,500 miles out to Arizona and maybe ``there was little
effort on the part'' of the ``former'' Cardinals, said Otis, ``but
there was none on their part. It's almost as if we didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years after the Cardinals left and before the Rams
moved here in 1995, Otis was part of a group trying to get an NFL
team back in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an expansion team, and not having another
team relocate to here,'' said Otis. ``And when (NFL commissioner)
Paul Tagliabue stood up to announce the expansion city, and he said
`Jacksonville' and not `St. Louis,' it was crushing.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be a huge irony in the Super Bowl if the Rams and
Jaguars meet, since the team now in Jacksonville was inches away
from being located in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rams arrived, Otis was excited about having football
back in St. Louis. But when the Rams went year after year without
winning, he was one of many who found his ardor cooling. And then
Otis repeated the joke that virtually every one in St. Louis cites,
almost word for word, ``about the Ram fan so disgusted with the
team that he left four tickets to a Rams game on his windshield and
when he came back to his car, there were eight tickets there.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis remembers every detail of the play out in Los Angeles when
Youngblood got up off the ground and intercepted Hart's pass and
ran it back for a TD, sealing the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to come back home,'' he said, ``and
have a home playoff game.'' Which St. Louis never had until last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But time passes, ``and there are kids out there now who've known
nothing except the Rams,'' said Otis. ``Their moms and dads, and
their grandparents remember the Cardinals, but all those kids know
is the Rams. And these kids will follow the St. Louis Rams all
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Jim Otis, the former Cardinal, now follows the Rams.
Ardently.
</P>
<P>
   Eating it up
</P>
<P>
   A large group was eating prime rib Thursday night and, almost as
spontaneous as breathing, story after story of Rams mania was
coming from their mouths. Karen Kunsemiller told of how casual
dress day at the St. Clair County Health Department was remarkable
``because everybody showed up in blue and gold.''
</P>
<P>
   And Julie Scheibel told of lunch hour Monday at Ameritech
Cellular in St. Louis when seven of the workers were able to get
through to Domino's and get their 99-cent pizzas while her husband,
Jim, a graphics design artist at the May Department Store in St.
Louis said he and his group had tried ``but we never could get
through . . . all the lines were busy all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Scheibel, for his part, was part of Rams mania when his
father-in-law put in a rush request for a particular graphic design
_ in blue and gold, of course _ last Saturday night at midnight
after a birthday party for his 3-year-old son. The father-in-law
was upset over his perception that Fox commentator John Madden was
looking down upon the Rams before the Vikings game. The sign, which
was not completed until 2 a.m. Sunday, read, ``John Madden.
Long-term parking rates available'' and the father-in-law circled
the TWA Dome Sunday morning looking to put the sign on Madden's bus
which, of course, would be parked in St. Louis for another week.
</P>
<P>
   Over in O'Fallon, Ill., just across the river, Virginia Duggan
was working just before 5 p.m. when her husband came by to pick her
up and he noticed the Domino's closing up shop at the strange hour
and a worker putting up a hand-written sign in the window:
``Closed. Temporarily out of dough.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of the ultimate question in St. Louis _ whether any of this
mania can equal Mark McGwire mania, and whether the Rams' success
can ever challenge the popularity of the baseball Cardinals,
opinions, surprisingly, were divided.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kunsemiller, an Air Force officer retired from nearby Scott
AFB, said, ``It beats McGwire. Mark McGwire has great ability, but
he lives in California. With the Rams, it seems like they're real
people.'' His wife, Karen, noted recent radio polls showing more
than half of St. Louis fans favored the Rams over the Cardinals but
added, sagely, ``It's just because of the recency. The Rams are
playing now and the Cardinals haven't played in months.''
</P>
<P>
   Duggan voted for the Rams, if only because ``all of this was so
unexpected,'' while her daughter, Julie, said, ``I think it beats
McGwire. Everybody is so excited about the Rams, plus you knew no
matter how much Mark McGwire did, the Cardinals were still going to
lose. The Rams are a team; McGwire is an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Kunsemiller concluded, ``I think Mark McGwire would like to
be playing for the Rams. Unlike the Cardinals, they win.''
</P>
<P>
   If only . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hart can remember the numbers of all the plays he used to
call for the Cardinals, and he can recite play after play of that
exciting 1974 season when the ``Cardiac Cardinals'' kept pulling
out game after game in the waning seconds. Coryell's offense was
innovative, Metcalf was flashy, Otis was strong, Smith could not be
stopped, and Hart was a most underrated quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And what he still vividly remembers is when the Cardinals
clinched the NFC East title ``and we flew back to Lambert (Field)
and there were thousands of fans waiting for us at the airport.
There were so many people there we couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, ever battling with the dominant Dallas Cowboys,
seemed on the verge of becoming both an NFL power and a true NFL
city. ``Then we went out to Los Angeles for the playoff game,''
said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Hart remembered every detail of the play. It called for Otis,
his fullback, to run to a seam and catch a short pass ``and we were
the Cardiac Cardinals that year and we thought we were on the way
to winning the game,'' he said. Offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf,
Hart recalled, had leveled Youngblood with a block ``and there was
Youngblood on the ground.'' Hart, much as Otis, considered
Youngblood out of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he got up,'' Hart recalled, ``reached up and deflected the
pass straight up in the air. And then he caught it and ran it back
for a TD. If only we could have come home for a playoff game. if
only we could have had the home-field advantage. I think you could
have seen what you see now. If we'd had the home game, we'd have
had the same fever.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, 24 years later, it is the Rams who have captivated St.
Louis and Hart, the former Cardinal, is an avid booster. He, like
Otis, has nothing good to say of the Cardinals of Arizona ``and I'm
sure if you asked every one of us, they'd all feel the same way as
I do and Jim does,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   But of the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 100 percent behind the Rams,'' said the former QB. ``All
of St. Louis is.''

JORDAN FACES TOUGH JOB WITH WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan may be a Wizard now, but don't get too
enthusiastic over the post-millennial transition, because ``Oz'' is
a prison these days.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Wizards' financial structure.
</P>
<P>
   MJ's new team must serve three more years (not including this
one) on the sentence otherwise recognized as the contract of
forward Juwan Howard. And those symbols you see aren't championship
rings - they're zeroes in the contracts of Mitch Richmond and Rod
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Strickland did put up some thick numbers on the court
Friday, no doubt inspired by Jordan's threat to wear sneakers at
the next Wizards practice.
</P>
<P>
   Motivating the rich employees also will be the chore for the man
involved in Jordan's first crucial move - coach.
</P>
<P>
   See, unless a rival NBA GM or two goes completely insane, the
Wizards' cast may not change much. And mercenaries without
contracts will not work for chump change, regardless of who wields
the personnel hammer.
</P>
<P>
   At least two looming free agents - Clippers Maurice Taylor and
Derek Anderson - don't believe money talks ... they believe it
hollers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, one of six NBA players hand-picked by MJ to wear his
``Jump Man'' gear, was asked if Jordan's new role reinvents the
Wizards as a more desirable free-agent destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Anderson said. ``Not in this day and age. I
don't think players will take money out of their pockets just
because he's the GM.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, when posed with the hypothetical, pie-in-the-sky
notion of Jordan and the Wizards achieving maximum cap room, said
Team MJ might work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no doubt about that,'' said Taylor, who - as a client of
Jordan pal David Falk - still feels worthy of premium loot.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked about becoming a Wizard if CEO Jordan is
unable to clear enough cap space to present a maximum offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help him,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   There is wonderful irony to those toni Kukoc-for-Glen Rice trade
rumors. As the teammate-alienating, pet project of Bulls GM Jerry
Krause, Kukoc became the whipping boy for ex-Bulls coach Phil
Jackson, who was CEO of the Krause is a Louse Foundation. But as
farfetched as breaking up this season's best NBA team would seem to
be, the Lakers probably would accommodate Jackson and make the
deal. The monkey wrench is Krause, who figures to be a bit
reluctant to assist Jackson, and also requires another team willing
to give him something tasty in exchange for the expensive Rice, an
aging Falk client. The Lakers know re-signing the free-agent-to-be
Kukoc - who's a versatile and triangle-friendly 6-11 -- would be a
much easier proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ... If the league held the 2000 draft today, who would be the
No. 1 pick? The answer baffles many NBA talent hounds, who love the
skills of Maryland's Terence Morris. But Morris' ability to
disappear when the Terps need him to be assertive has dropped the
6-9 junior out of the top 10 on the lists of at least two highly
regarded scouts. ... Texas center Chris Mihm is a threat to be
chosen just minutes after the draft begins, but the 7-0 junior is
threatening to stay in school. ... DePaul swingman Quentin
Richardson a 6-5 sophomore, reportedly has decided to go pro, but
scouts are underwhelmed by his defensive limitations on the
perimeter and inability to create off the dribble. But Richardson
still won't be on the board beyond the first few picks.
</P>
<P>
   Rising like mad are 6-8 Cincinnati senior Kenyon Martin and
Loren Woods, Arizona's 7-1 junior. ... Who has the most NBA
potential among college point guards? Don't say Michigan State's
Mateen Cleaves. Several watchdogs like sophomore Erick Barkley of
St. John's, but one evaluator picks Kenny Satterfield a gifted
freshman who has yet to crack the starting lineup at top-ranked
Cincinnati. Maybe the best PG you haven't heard of is 5-10 Hofstra
senior Craig ``Speedy'' Claxton. ... Missouri sophomore Keyon
Dooling, a lightning-quick 6-3 combo guard, has rated raves from
scouts who ignore his shoot-to-kill approach on offense. ... The
nastiest two-guard prospect is 6-5 Fresno State senior Courtney
Alexander a notorious ballhog whose citizenship history may drop
him far lower on the draft list than his talent level would
mandate. ... Alabama high school hotshot Gerald Wallace (6-7)
reportedly will leap into the draft IF he's convinced some team
will select him with one of the first eight picks. If the NBA were
a decathlon, he'd be a cinch.
</P>
<P>
   ... Remember former Knicks scoring mercenary Bernard King? Well,
there's a new Bernard King (not related to the old one), and he's
creating quite a buzz as a freshman two-guard at Texas A&AMP;M. ... A
potential first-rounder is small forward DeeAndre Hulett, who plays
for the IBL's Las Vegas Silver Bandits after spending a season
tearing up the juco ranks at College of the Sequoias.
</P>
<P>
   ... Clipper Derek Anderson may be close to an agent change,
which would require firing No Limit Sports, operated by rap star
Percy ``Master P'' Miller. But DA will be stuck with a tattoo on
his right deltoid that reads: ``No Limit Prosecuter.'' It's a shame
tattoo needles don't come with a spell-check function.

GOOD NOT ENOUGH FOR PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The Philadelphia 76ers are playoff-bound. They
have the league's leading scorer and interior strength, and they
play excellent defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the team was considering a couple of significant trades
while in Charlotte earlier this week, which says a lot about the
club and the people who run it.
</P>
<P>
   They know that what they do have is not enough. What the Sixers
have now, they realize, is a team that would be lucky to make it
out of the first round. That, clearly, won't do.
</P>
<P>
   You look at their roster and they have Eric Snow starting at
point guard. In a perfect hoop world, he'd be a backup. George
Lynch? He'd be an eighth or ninth man, but he starts for the
Sixers. Matt Geiger? The Sixers' answer to Vitaly Potapenko. Tyrone
Hill? Nice player, but do you win with him?
</P>
<P>
   That's what led Philly to seriously consider dealing Geiger and
Larry Hughes to the Cavaliers for Shawn Kemp. They would have
received an All-Star, albeit one who has struggled this season.
</P>
<P>
   What killed the deal was Kemp's contract. He is due to be paid
$45 million in the last two years, and, by that time, a luxury tax
could well be in effect and the Sixers would be hard hit. But from
a basketball standpoint, the Sixers looked at getting an All-Star
down low who also rebounds and would be a terrific complement to
Allen Iverson. But money shot that down. The problem is, when
you're coaching, even if you make money for the team but still
lose, you lose your job.
</P>
<P>
   The second deal discussed would have brought Jamal Mashburn to
Philly for Hughes, Billy Owens, and two of Rick Pitino's all-time
favorites, Nazr Mohammad and Bruce Bowen. This would have upgraded
the Sixers' front line as well, although Mashburn isn't the inside
killer that Kemp is. But he would provide some scoring at small
forward and give the team another go-to guy. Now, they basically
have one. But they're trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never be complacent in this job,'' said general
manager Billy King. ``Your job is to try and make the team
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this would be necessary had the team not
blown two straight drafts. The first was 1997. The Sixers had the
second pick, took Keith Van Horn, and then traded him to New Jersey
for, essentially, Tim Thomas. The following year, they took Hughes
over Paul Pierce. Imagine the Sixers with Pierce and Van Horn
instead of Hill and Hughes, and you're on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, this team finished behind the Celtics. Last year,
it finished sixth in the East with Larry Brown's masterful coaching
and got to the second round. This year? It feels now it will be
lucky to get the fourth spot. The Sixers may be well over .500 but
clearly are not satisfied with what they have.
</P>
<P>
   Are other teams trying to do the same thing? Sure. This is one
that got out, and the Sixers aren't happy about that. But it also
says that they aren't afraid to move even when the going is
relatively good. To many, the position they enjoy is a goal. To the
Sixers, it's unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Misunderstood
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been told to leave a movie theater yet. He hasn't been
dissed at the mall. Juwan Howard says his life off the basketball
court hasn't changed and that people actually smile at him and
enjoy his company. They should. He's been through enough already in
his life. But once he puts on a Wizards uniform, he turns into
Antoine Walker South. Those fans who are bothering to show up for
Wizards games have made the highly-paid Howard their undisputed
target. He hears it all the time and none of it is flattering. He
says he understands what's going on, even if the people don't. ``I
don't think people understand what goes on internally,'' he said.
``I'm not the go-to guy on this team. I stepped back and had to
sacrifice a lot. I'm playing a different role this year and playing
at a position (small forward) where I really don't play my best. I
feel I'd give them a better performance if I was at my natural
position (power forward). But we have a lot of those and only one
other (small forward). It's things like that people don't
understand and it makes it tough.'' Howard's minutes are down
dramatically. His shot attempts are down. His stats are down. But
his salary has gone up and that's why people abuse him as they do.
``If I was still on my rookie contract, it'd go unnoticed,'' he
said. ``The finger is being pointed at me, but this is a team game.
The expectation level is high and I understand that. But you don't
expect people to be cruel. It just goes with the territory,
especially when you are paid at this level.'' Howard's agent, David
Falk, has watched his client try to fight through all the
negativity and said, ``If there's one person who can do it, it's
Juwan. He's strong.'' Howard's story is well documented: He was
raised on the mean streets of Chicago by his maternal grandmother.
Howard has her name on a tattoo over his heart; she died just after
he committed to Michigan. He became the first NBA player to leave
school early and still manage to graduate on time, thanks to
correspondence courses. He is as frustrated by the Wizards' play as
any of the fans, even more so. ``I want to win, just like they
do,'' he said. ``I don't want to run away from this. I made a
commitment to this team and to this city. I want to return here and
see my jersey number hanging from the rafters. I feel our day is
coming.'' In the meantime, he will muddle through what easily has
been the worst experience of his NBA career. ``I've been through so
much in my life,'' he said. ``I've experienced so much adversity. I
just look at this as another test of strength for me. God is
testing me again. I've got to keep a strong, level head and think
that He has something special in mind for me and my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny will turn up
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns are coming East this week and Penny Hardaway is
coming with them. Remember him? Hardaway has been sidelined since
Dec. 5 with a foot problem and has been doing some light running
and shooting. No one is offering specifics on precisely when he
will return to the lineup. Hardaway, however, said he would be
ready for the Suns' visit to Orlando a week from Monday. &UR;  &LR; (Just
think of the reception the Hooterville faithful will give him.) And
you can imagine he'll want to have a game or two under his belt
before then. The Celtics host the Suns this Friday, the third game
on Phoenix's Eastern swing. The Suns are bringing small forward
Shawn Marion along. He's coming off knee surgery and could see some
action . . . Kevin McHale is coming back full circle in the Retired
Number Dept. He's already had his Celtics number retired as well as
the one he wore at the University of Minnesota. This weekend, the
fine folks in Hibbing, Minn., honored him in a big time ceremony,
which featured video clips, a reunion of McHale's last Hibbing High
team (1975-76), and the official retirement of his No. 33. The
jersey will be displayed in a trophy case at the junior high
school, however. True McHale-o-philes know he played his high
school games in that gym because the regular high school did not
have a gym big enough to accommodate the necessary bleachers. (But
it has just about everything else anyone could want.) McHale's
coaches from his Hibbing days were on hand and at least one
representative from his glory days in Boston was scheduled to
attend: Former coach K.C. Jones. The Timberwolves sent some
representatives, including Crunch, the mascot. McHale also was
given a key to the city by Hibbing Mayor Pru Lolich . . . The
Houston Rockets put together a modest five-game winning streak and
it has coincided with, though not hinged on, the return of Hakeem
Olajuwon. ``There's not a team in the Western Conference, or in the
East, that we haven't had down in the fourth quarter,'' said Steve
Francis. ``You can ask all the coaches of the teams we faced and
they'll say, `The Houston Rockets played us tough.' '' Prior to
Olajuwon's return, the team waived Thomas Hamilton, becoming the
latest club, including the Celtics, to shake its collective head in
frustration. ``Thomas and Rudy (Tomjanovich) had a disagreement,''
said Rockets basketball boss Carroll Dawson. ``Frankly, he made
himself a little bit of an irritation.'' Well, maybe more than a
little bit. Hamilton was upset about playing time and, according to
Dawson, challenged Tomjanovich to do something about it. Rudy T
obliged by sending him to Dawson's office. ``I waived him and I
think he was shocked,'' Dawson said. ``The guy has talent. He's not
a bad kid. But he has to learn what professional life is about.
Maybe one of these days he will grow up and drop 50 pounds. Then
everyone will be after him.'' Hamilton's weight is still a major
issue. He was around 400 when the Rockets got him and had slimmed
down to about 340. When the Celtics stopped in Houston the week
before Christmas, Tomjanovich said he was ready to give Hamilton
every opportunity. The Big Ham got more time in Houston than
anywhere else and still wore out his welcome. ``We thought we were
bringing him along the right way,'' Dawson said. ``A lot of things
go into being a professional. He has to learn the right way. He
would have had a career here.'' . . . So, Chris Wallace, are you
going to get a little extra tingle when you take that first call
from Wizards boss Michael Jordan? ``It won't be as big for me, a
guy from West Virginia, as getting that first call from Jerry
West,'' Wallace said. ``From my neck of the woods, it doesn't get
any bigger than that.'' . . . Guess who collected MVP honors at
last week's CBA All-Star Game? Dontae Jones, that's who. He had 34
points (on 13-of-18 shooting) and connected on a record five
3-pointers as he led the Eastern All-Stars to a 135-124 victory.
Yet, you can be sure Jones was fuming when teammate Mark Davis got
this week's callup from the NBA. Idaho's Roberto Bergersen was MVP
of the Rookie All-Star Game. He was given a trophy named after
former Charlotte swingman Bobby Phills, who played 34 games for the
Sioux Falls Skyforce in 1991-92.

   (FR) Comments: Stoneman recently caught some heat for
proclaiming that the Angels, even without making any more roster
changes, will contend this season. That belief is predicated on the
hope that with Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon, Jim Edmonds, and Gary
DiSarcina healthy, the Angels will not finish next-to-last in runs
again. Scioscia will try to purge the clubhouse of the
finger-pointing and blame-shifting that had the rats running amok
in the Mouse Kingdom.

   (FR) Comments: The Angels let ace Finley walk away to Cleveland
as a free agent, as club president Tony Tavares took a hard line,
saying the Angels were awful with Finley, so why throw more
millions at a guy who will be 40 in three years? But until Stoneman
deals an outfielder (Edmonds) for pitching help, the rotation is
woefully short. Jason Dickson is back after missing all of last
season with shoulder surgery, as is Ken Hill, who also was damaged
goods last season. But Tim Belcher, who was a huge bust last
season, isn't expected to be available until mid-April at the
earliest, which leaves the Angels placing a huge burden on kids
like lefty Jarod Washburn and righties Ramon Ortiz and Brian
Cooper.

Art Howe is planning to go with a platoon of Rich Becker and Ryan

Olivares, the A's have four starters (Appier, Olivares, Tim Hudson,
and Gil Heredia) who won at least 11 games last season. Red Sox
castoff Ron Mahay, who pitched well in September, will challenge
1998 top draft pick Mulder for the fifth spot. Injury-ridden Ariel
Prieto has pitched well this winter in Puerto Rico and could also
be a factor, and there are more kids (Barry Zito, Brett Laxton, and
Vasquez) in the pipeline.

   (FR) Comments: How long Gillick will allow L'Affaire Griffey to
be a distraction in Arizona is the biggest question coming into
camp. As loaded as the Mariners would be if they keep Junior,
Gillick can't afford to take the chance that he'll walk after the
season. The guess here is come Opening Day, Reds GM Jim Bowden will
have Griffey in Cincinnati _ without parting with infielder Pokey
Reese, the player Gillick demanded in return this winter. Olerud
will help ease that loss, while Javier and McLemore give needed
depth to the outfield. Carlos Guillen, the highly touted prospect
from Houston who came in the Randy Johnson deal, takes over at
third after missing most of last season with injury.

disappeared when owner Peter Angelos decided he was a health risk,
will give a big boost to a rotation that has the chance to be very
good, with lefty Jamie Moyer and impressive kids Freddy Garcia and

   (FR) Comments: Only the Indians scored more runs than the
Rangers did last season. Only the Mariners hit more home runs.
Still, the Rangers were cashiered from the postseason, swept for
the second straight year by the Yankees. So GM Doug Melvin pulled a
blockbuster, sending slugging two-time MVP Gonzalez to the Tigers,
an open invitation to rookie Mateo to live up to the raves he has
drawn in the minor leagues. Kapler, who comes from Detroit in the
Gonzalez deal, figures to take over right field from Igor, who last
week was quoted in the Dominican papers as saying that he wants a
$100 million deal, which is another reason Melvin launched a
preemptive strike. With Zeile bolting for the Mets, rookie Lamb
should have first crack at the third-base job.

<P>
   (FR) Comments: It's hard not to interpret Melvin's loading up on
lefties _ Oliver, Thompson, and Rogers to join righties Rick
Helling and Estaban Loiaza _ as an attempt to beat the
lefty-leaning Yankees come the fall. The rotation needed a major
makeover, though losing Sele, who won 37 games in the last two
seasons, was a blow. There are lefty kids on the way, too _ Matt
Perisho, Davis, and Lee. Independent league alum Jeff Zimmerman was
a revelation as a setup man, though his ERA was 5.79 over his last
22 appearances and he was less than a mystery to lefthanded hitters
in that span. Rafael Palmeiro opted to skip surgery and rehab his
ailing knees.

a 95-win season. Thompson is a bit of a risk, coming off August
shoulder surgery, but if Rogers pitches the way he did in his first
go-round with Texas, the Rangers should be in the thick of it
again.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Two myths have floated above the NFL this season;
namely, that the top American Football Conference teams are
stronger than the top National Football Conference teams and that
parity has made the NFL into a dull, boring game.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams have poked holes into both myths.
</P>
<P>
   The final answer to whether the AFC is stronger than the NFC
won't be answered defintively for another week, of course, but the
Rams have all the signs of all good teams who have ever played
football in January; they are peaking at the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are overwhelming favorites (14 1/2 points) to beat
Tampa Bay Sunday afternoon in the NFC Championship game at the
Trans World Dome. The Rams have won all nine games they've played
at home this season and won them by huge margins, outscoring their
opponents by an average of 37-14.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the other myth _ that parity is poor football _ that
the Rams have shredded to smithereens. None of the good teams of
the 1990s _ not Dallas, nor Green Bay, nor Denver _ possessed an
offense as dazzling and aggressive as St. Louis's. The Rams, to a
football lover, are a joy to behold.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the Rams have not been seen by much of
football America until they piled up 49 points against Minnesota in
a playoff game last week; in this case, ignorance certainly was not
bliss. Some veteran football minds are going so far as saying the
St. Louis offense is one of the best they've ever seen. There is no
need to yearn for the Cowboys, Packers, or Broncos of yore when the
Rams are here to savor.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Rams will be facing what is statistically the
NFL's best defense Sunday. Ordinarily, when the league's top
offense meets the league's top defense in a title game, blood races
and cliches flow. ``Defense wins playoff games,'' is pro football's
oldest axiom, but Tampa Bay's strong defense may be trumped by the
truest of football's axioms: that an unbalanced team can go only so
far in January.
</P>
<P>
   A team that is unbalanced on offense is eventually exposed. But
teams that are vastly unbalanced between offense and defense have
the highest hurdle to clear. The Bucs have only a shadow of an
offense to go with their strong defense and, on that offense, there
is only one player to fear: running back Warrick Dunn. The Rams'
underrated defense will be sure to concentrate on Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay absolutely cannot get into the bind that has befallen
all teams who've visited the TWA Dome this season: falling behind
early and falling behind by several TDs. That's because the Bucs
have a rookie quarterback, Shaun King, leading an offense more
geared to eating up time off the clock by running the ball than
scoring points. Scoring points does not come easily for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect Shaun to come in and tear up the league,''
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said of his QB, who has started only six
games in his pro career, ``but he's held his own. As long as we
play well around him, we know he will play well.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Rams are unknown to much of America, the St.
Louis defense is known even less. But the Rams confused the Vikings
last week with several unusual blitz packages that harassed Vikings
QB Jeff George, and King, the rookie, is sure to be seeing some of
these in obvious passing situations. Eight days ago against
Washington, King became only the second rookie QB to win a playoff
game since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a quarterback who can play well under pressure
all the game,'' said St. Louis defensive end Kevin Carter, the
NFL's sack leader this season. ``There was one (John Elway) and he
retired this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-charging and ever-talking Tampa Bay defensive lineman
and NFL defensive player of the year, Warren Sapp, is the true
symbol of this Bucs team. But Rams left guard Tom Nutten, who is
sure to be seeing much of Sapp Sunday afternoon, virtually scoffs
at the attention paid to Sapp. Nutten, and the entire underrated
Rams offensive line, reduced John Randle _ the Vikings' version of
Sapp _ to a nonfactor last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week it was John Randle,'' said Nutten. ``I've heard
Junior Bryant and Bryant Young. Sean Gilbert. The Goose (Tony
Siragusa) in Baltimore. So it's been every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rams QB Kurt Warner goes back to pass week after week,
virtually untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, when asked about Warner going untouched, countered, ``The
only one I've ever known to be untouchable was Eliot Ness, and he's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they drop back and throw as many times as I think, I'll
have a lot of chances to get up close and personal with Kurt
Warner.''

INTERNATIONAL WILL BE TWICE AS NICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has always had a big story to offer, but for a variety of
reasons the profile was kept small. For years, The International
was one of the unheard-of gems in New England golfing circles, a
private club tucked away in the gentleness of Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   He has built some of the country's greatest golf courses, but
for a variety of reasons, Massachusetts was not a destination. So
for years, Tom Fazio created his magic elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We are, however, living in a world that changes rapidly, and the
landscape of golf is one example. What was yesterday's dream is
today's reality, which is one way to explain how it is that Fazio
is in the midst of his first golf course in Massachusetts and The
International is about to share its character and charm with more
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick my projects by its clients,'' said Fazio, whose only
other work in Massachusetts was Wollaston Golf Club in Milton, back
in the 1960s when he worked on his uncle George Fazio's crew. It's
been a long time since then, and his list of credits is impressive:
Shadow Creek in Nevada; World Woods, Black Diamond, and Pablo Creek
in Florida; Wade Hampton in North Carolina; Estancia in Arizona;
Wild Dunes in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily the land. The clients have to agree to do
what we need to do. The International is a good project with really
good potential. I was really impressed with the commitment they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' being Brian Lynch and Dan Weadock _ both unyielding in
their passion for The International _ who just one year ago
realized a dream when they bought the facility. No one believed
they would actually ever own it, so you can understand how they
were not scared off by those who told them they would never get
Fazio to build them another 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were persuasive,'' said Fazio, and the three of them have
spent countless hours scribbling notes, drawing holes on the backs
of napkins, exchanging philosophies, and walking through mud and
brush. The new course is taking shape, thanks to a very mild fall
and early winter, and you can see Fazio's vision on the hills
overlooking Mount Wachusett and Mount Monadnock and in the valleys
that punctuate this stunning terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the changes in elevation,'' said Fazio. ``There are
ridges and great hillsides that give the opportunity to create
changes. You can feel the drama there. Our goal is to create a
distinct golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Fazio design opens for play in 2001, it will make The
International the only 36-hole private golf course facility in New
England, which is another step toward the vision that Lynch has had
for years. You could say this vision _ ``to have a 36-hole facility
that had the ability to mix business and pleasure, to handle
conference activities yet meet members' weekend social events'' _
has consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   That is understandable, because, save for a few weeks in a
factory when Lynch was younger, The International has been his only
place of work since that day in 1970 when he signed up to caddie.
He carried clubs, found golf balls, offered suggestions, and got to
know the members. Then he went to work with legendary head pro Bill
Ezinicki. All the while, his love of the place became more intense,
and after graduating from Assumption, Lynch stayed on at The
International, eventually getting promoted to general manager in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Few courses are enveloped in mystique quite like The
International, which was designed by Geoffrey Cornish in 1957 and
redesigned by the legendary Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1972. There
is the matter of big numbers (at 8,325 yards from what they call
the Tiger Tees, it is the longest course in the world), including a
fifth hole that can play to a par 6 of 715 yards. You don't mention
The International without discussing that green at No. 5, for it is
27,500 square feet, perhaps the only putting surface where you
would gladly take a three-putt. (To put that in perspective, many
of the greens at The Country Club are barely 4,000 square feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Size aside, The International was also known as a piece of ITT's
expansive holdings. The business giant bought the course from
original owner Burt Suprenant in 1961 and for the next 37 years, it
was almost exclusively used as a corporate playground, first by
ITT, then by Starwood, which bought ITT in 1998. There were
members, of course, but corporate outings and charitable
tournaments took up most of the playing schedule for years, with
few chances for even the Massachusetts Golf Association or New
England PGA to run events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were corporate,'' said Lynch. ``That's what we did. It's
what we will still do, but we'd like to become a little more of a
players club.'' New members are being accepted, he said, and there
is a desire to be more involved in statewide tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's vision for The International was hard to promote when he
was general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then along came my white knight,'' he said, referring to
Weadock. A 38-year employee of ITT, whose position at retirement
was president and CEO of Sheraton Hotels, Weadock shared Lynch's
love of The International, where he had golfed for years. When the
place went up for sale late in 1998, they asked themselves: ``We
love it, why not buy it?'' A year after signing the papers, they
still go to work with a bounce in their steps.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 53-room guest lodge, a state-of-the-art conference
facility, more bells and whistles to spoil businessmen than one
could imagine, and dining room/locker room facilities that are
unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can entertain a corporate outing,'' said Lynch, ``and the
members still have their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, each day brings them closer to the new course.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fazio next to a Robert Trent Jones,'' said Lynch. ``I
couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams, he said, do come true.
</P>
<P>
   Odd coupling
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin's debut as a card-carrying member of the PGA Tour
had an ironic twist this week at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. One
of his amateur partners was Richard Ferris, a member of the PGA
Tour Policy Board who testified against Martin in his court battle
for the use of a golf cart. At least, we think it was irony, though
someone in the tournament offices may indeed have a warped sense of
humor. Anyway, Martin understood the significance of the pairing.
``I think he's a nice guy,'' Martin said. ``We'll be friends out
there. I just won't read his putts for him.'' . . . Asked about the
presence of Martin at the tournament, another member of the policy
board, Davis Love, raised eyebrows when he said: ``It's probably
better that I don't comment on that subject.'' . . . There is
growing support for Martin, however, as Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson,
and Paul Azinger _ among others _ all have changed their opinion.
``I sincerely wish him well,'' said Watson, like Martin a Stanford
alum. There is also an advocate on the policy board in veteran Tour
player John Cook, who says: ``I like having him out here. If Casey
clips me by a shot, I'm going to shake his hand and congratulate
him. You won't hear me whining about him having a cart.'' . . . On
the Nike Tour, Martin never had to deal with hospitality tents in
close proximity to the greens. In his second-round 71, Martin
rifled an approach shot over one of the tents at the Bermuda
Dunes's 18th hole . . . New year, same old erratic game for John
Daly. At the Hope, he opened the 2000 campaign in a fashion that
underscored his roller-coaster life:
bogey-birdie-bogey-bogey-birdie, en route to a 72, which at this
event might as well be a 92. Through 36 holes, Daly was 7 over on
the par 4's, incredible considering that birdies come with the
blink of an eye in this tournament. How easy is it to score at this
five-round desert party? ``You've got to shoot like 88 under,''
said Glen Day after opening with a 65. ``I'm only 6 under, so I've
got a long way to go.'' . . . Need more proof that the desert is
hot 'n' easy? Rich Breem, the surprise winner of last year's Kemper
Open, was 21 over between four rounds of the Mercedes and two
rounds of the Sony Open; through 36 holes of the Hope, he was 13
under . . . As red as the scoreboards get at the Hope, there was
one player whose score actually ballooned. David Duval, who closed
with that dramatic 59 at PGA West a year ago, could manage just a
68 when he toured that layout Wednesday. ``I don't remember it
being this hard,'' said Duval, his wit making a rare appearance.
What apparently isn't hard for Duval is the 18th hole at PGA West.
Last year, Duval made eagle there to clinch his 59; Wednesday, he
made eagle again, and the first person to offer congratulations was
playing partner Roger Clemens . . . Friday, by the way, was Jack
Nicklaus's 60th birthday . . . Remember the woman who stripped to
her bra and underwear and raced to embrace Tiger Woods on
Carnoustie's 18th green during last summer's British Open? She
recently appeared before a judge in Arbroath, Scotland, and was
fined $400, though she left open the possibility of another
appearance at St. Andrews this summer. ``I'm going to have to
surprise you,'' said Yvonne Robb, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the Beach
</P>
<P>
   The deadline came and went Friday night without Woods entering
next week's Phoenix Open, all but assuring that he will next tee it
up at the Pebble Beach AT&AMP;T National Pro-Am Feb. 3-6. He will be in
search of his sixth straight win on Tour, and it is good news for
golf fans. Even better is word that Bill Murray will not be playing
at the AT&AMP;T. His very tired act is on display at this week's Hope
event, but it has been reported that a hectic work schedule will
keep Murray from tossing spectators into the bunkers at Pebble
Beach. Now, if only Kevin Costner would hang 'em up . . . Andy
North, the two-time US Open champion who has worked in recent years
as a golf analyst for ESPN, has accepted a sponsor's exemption into
the FleetBoston Classic at Nashawtuc CC in Concord Aug. 25-27.
North will turn 50 March 9 and surely will play frequently on the
Senior PGA Tour . . . Roberta Balduc of Longmeadow CC and Dorothy
Forbes of The Country Club have been reelected to the 23-member
USGA Women's Committee. Jeanne-Marie Boylan of Boston, who has been
nominated to serve on the USGA Executive Committee, resigned from
the women's committee . . . Golfers, even the most diehard ones,
must wave the white flag to winter and the ski crowd _ at least for
now. But there are always the indoor hitting facilities, of which
there quite a few. One of the newest ones is The Golf School at the
Radisson Hotel Boston, 200 Stuart St. For information, call
617-482-1800. The New England PGA (508-869-0000) can provide a list
of indoor facilities . . . It may not be right around the corner (a
couple of blocks away would be more accurate), but the 2001 US
Senior Open at Salem CC in Peabody is keeping the committee busy.
Volunteers are needed, and if you are interested, call
978-927-4350. Tickets go on sale in April.

   MELBOURNE _ If the TV was on at Rick's Cafe Americain in
Casablanca Saturday, the patrons were a little restless. Not that
the prefect of police, Claude Raines, was rounding up the usual
suspects or Sam was playing the piano off-key and too loud. Paul
Henreid and Ingrid Bergman weren't scrounging for exit visas, and
Bogart wasn't holding off the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that. But the local boy, Karim Alami, wasn't making
good anymore at the Australian Open. Though his thrashing by a
German was happening thousands of miles away, and it was only on a
screen, his fellow Moroccans felt for him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by fourth-seeded Nick Kiefer,
the guys from Morocco _ Alami, Hicham Arazi, and Younis El Ayanoui
_ are having more fun on the road than Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in
``The Road to Morocco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never saw that one,'' Alami said. ``Before my time. Was it
funny?'' Not as funny as the look on his face when he blasted a
125-m.p.h. serve, and it flew back even faster for a winner off
Kiefer's racket.
</P>
<P>
   But has the man from Casablanca ever seen ``Casablanca''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``Everybody said I should, so I rented
it. Fell asleep halfway through. I was bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh? Play it again, Karim. Please.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes by, the revered ``Casablanca,'' sprung from a 1942
Hollywood movie lot, somehow resists the process of aging. The set
may have vanished, but, said Alami, ``Rick's is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But not with kindly, dewlappy C.S. Szackall serving drinks, and
the evil, rotund Sidney Greenstreet at his table plotting and
scheming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tourist bar in the Hyatt,'' said Alami. ``I wouldn't go
there. I have my own places. It's my town.'' Bogie would have felt
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling the road from Morocco, Alami, Arazi, and El Ayanoui
have scored a first for an Arab country: a trio going as far as the
third round of a major championship. ``That,'' Alami said with a
smile, ``is as many as your American guys. Of course, they might be
better known _ Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Chris Woodruff.''
Arazi is now in the fourth against Nicolas Escude of France, and El
Ayanoui will be as well if he can finish off Spaniard Juan Carlos
Ferrero in the fifth set where rain stalled them.
</P>
<P>
   Alami means ``my flag'' in Arabic, and this lighthearted trio
with brio is carrying it splendidly. Arazi, the tiny, 26-year-old
lefthanded shotmaking wizard whose head comes loose now and again,
has done the best, making the French Open quarters in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The strapping El Ayanoui, at 6 feet 4 inches, and spindly Alami,
6-1, dwarf him, and serve bigger, though lacking Arazi's
legerdemain. They are close together, all ranked in the 30s, with
Davis Cup success as a mutual dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make it up there to the World Group, the top 16
countries,'' Alami said, ``and that would inspire many people at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia keeps ``Casablanca'' (the flick) in business, but
there are no memories of Moroccan tennis. ``We are it, the
beginning,'' Alami said on this gloomy, allegedly summer afternoon,
framed in a chill drizzle and frigid temperatures _ for Melbourne _
in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago El Ayanoui, who comes from Rabat, knocked off
10th-seeded Tommy Haas, a semifinalist last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy for Alami and me,'' said Ayanoui. ``There was
no tradition of professional tennis in Morocco, no mentality for
it. My parents couldn't understand what I wanted. It was too far
from their thinking. They wanted me to stay in school. Much more
important to them than playing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let me go to Nick Bollettieri's (camp in Bradenton, Fla.)
for a week holiday, as a present, when I was 17,'' he said. ``I
stayed eight months, and knew it was the life for me. They kept
calling, telling me to come home. But now it's OK. I'm supporting
myself.'' Indeed, he had nearly $400,000 in prize money in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the unschooled Casablanca-born Arazi, his break was to
escape a rough Paris slum in the care of a remarkable coach,
Alberto Castellani, a cultivated Italian who writes poetry and
insists that his pupils read it (``not necessarily mine'').
Castellani coached Alami, too, for a long period.
</P>
<P>
   Alami, also a high school dropout against his parents' wishes,
speaks Arabic, English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese,
married a Brazilian, and lives in Paris. ``If I swear when I'm
playing, it's in Arabic,'' he said, ``because it's so natural to
me, and relieves stress.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried, but there was too much to relieve as an airtight
Kiefer, Germany's 22-year-old heir apparent to Boris Becker, tuned
him fast.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a fez-tive occasion for four Moroccans in
the stadium gathering of 10,000. Abdelwahab Barkaoui and Mbark
Enegd doffed their customary tubular red caps to Alami, and each
fan's young daughter flapped a red Moroccan flag emblazoned with a
large green star.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really there. No concentration,'' said Alami, and you
can understand why as he tells you that his wife, Nathalie, gave
birth to a son, Rayane, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the day the
tournament opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was supposed to have the baby the first of the year. When
it didn't happen, she urged me to leave. I didn't want to, but she
said it's my job, and the Australian is important. So it was good,
winning two rounds, even if my mind was in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Since baby always needs a new pair of shoes, the $25,000 prize
money should help. But Sunday, to paraphrase a Hope-Crosby lyric:
``Like Webster's dictionary, Karim's Morocco-bound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the first plane out of here to see my boy, my
first-born,'' he said. On arrival, will he raise a glass to mother
and child with a Bogartian, ``Here's looking at you, kids''? This
could be the start of a beautiful family.

THE UNEXPECTED WILL BE EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Years ago, Bill Parcells was asked to name
the coach he least liked to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Ryan,'' was his answer, ``because you never know what
Buddy is going to do. He's liable to try anything at any time in
the ballgame, and you just don't have any idea of what it is or
when it is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the protege of Parcells meets the protege of Ryan, and
nothing has changed much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unsettling to play this Tennessee team,'' said Tom
Coughlin, head coach of the Jaguars, whose team faces the Titans in
Sunday's AFC Championship game. ``They are very unpredictable. They
do something on almost every play. They keep you thinking all of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin was on the Giants staff when Parcells was head coach
and they used to go head-to-head with Ryan's Philadelphia Eagles,
who had a young defensive backfield coach named Jeff Fisher. Fisher
is now head coach of the Titans, and he takes the same approach
with his team that Ryan did with the Chicago Bears as defensive
coordinator and later with the Eagles as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is very physical, very tough,'' said Coughlin, who
has lost three straight to Fisher and the Titans, two of them at
Alltel Stadium. ``They challenge your offense the whole game with
their defense. This kid (Jevon) Kearse is something special. They
feed off his ability to rush the passer. Their defense is very
good. It is very difficult to run against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved (strong safety) Blaine Bishop. He's an
exceptional player. He can tackle anyone in the open field. He just
doesn't miss. He's the biggest reason they are so good against the
run. They bring him up as the eighth man and he has so much
instinct, he just flies to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we know we are going to be looking at Eddie
George running the ball more than 30 times. In their two playoff
games, he was 57 percent of their total offense, either running or
catching. And just when you start going for their play-action, they
run a quarterback draw with (Steve) McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something. Once McNair goes across that line
of scrimmage, he's as hard to bring down as any running back in the
league. He's a big, powerful guy and you don't get him or George
down on the ground with arm tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans won, 20-19, in Jacksonville early this season, then
crushed the Jaguars at home, 41-14, late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the first game here more than they won it,'' said
Coughlin. ``We had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter and gave
the game away. I made some poor decisions in the fourth period that
hurt the team. I cost us the game. In Tennessee, it just wasn't our
day. It looked like we were moving in slow motion and they were at
high speed. We were bad, they were great.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher sees Sunday's game hinging on turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a close game, and in close games turnovers
are the difference,'' he said. ``Both of these defenses challenge.
I think Jacksonville is going to try to shut down our run and
pressure us in the passing game. Their cornerbacks are playing well
right now. I think we are going to have to spread the ball around,
get it more to our tight end or the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is evenly matched. Both teams have respect for each
other. This is always the toughest place for us to play every year
and our players know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team that wins the game is the one that protects the
football, has some balance on offense, and makes some plays on
defense. Both teams have been pretty good at that this season.''

COUGHLN NO NONSENSE, NOT HARD-HEARTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Coughlin will prowl the sideline Sunday in search of the
Super Bowl. For the second time in four years, he's got his
Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship game, and this time
he's at home, favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jags make it to Atlanta, brace yourself for a week of
Coughlin stories. He's the Great Santini with a whistle and
clipboard. He's Mr. Discipline, an on-time guy who wears shoes to
the beach, grades film while his kids open Christmas presents, and
once told his heat-stricken daughter that she would have to leave
the practice field if she insisted on sitting down. No one sits
during a Tom Coughlin practice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hard side and a soft side to Tom Coughlin. We bring
you both sides, from folks who knew him during his successful stint
as head coach at Boston College (1991-93).
</P>
<P>
   Reid Oslin, who worked for 24 years in the BC athletic
department and now is in the school's public affairs office, has
fond memories of the Coughlin era.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season, he doesn't listen to the radio in his
car,'' recalled Oslin. ``Tom commuted from Walpole and he arrived
at work every day at exactly 6:05. One day our cars had to be moved
from the parking lot outside Conte Forum. I think they were
repainting the lines. Tom tossed his keys to a kid, a wonderful kid
who was injured and never actually played for us. So he moved the
coach's car to the parking garage and he did what any 19-year-old
kid does _ he put on the radio. When Tom goes to his car, at 11 at
night, the radio came blasting on. The kid was called into Tom's
office the next morning for a discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was photo day. Every team in America has it, and it
takes a couple of hours. The team picture always takes a lot of
time because we put the seniors in the front row, then we put
numbers 1-99 in order in the next eight rows. Well, Tom had the
players file out of the locker room in exactly the right order. We
finished the thing in about 10 minutes, in one-tenth the time it
usually takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin has four children and they are unfailingly polite. They
still remember watching Dad grade one of the boy's high school
football films while the kids opened presents Christmas morning.
When his nieces and nephews would get a little rowdy while watching
BC games in the coach's office, they were told to behave or they'd
be sent to live with uncle Tom.
</P>
<P>
   He had his own TV show when he coached BC, and Coughlin was Al
Gore wooden. Players were instructed to deliver their names and
hometowns. Questions and answers were furnished in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had rules about hats,'' remembered Sue Mosher, BC associate
athletic director. ``The kids on the team could not wear hats
indoors. We were at a bowl in Florida, and his oldest daughter came
down to breakfast and you could tell she'd just gotten up because
she had a pile of hair under her hat. He told her to take her hat
off and she didn't want to because her hair was a mess. So he said,
`Then you're not having breakfast.' He would not stop until she
took her hat off.''
</P>
<P>
   Moe Maloney coached the BC baseball team when Coughlin was at
the Heights. They battled over Coughlin's refusal to let his
gridders play hardball in the spring. And then there was the
``Maloney Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing on the sideline, watching the BC-Miami game,''
remembered Maloney. ``Jay McGillis intercepted a pass in the end
zone and I was right there, hugging the kid before he even got out
of the end zone. After that, there were no more sideline passes for
us. Coughlin said, `I don't want some (expletive) baseball coach
costing me 15 yards.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McGillis died of leukemia in 1992. Coughlin never forgot the
young man or his family. He named BC's annual spring game after Jay
and for the last four years has hosted a Jay McGillis charity golf
tournament in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy everybody sees as so calculating and cold has a heart
of gold,'' said Mosher. ``What he's done for the McGillis family is
beyond what anyone would think.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong safety from Brockton, one of six children of John and
Pat McGillis, Jay was in the prime of his college career when
leukemia struck during his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom became probably our best friend at that time,'' remembered
John McGillis. ``He went in there every day _ to St. Elizabeth's or
Dana-Farber. He'd go in and spend time with Jay every day and he'd
bring one of the players. He was just so compassionate and generous
with his time and everything else. Our friendship with him will
endure forever because of the way he treated Jay and our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many well-meaning folks make an effort when tragedy strikes,
then move on and forget. Not Coughlin. He never forgets. A basket
of fruit arrives at the McGillis household every July 3 _
commemorating the day Jay died in 1992. And then there are the
cards and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just called Tuesday night,'' said McGillis. ``He said,
`I've got two Super Bowl tickets if you want 'em.' I said, `We'll
be there if you're there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There goes my neutrality for Sunday's AFC championship. John and
Pat McGillis deserve a trip to the Super Bowl.

DEFENSE IS THE SECRET WEAPON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The widely held belief among football fans is that
the St. Louis Rams will win the NFC Championship because of their
offense. They are wrong. The Rams will win the NFC Championship
because of their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The only team left in the playoffs that can present anywhere
near the offensive and defensive balance of the Rams is
Jacksonville, and the Jaguars have nowhere near as potent an
offense as the Rams. But St. Louis's defense is at least as
crushing as Jacksonville's.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Rams are 14-point favorites after opening the
season as 200-1 long shots to reach the Super Bowl in Atlanta next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Rams have the highest-scoring offense in the NFL,
an explosive attack that rang up 49 points on the Minnesota Vikings
last week in what was supposed to be their most difficult test, and
an average winning margin of 25.6 points a game at the TWA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   What has gone all but unnoticed _ because of the speed with
which the Rams can score _ is a defense that is No. 1 in the league
against the run and sixth overall. Like the offense it complements,
it is built on speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams defense is anchored in the middle by undersized
(5-foot-10-inch) linebacker London Fletcher, who is as fast and
ferocious as the law allows; has the league's leading pass rusher
in Kevin Carter (17 sacks); has a Pro Bowl cornerback in Todd
Lyght; and has speed across the board, especially in Fletcher,
fellow outside linebacker Mike Jones, and undersized defensive end
Grant Wistrom.
</P>
<P>
   Although its defense is less heralded than Tampa Bay's
NFC-leading unit (which allowed a league-low 235 points, only 29 in
the last three games), St. Louis quietly led the NFL in rushing
defense, did not allow any back to rush for 100 yards, and tied
Jacksonville for the NFL lead with 57 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that success against the run is because teams fell
behind early against the Rams' high-octane offense, and stayed that
way because of a defense that has given up an average of only 74.3
yards rushing a game. Worse for opponents, it's a defense that
bites back.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have scored eight defensive touchdowns and had a
safety. Like the offense, the defense is even more potent at home,
allowing only 11.3 points a game while the offense was scoring an
average of 34.8. Even the 37 the Rams gave up last Sunday against
the Vikings was not a true measure because the Vikings were held to
minus-2 yards on offense in three possessions in the critical third
quarter, when St. Louis turned a 17-14 deficit into a 49-17 lead.
The final 20 points Minnesota scored were not meaningless, but they
didn't change the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Tampa Bay can survive is by running the ball
between the tackles with fullback Mike Alstott, and wide with
Warrick Dunn, controlling the clock and keeping the Rams' offense
on the bench as long as possible. With a rookie quarterback and
limited offensive firepower, the Bucs cannot get into a shootout
with the Rams, and they know it. The only problem is the Rams know
what's coming and will have Fletcher and tackles DeMarco Farr and
Ray Agnew standing stout in the middle to stop the run, as they
have all season.
</P>
<P>
   The overall defensive team speed at linebacker and in the
secondary will make it difficult for Tampa Bay to hurt the Rams
wide, even if the Bucs get the ball to Dunn with the short swing
passes and screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing people don't talk about is they have been playing
great defense and their special teams and defense create field
position,'' Buccaneers head coach Tony Dungy said. ``I haven't seen
a weakness in them yet. They're playing the most consistently of
anyone in the NFC. This is a well-rounded team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams know that, even if the rest of the country hasn't
figured it out. When you score 526 points and have a league MVP in
quarterback Kurt Warner, the defense can go unnoticed, and the Rams
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an offense like ours, it's understandable if people
forget about us,'' Fletcher said. ``Offense draws everyone's
attention, especially if they score the way ours does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had games where we've held people to 3 points and
haven't gotten much attention because our offense scored
40-something. But we know what we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   What they're capable of is shutting down a Tampa Bay team that
rushed for only 44 yards last week against a Redskins defense that
had been giving up 123.3 yards rushing a game. Washington did it by
jamming the line of scrimmage with as many as eight defenders and
challenging rookie quarterback Shaun King to throw.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is likely to do something similar, but the difference
is if King does try to throw, St. Louis has the pass rushers to get
to him and the defenders to get to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave our defense any credit whatsoever and we really
take that personally,'' Wistrom said after the victory over the
Vikings. ``We know what we have on this team. We've got to keep
proving ourselves every week until we get some respect around the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more wins and they'll get that respect, some new jewelry,
and maybe even the recognition that they do more in St. Louis than
play offense.
</P>
<P>
   They play football.

TALKS BETWEEN PATRIOTS, JETS SHOULD HEAT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiations between the Patriots and Jets about compensation
that would allow Bill Belichick to become New England's coach and
general manager should heat up over the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had a brief ``table-setting'' discussion Friday,
according to an official close to the negotiations, but as of late
Saturday no further talks had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have called a news conference for Monday to announce a
new coach, which reportedly will be former Patriots defensive
coordinator Al Groh, currently the linebackers coach in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are keying on Belichick. While they are willing to
give compensation, it will not come without major negotiation and
compromise. The Jets want at least a first-round pick, perhaps
more, while the Patriots hope to give up less than that.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear which Jets official will speak to which Patriots
official. The negotiations may be conducted between owners; they
may be done on a committee basis, where Jets owner Robert Wood
Johnson IV, president Steve Gutman, and Bill Parcells would
negotiate with Robert and Jonathan Kraft and Andy Wasynczuk; or
they could be solely between Gutman and Wasynczuk. The final
approval obviously will come from Johnson and Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of an antitrust lawsuit by Belichick's legal team may
disappear if the teams settle on compensation. Belichick's lawyer,
Jeffrey Kessler, said, ``The most important thing we're after is
that Bill Belichick be able to work someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are in the process of promoting another former Patriots
assistant, Romeo Crennel, to defensive coordinator, and he may get
another title, possibly associate head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Crennel had been wooed by the Cleveland Browns, and there was
also the possibility that Belichick would bring him to New England
as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, free agent cornerback Marcus Coleman reportedly has
agreed to a five-year, $20 million deal to stay with the Jets.
Belichick is fond of Coleman as a player, and may have tried to
bring him to New England.

ST. JOHN'S WITNESSES A CRUEL REPLAY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just like last March, it was cruel. Just like last
March, it was heartbreaking. One final possession for St. John's
Saturday, one bucket needed and _ just like in the final of the
South Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament _ the same two players were nose to navel: Ohio State's
Scoonie Penn and the Red Storm's Erick Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley ended up with the ball on the left baseline with .02
seconds left. He went up for the game winner. Penn went up, too _
and he pinned the ball in Barkley's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then the horn. Then the hurt. No.13 Ohio State 65, No.19 St.
John's 64. ``There was no contact,'' said Barkley, who had collided
with Penn and lost the ball in the final 10 seconds last March in
the Red Storm's 77-74 loss, which sent the Buckeyes to the Final
Four. ``There was only a couple of seconds. I had no choice but to
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse perhaps than the collision between Barkley and Penn that
ended St. John's NCAA tournament run in March was the Red Storm's
collapse Saturday in the final 2 minutes 49 seconds to let the
Buckeyes back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's held a 64-54 lead and, thanks to the dead-eyed
left-handed stroke of Bootsy Thornton and the persistent interior
scrap of the undersized Anthony Glover, the Red Storm had answered
every Ohio State run. Thornton had just launched his sixth
3-pointer for his 28th point of the night, and the singing and
stomping crowd of 15,164 at Madison Square Garden made sure the Red
Storm knew it was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 38 minutes, we had absolutely no right to win this game,''
said Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien, whose 13-3 team has won five in
a row. ``For the last two minutes, we had every right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (12-4) outrebounded the Buckeyes by 42-37,
protected the ball better with just 8 turnovers to Ohio State's 15
and, up to that point, made Penn and his backcourt mate, Michael
Redd, walk the ball up the court with a smothering zone defense.
The 6-foot-7-inch Glover had outboxed 6-11 Ken Johnson inside and,
along with the slashing Lavor Postell and Reggie Jessie, dominated
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were still in it,'' said Penn, who finished with 16
points and 4 assists. ``We had been standing around playing their
game. We knew we needed to get it going up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes did just that by applying scrambling
baseline-to-baseline pressure that forced four St. John's turnovers
and had the Red Storm players stumbling around the court. The
frantic pace also allowed a struggling Redd to get back in the
game. He scored 7 of the Buckeyes' last 11 points _ including a
3-pointer that cut the St. John's lead to 64-63.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 38 minutes, I had a horrible game,'' said Redd, who
finished with 15 points. ``But at a timeout, Coach told me to relax
and keep my confidence. I had a couple open shots. I took them and
they fell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, meanwhile, could not make two passes in a row.
First Jessie, then Barkley, then Glover threw tentative passes into
the hands of the Buckeyes. ``I don't think they did any better,''
Thornton said. ``We just turned the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Added St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis: ``We allowed Ohio State to
hang around and be in the position to make big plays which Red and
Penn did. We paid the price for not taking care of the ball when we
needed to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 19.2 seconds left, Ohio State leading by 65-64, the
Red Storm had the ball and a chance for the victory. Jarvis' play
was simple: spread the floor, create a situation where somebody has
to help, get open and catch and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happened but the last part,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball first went into the lane at a flashing Glover who
caught it and drove hard to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to bull it up. But as he had all day, Johnson sprung in
the air and slapped the shot away for his 11th block of the game.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball kicked out to Barkley on the left baseline behind
the 3-point line, a cruel replay was about to unwind. Again, it was
Penn _ his teammate from the summer's United States team at the
World University Games _ in a defensive crouch. The sophomore
lifted in the air; the senior went with him.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Penn was bouncing around the Garden floor,
pumping his arms. Barkley was shuffling off dejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't foul him,'' said Penn, ending any similar
conversation that had lingered from the collision in the NCAA
tournament. ``Don't even go there. It was just an incredible
win.'' &QL;

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI, CUBA RELATIVES REMAIN SPLIT OVER BOY'S FATE, AS
GRANDMOTHERS MEET WITH RENO
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The grandmothers of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez met with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington
Saturday, but hopes for a family meeting that might break the
stalemate over the boy's future still seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us ... returning Elian to his family will honor his
mother's memory, return the family to normality and, more
importantly, return Elian to the normality of life with his father,
brother, family, friends at school, his toys, dog and parrot,'' the
women wrote in a letter they gave Reno during their 45-minute
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be no real progress toward that goal
Saturday. Instead, the grandmothers' visit seemed mired in the war
of words and political posturing that has surrounded the case for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   As his grandmothers met with Reno in Washington Saturday
afternoon, Elian played in the yard of the modest Little Havana
home where he has lived with his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off
Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Family members repeated their hopes that the grandmothers would
come to the house to see Elian, but also repeated their
unwillingness to take the boy elsewhere to meet the women.
</P>
<P>
   According to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez, there has been
no contact between the branches of the family since the
grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, arrived in New
York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't called,'' he said. ``Tell the National Council of
Churches to let them come meet with us, one on one, without that
translator they brought from Cuba. They still are not free to say
what they truly feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, however, told the Washington Post that they
are speaking their true feelings, and that they have been unable to
reach anyone at the Little Havana home for the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have disconnected the telephone,'' Rodriguez said.
``It just rings and rings.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's trip to the United States was arranged by the
National Council of Churches, one of the nation's largest
inter-denominational Protestant groups. An affiliated church group
in Cuba asked the U.S. organization to assist in the case, hoping
it might act as a go-between for the boy's return to his home.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, the two grandmothers, both 51,
went directly to their waiting airplane. Church group officials
spoke briefly, saying that they were immediately taking the women
back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written
statement the grandmothers ``made a very compassionate and
heartfelt plea'' but that the matter now is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship
between parent and child and that family reunification has long
been a cornerstone'' of U.S immigration law as well as Immigration
and Naturalization Service practice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Meissner's decision in early January to send the boy back
to his father that triggered the latest round of angry rhetoric and
protests over the case. Both Reno and President Bill Clinton back
the decision to return Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed a federal lawsuit to block
Meissner's decision, with an initial hearing on the case perhaps to
be scheduled in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is expected to be on the agenda when Congress
convenes on Monday, with several representatives saying they plan
to introduce bills to grant Elian citizenship or permanent
residency, which would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement to Reno, the grandmothers indicated that they
would go back to Cuba soon, perhaps within days. They may be
anxious to leave the United States out of concern that Elian's
Miami relatives might file court motions to subpoena them in the
legal proceedings surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not
to his distant family, where there had not been a previous
relationship,'' the women said in their letter to Reno. ``We only
have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see him, but we
also want to return with him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances of that seemed slim, with the two sides of the family
not communicating and neither side willing to compromise on when or
where they might meet. Indeed, relations seemed to grow only icier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the family say they know best what Elian's mother
- who drowned on the voyage from Cuba - would've wanted for the
boy. Both sides say their goal would best honor her intentions and
memory. Both claim the first-grader has told them that he wants to
do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives insist the Cuban side of the family is
being manipulated by Cuban President Fidel Castro, and can't speak
their true feelings. They also say the Cuban relatives have shown
little sorrow over the death of Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the barbs aren't coming from just one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not politicians,'' Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela
Quintana told the New York Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is the well-being of the child. If they're human,
we beg them to think about the child's well-being, too,'' she said,
referring to the Miami side of the family.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers also feel the Miami family is controlled by the
hard-core anti-Castro Cuban exiles they called the ``Miami Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Elian's father hasn't come to Miami to get his son,
they said he fears for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would kill him,'' Quintana said of the extremists in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers also doubted the Miami family's sincerity,
telling the Washington Post that Elian is ``nothing more than a
checkbook'' to his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. ``They have made a
business out of the child,'' Rodriguez said.

Football a labor of love for Houston GM Casserly
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owners, general managers, coaches, personnel directors and
scouts who have watched Charley Casserly during his 23-year NFL
career make some interesting observations about the new executive
vice president/general manager of Houston's expansion team that
begins play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations with respected NFL people who have
followed Casserly's career, this is what is known about the River
Edge, N.J., native who spent his entire NFL career with the
Washington Redskins, starting as an unpaid intern and working his
way up to general manager before he was fired by new owner Daniel
Snyder last year.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, 50, is dedicated, loyal, honest and humble. He isn't
afraid to make decisions. If they work out, he is quick to credit
others. If they fail, he accepts the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly is a workaholic with passion for the NFL and an
unbridled enthusiasm for football at any level. He is driven not by
ego but by his desire to succeed on and off the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob McNair invested $700 million to return the NFL to
Houston, no one had to tell him to hire an experienced front-office
executive to oversee the football side of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's decision to hire Casserly to pair with executive vice
president Steve Patterson, who runs the administrative side of the
organization, has been met with almost universal approval in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response we've gotten from people has been overwhelming,''
McNair says. ``Charley commands respect in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly is the embodiment of what a general manager should be.
He is experienced in every facet of the football operation. He has
run the draft, assembled a scouting staff, negotiated contracts,
manipulated the salary cap, hired and fired coaches, traded
players, signed free agents and served on the league's most
powerful and influential committees.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran member of the competition committee, he played a
major role in setting NFL policy, and he was a driving force behind
the return of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley lives and breathes football,'' says former Oilers
cornerback Cris Dishman, who left Houston for Washington as an
unrestricted free agent and now plays for the Chiefs. ``I don't
know if Charley knows about anything but football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that impressed me the most about him was his
honesty. As a player, you appreciate honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Being honest is part of Casserly's makeup as a person and as a
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might not always want to hear the truth, but they'll
appreciate your honesty,'' Casserly says. ``My word is my bond. A
handshake is as good as a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans know Casserly as the former Redskins general
manager. His story has inspired many through the years because his
rise from high school coach to general manager is so improbable it
has become the stuff of legend within NFL circles.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was born to a hard-working, demanding father and a
devoted mother, both of whom are dead.
</P>
<P>
   His father instilled an almost fanatical work ethic in his
youngest son, who joined the work force when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me once, `How can you work for Jack Kent Cooke?'
and I said, `You never knew my father,''' Casserly says. ``My
father was great. I loved him and my mother so much. But he was
very demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father lost everything in the Depression. His first wife
died, and he lost his job. He rebuilt his family, and he never made
more than $15,000. We also had food on the table and work always
came first.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Casserly can remember, he has been a sports
fanatic. Growing up less than 10 miles from New York City, he used
money from his paper route in New Jersey to ride a bus and subway
into New York City to watch the Yankees, Mets, Knicks and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was 8 years old, I kept up with everything I
could about sports,'' Casserly says. ``For a while, I delivered
papersto Mickey Mantle, Don Larsen and Clete Boyer. I used to love
to travel into the city to go to Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium and
the (Madison Square) Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Giants fan. You couldn't buy a ticket to see the
Giants back then, either, but if you sold enough subscriptions to
the Bergen Record, you could earn tickets, so I saw some Giants
games that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved football the most. When I turned 14, I knew I wanted
to be a college football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   James Casserly told his son he would attend Bergen Catholic High
School, and he would have to work to pay the $300 tuition. He got
jobs sacking groceries, selling baby food and keeping statistics
for a local baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was cut by his football team every year in high school,
but he coached youth football for the late George McElwreath, his
first coach and mentor in River Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``George inspired me because of his motivation and leadership,''
Casserly says. ``I admired him so much, and learning from him made
me want to be a football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly went to Springfield College in Springfield, Mass.,
because he wanted to be a football coach. He made the team his
first year, but that was the end of his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for his college tuition, he washed dishes and officiated
basketball games, among other things. He became a volunteer coach
at Cathedral High School in Springfield. When he was offered $300
to coach track, he learned everything he could about track. When he
was offered $500 to coaching swimming, he went to the library and
bookstore to learn everything he could about swimming.
</P>
<P>
   After earning undergraduate and graduate degrees at Springfield
College, Cathedral High School hired him full time to coach track
and swimming and to be a part-time football coach. He did so well
he was named athletic director when he was 24. One night, the
apartment building where he resided burned down, and he lost
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the local Goodwill store and bought a mattress I
slept on,'' he says. ``At that time, I really wanted to be a
college football coach, but I wasn't having any success. One day, I
figured, what the heck, I was going to write NFL teams to see if I
could get a job doing anything just to get my foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was willing to walk away from his job as a coach and
teacher at Minnechaugh High School in Wilbraham, Mass., for a
college coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to work for an NFL team for a year so I
could get a lot of the team's stationary,'' he says. ``That way,
when I wrote colleges on NFL stationary, somebody might be
impressed enough to hire me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote George Allen a letter, and the Redskins got back to
me. I thought, wow, I'll write the other 27 teams. I was shocked
when 22 responded. That's why I still answer every letter sent to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1977, Casserly got two interviews _ Allen with
the Redskins and Chuck Fairbanks with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Redskins said if I was ever in the area to drop by, so I
told them I was going to be in the area the next Wednesday,'' he
says. ``I wasn't supposed to be, of course, but I made sure I was.
I didn't tell anyone I was interviewing with George Allen because
they would have thought I was lying or crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, George wasn't expecting me because they
forgot to tell him. I was lucky because he didn't have much to do
that day, and I got to sit around with him for hours talking about
football. He explained his intern policy. If he hired you, you
worked free for a year, then you got $10,000 the second year. He
said he was looking for someone like he used to be when he was 26,
someone who would open the place in the morning and close it down
at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, George told me to write three things I could do
to help the Redskins and three things I thought would help the NFL.
I didn't have any ideas that would help the Redskins or the NFL,
but I wrote down some things, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I got a message too late that Fairbanks had called.
When I called his secretary, she told me he'd call the next day at
11:15 a.m. I still can't believe I did this, but I called George's
secretary and said I had to speak with him the next day at 10:15.
As a high school teacher, it was hard to have any time on the phone
during the day, so I figured I might have five minutes with each of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was looking for someone to compete with three other
intern candidates at the minicamp, and one would be chosen for
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called George, I told him I was going to interview with
Fairbanks, and he couldn't believe it,'' Casserly says. ``The job
he offered me didn't pay anything. He told me it might not be
available and he couldn't believe I wouldn't accept it, but I stuck
to my guns about interviewing with New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairbanks told me if I was hired, they'd help me get a college
job. He even brought in his defensive staff and asked them if they
would help me get a college job if I was hired and did well. They
said yes. I thanked him, but I told him I was going to accept the
job with the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly interviewed May 15 and quit his high school job June
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I woke up in a cold sweat,'' he says. ``I thought,
`My God, I'm sleeping on a Goodwill mattress on the floor, and I've
got $500 in the bank, and I'm driving a car with 120,000 miles on
it with a driver's side door that won't open, and now I'm taking a
job that pays nothing. What have I done?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was borrowing $500 a month from some friends so I could live
while I worked for George.''
</P>
<P>
   At training camp, Casserly got up before Allen and went to bed
after him. He got Allen coffee and ran errands for him. When the
Redskins returned to Washington, Casserly got a room for $8 a day
at a YMCA that was 40 miles from the team's old facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, I bought a jar of peanut butter and jelly and put it
in the refrigerator at the facility,'' he says. ``The next day when
I went to get it to eat, someone had stolen it, and I panicked. But
I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and there was no
way I was going to screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1977 season, Casserly did everything asked. He broke
down film, watched film, assisted the scouting department and even
helped the media relations department.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time the Redskins Club came over, and the PR guy (Charlie
Taylor) told me I could keep 25 cents out of every media guide I
sold them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After Casserly's first season, Allen was fired and moved to the
Rams. He told Casserly he had a job for him, but didn't specify
what it was or how much it paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``George wasn't the kind of guy you got into details with,'' he
says. ``Later, I told him the Redskins had offered me $17,000 to
stay. He said, `What am I paying you?' When I told him nothing, he
said, `Wow, from nothing to $17,000 _ that's quite a raise, isn't
it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Hickman, George's administrative assistant, told me I
should consider scouting as a full-time job. He told me there were
1,000 guys trying to get into coaching every year, but scouts came
from fired coaches who couldn't get jobs or relatives who wanted to
get into coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was 28. Bobby Mitchell, who is the Redskins' assistant
general manager today, was their director of scouting. He offered
Casserly a scouting job, and he accepted. He gave most of his first
paycheck to those who had loaned him money. He gave the rest to
Minnechaugh and Cathedral high schools and to some youth football
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a Christmas bonus that first year, but Bobby told
me to spend a week at a college all-star game in Tampa as my
bonus,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Beathard was hired as general manager, and he taught
Casserly most of what he knows about being a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby was great,'' Casserly says. ``He was easy to get along
with. He listens to people who work for him. He's family-oriented.
He lets people under him perform and grow in their jobs. I try to
treat people the way Bobby treats people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, his first season as a scout for the Redskins, he
discovered such offensive linemen as Joe Jacoby, Jeff Bostic and
Nate Newton.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, Casserly began dating the team's assistant
controller. He and Bev were married in 1980. Their daughter,
Shannon, turns 16 this week.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was Beathard's assistant general manager from 1982
until 1989, when he was promoted to replace Beathard. Along the
way, Casserly won three Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack Kent Cooke died, his estate looked for a buyer. His
son, John Kent Cooke, was the owner, but he couldn't afford to keep
the team. Casserly was outspoken on Cooke's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were loyal to me for 20-something years,'' he says. ``Why
wouldn't I be loyal to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly resigned as general manager in early September.
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized for such No. 1 draft choices as defensive
tackle Bobby Wilson (1991), receiver Desmond Howard (1992),
cornerback Tom Carter (1993) and quarterback Heath Shuler (1994),
Casserly struck pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   When the Redskins won the NFC East this season and beat Detroit
in the first round of the playoffs, Casserly's personnel decisions
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly traded for quarterback Brad Johnson, drafted cornerback
Champ Bailey and offensive tackle Jon Jansen, and left the Redskins
with three No. 1 picks in this year's draft. In the offseason, he
signed such free agents as offensive tackle Andy Heck, defensive
end Marco Coleman, guard Keith Sims, fullback Larry Centers and
backup quarterback Rodney Peete.
</P>
<P>
   Such draft choices as guard Tre Johnson (1996), receiver Michael
Westbrook (No. 1, 1995), running back Stephen Davis (No. 4, 1996),
receiver Albert Connell (No. 4, 1997) and tight end Stephen
Alexander (No. 2, 1998) blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Sporting News named him
NFL Executive of the Year at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday this season, Casserly drove three hours from his
home in Great Falls, Va., to Mount Laurel, N.J., where he watched
tapes of games at NFL Films. Then, he drove to Philadelphia to help
prepare Ron Jaworski for his weekly show on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly did weekly work for ESPN Radio. On Sundays, he went to
Grevey's Sports Bar in Falls Church, Va., to watch NFL games on a
bank of televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly also hung out with Joe Gibbs at a NASCAR event in
Virginia. He spent some time with Jeff Chernov, who is producing
The Replacements, the film about the Redskins' 1987 strike team
starring Keanu Reeves as the quarterback and Gene Hackman as the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to get another job, but I didn't know what
it would be,'' he says. ``I would have been a scout to stay active
in the league. I hit a grand slam home run to be hired for this
job. I have a great owner in a fabulous city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any bitterness toward the Redskins. Snyder bought
the team and, like in any business, he wanted to bring in his guys.
I can understand that. Once I walked out that door, I've never
looked back. I feel bad for John Kent Cooke. The Redskins were his
life. Now he doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Casserly gives another example of why NFL people respect
him when he says, ``Being a general manager in the NFL is a
constant learning process. I'm a better general manager today than
I was last year. I'll be a better general manager next year.''

SABBATINI LEADS, BUT DUVAL LURKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES _ Rory Sabbatini, who has less than two full years
of professional golf to his credit, is the surprise leader after
four rounds of the 3 million Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect him to shake in his FootJoys during today's
final 18 holes at Bermuda Dunes Country Club. And the ominous
presence of defending champion David Duval, who is lurking only two
shots back in chase of the first-place check of $540,000, probably
won't rattle him either.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini, who has a four-round total of 23-under-par 264, has
lived the pressure before _ he almost won last year's BellSouth
Classic before being passed in the final round by none other than
Duval - and believes he can handle things better this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Atlanta (site of the BellSouth) helped a lot in the
fact it taught me a harsh lesson coming down the stretch,'' he
said. ``It was a lot of fun because I had not experienced it
before, but I think I'll go into tomorrow with more confidence than
anything else because I'm really confident in my game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour rookie Matt Gogel said he also wasn't bothered by the
prospects of winning his first PGA Tour event because he is no
stranger to victory. Gogel, who is one shot back and alone in
second place, had six wins while on the Nike Tour and was that
circuit's first player to win at least one event four years in a
row (1996-99).
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old said he will do the same things he always has
done to win, ``and if it's my time, that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not happen today, however, because he said this
tournament and these courses do not suit his game. Gogel said he
tends to play his best golf on tougher layouts and is not used to
putting up such impressive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speciality is not a lot under par,'' said Gogel, who has
had rounds of 66-67-64-68 for 22-under 265. ``I'm just giving
myself chances this week.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Duval, and sooner or later he's going to take advantage of
them. He said he still isn't putting as well as he would like - he
lipped out at least three times Saturday - but he is fairly pleased
with his overall game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging to see the ball hitting the hole a lot,'' he
said, ``and they are eventually going to go in. And, hopefully,
that will happen (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Duval thinks he could have an advantage because today's round
will mark his second day in a row at Bermuda Dunes, and he can
better gauge the speed of the tricky greens. He also believes being
in the hunt will work to his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many people between me and the lead,'' he
said. ``Hopefully some of the experience I have from being there a
lot in the last few years will pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lickliter had the low round of the day with a 10-under-par
62 at Indian Wells, which has yielded several low scores this week,
including Brent Geiberger's 61 on Friday. Lickliter was tied for
seventh with J.L. Lewis, who had a 66 at La Quinta, first-round
leader David Toms (70 at La Quinta) and Kirk Triplett (65 at Indian
Wells).
</P>
<P>
   Another player making a move was Jesper Parnevik, who has been
almost ignored while quietly posting rounds of 69-67-66-64 and
jumping into a tie for third place with Rich Beem (71 at Indian
Wells), Duval and Stephen Ames (64 at Bermuda Dunes).
</P>
<P>
   The 72-hole cut was a record 11-under-par 276, which beat the
previous mark of 10-under set in this tournament in 1993.
Casualties included Steve Pate, last year's second-place finisher
behind Duval, who was at 71-277. Former Classic champions Fred
Couples and Tom Kite just managed to stick around by finishing on
the number.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Mesa's Esteban Toledo had the tournament's first
hole-in-one when he aced the 189-yard third hole at La Quinta with
a five iron. Toledo, who shot a 71, is at 14-under 273.

VICE PRESIDENT TAKES POWER IN ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Just hours after overthrowing Ecuador's
president, leaders of a military-backed coup stepped down on
Saturday, paving the way for Vice President Gustavo Noboa to take
power.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa assumed the presidency at dawn to become Ecuador's third
head of state in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Noboa, a bearded, 62-year-old lawyer and former
state governor, was heralded as a democratic outcome to the ouster
of President Jamil Mahuad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself with the unavoidable obligation to assume the
presidency,'' said Noboa, who is slated to finish Mahuad's
four-year term. ``I am sure that the vast majority of Ecuadoreans
will support my government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who served just 17 months, fled the presidential palace
on Friday after protesters stormed government buildings in Quito
and top military officers demanded that he resign.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the armed forces endorsed Noboa, it was unclear
whether the new president would win over the public or whether he
could end months of political and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, protesters complained that they had been used by the
military. Once Mahuad was ousted, they said their demands for a
populist government to rule on behalf of the poor were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Noboa said Saturday that he would follow many of
Mahuad's free-market economic policies, including a controversial
plan to scrap the local currency for the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel betrayed,'' said Segundo Jami, a Quichua Indian who
took part in Friday's uprising. He supported the short-lived junta,
which included a prominent indigenous rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   After spending Friday night at a military base and at the
Chilean Embassy in Quito, Mahaud surfaced on Saturday. He said he
had been tricked into leaving the presidential palace by military
guards who said they could no longer protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave the seat of power, you're finished,'' said
former President Leon Febres Cordero. ``No one recognizes you
anymore, not even hungry dogs in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address, Mahuad acknowledged that he had lost
power and would support Noboa. ``I will not stand in the way of
Gustavo Noboa I wish him the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials continued to monitor developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we regret the circumstances that led President Mahuad to
call for public support for a Noboa presidency, this statement is a
magnanimous gesture to pave the way to restore the country to
constitutional order,'' said a State Department communique.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis took hold on Friday as thousands of mostly Indian
demonstrators occupied the empty Congress and Supreme Court
buildings to decry Mahuad's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   They were later joined by scores of mid-level army officers, who
had been conspiring with Indian leaders for two weeks, according to
the Quito newspaper El Comercio.
</P>
<P>
   With Mahuad on the run, the demonstrators announced the
formation of a three-man ruling junta led by Defense Minister Gen.
Carlos Mendoza. But the putsch was strongly denounced throughout
the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with Gen. Mendoza, Peter Romero, the
U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for western hemispheric
affairs, warned that the coup was unacceptable and would lead to
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messages were pouring in from all over the region,'' said a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mendoza resigned at 3 a.m. on Saturday, just four hours
after forming the junta. The two other junta members leaders,
former Supreme Court president Carlos Solorzano and Indian leader
Antonio Vargas, protested the decision but eventually left the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gen. Mendoza justified the coup as a temporary measure to
avoid violence. ``There could have been conflict and bloodshed. It
required an immediate response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the uprising stained the Ecuadorean armed forces,
which had been admired for its support for democracy in a nation
that often seems to have a revolving door at the presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has set the armed forces back 100 years,'' said former
Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo. At least one coup plotter,
army Col. Lucio Gutierrez, was jailed on Saturday. The Congress
held an emergency session to ratify Noboa's presidency and denounce
the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many lawmakers were pleased to see Mahuad go _ a turn of
events made possible by the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated lawyer, was elected in July 1998. But
he inherited an economic mess that grew worse during his 17 months
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, inflation hit 61 percent and the economy shrunk by
7.5 percent. Bank deposits were temporarily frozen during a
financial sector crisis and Ecuador became the first nation to
default on its Brady Bond debt.
</P>
<P>
   Governing Ecuador may prove almost as difficult for Noboa.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny nation of 12 million is deeply divided along racial,
social, and even geographic lines. That makes reaching a political
consensus extremely difficult. Indeed, most of Mahuad's initiatives
to jump-start the economy were blocked by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mahuad urged Ecuadoreans to cut the new president
more slack. Noboa ``needs the backing of the entire country,'' he
said. ``That's something I always asked for but rarely received.''

PALMER STRUGGLES IN DESERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES -- Arnold Palmer has missed 18 consecutive cuts in
the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, and chances are you will see him in
next year's tournament despite a game that has been deteriorating
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hasn't made any decisions on returning to the desert in
2001, but he did say his game must improve first. That may be
asking a lot for an individual whose best golf clearly is behind
him and turned 70 years old in September. Palmer finished this
year's Hope last in the 128-player field after rounds of
82-79-76-77.
</P>
<P>
   He still can play a little, though. He toured the front nine at
Bermuda Dunes Country Club on Saturday in one-under-par 34, but he
closed with a 43 that included a quadruple-bogey eight on the 16th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament fans, however, couldn't care less about his
golfing struggles and gave him another standing ovation as he
walked up the 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished my score would have been better,'' he said when asked
about the adulation. ``I enjoy playing here in the desert and the
people. And the (tournament) executive committee kind of insists I
come and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many more times I'll play. I'm not going to
play and play as poorly as I have been. My game has been bad. If it
doesn't get much better, I'm not going to play much golf publicly
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play just around the club (Bay Hill in Orlando, Fla.)
with the members. I play like most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he will leave Tuesday for Hawaii, where he will
compete in this weekend's Senior Skins Game. He then will return to
his home at Bay Hill and work on his game in February ``to see if I
can get something that's reasonable.'' His Senior Tour schedule has
been not been finalized, but he might play in the Toshiba Classic
at Newport Beach Country Club in March.
</P>
<P>
   All he is asking for is improvement, and Saturday's front nine
indicated it might not be that far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's a little golf there,'' he said. ``Not a
lot. And I enjoy it so much, too. My biggest problem is I get so
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   (box) Sandy Lyle was disqualified from the tournament, and it
wasn't for signing an incorrect scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   It was for practice putting.
</P>
<P>
   The former Masters champion had just finished his round Thursday
at Bermuda Dunes Country Club and, after all play was complete,
went back to the 18th green to hit a few putts. Practice during the
tournament is limited to the driving range or practice putting
greens, but the violation was not reported until Friday, when Lyle
was shooting a 72 at the Arnold Palmer Course at PGA West.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle officially was in volation of United States Golf
Association rule 7.1b, which prohibits practice on the competition
course or testing the surface of any putting green on the course
before a round or playoff.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a Classic rule which prohibits practice at, or on,
the putting green of a hole at any of the four venues for all five
rounds.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush still dealing with abortion questions
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, confronting
abortion questions for a third straight day on the Iowa campaign
trail, said Saturday he favors maintaining the Republican
platform's anti-abortion rights plank.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the position despite the fact that the platform
differs from his own stance _ that abortion should be legal in
cases involving rape, incest or threats to the mother's health.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, reminded that the platform does not include the
three exceptions, Bush said, ``I understand that. That's going to
be up to the Congress, if America is ever ready for a
constitutional amendment. I understand that. The first step is to
convince Americans that we ought to value life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said in the past that he does not believe the nation is
ready for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush said the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion ``was a stretch.'' On Friday, he said restrictions on
abortion ``should be up to each state legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   IOWA POLLS SHOW GORE UP BY 20 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has a strong lead over Bill Bradley in
Iowa polls just days before Monday's presidential caucuses. Recent
polls in Iowa have given Gore more than a 20-point edge in Iowa,
and a new Heartland Poll by the University of Iowa Social Science
Institute gave him an even larger lead, 63 percent to 26 percent,
over the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gore had a slight lead in four new polls,
CNN-Time, Newsweek, a tracking poll by the American Research Group
and one by the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Gore's lead over Bradley has grown, according to a
poll issued last week by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP;
the Press. The gap was 68 percent to 24 percent, up from 53-38 in
December.
</P>
<P>
   SAME WITH BUSH OVER FORBES
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP race in Iowa, Bush has been nearly 20 points or more
ahead of Steve Forbes in recent polls. A Los Angeles Times poll
shows Bush up 43 percent to 25 percent, and he was ahead 54 percent
to 18 percent in the Heartland Poll.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, which holds its primary Feb. 1, Bush and
Arizona Sen. John McCain remain very close: They are tied in the
Los Angeles Times poll, while McCain has an edge in a tracking poll
by the American Research Group and Bush has an edge in a Newsweek
poll. Forbes has focused his attention on Iowa rather than New
Hampshire, while McCain has done the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Bush led McCain 69 percent to 17 percent in the Pew
poll, with others in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   HATCH UNAMBIGUOUSLY AGAINST S.C. FLAG
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his rivals in the GOP race, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch
has taken an unambiguous stand against South Carolina flying the
Confederate flag over its Capitol.

   ``From a constitutional perspective, it is clear that it is up
to the people of South Carolina to decide,'' he said, echoing the
view voiced by other candidates. But he added: ``That answer
conveniently ducks the real question voters want answered. They
want a personal perspective. ... I would remove the Confederate
battle flag.''

   FORBES SPENDING LIKE A RICH MAN
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Forbes, a multimillionaire, has spent far more than
anyone _ about $3.2 million, according to aides from the Forbes and
Bush campaigns. Bush aides say their campaign has spent about $1.6
million in Iowa; the Forbes camp puts the figure at $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Where's all the money going? Mostly to TV ads, but the Forbes
team has also invested in creature comforts. At one stop in Orange
City last week, 60-some souls had their choice of turkey or ham
sandwiches, with chips, cookies and sodas, with enough on the table
to feed them twice over. After the speech, everyone got a free copy
of Forbes' new book ($17.95 retail). Then comes the free
long-sleeve Forbes 2000 T-shirt. It was much the same in each town,
the Hy Vee grocery chain catering one meal after another. In Le
Mars, it was dozens and dozens of the biggest doughnuts you've ever
seen. A choice of chili or chicken stew at suppertime in Sheldon,
with enough rolls and cookies to bloat a multitude. More cookies,
heaping piles, at an evening meeting in Spencer.

   BRADLEY SINCERELY MOVED BY HEALTH-CARE STORY
</P>
<P>
   The mind-numbing routine of campaign appearances was broken
briefly last week in Salem, N.H., when the cerebral Bradley was
moved to tears during a news conference in which a Pelham woman
described her family's struggle to get by without health insurance
for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The seated candidate hung his head while he listened to Cathy
Perry, 40, talk about the time her 16-year-old son apologized
because she had to pay for his doctor's visit when he got strep
throat last year. Looking up, Bradley's eyes were moist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's important when reality enters a political
campaign,'' said Bradley, his voice breaking as he stood before a
barrage of reporters in a Salem day-care center. ``Your story
breaks through all of the political rhetoric to what the real
circumstance is in this country for so many families.''
</P>
<P>
   Though health care has been Bradley's top issue, the exchange
appeared genuine and unscripted. The audience, including reporters
and campaign staff, were hushed as the candidate stood before the
lectern trying to gather himself.

TEXT EXCERPTS FROM NEW YORK SENATE RACE FUNDRAISING LETTERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate campaigns of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary
Rodham Clinton are using direct-mail appeals to raise donations.
Following are excerpts from some of the letters:
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing to you because I think you'll agree with me when I
say that eight years of the Clintons in Washington has been more
than enough. It's time for the country to move forward. But that's
not going to happen if Hillary becomes a senator.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Hillary Clinton is a leader of the ultra left-wing
Democrats who are determined to save the gigantic federal
bureaucracy and the high taxes and spending that go with it. And
many people believe she's been the driving force behind some of the
most radical ideas that have been put forth by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The left-wing elite is pouring everything into this race, not
just because they see Mrs. Clinton as their champion. They are also
furious that my tough law-and-order, pro-free enterprise policies
have succeeded in making New York City great again.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Clinton wins, she will immediately become the leader
of the left wing of the Democrat Party in the U.S. Senate. In the
Senate, she would quickly revive her socialist government-run
health care plan and champion left-wing causes. And she would use
her Senate seat ... to become a leading Democrat prospect to run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   We can defeat the forces of attack politics and personally
negative campaigns by talking to people about the issues that
matter to their lives, building a grass-roots network of committed
volunteers who will join in helping to get our positive message
out.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The more I listen and learn, the more excited I become about the
progress we could make: for children, for families, for New York,
for America. I hope you share my excitement because there is a
tremendous challenge ahead of us, and I'll need all the help you
can give. I haven't even formally announced my candidacy and
already the divisive, negative Republican campaigning has begun.
Already, my potential opponent is attacking me almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is attacking me with a vengeance. The
Republicans even launched a ``Stop Hillary'' fund-raising effort on
the Internet to prevent me from running for the Senate. I welcome
healthy dialogue and fair competition. And I'm ready to meet any
challenge in making the case for the values you and I share. But
there's something cynical, and perhaps a little desperate, about
efforts to discourage someone from even entering the contest.

DUVAL IS CLOSE TO LEADER, BUT MARTIN MISSES CUT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ Rory Sabbatini took the lead and David
Duval remained in contention, but Casey Martin missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   It was an eventful fourth round Saturday at the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, with some players shooting themselves onto the
leader board while others fell out of the tournament. Sabbatini, a
second-year player who has never won on the PGA Tour, will enter
Sunday's final round at 23 under par (264), leading by one stroke
over the rookie Matt Gogel and by two strokes over Duval, Stephen
Ames, Jesper Parnevik and the third-round leader, Rich Beem, who
all are tied for third at 21 under.
</P>
<P>
   However, a double-bogey on the final hole at La Quinta Country
Club sent Martin home early in his debut as a full member of the
tour. Needing a birdie on No.18 to make the 11-under-par cut,
Martin pulled his tee shot near the water and then took off his
shoes and socks, stood in the water, and contemplated his next shot
while standing shin deep in the water. It was a potentially
dangerous move for Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory
disorder that has severely weakened his right leg. Any misstep or
wrong turn of his leg could have led to a possible career-ending
injury, and as Martin stepped into the water, you could almost hear
people holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   After a few anxious moments, Martin climbed out and decided to
take a drop and a penalty stroke. But he could not keep himself in
the tournament. His next shot landed in a greenside bunker, and he
chipped onto the green and two-putted for a double-bogey 6 that
made for a bitter eight-under-par finish, three strokes off the
cut, after Saturday's 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bummed,'' said Martin, who became a national figure in
1998 when he successfully sued the Tour for the right to use a cart
in competition. ``Four days of grinding and playing well and
nothing to show for it. That's life. That's golf. I blew it on that
last hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those still in contention _ 21 players were within
five shots of the lead _ looked forward to Sunday. Sabbatini went
ahead with an eagle on the 18th hole at Indian Wells, capping his
eight-under 64.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's No.2-ranked player, Duval is the man to beat,
though. He is trying to become the second player to win the Bob
Hope in consecutive years, joining Johnny Miller, who won in 1975
and '76. Last year Duval shot a final-round 59 at the Hope, one of
the great 18-hole performances, roaring from seven strokes behind
to win. No wonder he felt confident about his chances after
shooting a 64 Saturday at Bermuda Dunes Country Club, where
Sunday's final round will be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can promise you that if I shoot a 59 tomorrow, I'll win,''
Duval said. ``I believe I have a very good chance to win. There's
not too many people between me and the lead, and that's helpful.
Hopefully, some of the experience I have from being there a lot in
the last few years will pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval showed his talent at No.16 after he was distracted by a
spectator with a camera and then hit a poor tee shot, which left
him in the rough near the base of a tree. Unable to aim at the
green because of the tree, Duval aimed about 70 yards to the right
of the green, then intentionally hit a 7-iron hook from 167 yards
that curved beautifully from right to left and rolled onto the
green, a terrific recovery shot that saved his par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made pars on six holes in a row, and I wasn't making
putts,'' Duval said. ``I had to force something. I figured if I hit
a good shot, I could get it up near the green. I didn't really
expect to get on.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval also dealt with the additional distraction of playing with
John Elway, the former Denver Broncos quarterback who was one of
his amateur partners. Elway was besieged by autograph seekers on
every hole, and if he had stopped to sign every request, neither he
nor Duval would have left the course before dark.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval has the composure to deal with this tournament's
pro-am format, one of the reasons he has done so well. Duval said
he enjoyed meeting Elway for the first time, and on Sunday the
amateurs will be gone and the professionals will settle the
tournament. After last year, Duval has nothing but good memories
from this tournament to feed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen, because everybody on the
leader board is a fine player,'' Duval said. ``I'm not making as
many putts as I'd like to, but it's encouraging, because a lot of
them are hitting the hole and lipping out. Hopefully, that will not
happen tomorrow.''

Spears helps Houston win at Memphis
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ To help prepare for Saturday's game against
Memphis, Houston senior point guard Roy Spears went to watch his
father's high school team play Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Spears, alerted that he might make his second start of the
season, came away inspired by the victory the night before and
helped lead the Cougars to a surprising 98-89 Conference USA win
over the Tigers at The Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, perhaps stretching his point just a bit, UH coach
Clyde Drexler said, ``Now Memphis is famous for two things _ Elvis
and Roy Spears.''
</P>
<P>
   With his father, Roy Sr., the basketball coach at Memphis'
Central High School, in the crowd of 11,103 with about two dozen
friends and relatives, Spears scored 10 points, had six assists and
ended the game with only one turnover in 28 minutes as the Cougars
won on the road for only the third time in their four C-USA
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (8-10 overall, 2-3 C-USA) will try to keep the road show
alive Wednesday when it plays at South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, who won 79-78 here last year, needed no late-game
heroics this time, taking the lead in the first minute, increasing
the margin to 20 in the second half and holding off a Tigers flurry
that got Memphis within eight points with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me last night (Friday) that I might start and he
told me in the locker room I was out there for the start,'' said
Spears, who played little last season after he was granted a
medical redshirt because of a knee injury suffered in the third
game of the 1997-98 season. ``He told me he wanted me to get the
offense going, and I also knew I had to make my open shots so they
couldn't double off on Gee (Gervin). I looked for my shot because I
needed to be a scoring threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's plan was for Spears to make passes to Gervin inside
and George Williams in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' drive to the basket accounted for UH's first score, and
then he set up Gervin twice more and Kenny Younger on a fast break
as the Cougars made their first five shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to run with us, and that's our game,'' said Gervin,
who scored 10 of UH's first 19 points in the opening seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin finished with 19 points, as did Younger, who also had 10
rebounds while playing only 25 minutes because of foul trouble.
Williams also contributed a double double (14 points, 14 rebounds)
as the Cougars shot 52.3 percent for the game, including 55.9
percent in the first half en route to a 48-37 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   UH committed only one turnover in the first 13{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to run so smoothly in the offense,'' Spears
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``With Kenny on the bench (for about 13 minutes
early in the second half after picking up his fourth personal), I
knew it was important for me to get the boards. Roy was really a
big key. He got us in the offensive sets we wanted to run, and he
hit his own open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger also credited Spears' backcourt leadership with helping
the Cougars handle the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy is a great point guard and he's healthy now and able to do
the things he can do so well _ see the floor and get the ball to
the guys who are hot,'' Younger said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year senior Early Smith, playing for the first time since
suffering a knee injury against Texas in the 1998-99 season opener,
triggered a celebration by the UH bench when he slammed home an
offensive rebound to give the Cougars a 73-53 lead with 9:05 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis guard Marcus Moody then tried to inject some suspense
into the game. The 6-5 junior scored 13 points for the Tigers in
just over two minutes as Memphis surged within 74-66.
</P>
<P>
   But Gervin and Younger, inserted back into the game by Drexler,
answered Moody's challenge. With defender Courtney Trask flopping
in front of him for a charging call, Gervin fired in a 3-pointer.
After a Memphis miss, Chad Hendrick (11 points, four rebounds)
canned a trey that gave UH an 80-66 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tigers outscored the Cougars 13-4 in the last two
minutes, Memphis never got closer than nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Moody scored a game-high 27 points, including five 3-pointers,
and 6-10 sophomore Kelly Wise added 16 points, 12 rebounds and
three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers, who shot only 40 percent for the game, couldn't
find enough help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't challenge them the way we needed to,'' Memphis
interim coach Johnny Jones said of his team's defense. ``I thought
we'd been getting a pretty good effort, but today we weren't the
team we had been. I thought we took a step back.''

RESERVES DELIVER FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Friday's afternoon practice turned to night,
they stood alone near midcourt at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a meeting to save the season _ not with an assistant
coach (Steve Spencer) and two reserves (Ray Young and Matt Barnes)
frustrated with production and playing time.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no question their discussion salvage UCLA's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt and I have been frustrated, and coach Spencer put it all
in perspective,'' Young said. ``We couldn't argue with anything he
said. He told us to play good defense, and good things will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and Barnes responded with the finest performances of their
careers Saturday in UCLA's gritty 83-77 victory over Arizona State,
before 9,557 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Young played sensational defense on ASU's high-scoring guard,
Eddie House, and Barnes scored a career-high 17 points. They played
51 minutes, committed just three turnovers, combined for 27 points
and energized the wobbly Bruins, who trailed at halftime in a game
they needed desperately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt and Ray came back to life and produced in a big way,''
UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``They gave us a great lift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used one of their best second halves of the season to
defeat Arizona State for the 22nd consecutive time and avoid their
worst conference start since 1945-46, when they were 0-4 under
coach Wilbur Johns.
</P>
<P>
   They played solid man-to-man defense, they limited their fouls
and they held the Sun Devils to 33.3 percent shooting in the second
half. House scored his team's first 12 points on 3-pointers, but
finished with 18 points (12 below his Pac-10-leading average) and
was not a factor in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played good defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (11-5, 2-3) weren't great offensively, but they
played with more poise and patience than against Arizona. They shot
61.5 percent in the second half, made their free throws (75
percent) and executed their half-court offense well enough to
outscore ASU 16-9 with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after committing 10 turnovers against Arizona, freshman
forward Jason Kapono scored a career-high 24 points and hit two
free throws with 20 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Jerome Moiso, who's playing like a first-round
pick, added 22 points, seven rebounds and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson took one shot - ``That's never happened
in my life,'' he said - but he distributed the ball effectively.
UCLA's top scorers, Kapono and Moiso, took 25 of its 51 shots and
scored 46 of its 83 points. Their contributions were critical but
not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The production from Barnes and Young, however, was both
essential and unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a sophomore forward who was academically ineligible for
the fall quarter, had reached double-figures in just two of 10
games and played inconsistent defense. Friday, Spencer reminded him
that he's not the No. 1 scorer, so his minutes are based on defense
and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if they play hard for two minutes, if
they get a rebound or take a charge, that buys them more time,''
Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes listened and learned.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he grabbed seven rebounds, defended well and gave UCLA
the lead for good with a nifty spin move with seven minutes left.
His 17 points were not only a career high, they were more than he
scored in the previous three games combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that if I play good defense, I'll get on the court
more,'' Barnes said, ``and if I'm on the court, I can score.''
</P>
<P>
   For Young, Saturday's game was personal.
</P>
<P>
   He's a sophomore from Oakland and House is a senior from nearby
Hayward, and they faced each other in high school. Young has
enormous respect for House's work ethic and his skill, but the
easiest way to regain playing time was to undermine House's
All-American campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 12 points in six minutes against UCLA's zone
defense, House made 1 of 11 shots against Young's relentless
man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no master plan. I just made sure I stayed on his
butt and didn't let him catch and shoot,'' said Young, whose 10
points equaled his total from the previous five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much energy because I wanted to stop Eddie that the
game came easier for me today. My basketball awareness was amped.
It's been a hard seven or eight games. I hope this helps me get
back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he can always call another meeting.

STRANGERS IN A STRANGE NFL PLAYOFFS ARMED AND READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strange things have happened in a suddenly strange league known
as the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, please, to Rodney Harrison, a safety for the San Diego
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   You ever heard of Rodney?
</P>
<P>
   Me neither, although he does have Pro Bowl credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney is now proclaiming himself MVP of the NFL. This seems
very presumptuous of Harrison, but...
</P>
<P>
   Here's his story:
</P>
<P>
   In a preseason game last August against St. Louis, Harrison put
a lick on quarterback Trent Green, the starter for the Rams. Green
limped off, and season-ending knee surgery would follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, thinking they were headed for the usual 4-12 year
without Green, howled loudly about the Harrison hit. Running back
Marshall Faulk was outraged. He called it ``a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harrison said, ``I wonder what Faulk thinks now.
Shouldn't he be calling me the MVP? I am the MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that honor went to Kurt Warner. But Warner, the Arena
League/European League refugee, got his chance because of the Green
injury. And that's where Rodney is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, of course, after Green went down was a
combination of strange/amazing. Warner is the league MVP because he
deserved to be the MVP because he was the best quarterback in the
NFL. The best. No argument.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, still about the quarterback. Teams win with
quarterbacks, they lose basically because of quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the successful names aren't Aikman or Favre or Young, it
makes no difference. Only the results count. Only the winning.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Final Four round of the NFL postseason, the
quarterbacks will be Warner, Shaun King, Steve McNair and Mark
Brunell. By reputation, only Jacksonville's Brunell is not a total
surprise, but until last week against Miami, Brunell probably had
been the least impressive of the surviving foursome. Certainly he's
the least mobile, due to both knees being braced due to various
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   As a football fan, did you think you'd live long enough to ever
see the Rams and the Buccaneers, the Titans and the Jaguars,
playing for Super Bowl berths?
</P>
<P>
   Logic said it wouldn't happen. And especially not with the
quarterbacks, except Brunell, on those clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Warner. Despite all those hefty passing numbers he
posted this season, there are still those who think Green could
have done the same thing. The Rams are more about Faulk and the
receivers, not about the quarterback, the doubters will say.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Who could have watched Warner this season and actually
believe that stuff? Good receivers, yes. But Warner's incredible
passing accuracy has made them great receivers, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But again, we are programed to believe a Kurt Warner can't be
this good. Except he has been.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was once property of the Packers, until they cut him.
There was no room in Green Bay, not with Brett Favre, Ty Detmer
and, yes, Brunell, ahead of him on the QB depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell then became trade bait for the Pack. The competition was
fierce, but only Tom Coughlin, the Jax coach, stepped up with the
right deal. That move took Jacksonville to contender status.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Air'' McNair of the Titans. So much early
promise, followed by a career lull, but now look at him. He wins
without the ``Air.'' Yet the big passing arm is still there, and it
shows when coach Jeff Fisher takes off the wraps.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher is a defensive guy. His idea of a strong offense is
run it first, and always avoid turnovers. To his credit, McNair has
adapted. He went six games this season without throwing a TD pass.
But the last time the Titans played Jax, McNair threw five TD
passes.
</P>
<P>
   For Tennessee to win at Jacksonville today, doesn't Fisher have
to unleash McNair again? Fisher probably won't, but regardless, the
Jaguars have spent the past week worried silly about which McNair
will show up today. To stack an eight-man defensive front for
running back Eddie George could be extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy at Tampa Bay comes from the same coaching philosophy
as Fisher. He also wants to play defense, run the ball, avoid
turnovers. But can that work against the offensive gas of the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   Another of the NFL's quarterbacking surprises, rookie Shaun
King, came along to save the season for the Bucs. He has allowed
Dungy's philosophy to work. In his own way, King's story has been
as amazing as Warner's. The kid is incredibly cool, confident, and
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bow, C.O. Brocato of Arlington. Brocato is a long-time
scout for the Oilers/Titans organization. In last April's draft,
the quarterback class was one of the strongest in years. King,
however, was considered a notch below. The Tulane product went to
the Buccaneers in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Brocato would hear none of that. He told anyone who cared to
listen that in the long run, King would be the draft's best
quarterback. Brocato may well have been right about everything
except that ``in the long run'' part.
</P>
<P>
   A very strange NFL season has produced new teams and new names
at QB. But one thing didn't change. Success is still about the
quarterback, even if he's a mystery man.

KURT WARNER GOES FROM STOCKING SHELVES AT HY-VEE TO BEING NFL'S
MVP 
</HEADLINE>
 HY-VEE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There's a wonderful advertisement running in Iowa
newspapers these days that, more or less, wraps up the preposterous
story of Kurt Warner. It is titled, exotically enough, ``From
Hy-Vee to MVP,'' and then below, in smaller print, it offers a
sober, reasonable path an Iowa boy might take to becoming the most
valuable player in the National Football League and, just maybe,
the biggest sensation in sports.
</P>
<P>
   You start at Cedar Rapids Regis High School, where the team
rarely throws the football. Go to the University of Northern Iowa,
where you sit on the bench for three years. From there, naturally,
you stock groceries at the Cedar Falls Hy-Vee for a while. Then you
go to work for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   And there you go. The path to greatness. From Hy-Vee to MVP.
Today, the St. Louis Rams try to do the unthinkable. They play the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the right to go to the Super Bowl. The
Super Bowl! The Rams, before this season began, had the worst
record of any team in the 1990s. They had moved from Los Angeles,
where they were unloved, to St. Louis, where they were barely
noticed. They are owned by an oft-married former showgirl named
Georgia Frontiere. They are led by a 63-year-old coach named Dick
Vermeil, who quit coaching 17 years ago because he felt burned out.
</P>
<P>
   But the grandest, weirdest, wildest story of them all is the one
about the 28-year-old guy playing quarterback, Warner. And as the
advertisement says, if you hurry, and you live in Iowa, you can now
get Kurt Warner's Crunch Time Cereal, a 20-ounce box, for only
$2.99, for a limited time, only at Hy-Vee.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurt Warner story begins with simple faith. That makes some
people uncomfortable. It's always precarious blending sports and
religion, God and games, football and faith. In the end, all that
seems about as absurd as the wonderful old comedian line about the
boxer who thanks the Lord for granting him the strength to bash in
his opponent's face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't separate Warner from his faith. You can't tell
his story without peering into his beliefs. You know, in 1994,
after he graduated from Northern Iowa, he had a tryout with the
Green Bay Packers. It was a disaster. The Packers were overloaded
with good quarterbacks. Warner never had a chance. But, more than
that, they mocked him. Brett Favre, one of the great quarterbacks
on earth, called him Potsie. He was never allowed on the field. He
lasted two weeks. That stuff happens all the time. It seemed like a
story Warner might tell his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Only Warner would not quit football. He never even considered
quitting. He had been on the bench in college. He had been scoffed
at by the NFL. People told him to give it up, dump those childhood
fantasies, become an adult, but he believed in things. He believed
in football. He believed in his arm. He believed in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost hope,'' Warner said. ``He had a plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he worked nights at the Hy-Vee and worked days
watching football video. That's why he went to play three years of
football for the Iowa Barnstormers in a league that plays a
smash-'em-up football in small arenas, on 50-yard fields, a brand
of football where, quite often, receivers crash into walls. He was
brilliant there. He went to play football in Amsterdam. He was
brilliant again. He went to Jamaica on his honeymoon and was bitten
on his throwing elbow by a spider. His elbow swelled. Still, he had
shown enough stuff to join St. Louis in 1998 as the third-string
quarterback, knowing full well that third-string quarterbacks
almost never actually play.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all with a simple, childlike faith. Warner says he
did not expect to become an NFL star. He never even figured to play
in the big league. But he felt sure he was on the right path. He
felt sure he was going the right way. So he just kept on going.
He's sure God led him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people want to hear another answer,'' he said. ``But
there is no other answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something kept him going,'' said Terry Allen, Warner's coach
at Northern Iowa, now football coach at Kansas. ``That's all I can
really tell you. He has always been a committed young man. There's
no phoniness there. What you see is exactly what he is. He just
believed.''
</P>
<P>
   These crazy Kurt Warner kind of stories used to happen all the
time in the grainy old days of sports. Sure. There was one time
when the catcher for the Homestead Grays of the old Negro Leagues
got hurt before a baseball game. The Grays did not have another
player handy, so they called out to the stands to see if there was
a catcher in the house. An 18-year-old kid named Josh Gibson
wandered on the field. He was, perhaps, the best hitter who ever
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Unitas was playing semi-pro football on the sandlots in
Pittsburgh when the Baltimore Colts, on a whim, invited him to
their camp. He matured into the greatest quarterback of his era.
Frances Ouimet was a local caddie in Boston when he won the U.S.
Open. Baseball pitcher Bob Feller, a 17-year-old farm kid from
Iowa, showed up in Cleveland one day throwing 100-mph blurs and
scaring the Feller out of hitters twice his age. He struck out
eight men in three innings. One of those hitters supposedly barked
at an umpire, ``That last pitch sounded high.''
</P>
<P>
   So, no, the Kurt Warner saga is hardly unprecedented. But it's
different because we don't live in the grainy old days of sports
anymore. We live in the Pentium III, America Online, DirecTV
information age, when there are not supposed to be any surprises.
Football teams spend millions of dollars scouting players, testing
them, studying them from the time they're 15 and 16 years old. They
missed Warner. They all missed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought Kurt could be a good quarterback,'' Vermeil
said. The Rams proved that by leaving Warner exposed in the NFL
expansion draft, meaning that the Cleveland Browns, the NFL's
newest team, could simply have taken Warner, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they would not take Kurt,'' Vermeil says now in a
refreshing bit of revisionist history. ``Nobody had even given him
a tryout. Why would they take him?''
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? The Rams, themselves, had no intention of using
Warner. Then the starting quarterback and local hero, Trent Green,
was injured just before the season began. The few football fans in
town went into mourning. It was too late to get another
quarterback. The Rams would be stuck with this no-name, Kurt
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   His first game, against Baltimore, Warner threw for 300 yards
and three touchdowns, a sweet combination that had not happened for
a St. Louis quarterback in, get this, three years.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Warner did it again against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams played San Francisco next, and Warner had one of the
great games in modern times, completing 20 of 23 passes for 323
yards and five touchdowns, a game so ridiculously good that Rams
coaches would sit in the dark room and watch video of that game
again and again, in complete silence, as if they were watching an
opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any idea how good this guy is?'' Rams wide
receiver coach Al Saunders said. ``He never throws a bad pass. It's
unbelievable. Every pass hits our receivers right in the hands.
Every single pass. I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Television announcer) John Madden was saying that he throws
like Joe Montana,'' Vermeil said. ``Someday, we might be saying
that Joe Montana threw like Kurt Warner. He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   All year long, Warner played at that insanely high level. He
simply did not have bad games. He threw at least one touchdown pass
in every game. Then last week, in his first playoff game ever, he
put on a virtuoso performance that topped even his San Francisco
masterpiece, tossing five more touchdown passes and making a
mockery of the Minnesota Vikings' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his first playoff game,'' Saunders said. ``And there
weren't any nerves. Nothing. I'm telling you, I've never seen
anything like this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, there are plenty of people trying to explain
away Warner's remarkable season. The cynics say that Warner rarely
has to face intense defensive pressure because the Rams' offensive
line is so good. The cynics say that the Rams' breathtaking
receivers are so fast, so agile, that really anybody could throw
them the ball. Let's be honest here, the cynics are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coaching and watching football all my life,''
Vermeil said. ``I promise you: I've never seen one like Kurt
Warner. He's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody says that with Kurt Warner, what you see is what you
get. Well, what you see is perhaps the nicest athlete in
professional sports. Everybody likes him. And, really, what's not
to like?
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, he met Brenda Meoni in a country-western club
in Iowa. In a story she loves to tell now, Brenda told Kurt that
she was divorced and had two children and she would understand if
he never called her again. He called her the next day.
</P>
<P>
   They have helped each other through the worst times. In 1996,
both of Brenda's parents were killed when a tornado swept away
their home in Arkansas. In 1997, they married, and Kurt adopted
Brenda's two children, daughter Jesse, and son Zachary, who is
legally blind. Since then, they have another child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those children are my entire life,'' Warner said. ``They mean
everything to me. All this other stuff, fame and money and
everything, that has nothing to do with real life. The time I spend
with my children, my family, that's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   They spend much of their time working with the St. Louis Family
Church and Camp Barnabas, a Christian retreat for children. He says
any big money he makes in the years ahead will go to Camp Barnabas.
They live a quiet, churchgoing life in a middle-class neighborhood
in St. Louis. It's so corny, it hardly seems real. But it is real.
The whole story is real.
</P>
<P>
   These days in St. Louis, everybody wants a small piece of Kurt
Warner. Everybody wants a slice of the miracle. Warner's football
cards are running as high as $300 a pop. Stores can't keep his
jersey in stock. On eBay, the Internet auction site, there are
2,500 Warner items, including Warner chocolate bars, minihelmets,
signed jerseys, autographed tickets and, of course, Warner's Crunch
Time Cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nothing special,'' Warner said. ``All these things have
been happening to me. It's great. But I'm still nothing special.''

AS HOURS DWINDLE BEFORE CAUCUSES, CANDIDATES ARE AWHIRL IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ACROSS IOWA _ 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's 16 degrees in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley crawls out of bed at the Holiday Inn Express across
from the Speed-Lube. Rough day coming. The front page of The Hawk
Eye carries the headline: ``Bradley health problems at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat has been having heart fibrillations _ four minor
episodes in the past month. Standing in the cold outside a Masonic
lodge the night before, Bradley insisted that his condition was no
big deal, that lots of people, even former President George Bush,
put up with irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   And yet on Friday, as a tangerine sun peaks above the frozen
Mississippi River, the national media are wondering if this is the
beginning of the end of the former senator's race against Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters arrive at the Best Western Pzazz Motor Inn for a
``Breakfast With Bradley.'' They grab plates at a steaming buffet
outside the meeting room, only to be shooed away by the caterer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the paint contractors convention,'' the caterer
says.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that ``Breakfast With Bradley'' means a few
pastries, some juice and an urn of coffee that runs dry before 75
persons are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kokjohn brings his 8-year-old son and two Wilson
basketballs, which Bradley, a former New York Knicks star, gladly
autographs. Kokjohn later confesses to a reporter that he is a
devout Republican who supports Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Burlington event proves a success for Team
Bradley, allowing the candidate to explain his universal
health-care plan, his goal of eliminating child poverty and his
belief that any dream is possible ``in a world of new possibilities
guided by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asks about his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when we have the strongest economy in history, we're
the wealthiest nation on Earth, we have millions and millions of
children who have no health-care coverage at all. We ought to
change that.'' _ Gore in a TV spot
</P>
<P>
   7:26 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer is due on the air in C-SPAN's mobile studio outside
the Iowa Capitol at 7:30 a.m. There's no sign of the Republican, so
the show's producer paces the snow-packed pavement. Then Bauer's
two-minivan caravan tools up and the candidate pops out, cold but
calm.
</P>
<P>
   For a full hour, his eyes fix on the lens, hands stuck in his
lap. His back never touches the chair.
</P>
<P>
   The first question is about China, and the conservative activist
tees off. Later, a Democrat calls to label all Republicans
extremists and to accuse Bauer of wanting to be a ``dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer joshes back: ``Don't hedge on how you feel about me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friday edition of The New York Times in the Des Moines hotel
gift shop has a story about Bradley on the front page. It depicts a
campaign poster showing the senator in a Knicks uniform, driving
with the ball. ``Academic Scholar Basketball Star Presidential
Candidate _ Basically the guy YOU HATED in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   8:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes is on the phone to a morning radio team in Des
Moines during drive time. The Republican publishing tycoon tells
them stories of undocumented aliens not being deported after
serving felony prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' they respond in unison. ``That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: ``Mr. Forbes, one last question. Who is Harry Potter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gonna have to ask my daughter Elizabeth, who has read
the three books and is eagerly awaiting the fourth and keeps asking
me, `When is it coming out, Dad?' and `Why can't you get me an
advance copy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   9:02 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Alan Keyes, the former ambassador who is drawing big
crowds as the race winds down, strides into the WHO radio studios
just minutes before he goes on the air, at least a half-dozen aides
in tow.
</P>
<P>
   He walks up to the front counter and taps out a beat with his
fingers. Keyes is pumped.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, he unloads on Bush, the GOP front-runner. The topic:
abortion. Keyes' beef: Bush's assertion that a woman should decide
what to do if she becomes pregnant as a result of a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' belief is that abortions should not be allowed under any
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows an entire misunderstanding of the nature of the issue
that is involved,'' Keyes intones about Bush. ``He has an
understanding that's borrowed, that's derivative, that's given to
him by somebody because it's politically expedient.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what will lead to crushing defeat for the
Republicans if he is our standard-bearer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can cut taxes for working families _ and protect Social
Security. Some people say we can't. I say we've got to.'' _ Bush in
a TV spot
</P>
<P>
   10:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has changed into hiking boots, cuffed khaki pants and a
plaid shirt to stroll through Dan Lee's small hog farm near Huxley.
They're not exactly work clothes. He spends five minutes touring
the farm, seemingly unaffected by the stench of ammonia from the
hog confinement pens.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer tells about 30 persons crammed into a kitchen: ``I think
you hard-working people have a pattern here. The politicians come
here, hug a pig and go back to Washington to forget about you.''
</P>
<P>
   He promises not to forget. But they need to do him a favor: Get
out to the caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring your neighbors. Heck, bring those hogs out there. They
looked like they liked me.''
</P>
<P>
   11:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The media by now have decided that Bradley's heartbeat is the
top story from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In Muscatine, a half-dozen camera crews cluster below a
seven-story building, the city's tallest. They wait for Bradley to
finish his walking tour. He appears at the top of Iowa Avenue,
hands buried in his overcoat, as local businessmen guide him past a
department store.
</P>
<P>
   The first shout from the press: ``Senator, how are you
feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't answer. The pack and Bradley cross the street,
bobbing as one. Two elderly window-shoppers stare, mouths agape.
Now the cameramen are walking backward downhill.
</P>
<P>
   An aide shouts back, ``OK, no questions.'' The group weaves into
the Hotel Muscatine for a ``Get Out the Caucus Rally,'' which is a
``Breakfast With Bradley'' without the pastries.
</P>
<P>
   During the question-and-answer session, supporter Bonnie Weeks
brings up the heart issue. ``Could you put us at ease?'' she asks,
and Bradley smiles and says, ``I'd be happy to.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. Common condition. Ask President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Reid of Letts, Iowa, is satisfied. ``Look, we've all got
something wrong with us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   12:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter I: The Serious Al Gore. The topic at this Des Moines
stop is health care, and the vice president is in his somber mode.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame him. Gore just spent time with a group of
sick children and their families. ``My heart is a little heavy,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the microphone with both hands, he launches into his
litany before a crowded Mercy Hospital auditorium filled with
doctors, nurses and staff.
</P>
<P>
   The nation must provide financial incentives to employers who
want to provide health insurance to their workers, Gore intones.
The country must bolster Medicare. It must help seniors overcome
soaring drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk to these folks we just spent time with and not
have an idea exactly how urgent it is,'' Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 minutes, Gore is done and out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley will stand up for real campaign-finance reform to
get the big money out of our political system and let your voices
be heard. All politicians are not the same. Bill Bradley is
different.'' _ Sen. Bob Kerrey in a Bradley TV ad
</P>
<P>
   1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bush and Gore, according to the results of the latest
Heartland Poll released at a Des Moines news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two front-runners are far enough ahead so that neither
one of them will be embarrassed or upset,'' forecasts Arthur Miller
of the University of Iowa, which conducted the detailed survey.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the other candidates are foundering, although
Keyes has shown some upward movement, Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts a low turnout Monday. ``Most people,'' Miller
concludes, ``don't see anything exactly going on in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   1:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   North of Perry and right at the ``nightcrawlers 75 cents'' sign,
the Menz family farm has been transformed into a high-security set
for television.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore people wanted to hold this speech at Perry High School.
But Bush had made plans to talk there Monday, and school officials
didn't want two big disruptions. So the Democrat's staff came
asking to use the farm of Ed and Lila Menz.
</P>
<P>
   They were wintering in Arizona, so son David Menz took over. Ed
flew back for the day. But Lila, too scared to fly, is missing
Gore's visit to her home.
</P>
<P>
   The barn looks just so. David Menz has stacked up pallets of
corn and soybean seed at the behest of the campaign so the barn can
look, well, agricultural enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to clean up some of those tools,'' Menz says,
pointing to what will be seen over Gore's left shoulder. ``But they
said no. They wanted it left that way.''
</P>
<P>
   2:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah appears in the same Mercy Hospital
auditorium that Gore vacated just two hours before. Hospital staff
have closed off half the room with a partition, but empty seats
still remain.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 listened to Gore. Hatch draws, maybe, 25. He's in last
place in GOP polls, but he plugs along. The main message: He has
the experience. He knows how to get things done. The other
Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a clue how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He tosses around acronyms such as CDC, HCFA and FDA. He talks
about the 41 bills he passed last year and the 57 he managed to get
through another year.
</P>
<P>
   But his audience is silent. Hatch has to repeatedly ask for
questions. ``Who wants to work me over here?''
</P>
<P>
   No one takes him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a politician. He's a man of his word. I like him. I
trust him. Character matters a lot. A leader.'' _ Testimonials by
different people in a Forbes TV spot
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Laquita J. Good arrives at the Forbes rally in Clinton an hour
before anyone else so she can get the table up front. The retiree
of International Paper Co. has one question for Forbes:
</P>
<P>
   Would he please make the federal government stop taxing her
Social Security benefits?
</P>
<P>
   She had put the same question to Bush several days back. ``He
talked and talked, but I'm not sure what his answer was,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' answer is direct: ``My red line will go through that
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 150 Forbes fans cheers. One person yells,
``Amen!'' These people love their businessman-as-candidate, they
love his flat-tax proposal, they love the way he's been promising _
for four years now _ to ``drive a stake'' through the heart of the
tax code.

<P>
   He speaks quickly, wrapping up in 15 minutes. They love that
too.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   A reporter calls Bill Russell, a political science professor at
Graceland College, for an update from Lamoni. The Bradley county
coordinator is still upset by what he heard from Sara Norris, a
Gore field worker, at an earlier meeting of the Young Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Norris brought up Ernestine Bradley, wife of Gore's rival. As
Russell and others recall it, Norris pointed out that Bradley's
spouse was born in Germany and her father fought on the wrong side
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The inference was that she might, somehow, not be as patriotic
as Tipper Gore, Russell said. Even Gore supporters, such as Carol
Lytle, were shocked: ``I was not pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris could not be reached, but the Gore camp responded by
saying Gore has the utmost respect for both Bradleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Gary Bauer. Sadly, Bill Clinton and even some of my
Republican opponents have put foreign trade ahead of our national
security. As president, I'll end business as usual in China and, if
necessary, reopen our military bases in Panama to protect our
interests.'' _ a TV ad

</P>
<P>
   At Drake University in Des Moines, political scientist Dennis
Goldford is hot property. Three days before the caucuses, reporters
from CBS News and Fox News, as well as journalists from Canada,
Australia and the United Kingdom, want his take on how things are
shaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Goldford winds up doing 18 interviews Friday. At times, he has
his office phone in one ear, his cell phone in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Tuesday,'' he says, ``you'll throw me away like yesterday's
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   7:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's 30 minutes and counting past George W. Bush's scheduled
arrival at Iowa Western Community College.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis Central High School jazz band has run through its
standards. Twice. The national press corps is bored and, mockingly,
yells out requests for Lynyrd Skynyrd's ``Free Bird.'' Bob Joneson,
a junior in the band, grabs an electric guitar and improvises a
workable version.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 300 loves it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to strains of the underdog theme of ``Rocky,''
front-runner Bush hops on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' he says, ``that some of your friends and
neighbors are looking at the polls and saying, `Well, George W.'s
ahead. He doesn't need my help.' That's not the way it works. ...
The only thing that counts is if our people can get people to go to
caucus night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush talks for 15 minutes, managing to work in ``compassion'' a
half-dozen times. It's late in a long campaign day that began in
Marshalltown; now he mangles a few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   (On the Cold War: ``I'm also running because I want to keep the
peace, keep the peace. When I was coming up, with was a dangerous
world, we knew exactly who the they were. It was us versus them,
and we knew who the them was.'' To titters, he added, ``Today,
we're not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.'')
</P>
<P>
   His audience is smitten nonetheless. They crowd around 10-deep
to shake his hand, snatch an autograph and have their pictures
taken with the Texas governor. He picks up toddlers, hugs senior
citizens, clowns with the band.
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes after his speech, he gives a big wave and his
phalanx of bodyguards trail him out the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something you need to know about George W. Bush. In
1994, he signed a pledge with our organization that he would not
support sales tax or business tax increases. In 1997,
unfortunately, he broke his pledge.'' _ a Forbes radio ad
</P>
<P>
   8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2: Al Gore on fire. ``Are you ready for Monday night?''
he shouts, a bit too loudly, to several hundred students gathered
at the union at Iowa State University. ``Are you going to help us
win?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to eight hours ago, this Al Gore is all motion. His
hands twirl, he points to students, he raises his arms as if in
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not take anything for granted,'' he thunders. ``It's 70
hours and 30 minutes until the caucuses begin!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roars. This is hip Al, dressed in sharp slacks and a
long-sleeve polo. Hip Al claps his heavy hands to the beat of the
Rolling Stones ``Start Me Up.''
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking to rally young folks, a group notoriously unmoved
about voting, much less about enduring a 90-minute caucus meeting.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore tries to generate passion, a process that gets off to a
slow start when two old guys, Rep. Leonard Boswell of Iowa and
Education Secretary Richard Riley, introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   At times, some of Gore's long riffs stall, and he has to put his
head down and pause as he considers how to continue. But talk he
does this night _ about Gandhi, about destiny, about ``discovering
our purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   It is idealistic stuff for an idealistic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about ending discrimination for gays and lesbians. He
criticizes South Carolina for flying a Confederate flag above its
Capitol. He urges more help for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand and fight for me so I can fight for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Today it will start all over again, another day on the trail.
More handshakes. More speeches. More rallies. Except for the
long-awaited endorsements by The Des Moines Register, it will be a
day like most others. Except that there are only hours left before
Iowa begins the process of selecting our next president, and ready
or not, the election year really commences.

Houston guarantees Dimel's salary through creative fund-raising
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS and DAVID BARRON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When University of Houston athletic director Chet Gladchuk was
looking for a new football coach last year _ a search designed to
change the program's profile as well as its leadership _ his
mission was twofold.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted someone who had been successful as a head coach at the
NCAA Division I-A level.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk also had to be creative.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the hiring of Dana Dimel, who had served as head
coach at the University of Wyoming for three seasons, and a
contract based on hope and promises as much as hard dollars.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of documents related to the coaching search shows
Dimel will make twice as much as his predecessor, Kim Helton, due
to a guarantee that UH will raise at least $300,000 a year through
external sources or tap into the Houston Athletics Foundation, the
official fund-raising arm of the UH athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement signed by Dimel and Gladchuk, Dimel
is due to receive a minimum of $600,000 a year for five years, half
in base salary from UH and half in ``guaranteed income from
external sources of revenue.'' The agreement identifies such
sources as television, radio, shoes, alumni gatherings and ``other
endorsements as appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the value of those ventures will hinge on the
marketability of Dimel and his program, the money is guaranteed
because, according to Gladchuk, the Houston Athletics Foundation
will make up for any shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel's agreement also includes a provision stating the
foundation will pay the $200,000 buy-out clause in his contract
with Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In Gladchuk's view, Dimel's financial package is an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to invest money to make money,'' he said. ``It's as
simple as that. It's a statement. Are we going to be a player in
Conference USA or not? I mean, we've got to get a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to step up, and we've got some people in the
community we're confident will step up and help us. You ask a guy,
`Will you help me?' He says, `I'll help you.' You go forward if you
know he's going to be there for you. We'll put together the money
we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Gladchuk been successful in hiring his first choice for the
job, Marshall University coach Bob Pruett, the financial burden
would have been even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett's agreement with UH stipulated that he receive a $100,000
advance on his first year's guaranteed outside income and that the
Houston Athletics Foundation cover the $350,000 buy-out clause in
his Marshall contract.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett signed the agreement Dec. 9 but backed out a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, fired with two years remaining on his contract, was paid
an annual sum of $269,000, all university funds. His contract
called for him to receive a base salary of $149,000 and an
``additional guaranteed salary'' of $120,000 in return for
promoting the UH athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gladchuk, Helton was compensated for the remaining
years on his contract _ about $500,000 _ with funds from the UH
athletic department's operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said the key to his coaching search was developing a
financial package that paid at least $600,000 a year without
putting UH, strapped with an athletic deficit dating back more than
a decade, on the line for more than the $300,000 it had been paying
Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ($600,000 a year) was the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the guarantee, made to Dimel and Pruett, of
$300,000 in annual outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said he is negotiating a variety of deals, including a
new shoe contract, that will help UH fulfill its obligation to
Dimel.
</P>
<P>
   But if sufficient funds cannot be generated from external
sources, Gladchuk said, the Houston Athletics Foundation stands
ready to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident there are enough people in our community
interested in seeing this program succeed _ alumni and friends and
so on _ that our fund-raising will be enhanced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using foundation money to compensate Dimel would be a departure
from the organization's stated purpose of funding scholarships for
UH student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said his plan encompassed the same thinking University
of Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds used when UT changed
football coaches two years ago, dumping John Mackovic and hiring
Mack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to DeLoss about how he handled the whole transition
with Mackovic and Brown,'' Gladchuk said. ``He did what he could
with all his different contracts and everything else. Then he asked
people for money. They stepped up at Texas, and I know they'll step
up here (UH), too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk's attempt to attract a so-called ``name'' coach first
focused on one of the biggest in the business, former Nebraska
coach Tom Osborne. Initially involved only as an unpaid consultant,
Osborne, 62, considered taking the job before deciding he did not
want to move away from his children and grandchildren in Lincoln,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk then turned to Marshall's Pruett, whose team was 12-0
at the time and went on to complete an unbeaten season with a
victory over Brigham Young in the Motor City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pruett led reporters to believe he had simply
considered an offer from UH before withdrawing his name from
consideration, documents obtained by the Chronicle from UH under
the Texas Open Records Act show he signed a document Dec. 9
accepting contract terms and agreeing to become Cougars coach
effective Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The contract terms were detailed in a memo from Gladchuk to
Pruett dated Dec. 8 and signed on a point-by-point basis by both
men.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, Pruett was due to receive a six-year,
roll-over contract with an annual base salary of $300,000 and
guaranteed yearly income from external sources in the same amount,
making the deal worth a minimum of $3.6 million. The deal called
for two years to be automatically added to the contract every year
after Pruett's fourth at UH.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett was due to receive two vehicles, a country club
membership, a $3.6 million life insurance policy and a house valued
at $500,000. The memo detailed a plan in which UH would arrange for
the purchase of the house and gradually transfer ownership to
Pruett over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, UH agreed to provide Pruett with a $100,000 advance
on his first year's guaranteed outside income and $27,000 to make
up for the bonus he would have lost by leaving Marshall before the
Motor City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Gladchuk estimated the value of the contract to be
$800,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your agreeing to become our head football coach is an historic
and exciting moment for this university,'' Gladchuk wrote. ``We
will provide you with the supplemental resources to position our
program to be a national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 57, signed the agreement with UH just two weeks after
Marshall had announced he had signed a new seven-year contract with
the Huntington, W.Va., university.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk's agreement with Dimel, 37, matches the one prepared
for Pruett in terms of base salary and guaranteed outside income,
but it differs in several significant ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel's five-year deal includes neither a roll-over provision, a
life insurance policy nor a home. His major perks are two vehicles
and a country club membership.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel's deal does include a series of reasonable incentive
clauses. He will receive a total of $100,000 if the Cougars put
together an eight-win season, win the Conference USA title, and
appear in and win a pre-Jan. 1 bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He also is due to receive $10 for every UH season ticket sold
over 20,000 each season during his tenure at UH.
</P>
<P>
   At Wyoming, Dimel had a base salary of $98,000 a year and a
total annual package worth approximately $240,000. He was head
coach for three seasons, compiling records of 8-5, 8-3 and 7-4.

VICE PRESIDENT TAKES POWER IN ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Just hours after overthrowing Ecuador's
president, leaders of a military-backed coup stepped down on
Saturday, paving the way for Vice President Gustavo Noboa to take
power.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa assumed the presidency at dawn to become Ecuador's third
head of state in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Noboa, a bearded, 62-year-old lawyer and former
state governor, was heralded as a democratic outcome to the ouster
of President Jamil Mahuad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself with the unavoidable obligation to assume the
presidency,'' said Noboa, who is slated to finish Mahuad's
four-year term. ``I am sure that the vast majority of Ecuadoreans
will support my government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who served just 17 months, fled the presidential palace
on Friday after protesters stormed government buildings in Quito
and top military officers demanded that he resign.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the armed forces endorsed Noboa, it was unclear
whether the new president would win over the public or whether he
could end months of political and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, protesters complained that they had been used by the
military. Once Mahuad was ousted, they said their demands for a
populist government to rule on behalf of the poor were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Noboa said Saturday that he would follow many of
Mahuad's free-market economic policies, including a controversial
plan to scrap the local currency for the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel betrayed,'' said Segundo Jami, a Quichua Indian who
took part in Friday's uprising. He supported the short-lived junta,
which included a prominent indigenous rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   After spending Friday night at a military base and at the
Chilean Embassy in Quito, Mahaud surfaced on Saturday. He said he
had been tricked into leaving the presidential palace by military
guards who said they could no longer protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave the seat of power, you're finished,'' said
former President Leon Febres Cordero. ``No one recognizes you
anymore, not even hungry dogs in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address, Mahuad acknowledged that he had lost
power and would support Noboa. ``I will not stand in the way of
Gustavo Noboa I wish him the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials continued to monitor developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we regret the circumstances that led President Mahuad to
call for public support for a Noboa presidency, this statement is a
magnanimous gesture to pave the way to restore the country to
constitutional order,'' said a State Department communique.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis took hold on Friday as thousands of mostly Indian
demonstrators occupied the empty Congress and Supreme Court
buildings to decry Mahuad's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   They were later joined by scores of mid-level army officers, who
had been conspiring with Indian leaders for two weeks, according to
the Quito newspaper El Comercio.
</P>
<P>
   With Mahuad on the run, the demonstrators announced the
formation of a three-man ruling junta led by Defense Minister Gen.
Carlos Mendoza. But the putsch was strongly denounced throughout
the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with Gen. Mendoza, Peter Romero, the
U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for western hemispheric
affairs, warned that the coup was unacceptable and would lead to
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messages were pouring in from all over the region,'' said a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mendoza resigned at 3 a.m. on Saturday, just four hours
after forming the junta. The two other junta members leaders,
former Supreme Court president Carlos Solorzano and Indian leader
Antonio Vargas, protested the decision but eventually left the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gen. Mendoza justified the coup as a temporary measure to
avoid violence. ``There could have been conflict and bloodshed. It
required an immediate response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the uprising stained the Ecuadorean armed forces,
which had been admired for its support for democracy in a nation
that often seems to have a revolving door at the presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has set the armed forces back 100 years,'' said former
Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo. At least one coup plotter,
army Col. Lucio Gutierrez, was jailed on Saturday. The Congress
held an emergency session to ratify Noboa's presidency and denounce
the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many lawmakers were pleased to see Mahuad go _ a turn of
events made possible by the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated lawyer, was elected in July 1998. But
he inherited an economic mess that grew worse during his 17 months
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, inflation hit 61 percent and the economy shrunk by
7.5 percent. Bank deposits were temporarily frozen during a
financial sector crisis and Ecuador became the first nation to
default on its Brady Bond debt.
</P>
<P>
   Governing Ecuador may prove almost as difficult for Noboa.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny nation of 12 million is deeply divided along racial,
social, and even geographic lines. That makes reaching a political
consensus extremely difficult. Indeed, most of Mahuad's initiatives
to jump-start the economy were blocked by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mahuad urged Ecuadoreans to cut the new president
more slack. Noboa ``needs the backing of the entire country,'' he
said. ``That's something I always asked for but rarely received.''

CUBAN PARENTS CHOSE FREEDOM FOR THEIR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 FAMILY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISETTE GARCIA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roland Sabates and his sister Gladys Sabates Mabry can't imagine
sending their children away for the sake of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the choice their parents made 39 years ago. After
Cuban President Fidel Castro took over that country, children were
being sent to communist indoctrination camps. The Sabates managed
to slip five of their 10 children out of Cuba through Operation
Pedro Pan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabates children were among 14,048 who made the journey.
Eight thousand never saw their parents again.
</P>
<P>
   Sabates and Mabry ended up in Kansas City. And, while they don't
dwell on the odyssey that brought them to the United States,
memories are flooding back because of a refugee in similar straits:
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother was bringing her son to freedom in November when
their boat capsized. She and 10 other passengers drowned. Elian was
one of three survivors. Now, U.S. officials plan to send him to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sabates and his sister see Elian's rescue as miraculous. And
although not all Americans agree, they think his return would make
a mockery of the mother's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, the Sabateses have come to appreciate how much love
and faith it took for their parents to send them away alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I had children of my own that I understood,''
said Sabates, 50, sitting with his sister in the lobby of his
business, the State Line Eye Care Center Optical in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   His sister caressed his arm and considered her own children, 13
and 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it hits you. And it hurts,'' said Mabry, 48.
``Imagine you have a nice home, you live well in Cuba. Well, my
parents risked never seeing us again to make sure we would know
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sabates is the father of three teen-age sons and an
ophthalmologist who operates five eye clinics, a chic restaurant
and a modest real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have the life I have today if they hadn't sent
me,'' said Sabates, of Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry, of Leawood, Kan., is an interpreter to the poor and a
part-time Spanish teacher at Cure of Ars School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950s Cuba, the Sabates family enjoyed an upper middle-class
lifestyle built on their family trades of jewels and optics.
Sabates and Mabry were the third and fourth children of the 10 born
to Enrique and Irma Sabates.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather proudly paraded them in matching pinafores
during festivals in their city of Camaguey. They were known for
slicked-down 'dos, hair restrained with ``Gomina,'' or styling gel.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Castro's successful coup in 1959, the government
seized the Sabates' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Money wasn't all they lost. Besides banishing class differences,
Castro eradicated the religious leadership. When nuns and priests
were expelled from the educational system in 1960, Sabates and
Mabry lost their teachers. Parochial schools were commandeered by
the state and converted into Marxist-Leninist indoctrination
centers. Churches became barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children were being taken away to rural camps for a literacy
campaign, and when they came back at the end of the summer and the
stories of promiscuity among all the kids got out, parents began to
look for ways to seek a safe haven from that,'' said retired
Monsignor Bryan Walsh of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the U.S. State Department, Walsh started
Operation Pedro Pan, or Peter Pan, named after the Disney character
who spirited children away to Never-Never Land.
</P>
<P>
   The program provided travel and lodging in the United States for
children ages 6 to 16. He covertly disbursed visa waivers _ special
travel permits _ through sympathetic diplomats traveling to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest Sabates children, Mimi and Enrique, fled together
in September 1961. Mabry's visa came on her 10th birthday. She was
tempted to turn it down, she said, because she thought her older
brother Roland was entitled to go first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we knew if I didn't take it, I might never get another
chance,'' Mabry said.
</P>
<P>
   She and a cousin flew out of Rancho Boyeros airport on Dec. 7.
Mabry remembers trying to calm her crying cousin as they waited for
a plane that seemed as if it would never come.
</P>
<P>
   She also remembers her mother signaling through the glass walls
of the ``fish tank,'' an enclosure for departing passengers whom
guards already had frisked, and removed their hidden valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Sabates gestured to her 10-year-old to twist the solitaire
on her finger so it wouldn't be detected beneath the girl's white
crocheted gloves. The ring might be needed to hock later.
</P>
<P>
   Sabates followed his sister in February, and the fifth child,
Maria Victoria, left in April 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The five Sabates children who came through Pedro Pan lived just
blocks apart at three homes in Los Alamos, N.M. Their sponsors were
government scientists working at area atomic labs. The children
visited one another often.
</P>
<P>
   Although the siblings wanted for nothing materially, life in the
United States wasn't easy, Sabates said. The weather was terribly
cold compared with their tropical upbringing. They had never before
done chores. No one in the town spoke Spanish. Shrill TV broadcasts
of the missile crisis in October 1962 declared Cubans the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Flights from Cuba stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry worried that her parents and remaining five siblings
wouldn't make it out. She feared she would be shipped back. The
foster families assured the children they could stay as long as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, relatives made it out of Cuba and took the
children in until their parents could come.
</P>
<P>
   They settled in North Carolina, close to the labs of the
American Optical Co. The family used connections at American
Optical to get jobs crafting eyeglass and camera lenses. Until they
could obtain U.S. optometric licenses, those were the best jobs
available.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Enrique, Irma and the five youngest Sabates children
_ Manuel, Reynaldo, Liliam, Hector and Rebeca _ were supposed to
join the growing group in the Carolinas. It almost didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   As the seven remaining Sabateses waited for a 2 a.m. flight in
1966, the military police nabbed Irma Sabates for questioning. She
had closed a bank account just days before the family's departure.
Government officials wanted the money. She had already given it
away to relatives. She wept as she and her five children left her
husband behind to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to fly out the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Matriarch Irma Sabates describes the setback with amusement now
and invokes the words of her husband, who died of cancer 14 years
ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to tell me, `Don't worry. We're lucky. Everything's
always turned out well for us.' And, truly, everything has,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in North Carolina, the Sabateses and their 10
children moved to Kansas City to join another relative with an
established eye-care practice. The Sabates brothers and sisters
studied at local universities and earned degrees, and some
eventually moved to places such as Dallas, St. Louis and Madison,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabates clan of 52 is close despite the distance imposed by
their careers. Plans to reunite in February for a niece's wedding
in Coral Gables, Fla., have the phone lines buzzing again.
</P>
<P>
   With their children's growing interest in their heritage,
Sabates and Mabry have been forced lately to recall more details of
what they gave up. But even if they could return to a Cuba ruled by
democracy, they said they wouldn't. Their lives are American
``through and through,'' despite lingering nostalgia for their
former homeland.
</P>
<P>
   And if the family matriarch ever harbored dreams of returning,
she won't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always simply prayed that my Heavenly Father would let me
watch my children grow and establish their lives,'' said Irma
Sabates, 74, in her Mission Hills Home. ``They've done that. Each
found an excellent mate and is happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other thing I asked was to die before my husband and
children. Enrique is gone, so that wasn't meant to be. I hope my
children don't precede me too. To lose them again would be a pain I
couldn't bear.''

REVIVING MEMORIES OF A ONCE-FAMOUS KANSAN 
</HEADLINE>
 MEMORIAL-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT SCOTT, Kan. _ A mammoth tombstone in Section 14 of
Evergreen Cemetery marks the grave of John Lawrence Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   Polished gray granite, the tombstone appears almost new,
although Caldwell died more than 77 years ago in Washington, D.C.
At his burial Dec. 10, 1922, a seemingly endless cortege of
hundreds upon hundreds of mourners trekked the two miles to the
cemetery after services at the Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new governor-elect of Kansas, Jonathan M. Davis, was
there, a fact noted under the large black headlines reporting the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, 47 years old and dead of ``toxic depression of the
heart'' (probably a strep throat infection that affected his
cardiovascular system), was likely the most famous man in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He should have been. He was a local boy who became a teacher,
then vaulted into the rarefied air of state politics and power with
his election to the Kansas Senate at the age of 24 in 1899. Leaving
the Senate in 1903, he became the county attorney of Bourbon County
and cleaned up Fort Scott, a wild and woolly railroad town. So
Caldwell was a consequential man.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more. In 1914, the new Democratic president,
Woodrow Wilson, appointed Caldwell ``minister plenipotentiary to
Persia.'' The appointment was apparently a reward for Caldwell's
help in 1912 in delivering Kansas' presidential electoral votes to
Wilson, electing five Democrats to the state's congressional
delegation, sending a Democratic U.S. senator to Washington and
putting both houses of the state legislature into the Democratic
fold.
</P>
<P>
   That appointment thrust Caldwell, 39, into the frenetic tumult
of central Asia _ the death throes of the Ottoman Empire; the Brest
Litovsk treaty; the desert clans' emerging tribal enmities; the
rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi, founder of modern Iran; and even the
periphery of what was called ``The Great Game'' in which Europe and
czarist Russia jockeyed for dominance over an area that geologists
even then knew cloaked an ocean of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But the job _ he was called minister because ambassador hadn't
come into vogue _ basically was one any Kansas politician would be
familiar with, dealing with people and their problems. Caldwell
apparently was good at taking care of the small American community
and the salesmen, traders, missionaries and the occasional traveler
who came to his office in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell was in Persia from 1914 to 1922.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chaotic period,'' said Rouhollah Ramazani, professor
of government and foreign affairs at the University of Virginia at
Charlottesville and author of the classic study ``Foreign Affairs
of Iran: A Developing Nation in World Affairs, 1500-1941.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But at that time Americans were the darlings of Iran. They saw
in Americans people who could help them reform their economy and
finances and enter the modern world. America, in turn, saw a
strategic land between Asia and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   What Caldwell saw firsthand, said Arnold Schofield, the
historian at the Fort Scott National Historic Site, must have been
much like what most know from the 1962 movie ``Lawrence of Arabia''
_ the trackless sand, the endless vistas, the chimera of colors,
and people living as they had for millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Yet who remembered John Lawrence Caldwell?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, really,'' Schofield said. ``It was as if his grave not
only swallowed him, but any memory of him was somehow erased. Even
with that huge marker, I'll bet almost nobody in this county knew
who was under it. There's no mention of anything he did on his
tombstone. He was just forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently. A few weeks ago Glenda Wolf, who, along with her
husband, Ronnie, and their kids, lives east of here, approached
Schofield after services at the little Diamond community church.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda had an ``obituary box'' left to her by her mother-in-law,
Leila Howard Wolf. Inside were all sorts of papers and newspaper
clippings. Among these were news stories about the death of
Caldwell, a distant cousin of Leila Wolf and thus Ronnie, and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes were made of beautiful paper, bore strange-looking
stamps and were embossed with ``Legation of the United States of
America.'' On the back of the envelopes were gorgeous red wax
seals.
</P>
<P>
   Did Schofield know anything about such envelopes? Would he like
to read the letters? Had he ever heard of Caldwell?
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said no, the name wasn't familiar to him, but he'd ask
around. He called Fred Campbell and Don Miller, two local
historians.
</P>
<P>
   Nosing around, Schofield, Miller and Campbell checked Evergreen
Cemetery. There, in one of the highest parts of the burying ground,
was the big stone, the name Caldwell spelled out in script on one
side, odd in that no other marker has such writing. The birth and
death dates were in block letters on the other side and matched the
dates in the newspaper obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery employees said that to their knowledge, the grave had
never been decorated. Nor could they remember anyone visiting it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a stone marking the graves of T.A. and Mary Caldwell,
who are either Caldwell's parents or aunt and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   There is no grave for Caldwell's wife, Evelyne, nor his three
children, all nearing adulthood when he died. Schofield wonders if
the wife remarried, being relatively young, and perhaps the
children went their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were living in Washington, where he'd joined a law
firm,'' Schofield said. ``Why come back to Fort Scott?''
</P>
<P>
   The Caldwell letters are chatty, telling of mountain climbing,
boar hunting, the kindness of the Persian people, the exotic sight
of a camel being sacrificed during a feast day, and his problems
getting his Hupmobile motor car shipped into the country. Plus the
quality of Persian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Caldwell wrote about world affairs. In November
1915, he reflected that ``the recent demands made on China by Japan
will probably prove the salvation of China by awakening her; and
when she does awake, watch out for the slumbering giant, both
physically and mentally!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walsh of the National Archives in College Park, Md., says
the repository holds Caldwell's State Department papers. They run,
he says, to more than 750 pages of letters, telegrams, reports and
files.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those documents, Walsh notes, were complaints _ one about
Caldwell's habit of calling just about everybody ``buddy,'' and
about him using his knife as a combination spoon and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Ramazani thinks Caldwell probably did very well as minister.
Otherwise he wouldn't have lasted in the job, which was essentially
a patronage position.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Ramazani said, one of the jobs Caldwell probably
facilitated was selling oil to the Persians. Despite swimming in
crude oil, Persians found it all but useless. Needed were the
refined products such as gasoline and motor oil that came from
America and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Selling oil to the Middle East? Or coal to Newcastle? One
imagines that the boy raised in the hardscrabble Drywood community
and who as a man became a consummate politician probably never even
gave that incongruity a second thought.

LEARNING TO LIVE DRUG-FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Tommy Sapien was an altar boy who sold drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But he had his limits: He wouldn't sell at school or on church
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know God sees you everywhere, but if I sold them there, I
would go to hell for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tommy would walk down the street and find some other kids to
sell to, little kids who would give him $1 for a reefer.
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy is 16 now, and he's clean for the first time in years.
He's been through nine months of drug counseling, group therapy and
drug testing after being arrested for possessing drugs and a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from juvenile drug court earlier this month, and
he's working on his GED at Rio Salado Community College and
thinking about learning a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors suggested that Tommy try food preparation or machine
operation. He may, but it doesn't sound very exciting to a kid who
used to carry around two phones and a pager, made hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of dollars a week and bought his girlfriends
expensive gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is Tommy liked being a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the way people look at you, like you have money.
Mostly the girls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked having a lawyer call me (to buy). People would like to
see me show up. I was somebody. I think I was more addicted to
selling the drugs than to taking them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took plenty.
</P>
<P>
   His system was so full of drugs that it was six months before he
could pass a drug test after his arrest. It took that long for the
drugs to clear his system. &QL; 
GETTING THE HABIT
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many kids who use drugs, Tommy didn't come from a poor or
broken home, or one where the parents used drugs. His mother is a
legal secretary; his father is a construction foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy didn't need drugs to escape from a tough life. Drugs just
seeped into his life and took over.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in fifth grade, he bought a marijuana joint with $2
in lunch money from an elementary school friend whose parents sold
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it in the movies,'' he said. ``I saw it in a friend's
house. I heard stories about how it made you feel like you were
floating.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked that feeling, so he bought more. Soon, he was
encouraging his friends to try it. Dealers began calling him and
asking if he wanted in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole group was following me. I was the leader,'' he said.
``It made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy sold drugs through seventh and eighth grades while
attending a Catholic school, and he continued selling through a
quick succession of high schools: Tolleson, Peoria, West Phoenix
and North.
</P>
<P>
   He hid cocaine in his bedroom and buried a huge stash of
marijuana under the floor so his parents wouldn't smell it.
</P>
<P>
   The day he graduated from his school's Drug Abuse Resistance and
Education program, he was using and dealing drugs. He and his
friends thought DARE was a big joke.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said they noticed changes in their son. But for
three years, they couldn't admit to themselves that he had a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   They did suspect that his friends were gang members and drug
users, so they decided to enroll Tommy in a Catholic junior high
school, thinking he'd be safe there.
</P>
<P>
   When they got several anonymous calls saying, ``Your son is
selling drugs to my son,'' they told themselves it couldn't be
true. Tommy was playing sports and couldn't be high, they
rationalized. Tommy is smarter than that, they thought.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was in the ninth grade, Tommy was constantly high
or drunk, and almost always in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely went to class, and he failed every subject. In two
years of high school, he earned no academic credits.
</P>
<P>
   One day, in the fall of his freshman year, his parents found him
passed out in his bedroom. They couldn't deny the truth any longer:
Tommy needed help.
</P>
<P>
   They put him into a 30-day detox program at Charter Hospital in
Phoenix. They were lucky; they had health insurance that covered
residential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Tommy was far from ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and I had this joke that rehab was for quitters,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On visiting days, his mom and dad went to see him. His mother
did the talking; his dad just looked at him with a hurt expression.
</P>
<P>
   His mother attended family therapy sessions with Tommy. She
cried when she learned that he had tried every drug but heroin. He
was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen days into the program, Tommy had cold sweats, shakes and
nausea. He couldn't sleep. His mother wouldn't OK any medications
to make the withdrawal easier; she wanted him to feel the pain so
he wouldn't try drugs again.
</P>
<P>
   She thought the nightmare would end when Tommy completed the
program. She thought she'd have her son back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth?'' Tommy said. ``I was looking for the next high.'' &QL; 
DEALING IN TREATMENT &QL; 
When Tommy left the hospital, he went into Pathways, a private
after-care program for teenagers who are addicts. The teens live at
home or in halfway houses, get counseling and go to a Pathways
school.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were told not to worry about him because he would be
around ``kids who were also trying to stay sober _ they would help
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what Tommy discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more drugs in Pathways than I ever imagined,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He got in on the action, selling LSD, PCP and other
hallucinogenics to other kids there. And he picked up a new
addiction, cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of weeks, he had been caught twice using and dealing
and got kicked out of the program.
</P>
<P>
   So, he went back to a public high school, where, he said, the
demand for drugs was high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made so much money. One day I made $2,000, and, over a
two-week period, $4,000 or $5,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a lot of it on girls. Some were drawn to him, but
others wouldn't have anything to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One girl told me I was ugly,'' he said. ``Not because of my
looks, but because of my attitude. I thought about it, but not
enough to change who I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy bought his drugs from an older guy who got his supply from
Mexico or South America, Tommy isn't sure which.
</P>
<P>
   He would give his supplier proceeds from the sales as he made
them. Then he would get his share back, usually $4,000 or $5,000
for every $20,000 in sales. &QL; 
ARREST CHANGES THINGS
</P>
<P>
   Tommy said he always took along a gun, usually his dad's, when
he picked up drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, on a run to get a supply of drugs, he and a
friend were arrested in Glendale near Bethany Home Road and 61st
Avenue. He had his dad's gun with him and about 20 grams of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Until that day, 15-year-old Tommy had been arrested only for
breaking curfew. He now faced a Class 6 felony for possession of a
firearm, a Class 5 felony for possession of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia, as well as three misdemeanors, including curfew
violation and carrying a gun without a license.
</P>
<P>
   When the police called his home from the precinct station to say
that he could be bailed out, his mom told police to take her only
child to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The police tried to tell her that he was cooperative during the
arrest and could be bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take him,'' she said in tears.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next few weeks in the Durango Juvenile Detention
Center in southwest Phoenix, then was placed under house arrest at
home.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't leave the house, but he still managed to sell drugs
and get high. He would go out to the side yard, where drugs would
be dropped off; then teenagers would stop by the house to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had too much time on my hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his probation, Tommy was in the non-profit TASC
(Treatment Assessment Screening Center) program where he had to
attend counseling and have drug tests three times a week. After a
couple of months of failing tests, he was charged with violating
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year he was placed in the HIP, or High Impact
Program, run through the Durango Jail, which includes a tough
regimen of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take you running until you get sick, and you're detoxing
at the same time,'' Tommy said.
</P>
<P>
   When the five-day program was over, an exhausted Tommy was
released and put on a waiting list for the Maricopa County's
Juvenile Drug Court, one of three now operating in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The drug court has become a model for other programs across the
country. Judge John Foreman, who started the program, has seen it
change teens' fates. One of three addicts who graduate relapses,
but that still leaves two others who haven't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teens, often accompanied by parents, report once a week to
court, attend counseling and do community service. If they don't,
there are swift and tough penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But when a probation officer came to his house to interview
Tommy for the program, he was high.
</P>
<P>
   The drug court turned him down. But Missy Becker, juvenile
services administrator at TASC, fought to get him in. He had an
``attitude'' and was a troublemaker in group counseling sessions,
but she believed in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was honest about his drug use and eventually about his
hopelessness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy got into the program, but his troubles weren't over.
</P>
<P>
   When he made his first appearance last spring before Judge
Foreman, Tommy lied and said he was straight. Foreman ordered a
drug test on him, then placed him in detention for the weekend when
it came back dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy was so high that the levels were off the scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed and proud that the levels were so high,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither did he want to be sent to the Arizona Juvenile
Department of Corrections, where he would be locked up until he was
18.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, the level of drugs in Tommy's system began to
drop. By September, he was clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy, even now. There are always cravings,'' he said,
both for drugs and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made so much money, too much money,'' he added, playing with
a gold chain his mother bought for him because he can no longer
afford to buy things like that on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy has slipped since beginning his rehabilitation last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he went out with friends for the evening, sipped iced
orange juice, then felt the urge for a beer. He dropped his friends
off at home, then went to a liquor store. He drank a beer, then
went on a drag race down McDowell Road. For a moment, it reminded
him of the excitement of his earlier days.
</P>
<P>
   Then he saw a policeman's red light behind him. He was caught.
</P>
<P>
   The breath test showed a trace of alcohol in his bloodstream.
His parents were livid. His father kicked him out for the night.
</P>
<P>
   He walked across the street and sat on a bus bench and thought
about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, he would have gone out and gotten high.
But he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he went back home.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, as part of his DUI class, he saw a grisly movie
about drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sunk in what could have happened if I had hit someone. It
kept pushing me to sobriety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy insists that he won't slip again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people who want to see me succeed. I don't
want to let them down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still gets calls from teenagers who want to buy. He tells
them, ``I don't deal with that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He's thinking about his future, and he has some advice for
parents willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to be busy,'' he said. ``Keep them involved in
sports, community service or church. Drugs are everywhere.'' &QL;

Nebraska roots kept Osborne from being persuaded
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
and DAVID BARRON &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Late last year, Nebraska coaching icon Tom Osborne traveled to the
University of Houston to spend a day evaluating the UH football
program as a favor to two old friends working in the school's
athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who retired after the 1997 season, came to Houston
intending only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the UH
program and help guide the university in its effort to hire a
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   He left thinking the best man for the job might be himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Chronicle, Osborne confirmed he
briefly considered a return to coaching as Kim Helton's successor
at UH before deciding against it, primarily because of concerns
about uprooting from his Lincoln, Neb., home.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, 62, said he considered taking the job after the notion
was presented to him during his visit to Houston _ labeled a
consulting trip _ by UH athletic director Chet Gladchuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our original conversations really had to do with, `What can I
do to help you figure this (improving the UH program) out?'''
Osborne said, ``and, in the process, Chet mentioned to me they
would like to have me consider the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss coaching. It (coming out of retirement) has crossed my
mind from time to time. So I did give it some thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said several factors made the job attractive to him _
the way in which Gladchuk and other UH administrators presented
themselves, the quality of the school's office and training
facilities, the number and quality of players in the Houston area
and the tradition remaining from the Bill Yeoman and Jack Pardee
eras.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said he also liked the idea of rebuilding a program that
had leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, he said, he and his wife, Nancy, were reluctant
to move away from their children and grandchildren, all of whom
reside in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was family considerations,'' he said when asked
why he did not take the job. ``I've got all my children and
grandchildren up here. And I thought it might be a little unfair to
Nancy at this point to ask her to move away from Lincoln. She's
been through 25 years as a head coach's wife. It's asking a lot at
this stage in our lives to uproot, and it (the idea of moving) was
really going down kind of hard with my grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested and flattered that anybody would even
consider us, but I think essentially it was mostly family
considerations that made it difficult (to come to UH).''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was Nebraska's head coach for 25 years, winning 255
games, 13 conference titles and three national championships. He
went out in a blaze of glory in the 1998 Orange Bowl, where the
Cornhuskers defeated Tennessee to earn a share of the '97 national
title with Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   When Osborne announced his retirement, he cited the desire to
spend more time with his family and concerns about his health. He
had double heart-bypass surgery in 1985 and was hospitalized with
an irregular heartbeat in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne teaches two classes at Nebraska and makes numerous
appearances as a public speaker. He also heads a statewide
mentoring program called Teammates, which matches adults with
youngsters lacking stability in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Although his days are full, he has found himself missing
football and the life he used to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this (year) was harder than the first year, and I
think Chet caught me at a little bit of a vulnerable moment because
of it,'' he said. ``I don't think either one of us, when we started
out, had anything in mind about me going down there (as UH coach).
But as time went on, he said, `Well, how about you?' and I thought,
`Well, this is kind of interesting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said he sought Osborne's input during the coaching
search because the former Nebraska coach knows what it takes to be
successful at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne has ties to UH through Chris Bahl, a former Nebraska
athletic department employee who is UH's associate athletic
director for external affairs, and Bill Doleman, a former host of
Osborne's television show who does television play-by-play for UH
football and basketball and hosts the UH coaches show on KTBU
(Channel 55).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my ideas as to what this program is about and what we
need to do to be a UT, a Penn State,'' Gladchuk said. ``However, I
thought it was important to bring in somebody who had been at the
top and could bring a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne agreed to serve as an unpaid consultant and was on the
UH campus Nov. 29. He met with coaches and athletic administrators
as well as Arthur K. Smith, UH president and system chancellor.
Osborne's wife accompanied him on the trip and spent the day with
Gladchuk's wife, Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said he broached the subject of Osborne taking the job
as the two chatted in a conference room late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Osborne) said to me, `I'm really enjoying being here
today. I really enjoy being back around football,''' Gladchuk said.
``I said, `I understand. Have you ever thought about coming back?'
He said, `No, because I've been away from it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, why don't you think about it. Give me a call.
Let me know if you have any interest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk said Osborne agreed to give the matter some thought
after returning to Nebraska but subsequently thought the job should
go to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing was he didn't think he could deal with seven,
eight wins a year,'' Gladchuk said. ``Then he said something about
how his family would have absolutely no interest in moving. And the
third thing he said was he had talked to his doctor and the doctor
thought, with the stress and everything else, he'd be on the
operating table in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne detailed his thoughts regarding the UH football program
in a letter faxed to Gladchuk on Dec. 3. The letter, provided to
the Chronicle by the university in response to a request under the
Texas Open Records Act, indicates Osborne was considering the UH
job at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding the letter, Osborne wrote: ``I have been in touch
with the doctor who just returned from Germany. He wants to examine
my records and will contact me Saturday night (Dec. 4). He is a
medical person in whom I have great confidence. I should be
prepared to discuss things with you Sunday afternoon. Thank you for
your interest and your friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne told the Chronicle his health is better than it was two
years ago and probably would not preclude him from coaching again.
The main impediment, he said, is the one that caused him to say no
to UH _ his family.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider another opportunity if it arose,
Osborne said: ``You never say never, because maybe three months,
six months from now something could happen where I might be
compelled to take a job. I'm not going to come out flatly and say
I'll never coach again, but I think the odds of me doing so are
very, very slim _ maybe the 5 percent range. I doubt it would
happen, and, basically, it has to do with family, those kind of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good career. Now I'm focusing on other things. I do at
times miss coaching very much, particularly during the season and
particularly on game days. But I knew that would happen. It happens
to just about everybody.''

INTEREST IN IOWA CAUCUSES NOT GENERATING MUCH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(DES MOINES, Iowa) _ In the good old days, politically speaking,
you could count on the Iowa caucuses for some high political drama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition roared into a
strong second-place finish ahead of Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pat Buchanan nearly defeated Bob Dole here, then went
on to upset him in New Hampshire, stopping Dole's momentum and
raising doubts about the strength of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2000 Iowa caucuses, the first presidential contest of
the new millennium, has set off few fireworks. The only surprise
appears to be Alan Keyes, whose passionate oratory is attracting
hundreds to his campaign rallies and pushed him into third place in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates make their last pass on the campaign trail
here before Monday night's con test, most campaign aides are
expecting a low turnout and have been forced to talk more about
where they might finish in the polls than about big-ticket campaign
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the candidates' decision to focus on New Hamp shire
or the humming economy, or even the sapping influence of last
summer's Iowa Straw Poll, campaign observers said the Iowa caucuses
could turn out to be the crop that didn't come in. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`FEELS LIKE IT'S OVER' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The caucuses are more prologue to the rest of the campaign
because the significant challenge to the front-runners are not
being made in Iowa but in New Hampshire,'' said Dennis Goldford, a
political scientist at Drake University. ``And I think the (Iowa)
Straw Poll took a little bit of the wind out of the caucus sails
because a lot of the winnowing was accomplished there. The real
heavyweight alternatives to Bush are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's all over,'' agreed Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont University in California, who flew
into Des Moines to do television analysis on Friday. ``For one
reason or another, the excitement isn't there, and the interest
isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa GOP officials denied there is a lackadaisical feel to the
campaign and said the August Straw Poll, even though it may have
pared down the field, hasn't dampened public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party,
anticipates that 100,000 to 110,000 Iowans will attend a caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that we'll have a good turnout,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Although candidates continued to barnstorm Iowa this weekend,
most of the action was over the telephone and in restaurants and
bars, as campaign aides and supporters began the quadrennial
process of setting expectations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUSH STILL AHEAD &QL; 
In most polls, Bush still holds a commanding 20-point lead, with
Steve Forbes trailing in second and Keyes pulling ahead of Arizona
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A Research 2000 survey of 311 likely GOP voters had Bush at 43
percent, Forbes at 25 percent, and Keyes at 9 percent. McCain and
Gary Bauer had 7 percent each. The poll had a margin of error of
plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   When they are asked where they will finish, almost everyone aims
low. Bush aides said they would be happy with 37 percent. Forbes'
team said 25 percent would be fine. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said he
needed a fourth-place finish or better. And McCain, who has largely
bypassed Iowa in favor of campaigning in New Hampshire, said a few
ticks above zero would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to lower the bar that he's got to pass over in
order for believing that they succeeded,'' Goldford said. ``Right
now, everybody is jockeying for position.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's team has set the bar about as low as it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple of cooks at the A1 Steakhouse are supporting
us,'' joked Mike Murphy, McCain's media consultant by telephone
from Greenville, S.C. ``But seriously - it ain't our show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not contesting Iowa. We have no expectations because we
have no organizational effort there.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
KEYES POISED FOR THIRD &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nevertheless, some observers said a fourth-place finish could hurt
McCain, who hasn't stayed away from Iowa entirely and whose surging
campaign in New Hampshire has raised expectations for him
everywhere else. At one time, many believed McCain could finish
third even without launching a full-scale campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has shown up, and there has always been in the back of
peoples' minds that it would be his place to pull off a third-place
surprise,'' said Bebitch Jeffe, of Claremont University.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is Keyes who is poised to fill the third slot.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes officials have grown increasingly confident of their
chances, citing the social conservative's strong performance in the
presidential debates and one poll that had him breaking into double
digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost a magic number there when you break out of the
single digits,'' said Sydney Hoff Hay, Keyes' national consultant.
``We sense there is something happening, and it gives us great
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay attributed most of the progress to Keyes' performance
in the GOP debates, which have allowed Keyes to showcase his fiery
oratory. And she said the buzz has allowed Keyes to raise money for
Iowa television ads and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates really have been a godsend,'' Hoff Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are highest for Bush, the front-runner who must prove
for the first time whether he deserves that title. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEETINGS HELD AT NIGHT &QL; 
``If Bush were to get out of here with 59 percent or better, that
shows him strong, and he's ready to face the McCain challenge,''
Goldford said. ``It shows he has substantially increased his
support from the Straw Poll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses, which are really meetings held at night at
more than 2,000 precincts statewide, require organizational muscle
and often turn into a contest of who can entice the most voters out
into the cold January weather.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Forbes have invested heavily in ground troops,
promising to have at least one caucus captain at each location.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldford, anything less than 40 percent for Bush
would ``show a significant lack of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what Bush's aides have been saying. For months, they
have been drilling home their view with reporters that 37 percent
will be just fine, noting that that is the largest number any
candidate has ever received in a contested Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to meet or exceed that record,'' said Ari
Fleisher, Bush's spokesman. &QL; 
LOWERING EXPECTATIONS &QL; 
Nonsense, said Goldford and others. After all, in 1988, Dole was
competing against a relatively evenly stacked field. This year,
Bush has outspent most of his competitors by a wide margin and is
way ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are low-balling,'' Goldford said. ``The Bush people say
that should be the mark, but 1988 was a much more level playing
field with multiple candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Further seeking to lower expectations, the Bush campaign is
making it known that the traditional bounce out of Iowa goes to the
second-place finisher _ in this case, possibly Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the polls tell you you are in first place, if you
don't look carefully over your shoulder at who is in second, you're
not doing your job right,'' Fleisher said. ``Steve Forbes is in
second place, and we've got our eye on Steve Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes aides accused Bush of trying to tamp down expectations
even as they hold their own hopes down to 25 percent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BETTER THAN 50 PERCENT? &QL; 
``In our view, Bush has got to get north of 50 percent,'' said Bill
Dal Col, Forbes campaign manager. ``If he's under 50, he's got to
explain why.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said 25 percent is a legitimate number for Forbes
because it matches his position in most polls. It's also what
Forbes managed to score during the summer Straw Poll. But some
expect Forbes to exceed that number because he has spent lavishly
on a sophisticated effort to turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just get a decent bump out of here, it's a whole new
world in New Hampshire,'' Dal Col said. &QL;

SPURS BEAT KNICKS, 96-83  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It was just the vision of the demure Tim Duncan
slipping into his invincible skin, and all of the Knicks' leftover
anxieties and insecurities were unearthed like a flashback triggers
sweaty palms.
</P>
<P>
   It was late June all over again. And the inclusion of Patrick
Ewing did not matter. The more Duncan began to pull bank shots out
of his holster and wear a path to the free-throw line, the more he
devastated double teams with a pass for an assist and popped up
like a roadblock to slay their layups, the more the Knicks let
their frustration bubble to the surface and ruin their chance to
find a sliver of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the three first-half technical fouls that undid
the Knicks, it was their panic in the third quarter that showed
just how undisciplined they become when a player like Duncan tap
dances on their psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the finals, when the Spurs took the title by four
games to one, Duncan unsettled the Knicks with his 33 points, 15
rebounds and 4 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Spurs' convincing 96-83 victory, Duncan loped
across the floor as the dispirited Knicks experienced the deja vu
of leaving the Alamodome. All of the momentum the Knicks had had
after strolling through the East the last month was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a setback,'' said Larry Johnson, who tried in vain to
guard Duncan, and left with 10 points and one technical foul.
``It's easy and quick in this league. We could have made a big
statement tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead they walked out without even threatening the Spurs. And
this time, Ewing shuffled out with them. Even with his size inside
and his jumper on the outskirts, he could not make the difference.
What started out as an impact game for Ewing _ he had 12 first-half
points _ ended when his teammates began launching shots from the
perimeter in their frantic third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ewing was double-teamed on occasion, the Knicks did not
stop long enough to look inside or set up a smart shot. In their
haste, they turned the ball over five times, made just 5 of 18
field-goal attempts and were helpless to prevent Duncan from
scoring 11 points. None of the Knicks go-to men had anything going.
Allan Houston, who missed some open shots and forced others, was 1
for 4 in the quarter. Latrell Sprewell, who was doubled and
harassed by Mario Elie, was 0 for 2, and Marcus Camby, who picked
up charging fouls by the handful, was 0 for 2. Almost a bystander
to the chaos, Ewing didn't take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we held our poise very well,'' Coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ``We were taking one-legged, rushed shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were not even getting to the free-throw line. By the
end of the game, the Knicks had gone to the line eight times while
the Spurs had 32 free-throw attempts. If the Knicks had not had
this discrepancy so often this season, maybe it could have been
attributed to the star treatment Duncan receives. But the Knicks,
though they fumed early at the fouls, know they were beaten more by
themselves than by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with that second foul, but I shouldn't have
reacted the way I did,'' said Johnson, who was hit with a technical
with 3 minutes 57 seconds left in the first half. ``I took myself
out of this game. I should have kept my composure.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the most maddening part of it. There were times
when the Spurs would take a Knicks make out of the net, then spring
past their pedestrian defenders on their way to an easy basket. As
a result of the Knicks' lazy transition defense _ which was eaten
up by Avery Johnson's ability to push the ball _ the Spurs shot
47.9 percent against the league's best defense. For the game, the
Spurs had 21 fast-break points to the Knicks' 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``That killed us, too,'' Houston said. ``That has plagued us
this year. That's just effort, too. That's all that is. That's
disappointing when you can't even get back to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't such a bad start, though. Determined to show what the
Knicks were missing without him in the finals, Ewing waved for the
ball and took more shots in the first half than he has in most of
the games he has played since his return.
</P>
<P>
   Only once has Ewing taken more than 14 shots in a game, putting
up 16 against Detroit and 14 against the Nets in the last two
games.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Ewing was 6 for 13, leading the Knicks with
12 points and 5 rebounds. Although Ewing's defense against David
Robinson was frozen as he often stood back and dared Robinson to
hit a jumper, it worked. Robinson's indelicate outside touch left
him 3 for 8 in the first half. In many ways, Ewing saved the Knicks
from a double-digit deficit in the first half. But by the end of
the game, he was as helpless as he had been in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the double team,'' said Ewing who finished 6 for 15
with 12 points. ``We turned it into a perimeter game.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the sight of Duncan's dominance left them to
panic once again.

ISLES BEAT LIGHTNING, 2-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Before Saturday night's game against the Tampa
Bay Lightning, Islanders Coach Butch Goring said he did not have
any particular reason for giving Kevin Weekes his second straight
start in goal.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes stopped all 28 shots he faced to record his first shutout
as an Islander, and the team snapped a season-high six-game losing
streak in beating the Lightning, 2-0, before 8,399 at Nassau
Coliseum. It was Tampa Bay's fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 minutes 24 seconds left, the shutout seemed in jeopardy
when Claude Lapointe was called for hooking. Then, with 1:39 left,
Lightning Coach Steve Ludzik pulled the replacement goaltender Rich
Parent, who had come in late in the game for Kevin Hodson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders held on for their second shutout of the
season, and Weekes got his second shutout in the National Hockey
League. Weekes, 23, who was acquired by the Islanders from
Vancouver along with Bill Muckalt and Dave Scatchard on Dec. 19 in
exchange for goaltender Felix Potvin, stopped 19 shots in the
Canucks' 3-0 victory over the Rangers on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first victory at home in 2000 for the Islanders
(11-30-6), who last won at the Nassau Coliseum on Dec. 27 when they
beat the Boston Bruins, 3-0. The Islanders had been 1-11-1 after
that, including shutouts by the Devils and the Montreal Canadiens
in their last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' 144-minute-42-second scoreless streak was broken
at 7:48 of the first period, when Gino Odjick, hovering just to the
right of the crease, took a pass from Lapointe from behind the net,
beat Lightning defenseman Jassen Cullimore and flicked the puck
past Kevin Hodson on his glove side for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Odjick's fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning (11-28-6) threatened to score early in the opening
minutes of the second period when Lapointe was sent to the penalty
box for slashing at 0:13, but Ollie Jokinen made a great defensive
play to stop a sure goal.
</P>
<P>
   As the puck skittered around in front of the crease, Jokinen
back-pedaled nearly into the net next to Weekes and swatted away
Darcy Tucker's backhander in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, Mariusz Czerkawski was taken
down by Brian Muir while skating in on Hodson. But the Islanders
were unable to get off a good shot on their third power play of the
night, extending their power-play slump to 0-14.
</P>

   At 16:11, the Islanders again got a man advantage when Tucker
was called for hooking, and this time scored when Czerkawski angled
a perfect cross-ice pass to Jorgen Jonnson, who sent it past Hodson
from the bottom of the left face-off circle at 17:45 for a 2-0
lead.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 15 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE CONVERSION &LR;  By Aharon Appelfeld. Translated by Jeffrey M.
Green. Schocken, $12. In this novel about the moral education of an
apostate, a young Jewish man converts to Roman Catholicism to
advance his career as a civil servant in the waning years of the
Hapsburg empire, and learns some painful lessons in the value of
religious identity. ``Appelfeld's fiction has some of the solemn
tone of biblical parable,'' Larry Wolff wrote in The New York Times
Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CARELESS LOVE: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley &LR;  By Peter
Guralnick. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $17.95. The final installment in
the author's two-volume life follows the King from his release from
the Army in 1958 to his wretched drug-steeped demise in 1977. This
``is not simply the finest rock 'n' roll biography ever written,''
Gerald Marzorati wrote last year. ``It must be ranked among the
most ambitious and crucial biographical undertakings yet devoted to
a major American figure of the second half of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SWEET SOUL MUSIC: Rhythm and
Blues and the Southern Dream of Freedom &LR;  ($17), Guralnick's 1986
study of soul music and its gospel-based roots. ``He deftly
orchestrates interviews, research and his own impressions to convey
the emotional impact of the music and the atmosphere in which it
developed,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COUNTRY LIFE &LR;  By Rachel Cusk. Picador USA, $14. This
British parody of the country idyll, part of a rich literary genre,
features a London governess who becomes unhinged when she lands
among a family of unscrupulous tyrants in a tiny Sussex village.
The novel ``boasts pitch-perfect tonal control and humor of ... sly
subversion,'' Lisa Zeidner wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REMOTE FEED &LR;  By David Gilbert. Scribner, $12. These short
stories feature characters who seem familiar but possess an exotic,
often ridiculous individuality. Among them are a creepy self-help
guru and an ex-con who volunteers to read to a blind woman. Gilbert
``makes even the most ludicrous exchanges sound plausible,'' Adam
Goodheart wrote in 1998.

   &UR; THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD: Money's Prophets, 1798-1848 &LR;  By Niall
Ferguson. Penguin, $18.95. This account of the phenomenal rise of a
financial dynasty founded by an obscure coin dealer from Frankfurt
illuminates both European and Jewish history. ``Their enthralling
story has often been told before, but never in such authoritative
detail,'' Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BE COOL &LR;  By Elmore Leonard. Dell, $7.50. Chili Palmer, the
petty mobster turned movie producer who connived his way through
``Get Shorty,'' turns his eye to the music business in this wicked
slice of Hollywood life. ``Leonard has a nasty little habit of
dead-on accurately conveying the thought processes, if lightly and
humorously, of some seriously nasty people,'' Kinky Friedman said
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ACHIEVING OUR COUNTRY: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century
America &LR;  By Richard Rorty. Harvard University, $12.95. A
philosopher appeals to American intellectuals to abandon the
cynicism of the academic left in favor of the political ideals of
Emerson, Whitman and their allies. ``What Rorty has written _ as
deftly, amusingly and cleverly as he always writes _ is a lay
sermon for the untheological,'' Alan Ryan wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AMERICAN WAY OF DEATH REVISITED &LR;  By Jessica Mitford.
Vintage, $14. The author, who died in 1996 just before finishing
this revision of her 1963 muckraking classic, skewers the American
funeral industry and reveals the ways the profession exploits
feelings of guilt and fear. Her updated account ``is no less
startling, or entertaining, than the original,'' Judith Newman
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IOLA LEROY: Or, Shadows Uplifted &LR;  By Frances E.W. Harper.
Beacon, $13. Harper (1825-1911) was a popular black writer, speaker
and crusader for women's rights. In this 1892 novel, a young
mulatto woman raised in wealth discovers she is black when she and
her mother are sold into slavery. Reviewing an anthology of
Harper's work in 1990, James Olney said she deserves ``a central
place in a tradition of black women's writing'' from the 18th
century to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has restored to print  &UR; PLUM BUN: A Novel
Without a Moral &LR; , by Jessie Redmon Fauset ($14), in which a black
art student moves to New York and decides to pass for white, only
to learn that race isn't the only obstacle to a woman's
advancement. Her story is told ``with a simple fidelity to
character,'' The New York Times Book Review said in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHNNY'S GIRL: A Daughter's Memoir of Growing Up in Alaska's
Underworld &LR;  By Kim Rich. Alaska Northwest, $15.95. The author's
mother was a prostitute and her father a charismatic small-time
criminal in Anchorage in the 1960s, when Alaska was a wide-open
haven for scoundrels. ``This memoir poses the question `Which
offenses from our childhoods are forgivable and which ones are
not?''' Cyra McFadden wrote in 1993.

LIFETIMES OF 2 MEN FOUND IN LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Theirs is a story from a century past, an era before
the e-mailed, 15-minute world we live in now.
</P>
<P>
   For 73 years, two men sat down with paper and stamps, wrote each
other letters, and mailed them across an ocean. For 73 years, they
were pen pals.
</P>
<P>
   Their correspondence ended only in December when one of the men,
Seigo Kagawa, died at 84.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Charles Ingersoll, also 84, and Kagawa spanned war,
man walking on the moon, the birth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story that we can tell now as quaint; the story of a hole
in Ingersoll's heart, created through the U.S. mail.
</P>
<P>
   As Ingersoll, of Gold Canyon, says, ``There won't be any more
letters from Seigo.''
</P>
<P>
   The first letter was penned by Ingersoll in a Raymond, Neb.,
classroom in 1927 as part of a fifth-grade experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of pen pals, Ingersoll's class consulted a world map
and chose Waimea, Hawaii, for their packet of would-be friendships
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll's letter found Seigo Kagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my name and that I lived on a farm,'' Ingersoll
says.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, there was a letter for Ingersoll from a new
friend overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Kagawa's second letter to Ingersoll is dated Dec. 5, 1927. The
handwriting is loopy, the ink smeared and the corrections scribbled
in.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Charles,
</P>
<P>
   Did you receive my picture I send you. Will you answer my
letter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   To-day I went to see a boot-ball game. . . . We small boys play
boot-ball. It is very fine. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 2 was my birthday. I am twelve years old. On Thanksgiving
Day we ate chicken. It was very good.
</P>
<P>
   Your unseen friend,
</P>
<P>
   Seigo.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Write as soon as possible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The boys were 12, each intrigued by the slow discovery of a land
that seemed so far away. They didn't have much in common, but maybe
that was what kept them writing.
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll knew when the mailman came, and would ``hotfoot'' over
the quarter-mile trek to the edge of the farm each day to see if
there was anything for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I left disappointed,'' he says, ``but
sometimes, there was that thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll's wife, Jeanette, says Charles tingles to see the mail
come even now.
</P>
<P>
   The pen pals' letters survived the turbulence of teenage years.
There would be lapses and excuses, but always, there would be
another letter.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a rare typed letter sent by Seigo on one of the
first voyages of the China Clipper, dated Dec. 2, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dear Charles,
</P>
<P>
   This is unusual but will become very common in the next year.
Yes, it is this airmail I'm talking about. I want you to be one of
the many who will receive a letter by the returning Clipper so I'm
here banging at this typewriter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Today is my birthday and I'm TWENTY. . . . Excuse all the errors
and mistakes for today is my birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Seigo Kagawa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The correspondence continued. Ingersoll married. Kagawa joined the
Army and was sent to Camp McCoy, Wis., a World War II enemy-alien
prison and training camp, along with thousands of people of
Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   When Kagawa was given a furlough, Ingersoll arranged to meet him
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years and countless sheets of paper, the two came face
to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, we had a thrilling handshake,'' Ingersoll later told a
Nebraska newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dear Charles:
</P>
<P>
   I have felt so happy recalling the weekend. Charles, it was
really great the way we met. Surely, the 16 years of interesting
correspondence was not in vain. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I will want to meet you again and wherever it be, we'll have a
joyous time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Aloha 'til the next time,
</P>
<P>
   Seigo &QL; 
 &QL; 
From Camp McCoy, Kagawa left for the battlefields of Italy, where
he marched with the famous 100th Infantry Battalion, reportedly the
most decorated unit in U.S. military history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters were censored, towns were censored, and I didn't
always know where he was,'' Ingersoll said. ``But I prayed a lot
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1944, Kagawa was injured and sent to Iowa for recovery.
He left the war decorated with four Bronze Stars (one for Pearl
Harbor), a Presidential Unit Citation, a Combat Infantrymen's
Badge, a Purple Heart and a Good Conduct Medal. The Ingersolls were
living in Lincoln, Neb., and arranged for Kagawa to visit for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the train to Nebraska from Iowa, Kagawa was ridiculed,
harassed, and insulted because of his Japanese ancestry. Upon
arrival in Lincoln, he checked himself into a hotel to spare the
Ingersolls the shame of housing him.
</P>
<P>
   They calmed his fears, brought him home and even called a
newspaper reporter to tell the story of two men who'd been writing
to each other since 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorated Jap Sergeant arrives for visit here,'' read the
headline in the Jan. 13, 1945, Lincoln Night Journal.
</P>
<P>
   But the only recognition Hawaiian-born Kagawa wanted was to be
known as an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my face is not like an American's,'' the son of
Japanese immigrants told the Journal reporter. ``And a lot of times
I get my feelings hurt, but I am an American.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit ended and Kagawa went home to Hawaii and got married.
The Ingersolls moved to Wheaton, Ill. Both pen pals started
families and careers. The letters continued.
</P>
<P>
   There were four more visits: Kagawa visited the Ingersolls in
1957, and the Ingersolls journeyed to Hawaii in 1963, '73 and '85.
Seventy-three years of writing letters, and their time together
didn't even total a month.
</P>
<P>
   Age started to take its toll: Ingersoll has a copy of Kagawa's
mother's obituary, and Kagawa sent Ingersoll an extravagant bouquet
of Hawaiian flowers when his brother died.
</P>
<P>
   The world changed: There were computers and e-mail and pressures
from the Ingersolls' children to get both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old to join the 21st century,'' says Ingersoll, who
spends about four hours a week handwriting letters to friends and
family far away.
</P>
<P>
   (This is a man seldom without two pens in the pocket close to
his heart. He gives extras out as tokens of friendship.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see handwritten letters anymore, but you
should,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Their handwriting changed: Seigo's became tighter, smaller,
harder to read. The subjects of their letters shifted: children and
grandchildren and health. The letters were shorter and less
frequent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
December 18, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Dear Jeanette and Charles:
</P>
<P>
   We are glad to hear that both of you are getting better. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We are all facing this problem as we get older. I get my ups and
downs. We must face it that we have passed our average life's span.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   We're fine. Please take care and more next time,
</P>
<P>
   Seigo and Hisaye &QL; 
 &QL; 
There were always plans for more visits. When the Ingersolls sold
their advertising business and retired to Gold Canyon in 1996,
Kagawa promised to come to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 15, Kagawa died unexpectedly. The Ingersolls got a
phone call from his son, Glenn, on the day of the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished I could have been there,'' Ingersoll says.
</P>
<P>
   But even better than a funeral program and a list of speakers
who stood and spoke of Kagawa's life, Ingersoll has 73 years of
personal history, handwritten on yellowing paper.
</P>
<P>
   There are tales from the battlefield and stories from the heart,
personal messages penned from a friend brought into Ingersoll's
life by a simple act of fate and hope: a 12-year-old boy's letter,
sent out into the world in hopes of reaching a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing it has been in my life to have a friend like
Seigo,'' Ingersoll says. ``It was something to have a true friend
in a different culture, a different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an accomplishment, that a pen pal relationship
could last 73 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll believes he'll see Kagawa again one day. But until
that day, he'll send this last message out into the void:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just thanks for being my pen pal. Thanks for answering my
letters, and for being a real loyal friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The last letter Ingersoll got from Hawaii was from Kagawa's
daughter, telling the sad news.
</P>
<P>
   It's typed. &QL;

Rotation could be tricky as Rockets regain bulk
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets broke into groups for their post-practice shooting
drills when coach Rudy Tomjanovich turned to find Kenny Thomas and
Bill Curley alone at one end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's my big men?'' Tomjanovich shouted, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   So many times he might have wanted to scream the same thing, but
then he would have been moaning in agony rather than good humor. He
so often knew the only big men he could claim were on the injured
list or strangers forced to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he knew at least most finally were back in uniform,
having gone through regular workouts. Hakeem Olajuwon and Kelvin
Cato had gone through a full practice together for the first time
since Thanksgiving morning and had stepped into the training room.
Anthony ``Pig'' Miller had begun lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Miami Heat and Alonzo Mourning in town tonight and
a gauntlet of big men to run, the Rockets finally had begun to get
big men back faster than they have gone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have the whole crew and most of the front line
playing,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We could work on things we needed to
tune up and add some things.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Heat beat the Rockets on Jan. 6, Olajuwon was still
weeks short of his return from hernia surgery. The Rockets had just
begun to discover how serious Cato's sprained right wrist would be.
Miller had just joined the team that day.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning torched the Rockets for an easy 28 points and matched
his franchise record with nine blocked shots. Averaging 22.8 points
per game, Mourning is fourth in field-goal accuracy (53.7 percent)
and first in blocked shots (4.42) in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mourning is a beast,'' Cato said. ``He can really play. Every
year, he's gotten better and better. Now he has a lefthand hook, a
righthand hook, an up-and-under, a fallaway jumper. We've got to
contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't get easier, and the return of the Rockets' top
frontcourt defenders could not be timed better. In the next week,
the Rockets also will face the Timberwolves and Kevin Garnett, the
Nuggets and Antonio McDyess, and the Lakers and Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're needed to play the big teams,'' Olajuwon said. ``The big
guys, myself and Cato, should be ready to make the rotation and
help each other support the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Rockets face the Heat tonight, they will take a
test potentially more revealing than the ones passed since their
previous meeting or in their five-game winning streak. The Heat
holds the best record in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had an even better record when the Rockets
beat them Tuesday. But the Rockets had played well against the
Trail Blazers before, something they cannot say about the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst beating we took this year,'' Rockets guard
Steve Francis said. ``They came out aggressive and we didn't.
They're going to see a different team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an accomplishment to have moved so much closer to having
everybody playing at all, especially inside where Mourning was too
big for Kenny Thomas and too quick for former Rockets center Thomas
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon will play in his fourth game since returning to the
active roster. Cato replaced Carlos Rogers, who had thumb surgery
Thursday, on the active roster Saturday. And since the Heat blew
out the Rockets, the Rockets have the longest active winning streak
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But that winning streak complicates bringing back the Rockets
centers. Both would seem needed, particularly with Mourning and the
other top big men waiting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets have been so in sync and effective offensively,
changing the mix could require a careful touch. Changing the
rotation, Tomjanovich said, will be more complicated than doling
out minutes to four, rather than three, big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, it's all such a fine mix of interpersonal and
inter-talent relationships,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It takes time
every time you add someone to it. It's like making a gumbo. You add
that okra in there and everything changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate defensive situation would be to have our big guys
well and to play four big guys in good shape busting it every
minute out there. Guys can keep the pressure on, play with high
intensity, run the court every time and play with a sense of
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are not there yet. Tomjanovich said he could not
even predict how long Olajuwon, who has averaged 17 minutes in his
three games since coming off the injured list, will play, never
mind Cato in his first game back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play it by how things go,'' he said.

KINGS LIKE THEIR NEW COMMUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jamie Storr rolled out of bed Saturday morning and
went to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound like much, but for Kings players who often found
themselves in two hours of traffic commuting to workouts in the
Valley, their new facility in El Segundo is a five-minute drive for
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like living next to a school,'' said Storr, who like many
Kings lives in nearby Manhattan Beach. ``You hear the bell, get up
and go to class.''
</P>
<P>
   Class for the Kings these days has been pretty strenuous. They
are trying to build some consistency during a 4-11-1 stretch the p
coach Andy Murray has worked the team very hard, physically and
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared Saturday for this afternoon's game against the
Colorado Avalanche at Staples Center, Murray said he sees the
Kings' new training facility as a good way to keep his club
together through this tough stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big city with lots to do, a lot of ways to go off on
your own,'' he said. ``With this so close to their homes, we want
it to be a place where some of the guys can come and watch a game
at night and spend time with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The $24 million Healthsouth Training Center is managed by
Iceoplex, the same company that ran the Kings' practice facility in
North Hills. There is a posh players lounge and a Jacuzzi in the
trainers room.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the Kings' first practice, which drew more than a
hundred young fans, including a youth team from Murray's hometown
of Brandon, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Waking the dead: Kings opponents often play the Mighty Ducks
first in Anaheim, and Murray is a frequent visitor to the Pond. The
Dallas Stars lost there 3-1 on Wednesday before beating the Kings.
The Avalanche was tied 3-3 on Friday on a goal by Teemu Selanne
with 1:40 left after a brilliant cross-ice pass from Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was not surprised the Ducks went unbeaten against two of
the elite teams in the Western Conference, even after going 1-8-1
in their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season started they were expected to be one of the
top clubs,'' Murray said. ``I think (Colorado coach) Bob Hartley is
going over a few things with his players today. But I think the
Ducks are just doing what they're capable of doing. I thought
(Colorado goaltender Patrick) Roy had a great game. And Kariya was
amazing, a goal and two assists. With a player like that, good
things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Center Jozef Stumpel, who has missed all but
three games since Nov. 6 with abdominal and knee problems, returns
today. Stumpel has been sidelined the past two weeks with a slight
muscle tear in his left knee. He has undergone more than a dozen
MRIs to monitor the problem but participated in a full workout
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray, who has missed three games with a bruised chest,
also practiced, but he looked far more tentative than Stumpel. His
availability will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette, out three weeks with a badly sprained left
ankle, still was sore after skating Saturday. The club is hopeful
he can return by the end of this week's trip to Dallas, Nashville
and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   KINGS vs. COLORADO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 12:30 p.m., Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net; KRLA-AM (1110).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Avalanche went 8-0-2 at home during a stretch where
it played 10 of 11 at its new Pepsi Center, including shutouts the
previous two games. Then the team arrived Friday at the Pond in
Anaheim and tied the Ducks 3-3. Colorado had the lead until Teemu
Selanne tied the game with 1:40 left. But the Avs were sluggish at
the end, getting outshot 19-1, including 5-0 in overtime. Joe Sakic
(flu) and Adam Deadmarsh (sprained knee) are back. Colorado's
penalty-killing unit has been spectacular, not allowing a goal in
its last 24 attempts until Paul Kariya scored in the second period.
Stephane Fiset, who was replaced in goal three games ago when Jamie
Storr returned from his concussion, will start against the Avs.
