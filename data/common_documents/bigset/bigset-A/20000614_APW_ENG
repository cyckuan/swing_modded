Man Found Guilty in Xerox Shootings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A former Xerox copier repairman was convicted Tuesday of
gunning down seven co-workers in Hawaii's worst mass killing. A jury found Byran
Uyesugi, 40, guilty of first-degree murder, which covers multiple killings, and
attempted murder in the second degree for shooting at an eighth co-worker and
missing. The verdict means the jury believes Uyesugi was legally sane during his
Nov. 2 shooting spree at a Xerox parts warehouse.

Change in Release of Census Data Sought
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Secretary Richard Daley will propose giving the
head of the Census Bureau the final say on when to make public sampled census
data that could drastically affect the way congressional district lines are
redrawn, Census officials said Tuesday. The authority to release the
statistically adjusted data from Census 2000 currently lies with the commerce
secretary. The announcement of the proposal will come at a news conference
Wednesday, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday night.

Number of Refugees Grows Worldwide
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor and wars across
Africa sent 7 million people fleeing their homes last year, bringing to 35
million the number of people worldwide who are uprooted and in need of
protection, a leading refugee organization said Tuesday. The U.S. Committee for
Refugees said more people were living in refugee camps and makeshift housing at
the end of this decade than at the start. In 1990, 29 million people were either
refugees -- defined as people forced to flee their countries -- or internally
displaced residents who leave their homes but not their countries to escape
fighting or political instability.

House Nears Vote on Education Bill

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans batted down Democratic efforts to add funds
for schools and biomedical research to a $339.5 billion measure financing next
year's education, health and labor programs as the House moved today to the
brink of a final vote on the year's biggest spending bill. With a promised veto
by President Clinton waiting in the wings, Republicans were hoping for House
passage tomorrow of a bill so controversial that it hasn't come to that
chamber's floor since 1997.

Pope Attacker Arrives in Turkey

<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy on Tuesday pardoned the Turkish gunman who tried to kill
Pope John Paul II in 1981, and he was immediately delivered to authorities in
Turkey -- taking with him the answers to the mysterious assassination attempt.
Despite the pardon, Mehmet Ali Agca must now serve time in Turkey for a killing
that took place before the attack on the pope. He arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk
International Airport early Wednesday. Police backed by armored personnel
carriers blocked off the gate where he landed, CNN-Turk reported.

Assad Buried in Home Village
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria (AP) -- After a day of frenzied mourning, solemn prayers and a
bit of politicking, Syrian President Hafez Assad was laid to rest Tuesday in the
mountains where he began his climb to power. Bashar Assad, the president's
oldest surviving son and heir apparent, was jostled at the head of the coffin as
clerics, elderly men in business suits or the traditional dark cloaks and white
headdresses of Alawite Muslims, and even soldiers pressed forward. ''His death
is a national catastrophe,'' said Hafez al-Shuraiqi, 69, a former schoolmate of
the president.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gil Meche came off the disabled list and
allowed just one hit in five innings to lead the Seattle Mariners
to a rain-shortened 7-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game, halted as the Royals came to bat in the bottom of the
sixth inning, was called after a delay of 1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meche (2-4), who missed two starts with a strained right
shoulder, allowed only three baserunners as the Mariners moved a
season-high seven games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander struck out two, walked none and also benefited
from an outstanding running catch by left fielder Rickey Henderson
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, which moved a half-game ahead of Oakland in the AL West
on Monday night, has won four in a row and seven of nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals lost their third consecutive game at home for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron's leadoff triple off Brett Laxton (0-1) in the
third got the Mariners started on a three-run inning. Raul Ibanez
had an RBI single, Mark McLemore hit an RBI double and Alex
Rodriguez had an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made it 6-0 in the fourth on a two-run single by John
Mabry, and a sacrifice fly by Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud scored the Mariners' final run on a passed ball in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Laxton, making his debut with the Royals, gave up six runs,
eight hits, walked two and struck out one in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney hit a double in the first, Rey Sanchez walked in
the third, and Joe Randa reached on an error by Olerud at first
base in the fifth for the Royals' only baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson robbed Scott Pose of a hit in the third with a nice
running catch one step inside the left-field foul line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals SS Sanchez, who turned a nice 6-3 double play in the
second, has gone 40 games without an error. He has committed just
one error this season in 56 games. ... Dye took over first place
among outfielders in AL All-Star balloting. He has 510,595 votes
and leads Yankees OF Bernie Williams by more than 13,000. ...
Royals OF Carlos Beltran, the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, was
benched in favor of Todd Dunwoody. Beltran is hitting .252. ...
Seattle sent six men to the plate in their three-run third with
only two official at-bats. ... Olerud hit singles in his first
three at-bats. ... A member of the grounds crew got caught under
the billowing tarp after it covered the infield. Royals players
came running out of the dugout to assist, but the man emerged to
the cheers of the crowd a moment later.

<HEADLINE> Widower Looks Up Old Sweetheart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) -- After his wife died, loneliness and
curiosity took 95-year-old Paul Johnston to the doorstep of his
college sweetheart's home.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years after they last saw each other, the spark was
still there, and it led to marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love you,'' Johnston says as he kisses the cheek of his
94-year-old bride. Lula Marschat giggles like she's a schoolgirl
again.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who had a yearlong romance in college, never imagined
they would reunite. Johnston lived in Idaho, Marschat in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   They started dating at an Idaho college in 1924 -- Marschat was a
junior and Johnston a senior. They shared picnics and never missed
a dance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply liked each other,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Johnston moved back home -- 150 miles away --
while she remained at school. Since they did not have telephones
and had to borrow a car to see each other, it was difficult to stay
together. But Johnston never forgot his sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, whose wife of 70 years died in 1997, first tracked
down Marschat's sister in Idaho. He discovered that Lula was alive
and that she, too, had lost her spouse. But her sister, protective,
dissuaded him from contacting her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Johnston went home and spent three days composing a
letter. He mailed it on a Wednesday, and on Friday night, the phone
rang. It was Lula.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was excited to know he was still alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They had a lot to talk about. Johnston, who was a radio operator
during World War II, survived a Japanese torpedo attack that sank
his ship off Hawaii. He later received a master's degree in history
at University of California at Berkeley and taught secondary
education in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, his four children lived near Marschat. She also
became a teacher and had three children with her husband, a school
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   After the phone conversation, Johnston booked a flight
immediately. When he arrived at her doorstep, she expected to greet
him with a handshake. Instead, he opened his arms. ''We clasped,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, he proposed at the dinner table. When she
accepted, he leaned over and kissed her lips. ''It was such a long
kiss,'' she said, blushing.
</P>
<P>
   They were married Saturday. More than 200 people attended the
wedding at a Woodburn church, with the bride in a green suit and
the groom wearing navy blue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were college sweethearts,'' he said. ''We still are.''

<HEADLINE> Change in Census Data Release Urged  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Secretary William Daley will propose
giving the head of the Census Bureau the final say on when to make
public sampled census data that could drastically affect the way
congressional district lines are redrawn, Census officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authority to release the statistically adjusted data from
Census 2000 currently lies with the commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the proposal will come at a news conference
Wednesday, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes the process transparent,'' Prewitt said. ''This
makes sure there is no partisan intent on how we conduct the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, which Prewitt has said
he favors. Supporters of sampling believe it will help account for
portions of the population undercounted in previous counts,
including minorities and inner-city residents who historically vote
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department. Both Daley
and Prewitt were appointed by President Clinton, and may not be in
their positions by early next year, when the decision to release
sampled data must be made.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could become a formal regulation by September,
following a public comment period, Census spokesman Steve Jost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the reapportionment of
congressional seats must be made using raw, or nonsampled data. It
left open the possibility for states to use sampled data when
redrawing state and congressional district lines.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, in general, fear sampled data could skew those
political boundaries to Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, called the
proposal ''politics as usual'' since both positions are appointed
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think this changes things at all because all it does
is move the decision-making process from one political appointee to
another,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the proposal, Jost said there was no guarantee that
sampled data would be released. Prewitt said the proposed policy
change removes partisanship from the decision-making process
because it is put into the hands of ''technical experts and career
statisticians'' not concerned with political outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the next president will appoint the next heads of
the Commerce Department and Census Bureau. So, if presumptive
Republican nominee George W. Bush should win the presidency in
November, he would have the power to change the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush, if he wanted to, could repeal the regulation and
take away the authority that this administration is delegating to
the career professionals at the Census Bureau,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's ranking Democrat. ''If he wants
to do that, that's going to be one hell of a Kodak moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Act states that the commerce secretary has the power
to delegate the authority over ''whether it is feasible to
release'' sample data, said Jost, the Census spokesman. That power
was taken away following the last census, in 1990, from the census
director's office by the then-Republican commerce secretary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed decision returns to that prior long-standing
precedent which was changed in 1990,'' Jost said.

<HEADLINE> Rocker's Return to Richmond Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- John Rocker returned to Richmond for the
first time in two years on Tuesday night, drawing a huge crowd and
a standing ovation from thousands who stayed out late just to see
the exiled relief pitcher throw.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of a save situation when Richmond scored twice in the
bottom of the eighth inning, Rocker came on to start the ninth and
drew roars -- and a smattering of boos -- from a crowd of 6,459 that
waited out a 2{-hour rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struggled for the first time in three appearances with
Richmond, giving up singles to Toledo's Billy McMillon and Gabe
Alvarez to start the inning before retiring Javier Cardona on a fly
ball to left center that allowed McMillon to tag up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first out he's recorded that wasn't a strikeout since
he joined Richmond last Thursday. The second, a fly ball to left by
Carlos Mendez, scored McMillon, before Rocker got Chris Wakeland to
ground into a force at second to end Richmond's 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance was easily the shakiest of Rocker's three since
he was demoted by Atlanta. He was dominant in appearances against
Toledo and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   He also was warmly received in Ohio, but nothing like Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared in the Triple A Braves' bullpen with two outs in
the bottom of the seventh, the bases loaded and Richmond leading
3-1. So intent were the fans on the left field line in watching his
every move that most of them missed Toby Rumfield's RBI-single to
right and the ensuing inning-ending play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker soft tossed with right fielder Tim Unroe, flipped two
balls into the cheering crowd and started warming up. He came on to
start the ninth inning, doing his trademark sprint down the left
field line as the crowd rose and roared.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, demoted by Atlanta last Monday, didn't report to the
Braves until three days later. It was unclear late Tuesday if an
injury to Atlanta reliever Rudy Seanez in Pittsburgh could prompt
the Braves to recall Rocker early.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond Braves would surely be sorry to see him go. Besides
the large crowd Tuesday night, he's been a model citizen, several
players and manager Randy Ingle said. He even bought a sport coat
to conform to the team's travel dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just one of the guys,'' pitcher Tim Pugh said before the
game. ''I haven't heard one negative thing out of his mouth. I
think he's got his mind right.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrin Ebert agreed and said Rocker has been a welcomed addition
because of his ability to close out games for Richmond, which had
won just 17 of 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he steps on that mound, there's so much intimidation that
he brings with him,'' Ebert said. ''The two times that he's come
in, he's just dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain figured to be a disappointment for fans, some of whom
arrived almost three hours before the 7 p.m. start to get a choice
seat to watch the lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like ol' Rocker,'' said Sid Canfield, a 78-year-old
Richmonder and longtime Braves fan. ''I think he's a good boy.
They're dragging him over the coals.''
</P>
<P>
   Canfield said he didn't agree with Rocker's offseason remarks to
a Sports Illustrated reporter disparaging minorities, gays and
foreigners, but said he thinks the 25-year-old deserves another
chance to prove he's learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was echoed by E.J. Bush, a 72-year-old Braves fan
from Milton, Fla. He was in town for a family matter, but loaded up
his portable oxygen tank and came to The Diamond with his son
hoping for a chance to see Rocker pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he should have said what he said. He should have
been a little more diplomatic,'' Bush said. ''But I still like the
man as a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   There were about a dozen police officers on hand, twice the
normal number, because of Rocker and the large crowd expected,
general manager Bruce Baldwin said. He did not know if three Major
League Baseball security people who stayed with Rocker throughout
the Ohio trip would return after having a day off Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the team clubhouse was closed to reporters before and
after the game, and the field was off-limits as well during batting
practice and warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared in nine games for Richmond in 1998 before being
called up to Atlanta. He worked 19 innings, struck out 22 and was
1-1 with one save.

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Rockies 3  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ken Caminiti homered and drove in three runs and
Shane Reynolds won for the first time in six starts as the Houston
Astros put aside their infighting and beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Gerry Hunsicker held a 25-minute pregame meeting
in the wake of Sunday's batting-practice scuffle between rookie
Mitch Meluskey and Matt Mieske, and the Astros seemed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which had lost 12 of 13 on the road, built a 5-1 lead
against Rolando Arrojo (4-5), and Reynolds pitched six innings for
his first victory since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (6-3), elevated to staff ace when Mike Hampton was
traded to the New York Mets during the offseason, gave up one run
and eight hits. He walked three and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his sixth save in 13 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin had three hits and stole two bases for the Rockies,
who had their four-game winning streak snapped. Colorado also lost
for the first time in nine games at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros (23-40), who have the worst record in the majors, led
5-1 when the Rockies rallied against Jay Powell in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mayne had a bases-loaded single to drive in a run, and
Goodwin forced home a run when he drew a four-pitch walk from Butch
Henry. The threat ended when Mike Lansing lined out to second.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti hit a solo homer, his 15th, off Mike DeJean in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti had a two-out RBI double in the first and a run-scoring
single in the third to help Houston build a 4-0 lead before Goodwin
scored on Larry Walker's two-out triple in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey put Houston ahead 5-1 with an RBI single in the sixth,
and Arrojo left for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the inning. He
gave up five runs and 12 hits with no walks and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reynolds made his first start in Colorado since Sept. 8,
1996. ... Rockies OF Jeffrey Hammonds extended his career-best
hitting streak to 12 games. ... Houston OF Moises Alou has hit in
11 straight. ... Goodwin, who leads the majors with 29 steals, had
his 59th career multisteal game. ... Colorado 1B Todd Helton has
just six hits in his last 28 at-bats, dropping his NL-leading
average from .418 to .392.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Recalled by Braves  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- John Rocker is going back to the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after finishing the least impressive of his three
one-inning stints for the Atlanta Braves' Triple A farm team at
Richmond, Rocker was recalled by the parent club following an
injury to Rudy Seanez, Richmond pitching coach Mike Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got the news after working the ninth in a 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it was because Rudy got hurt,'' Alvarez said
after Rocker allowed two hits and a run in the ninth inning. ''They
didn't give us details.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker thanked the Richmond Braves for having him and helping
him during a six-day stay, his first in the minors since he pitched
here early in the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's always exciting to go to the big leagues,''
Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond locker room was closed after the game and Rocker
was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Only a short time earlier, he was welcomed like a returning hero
by a huge crowd that stood roaring when the exiled reliever
sprinted into the game to start the ninth. Only a smattering of
boos were audible from the crown of 6,459 who waited out a 2{-hour
rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struggled for the first time at Richmond, giving up
singles to Toledo's Billy McMillon and Gabe Alvarez to start the
inning before retiring Javier Cardona on a fly ball to left center
that allowed McMillon to tag and move to third.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first out he recorded that wasn't a strikeout since
he joined Richmond last Thursday. The second, a fly ball to left by
Carlos Mendez, scored McMillon, before Rocker got Chris Wakeland to
ground into a force at second.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared in the Braves' bullpen with two outs in the
bottom of the seventh, the bases loaded and Richmond leading 3-1.
So intent were the fans on the left field line in watching his
every move that most of them missed Toby Rumfield's RBI-single to
right and the ensuing inning-ending play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker soft tossed with right fielder Tim Unroe, flipped two
balls into the cheering crowd and started warming up. He came on to
start the ninth inning, doing his trademark sprint down the left
field line as the crowd rose and roared.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, demoted by Atlanta last Monday, didn't report to the
Braves until three days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond Braves will be sorry to see him go. Besides the
large crowd Tuesday night, he had been a model citizen, several
players and manager Randy Ingle said. He even bought a sport coat
to conform to the team's travel dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just one of the guys,'' pitcher Tim Pugh said before the
game. ''I haven't heard one negative thing out of his mouth. I
think he's got his mind right.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrin Ebert agreed and said Rocker has been a welcomed addition
because of his ability to close out games for Richmond, which had
won just 17 of 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he steps on that mound, there's so much intimidation that
he brings with him,'' Ebert said. ''The two times that he's come
in, he's just dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain figured to be a disappointment for fans, some of whom
arrived almost three hours before the 7 p.m. start to get a choice
seat to watch the lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like ol' Rocker,'' said Sid Canfield, a 78-year-old
Richmonder and longtime Braves fan. ''I think he's a good boy.
They're dragging him over the coals.''
</P>
<P>
   Canfield said he didn't agree with Rocker's offseason remarks to
a Sports Illustrated reporter disparaging minorities, gays and
foreigners, but said he thinks the 25-year-old deserves another
chance to prove he's learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was echoed by E.J. Bush, a 72-year-old Braves fan
from Milton, Fla. He was in town for a family matter, but loaded up
his portable oxygen tank and came to The Diamond with his son
hoping for a chance to see Rocker pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he should have said what he said. He should have
been a little more diplomatic,'' Bush said. ''But I still like the
man as a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   There were about a dozen police officers on hand, twice the
normal number, because of Rocker and the large crowd expected,
general manager Bruce Baldwin said. He did not know if three Major
League Baseball security people who stayed with Rocker throughout
the Ohio trip would return after having a day off Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the team clubhouse was closed to reporters before and
after the game, and the field was off-limits as well during batting
practice and warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared in nine games for Richmond in 1998 before being
called up to Atlanta. He worked 19 innings, struck out 22 and was
1-1 with one save.

<HEADLINE> Bans May Not Affect Fiji Olympians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Proposed bans on Fijian sporting teams
entering Australia were not likely to extend to Fiji's Olympic
team, Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand authorities have banned Fijian rugby union teams
from competing in New Zealand in response to the coup crisis, where
George Speight and armed supporters have held Fijian Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry and 30 other people hostage since May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Downer said Tuesday he was considering similar sanctions to
those applied in neighboring New Zealand, adding that inviting
Fijian sporting teams to Australia was ''highly inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight and Fijian national rugby authorities on Wednesday
condemned the sporting bans, which had prompted speculation of
similar sanctions for about 10 Fijians preparing for the Sept.
15-Oct. 1 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's Foreign Ministry later backed down on the
Olympic issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minister Downer has not given any consideration to blocking
any Olympic team,'' a spokesman for Downer said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who qualify for the Olympics were expected to receive
Games accreditation and a special identification pass, which
doubles as an entry visa for Australia leading to and during the
Games.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Picked For Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A lawyer has been selected to argue for
President Clinton's disbarment over his testimony about his
relationship with Monica Lewinksy.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Marie-Bernarde Miller will represent the state panel
that disciplines lawyers in its disbarment petition in circuit
court in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Tuesday that she was hired June 7 but referred all
other questions about the case to the state Supreme Court Committee
on Professional Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended May 22 that Clinton be stripped of his
license to practice law in Arkansas over misleading testimony in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the committee was treating him more severely
than other lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has not yet filed its petition with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 48, grew up in Little Rock. She graduated from Maryville
College in St. Louis and received a law degree from the University
of Kansas in 1984. A former social studies teacher, Miller works
for a Little Rock law firm.

<HEADLINE> North, South Korean Leaders Meet  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korean officials met
on the second day of a historic summit Wednesday, after the South's
leader pledged a day earlier to work toward reunification and North
Korea's leader said he was ready to open ''dialogue without
reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But limited media access to the talks make it difficult to
determine just what was happening between South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the two governments resumed Wednesday with
Kim Dae-jung attending without his counterpart, according to the
print and television reports shown at a media center in Seoul. Kim
Yong Nam, the North's ceremonial head of state, hosted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The reports said the meeting focused on opening highway and
railway lines across the border and economic cooperation, but
provided no details. South Korea also raised the issues of family
reunions and a ''hot line'' for contact between the two nations
during confrontations. The pool reports also said the two leaders
would meet separately later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening day of the summit, optimism about possible
breakthroughs between the two heavily armed countries ran high as
Kim Jong Il warmly welcomed Kim Dae-jung in an airport ceremony.
They held hands during a limousine ride into the North's capital,
Pyongyang, traveling along avenues lined with hundreds of thousands
of people waving bouquets of pink paper flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Kim Dae-jung's spokesman, Park Joon-young,
denied front-page reports in South Korean newspapers that the two
leaders had agreed to establish the ''hot line.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are discussing that, but no agreement has been
reached yet,'' Park told reporters in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 South Korean journalists who were allowed to travel there
to cover the two leaders filed sketchy pool reports to the hundreds
of foreign journalists who were forced to remain in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a day mostly given to the pomp of an unexpectedly
elaborate welcome, and the two leaders expressed hopes for an end
to more than a generation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years to the week since the Korean War began, South
Korea's president appealed for reunions of separated families and
for the opening of land, sea and air routes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us open up the road that has been blocked off for half a
century,'' Kim Dae-jung said. ''Let us open new sea lanes of
communication and air routes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When that happens all Koreans will be able to travel freely
between the two sides and work toward reconciliation, cooperation
and eventual reunification,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il, one of the world's most reclusive leaders, urged a
''dialogue without reserve,'' according to South Korean pool
reports. Non-Korean journalists were barred from traveling with the
South Korean president to Pyongyang for the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung's visit began with a surprise welcome by Kim Jong
Il at the airport on the outskirts of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is closely watching us. Why President Kim came to
North Korea and why I accepted is a question mark,'' the North's
leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to give the answer to this question during the two
nights and three days,'' the pool quoted him as saying. ''I ask not
only President Kim, but also (accompanying) ministers, to make
contributions to this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart
underscored the importance of the summit, saying the Clinton
administration was ''heartened to see the warm welcome'' Kim
Dae-jung had received.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan saluted ''the vision and
wisdom'' of the two leaders in opening the historic dialogue, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was hopeful the summit would produce substantive results,
''marking a turning point towards lasting peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula and throughout the entire region, as well as
national reunification,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Kim Jong Il stepped forward to shake hands with
the southern leader, and the two smiled and clapped for each other.
The reception included a military band, goose-stepping soldiers and
women dressed in traditional, billowing Korean gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders then rode together in a limousine to the North
Korean capital, where an estimated 600,000 people lined block after
block. The spectators appeared to direct their emotion at Kim Jong
Il, chanting his name as the motorcade passed through the city of 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang's Central TV downplayed the presence of the South's
president, focusing instead on the man who has ruled the North's
totalitarian regime with the benefit of a personality cult since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast airport and streets of Pyongyang burned with emotions
because so many people turned out to see our Great Leader Kim Jong
Il,'' a television announcer said.
</P>
<P>
   The North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, remarked that Kim
Dae-jung had arrived in Pyongyang ''at his own request'' --
apparently meaning to suggest he was a supplicant to Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an unexpectedly warm start to the first meeting
between the heads of the two Koreas since they were divided
following World War II.
</P>
<P>
   At the North's main state guesthouse, Kim Jong Il explained
Pyongyang's secretive approach to the summit, telling Kim Dae-jung:
''We were unable to publicize your visit through newspapers and the
radio because of security.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the South, things may work out well if you advertise them,
but we will be all right if we pursue only the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange, Kim Jong Il said: ''I am convinced that all
problems will be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Kim Dae-jung: ''I agree. From now, we must talk
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides family reunions and the opening of travel routes, the
South's president is expected to ask Kim Jong Il for a summit
sequel in Seoul, as well as other conciliatory gestures in exchange
for economic resources from the South. North Korea was unable to
feed its own people in the late 1990s and is now reliant on food
aid from its traditional foes: South Korea, Japan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation for economic aid is believed to be a major factor in
driving the North to agree to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Korea's leaders have a host of touchy issues to resolve, among
them the North's long-range missile and nuclear programs and the
37,000 U.S. troops deployed in the South. Their role has been to
deter the North, which is believed to have stockpiles of chemical
weapons and one of the world's largest standing armies.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification -- the stated goal of both Koreas -- also was likely
to be a lengthy and difficult process.

<HEADLINE> 5 Year Cancer Survival Rate Tested  </HEADLINE>
By JACQUI PODZIUS COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The five-year survival rate -- the standard
measurement of a cancer treatment's success -- may be misleading
because people are being diagnosed earlier and therefore living
longer with detected cancer before they die, a study says.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, are based on a National Cancer Institute
effort to collect and analyze cancer data in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year survival rate is the number of cancer patients who
are still alive five years after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis looked at the 20 major types of cancer and the
rates of five-year survival from 1950 to 1995, then looked at
deaths and the incidence of the disease. In some cancers, more
people are living five years after being diagnosed, but more people
are also developing the disease and more people are ultimately
dying from it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the five-year survival rate for prostate cancer has
increased from 43 percent in 1954 to 93 percent in 1995. However,
the mortality rate -- the number of patients per 1,000 who die from
the disease -- has gone up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, lead author of the study, said the
increase in the survival rates is mostly influenced by earlier
diagnoses of cancer, not advances in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The survival rate is computed from the time of diagnosis, so it
appears people are living longer, when in reality many of them are
only learning they have cancer earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a man is diagnosed with prostate cancer at 75
and dies at 78, the five-year survival rate is 0; if another man is
diagnosed at 73 and dies at 78, the rate is 100 percent. Both men
may have developed cancer at the same time, but one was diagnosed
earlier and appeared to have a better five-year survival rate, even
though the end result -- the age of death -- was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the five-year survival rate always goes up when
we find cancer earlier in patients' lives. Whether or not these
patients have their deaths postponed is a different matter
altogether,'' said Welch, a doctor at the Department of Veterans
Affairs Hospital in White River Junction, Vt., and a professor at
Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said the findings are not meant to imply there have not
been advances in cancer treatment or to discourage people from
getting screening tests. But he said the public and the media
should be more skeptical of findings based solely on the survival
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hoskins of the disease management department at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the
five-year figure is an important measurement because after that
amount of time, a cancer patient usually is considered cured.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that early diagnosis has probably boosted the survival
rate, but he said at least some of those cases probably were people
who benefited from early treatment and were cured, not just people
who were simply diagnosed earlier and died in the same amount of
time.

<HEADLINE> Big Names Help Pa. House Race  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAVERLY, Pa. (AP) -- Candidates in state legislative races
normally call on the help of hometown politicians, civic club
leaders and maybe a local celebrity to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   But rivals in a legislative district near Scranton are tapping
the president, the vice president and the governor for help.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to tape a radio ad, and Vice President Al
Gore and Republican Gov. Tom Ridge have been scheduling stops in
Pennsylvania's 114th House District, where a June 20 special
election is expected to serve as a test case for a critical fall
legislative battle.
</P>
<P>
   The race pits Republican Tom Parry, a 38-year-old deputy court
clerk and former school board member, against Democrat Jim Wansacz,
a 27-year-old son of a former veteran state representative from
this district of closely knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   They are competing to replace Rep. Frank A. Serafini, a
Republican who resigned after pleading guilty to perjury charges.
The winner will serve for five months until the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the short term, the election is widely seen as a test
case for the November battle over control of the Pennsylvania
House, where Republicans hold a two-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates who win November's state House election will
decide how to redraw the state's congressional boundaries next
year. Pennsylvania is expected to lose seats after the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   That has led to interest from people who are a long way in the
political world from the hills of the 114th District.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of intensity behind our efforts, both the
Harrisburg folks and us down here in Washington,'' said Edward G.
Rendell, the former Philadelphia mayor who now chairs the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he either gave or lobbied for $30,000 in
contributions to Wansacz's campaign and committees that are
supporting House members. He also arranged for President Clinton to
record a radio commercial on Wansacz's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a crucial first step to the eventual control of the
House in January 2001,'' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell also arranged for Gore to make an airport appearance
with Wansacz Tuesday night as the apparent presidential nominee
prepared for a campaign appearance of his own Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, meanwhile, spent the morning with Parry at two community
meetings. The governor enthusiastically plugged the slightly
tense-looking candidate and discussed importing of out-of-state
waste, a chronic issue in the landfill-laden district.
</P>
<P>
   He also took time to tweak Gore, whose appearances in Scranton
are part of a campaign swing meant to highlight the nation's
prosperity under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incredible recovery and turnaround in Pennsylvania has a
lot more to do with the people in Pennsylvania than the people on
Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's House Republicans have been battered in the last
year as lawmaker after lawmaker in the party faced legal troubles.
One resigned and three others chose not to seek re-election after
being convicted, indicted, charged or otherwise accused of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other Republicans also decided against seeking
re-election. One Democrat with legal problems opted out of running
again.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 districts left without an incumbent candidate, Democrats
have enlisted the aid of their national organization to seize the
majority. Republicans have generally brushed aside suggestions that
the open seats present the GOP with vulnerability.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Angioplasties Studied  </HEADLINE>
By DON BABWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Heart attack victims are far more likely to
survive if they have an angioplasty almost as soon as they get to
the hospital, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings underscore what doctors have long suspected about
angioplasty, in which a balloon is inserted via a catheter to open
a blocked artery in the heart -- time counts.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by researchers at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston and was published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   It analyzed the cases of 27,080 heart attack patients treated
with angioplasty in 661 hospitals across the United States over a
four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quicker the better,'' said the study's lead author, Dr.
Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   The study found the death rate among people who had suffered
heart attacks climbed the longer the time between entering the
hospital and undergoing angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the death rate among those who had an angioplasty
within an hour was only 4.2 percent, compared with nearly 8 percent
for those who waited longer than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   When factors such as age and the severity of the heart attacks
were factored in, the death rate was 40 percent to 60 percent
higher among those who waited longer than two hours than those who
had the procedure in less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that only about half of the patients in the
study had the procedure within two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The medical community has some work to do,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Also not surprising to the researchers was that the success rate
of the procedure was greater among hospitals that did angioplasty
more often.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the death rate was 33 percent lower among
hospitals where three or more of the procedures were performed a
month compared with those where less than one was performed a
month.

<HEADLINE> School Bomb Threats Take Off  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THROOP, Pa. (AP) -- At least 5,000 bomb threats jolted schools
across the country in the six months after the Columbine High
bloodbath, costing thousands of lost classroom hours, an education
safety group says.
</P>
<P>
   The National School Safety Center did not track the number of
threats before the killings, but many schools reported fivefold
increases afterward, said Ronald Stephens, the group's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators blame students who do not know the costs or
consequences of crying bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time you ratchet up the level of violence, it tends to
redefine deviancy,'' Stephens said. ''We've transitioned from
fistfights to gunfights, and Columbine introduced a new dimension
called explosive devices.''
</P>
<P>
   No one tracks the total number of bomb threats to the nation's
schools -- many agencies say real violence leaves little time to
chase pranks. Some states leave the task to indivividual schools or
police departments, which do not always share the information with
the state or each other.
</P>
<P>
   States that do track bomb threats reported significant increases
after the April 20, 1999, killings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   California had 548 school bomb threats in the 1998-99 school
year, 80 percent of them after the killings, said Jean Scott, a
state Education Department spokeswoman. The previous school year,
California had 236 threats, she said.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press review of Pennsylvania records shows an even
larger increase. Schools in the state reported 309 threats to the
state Emergency Management Agency in the month after Columbine, up
from 60 between Jan. 1, 1996, and the day before the killings, the
AP's computer-assisted analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Education Department, which also tracks bomb
threats, reported more threats before Columbine than PEMA did: 183
from July 1, 1995, to June 30, 1998. The department has no newer
numbers for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1999-2000 school year draws to a close, the number of
threats in Pennsylvania seems to be tapering off. PEMA reported 60
between September and April 26, the latest date for which
information is available.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's rash was costly in both dollars and hours. Thirteen
of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts during the 1998-99 school
year could not provide the 180 days of class required by state law
because they lost too many days to bomb threats or other violence.
</P>
<P>
   The department granted all 13 an exemption, but Pennsylvania
students have never before lost so much time to threats, spokesman
Al Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has calculated the total dollars lost, but some schools
have tracked their own. Authorities at Mid Valley School District
near Scranton said they lost $45,000 in salaries and cafeteria food
for sending home students and teachers because of an April 28,
1999, note saying the school would go ''boom.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not include the expenses and hours of 25 volunteer
firefighters, a state trooper and two police officers who answered
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're putting a lot of people in danger,'' said Throop police
Chief Neil Furioso, one of the police officers who arrived at the
campus. ''Our volunteers are rushing to an unfounded thing.
Anything could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the ''boom'' note, a 17-year-old girl who was a
junior at Mid Valley, was expelled and enrolled in an alternative
education program. She also spent three days in jail and served six
months of probation.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was caught when she bragged to friends that school
would be canceled on the day of the threat. They turned her in.

<HEADLINE> Study: Exercise Reduces Stroke Risk  </HEADLINE>
By JACQUI PODZIUS COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who get 30 minutes of vigorous exercise
every day, even just a brisk walk, can reduce their chances of
having a stroke by as much as 30 percent, a study says.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, were based on six years of data from 72,488
women, ages 40 to 65, who participated in the Harvard-based Nurses
Health Study.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said it is the first large-scale study to link
exercise to reducing the risk of stroke, which is the third-leading
cause of death in men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies, such as the surgeon general's 1996 report on
exercise, concluded it was unclear whether physical activity
protects against stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found that doing 30 minutes of moderate to
vigorous exercise almost every day cut the risk of having an
ischemic stroke, the most common type, by 30 percent. The risk of
other types of stroke was cut by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits were the same whether the women took a brisk walk
or did more intense exercise such as jogging or aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major public health problem in this nation is sedentary
lifestyle,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, one of the study's authors and
chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
''Walking is the most popular and common form of exercise in
middle-age and older women, so it's great news from a public health
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits from exercise are seen rather quickly, so a woman
who doesn't start exercising until later in life still has a chance
to cut her risk of stroke, Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The earlier you develop good habits, the better,'' she said.
''But it's an important public health point that it's never too
late. Someone shouldn't think if they are 60, 70, 80 years old they
won't get the health benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson stressed that in order to get the stroke-reduction
benefits from walking, women must maintain a brisk pace -- a mile in
no more than 20 minutes, or fast enough to elevate the heart rate
and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   One way exercise cuts the risk of stroke is by lowering blood
pressure and the chance of clotting, Manson said. An ischemic
stroke is caused when blood vessels are constricted and then
finally cut off by a clot.

<HEADLINE> 'Some Like It Hot' Named Funniest  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Something about men in women's clothing
obviously tickles people's funny bones: ''Some Like It Hot'' and
''Tootsie'' came in at Nos. 1 and 2 on the American Film
Institute's list of the 100 funniest American movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some Like It Hot,'' Billy Wilder's 1959 classic starring Jack
Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe, topped the list announced
Tuesday on a CBS television special. Lemmon and Curtis play
musicians who witness a mob massacre and dress up as women to hide
out with an all-girl band.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Pollack's ''Tootsie,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as a
down-and-out actor who finds soap-opera success masquerading as a
woman, came in second, as determined by about 1,800 actors,
directors, studio executives, critics and others in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Voters chose their funniest movies from a list of 500 nominees
compiled by the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the top 10, in order, were: Stanley Kubrick's ''Dr.
Strangelove,'' Woody Allen's ''Annie Hall,'' the Marx Brothers'
''Duck Soup,'' Mel Brooks' ''Blazing Saddles,'' Robert Altman's ''M
A S H,'' Frank Capra's ''It Happened One Night,'' Mike Nichols'
''The Graduate'' and Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker's
''Airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also had 11th place with ''The Producers'' and 13th place
with ''Young Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the institute's third annual list. Two years ago, the
group released the 100 best American films, topped by ''Citizen
Kane,'' and last year the institute ranked the top 50 screen
legends, led by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time out, funny films leapt to the fore,'' said Bob
Gazzale, producer of the institute's TV special. ''These films make
us laugh, they got us through the Great Depression, but they really
haven't gotten the recognition they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was the director with the most films included, with
''Annie Hall'' and four others: ''Manhattan'' at No. 46, ''Take the
Money and Run'' at No. 66,'' ''Bananas'' at No. 69 and ''Sleeper''
at No. 80.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ''Some Like It Hot,'' Wilder also wrote or directed four
other movies on the list. The Marx Brothers also had four others in
the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Chaplin had four movies, with ''The Gold Rush'' ranked
highest at No. 25. George Cukor and Preston Sturges also directed
four. The top-ranked silent film was Buster Keaton's ''The
General'' at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cross-dressing comedies made the list, ''Mrs.
Doubtfire'' at No. 67 and ''Victor/Victoria'' at No. 76.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be nominated. I would be unhappy if I didn't make
a few people laugh,'' said ''Victor/Victoria'' director Blake
Edwards, whose ''A Shot in the Dark'' also was No. 48. ''But I'm
just a little bit leery of lists. It's not sour grapes that I
wasn't No. 1 or anything like that, though it'll probably sound
like sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just very subjective. I have the same problem, frankly,
with the Academy Awards. Jack Lemmon once said, 'How can you really
judge a performance unless all five nominees play the same part?'''
</P>
<P>
   The newest film on the list was the Farrelly Brothers' ''There's
Something About Mary'' from 1998, which ranked 27th. Only four
other movies from the 1990s made the cut, but the 1980s were the
best-represented decade with 22 pictures, including ''A Fish Called
Wanda'' at No. 21, ''When Harry Met Sally ...'' at No. 23 and
''Ghostbusters'' at No. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Leonard Maltin said that the list was weighted too
much toward recent movies and that comedy classics by Sturges and
Chaplin should have been ranked higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''In large part these lists turn out to be a celebration of
ignorance,'' Maltin said. ''I don't think I'm a voice in the
wilderness when I say there's a possibility Charlie Chaplin is a
better filmmaker than the Farrelly Brothers.''

House GOP Seeks $16M for Campaign
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- House Republican leaders will demand GOP lawmakers raise
$16 million for use in key contested races this fall, officials said Tuesday
night. They intend to hold the rank and file accountable through control of
chairmanships and committee assignments in 2001. Any Republican who declines to
assume responsibility for his allotted fund-raising quota will be asked to
''call the speaker (House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.), set up a personal
meeting to tell him why,'' according to material prepared for a session of GOP
members on Wednesday morning.

Uyesugi, 40, guilty of first-degree murder, which covers multiple killings, and
attempted murder in the second degree for shooting at an eighth co-worker and

Number of Refugees Grows Worldwide

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor and wars across
Africa sent 7 million people fleeing their homes last year, bringing to 35
million the number of people worldwide who are uprooted and in need of
protection, a leading refugee organization said Tuesday. The U.S. Committee for
Refugees said more people were living in refugee camps and makeshift housing at
the end of this decade than at the start. In 1990, 29 million people were either
refugees -- defined as people forced to flee their countries -- or internally
displaced residents who leave their homes but not their countries to escape

<HEADLINE> Maggots May Clear Death Row Inmate  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A man awaiting execution on Arizona's death row
is pinning one of his final attempts at salvation on a bunch of
unlikely saviors: maggots.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Spears, 41, convicted of murdering Jeanette Beaulieu and
dumping her body in the desert, has maintained his innocence since
his 1992 arrest. Eight years later, he's sticking to his story --
and hoping a study of the maggots found on her body can save him.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu's body was found Jan. 19, 1992, at a shooting range
east of Phoenix. She had been shot in the back of the head. Based
on the decomposition of her body, a medical examiner put the murder
date at Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   However, forensic entomologist David Faulkner -- who recently
examined the flesh-eating maggots found crushed and preserved in
Beaulieu's clothing -- says the date of death is more likely between
Jan. 10 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Spears was at home near San Diego on those dates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The insects I looked at couldn't have been much older than
about 10 days,'' Faulkner said. ''If the person was dead longer
than that, they were ... excluded from insect activity -- stored
away in something like a freezer or a locker.''
</P>
<P>
   With capital punishment under growing national scrutiny, the
case is a twist on more traditional avenues of appeal, including
DNA testing of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the life span and development of insects found at crime
scenes can help determine the date of a victim's death. Faulkner
said it takes only moments for the insects to appear after someone
dies.
</P>
<P>
   He has studied insects at crime scenes since 1981 and is the
head of the entomology department at the San Diego Natural History
Museum. A second forensic entomologist, Dr. Rich Merritt of
Michigan State University, is scheduled to view the maggot samples
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were not studied during Spears' 1992 trial. Faulkner
and Merritt were hired to look at Beaulieu's case by friends of
Spears' wife, Janet -- who married Spears after serving as the
foreman of the jury that convicted him.
</P>
<P>
   Though the jury unanimously convicted Spears of first-degree
murder, she said she was never convinced and was ''beat up
mentally'' by other jurors who were tired and wanted her to make a
final decision. The day after the verdict was read, she told the
judge she'd made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late. Spears was sentenced to death in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Spears, now a third-year law student in San Diego, said
she began visiting Spears after rereading transcripts from his
trial. They were married in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way he could've have killed her is if he killed her
from California,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Spears will have to submit the new maggot theory to
the trial court if they hope to win his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Spears filed a motion himself in Arizona Supreme Court on June
2, saying that his lawyer, Jess Lorona, had mostly ignored him in
the last two years. Lorona did not return messages for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Cattani, chief of the Arizona attorney general's death
penalty appeals unit, refused to discuss the merits of Spears'
claim. Pati Urias, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said
Spears' conviction was fair.
</P>
<P>
   Although Spears was not in Arizona when Faulkner says Beaulieu
was killed -- Jan. 10-12 -- he was in the state on Jan. 4, the day
the state says she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He had flown to Phoenix on Jan. 2 with a one-way airline ticket
purchased by the 39-year-old Beaulieu, and he brought a 9mm handgun
with him, according to court documents. A shell casing determined
to be from that gun was found among the thousands of others at the
shooting range a week and a half after Beaulieu's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Spears drove back to California on Jan. 4 in a truck he bought
from Beaulieu. San Diego authorities found a notarized title from
Beaulieu in the glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence presented during the trial demonstrated that Spears
plotted to kill Beaulieu to steal her truck, guns and about $1,000
the victim obtained through cash advances on her credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see a big error here,'' said Janet Spears. ''My purpose is
not to say the death penalty is wrong. But if you're going to
execute somebody, you'd better be damn sure you've got the right
person.''

<HEADLINE> Life Returns After Cyanide Spill  </HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
<TEXT>
<P>
   CSONGRAD, Hungary (AP) -- For centuries, Hungary's fishermen have
pulled nets bursting with fish from the Tisza River. Five months
after a deadly cyanide killed much of the river's life, fishermen
are dumping buckets of tiny fish back into the waters hoping they
will thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can hardly wait to start to work again,'' Imre Koeroesi,
54, said. ''We haven't been able to fish since last fall, and have
used up all our reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Koeroesi and other fishermen will be allowed to
return to their trade. Fishing has been banned here since more than
130,000 cubic yards of cyanide-laced water leaked from a reservoir
at an Australian-owned gold mine in Romania in January and flowed
into the Tisza, which flows into the Danube and on to the Black
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Koeroesi and other fishermen have worked hard to reintroduce
80,000 tiny catfish. They are confident the fish will flourish and
the Tisza will again provide a livelihood for those who populate
its banks.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 60 species of fish living in the Tisza
were indigenous and are being reintroduced, said Janos Goenczy,
government commissioner overseeing catastrophe-prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a good chance that we can improve the fish stock of
the river,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has set up a task force to evaluate the
extent of damage caused by the cyanide spill and another spill of
heavy metals that followed shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   While cyanide kills instantly, it dilutes fast. Nature was
fortunate that the poisoning occurred in winter before many plants
had sprouted and that it was followed by heavy flood waters that
helped wash out the remaining poisons, said Goenczy.
</P>
<P>
   Fears remain, however, that the impact of the heavy metals may
be felt for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Different living beings reacted differently to the
poisoning,'' said Goenczy. ''In some fish species the damage was
bigger than in others, while the flora was in relative safety,
given the time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries affected -- Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and
Ukraine -- have agreed to set up a monitoring system so they can
alert each other of another such environmental catastrophe, said
Eva Montsko, Goenczy's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian government also plans to sue the Aurul company in
Australia and Romania for damages estimated at about $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishermen believe in the magical healing capacity of the
Tisza, their sole source of living.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who said there'd be no life here for 20 years, shouldn't
have said that,'' said Istvan Gyovai, 50, a fisherman whose deep
tan tells of the hours he's spent on the river.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he realizes that even though nature may heal the Tisza,
it will take years to restore public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it will be harder to make the world believe that
everything -- the water, the fish -- is safe here,'' he said. ''And
everybody is welcome to spend their vacation at this beautiful
place.''

Senate panel backs making leaks of classified material a felony
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly
has endorsed legislation that would make disclosing classified
information to the news media a felony punishable by up to three
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members, led by Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., say
existing laws make prosecutions difficult and don't encompass all
kinds of classified materials, The Washington Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To prosecute leakers under current law, prosecutors must show
they leaked on behalf of a foreign power or divulged ''national
defense'' data, which excludes much important information,
committee members say.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment groups and Attorney General Janet Reno have
opposed the bill, saying criminal prosecutions are not necessarily
the best way to stop leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, along with FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and CIA Director
George J. Tenet, is scheduled to testify Wednesday at a closed
hearing of the Senate committee concerning the bill. The Post,
quoting an unidentified administration official, said Reno would
oppose the bill at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's bill says any government official who
''knowingly and willfully discloses ... any classified
information'' to an unauthorized individual is guilty of a felony
and may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to three
years, Shelby was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Storms Swamp North Dakota  </HEADLINE>
By MATT GOURAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILBY, N.D. (AP) -- Crews from the Grand Forks Air Force Base
arrived in this eastern North Dakota community to help save homes
from flooding after storms that dumped more than a foot of rain in
12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   One man was dead and another missing after a car drove into a
washout late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency shelters were set up as people in Gilby and other
small towns along the Turtle River fought the rising water.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you going to do? If it comes, it comes,'' said Jackie
Irish, who was helping pile sandbags in Gilby, 13 miles northwest
of Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said parts of Grand Forks County got between 6 inches
and 10 inches of rain from Monday's storms. One report from an
observer's rain gauge near Larimore, west of Grand Forks, tallied
17 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really incredible -- almost like a year's worth of rain in
a 12-hour period,'' said Dave Kellenbenz, a National Weather
Service meteorologist in Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dickson, who farms near Gilby, said he lost about half of
his crop to flooding Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is much worse than in '97,'' he said. ''This happening
here to this town now is like the Dow Jones dropping 5,000
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilby rancher Ron Amundson said he got nearly 15 inches of rain
on his farm, and could not get to his pasture to look after his
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a boat to get out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty people from the Grand Forks Air Base were brought in
Tuesday to help with the sandbagging, said Jim Campbell, Grand
Forks County's emergency manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will save that town,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine miles away, residents in Mekinock fled ahead of rising
water. In nearby Manvel, the Turtle River was expected to rise
nearly 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll try and fight and save their homes, but if they see
that they're in danger, they're going to leave,'' said Jim Brink,
an American Red Cross worker.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Forks County sheriff's office said the body of Anthony
Schneider, 25, of Larimore, was recovered in a station wagon that
went into a washout northwest of the town late Monday night. A
26-year-old man who had accompanied Schneider was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jiacoma of Gilby had to be rescued from his home by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both our cars are under water in the shed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brusegaard, a Gilby farmer and volunteer firefighter, said
many basements were flooded by the storm. He said the rain also
washed out a 30- to 40-yard section of Burlington Northern-Santa Fe
railroad tracks south of Gilby. Workers were trying to repair a
washed-out railroad bridge nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Grand Forks itself, which was ravaged by flooding
and fire in 1997, was in no danger, officials said. It got only
about 2 inches of rain from Monday's storm.

<HEADLINE> N.China Fights Expanding Desert  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANGTOUGOU, China, (AP) -- When Du Hanchun was growing up in the
1930s, villagers had to cross a tangle of reeds and willows to get
to the broad banks of the sparkling Chaobai river.
</P>
<P>
   Today the encroaching desert has almost buried Langtougou.
Golden sand drifts up to the eaves of its sturdy, one-story farm
houses and smothers now-barren corn fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not much to do these days. The corn fields are all
gone,'' says Du, a thin man with a steady gaze who in his 75 years
has seen the valley about 100 miles north of Beijing turn bare.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged drought, excessive grazing and timber cutting and the
cultivation of grasslands, riverbanks and mountains with corn and
other grains have made northern China a dust bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth and industrial development drain reservoirs
and underground water tables faster than they can be replenished,
leaving city residents and farmers alike without enough water to
drink or irrigate crops. The scarcity threatens China's ability to
feed itself and is a severe handicap for growing industries.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen massive dust storms scoured northern China this spring
as unusually strong winds swept through vast, arid northern deserts
and sparse grasslands that stretch from Mongolia and northwestern
Xinjiang, 1,500 miles to the northwest, right to Beijing's
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji described the sandstorms as ''an alarm for
the entire nation,'' in a rare television address this month.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-quarter of China, some 1 million square miles, is
desert. Nearly 1,000 square miles is lost to sand each year, mainly
in impoverished areas like Langtougou where inhabitants -- ethnic
Manchurians who traditionally raise corn, horses and goats -- depend
on the land to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these people are having trouble making ends meet. They
can't graze their goats. As you can see, there's no land to farm,''
says Cui Ruixiang, chief engineer for the local Forestry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sand dumped on Langtougou comes from even
worse-affected areas further north in Inner Mongolia, where
burgeoning livestock herds have grazed once plentiful grasslands
bare.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term degradation of the land has been hastened by
drought. Most river and stream beds between Beijing and Langtougou
have dried up.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, in central Anhui, Henan and Hubei provinces, only
10 percent of the normal rainfall has fallen this spring. Streams
and small rivers have run dry; fish ponds and small reservoirs are
hard, cracked mud.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematics of supply and demand spell future trouble: More
than 400 of China's 668 cities are short of water.
</P>
<P>
   In arid Beijing, water consumption has grown 40-fold since the
1950s, along with a booming population, irrigation and industrial
growth. With the city pumping out more water than flows in each
year, the underground water table has dropped to about 135 feet
below the earth's surface from 15 to 30 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In Langtougou, the water table has also dropped from just a few
feet below the surface to about 13 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it falls, we just dig a little deeper,'' says a farmer
surnamed Cui, smiling as he cranks a bucket from the depths of his
farmhouse well.
</P>
<P>
   Langtougou's troubles have drawn special scrutiny because the
Chaobai River, which trickles to the sand's surface further down
the valley, is the source of almost half of Beijing's drinking
water, says Cui, the forester. Zhu and other top Communist leaders
have visited, and promised relief supplies of grain.
</P>
<P>
   Cui is encouraging the villagers to sell their goat herds --
about 2,000 head being grazed on the sparse hills above the valley
-- and buy milk cows to be kept in pens and fed with grass cut from
the hillsides. He hopes to replant the valley with windbreaks of
poplar alternated with patches of grass. Pastures are to be fenced
off to prevent grazing.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the government has ordered bans on logging in many
areas. Marginally productive fields -- plowed under during
ultra-leftist campaigns to plant grain at virtually any cost -- are
being taken out of cultivation and replanted with grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some conservationists believe those plans are unlikely to
succeed unless they accompany broader changes in the cities, where
water remains relatively cheap and the demand for fresh meat seems
insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a connection between the dust storms and ourselves,''
says Liang Congjie, head of the environmental group Friends of
Nature. ''People take eating mutton for granted these days. But the
sheep are grazing pastures bare. To get something, you have to give
something up.''

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cincinnati's Aaron Boone was struck in the
face Tuesday night by a pitch while batting in the seventh inning
and was taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Boone fell to the ground in pain after being hit by the pitch
from San Francisco's Russ Ortiz as teammates and trainers rushed to
tend to him. He appeared to be bleeding from the nose.

several minutes, he was helped to his feet and the crowd gave him a
warm round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Boone then walked off the field with help from trainers, a towel
wrapped around his face.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds third baseman was taken to St. Francis Hospital for

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros set a Los Angeles record with his
229th home run, and Chan Ho Park pitched a five-hitter as the
Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield hit a two-run homer, and Park (8-4) earned his
fifth complete game in 121 career starts and first of the season.
Park won his fourth straight start as the third-place Dodgers
climbed within three games of the NL West-leading Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's loss was its first in five meetings this season with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who tied Ron Cey's record on Saturday, drove a 2-1 pitch
to left filed leading off the eighth against Matt Mantei. It was
his 18th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pitching the final 2 1-3 innings with a blister on his
middle finger, Park retired 14 of his final 15 batters after giving
up a solo home run to Damian Miller with one out in the fifth. Park
struck out four and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Park pitched out of trouble twice in the first three innings
with a runner in scoring position, after being staked to a 2-0 lead
in the first on a leadoff walk to F.P. Santangelo and Sheffield's
18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers increased their lead to 4-1 in the fifth against
Mike Morgan (1-1), who came out of the bullpen to make his second
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo opened the fifth with a single and scored from first
on Mark Grudzielanek's double to right-center. Shawn Green followed
a walk to Sheffield with an apparent double-play grounder to third.
But second baseman Jay Bell's wide relay throw skipped past Travis
Lee, allowing Grudzielanek to score.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield added a sacrifice fly in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan allowed four runs and eight hits in 4 2-3 innings.
Notes: Duke Snider holds the career Dodgers record with 389 home
runs. ... Greg Swindell relieved Morgan and retired all five
batters he faced, extending the Arizona bullpen's string of
consecutive outs to 30 -- three more than the equivalent of a
perfect game. The streak ended when Grudzielanek greeted Russ
Springer with a one-out single to center in the seventh. ... The
Dodgers traded reliever Alan Mills to Baltimore for Al Reyes,
recalled Orel Hershiser from Class A San Bernardino, and demoted
struggling rookie starter Eric Gagne to Triple-A Albuquerque.

<HEADLINE> Expos 9, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero's two-run single keyed a
seven-run third inning for Montreal, as the Expos beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 9-4 in a rain-delayed game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Following a delay of 2 hours, 12 minutes before the game, the
Expos broke out to an 8-0 lead after three innings against Steve
Woodard (1-5) and coasted from there.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro had a two-run double in the third and a solo homer in
the ninth for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pavano (7-3) allowed seven hits and three walks in five
scoreless innings to win for the fourth time in his last six
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Casanova hit his first career grand slam in the eighth
inning off reliever Steve Kline for the Brewers, who had won three
straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos ruined Steve Woodard's return to the starting rotation
with the seven-run third inning, snapping Milwaukee's three-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Already trailing 1-0 on Orlando Cabrera's RBI single in the
second, Woodard allowed the first six batters to reach and five
runs to score before retiring a batter in the third.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of singles and walk loaded the bases before Guerrero hit
a two-run single. Vidro followed with a liner that left-fielder
Geoff Jenkins lost in the lights for a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro scored on Geoff Blum's single. One out later, Cabrera
singled and Pavano sacrificed the runners to second and third.
Peter Bergeron, who led off the inning with a bunt single, hit a
two-run single to knock out Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard gave up eight runs and 11 hits in his shortest start
since going two innings against Seattle on Aug. 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard was making his first start since being banished to the
bullpen May 24. He made seven appearances in long relief before an
injury to right-hander Jeff D'Amico six days ago forced the
pitching-thin Brewers to press Woodard back into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tyler Houston, who started 19 games at catcher, made his
first start at first for Milwaukee. ... Milwaukee's Santiago Perez
double in the second extended the rookie's hitting streak to seven
straight games, a career high. ... Despite playing the game, the
Brewers said rainchecks would be honored to any remaining game,
except the last one at County Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Not Get Arms Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite President Clinton's efforts to build a
legacy in his remaining days in office, he seems likely to become
the first president in decades to fail to negotiate a major
agreement with Moscow on strategic arms.
</P>
<P>
   And with the clock ticking, his job isn't being made any easier
by Republicans in Congress bent on thwarting his negotiating
authority -- or by growing international alarm over U.S. plans for a
national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   This week's disclosure of missing computer hard drives
containing nuclear weapons data at the Los Alamos nuclear
laboratory in New Mexico has only further hardened GOP animosity
toward the Clinton administration's national security policy.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely to spill over into Clinton's attempts to reach
further agreements on nuclear weapons. ''It's an enormous
embarrassment,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, chairman of the
Senate Republican Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has said
any arms-control pact Clinton negotiates this late in his
presidency will be ''dead on arrival'' in his committee.
</P>
<P>
   And, late last week, the Senate added an amendment to a defense
spending bill that would effectively deny Clinton an authority
presidents of both parties before him have had -- the ability to
make unilateral reductions in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic unilateral cuts in the U.S. tactical nuclear forces
deployed in Europe by then-President Bush in September 1991
prompted then-Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw
all tactical weapons from outside Russian territory and to
dismantle thousands of warheads.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the Republican-led Senate was denying Clinton
this authority, it voted to give it to the next president. Senate
Republicans are betting that will be Texas GOP governor, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has recommended deep reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal
-- now at the 7,200 Cold War-vintage level -- whether Russia makes
corresponding cuts or not.
</P>
<P>
   He also has urged Clinton to make no new arms control pacts with
Russia that he might have to renegotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will ignore such a recommendation, but he's
had little luck in coming up with any such agreement, partly
because of his advocacy of a missile-defense program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two leading Senate Democrats on foreign policy issues --
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, and John Kerry of Massachusetts, a committee
member -- have come forth and urged Clinton to leave missile-defense
decisions to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   After opposing Republican plans for a missile defense for most
of the first six years of his presidency, Clinton did an about-face
in late 1998 and agreed to support such a concept. His condition
was that the system be designed to stop a limited missile attack
from what the United States considers ''rogue'' states like North
Korea, Iran or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world changed very vividly when the North Koreans fired
that missile,'' Clinton's top adviser on Russia, Strobe Talbott,
said recently, referring to North Korea's August 1998 launch of a
multistage missile over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has been unable to persuade either Russia or
America's European allies to go along with such a system. Nor is
Russia willing to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to
permit such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has had a chilling effect on arms reduction
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The START II treaty, negotiated by Bush and Gorbachev and
establishing reductions to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads on each side,
has yet to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Russian government has proposed going as low
as 1,500 warheads as part of a future START III agreement, compared
with the 2,000 to 2,500 warhead level the United States has
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic dispute over missile defense has put such talks on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Clinton's appeals for
Russian support to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to
allow such a system.
</P>
<P>
   And, while some White House officials hold out the possibility
of a late-term agreement, Putin is mindful that missile defense and
arms control have become presidential campaign issues and that,
either way, he'll be dealing with someone other than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Reagan and Bush successfully
negotiated major nuclear disarmament agreements with Moscow.
President Carter negotiated one but had to withdraw it from Senate
consideration in 1980 after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would be most tragic about the possible failure of the
administration to conclude an agreement with Russia is that the
opportunity for success has been so great after the end of the Cold
War,'' said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to
Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an arms-control advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> 2 Named To Probe Nuke Material Loss  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The disappearance of nuclear secrets from a
vault at the Los Alamos weapons lab has prompted a criminal
investigation and unleashed another torrent of criticism about
security at the Energy Department, leaving the Clinton
administration scrambling to contain the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which was brought into the case when the Energy
Department learned on June 1 of the disappearance of the nuclear
secrets from the New Mexico facility, was conducting a criminal
probe. The investigation was expected to focus on some two-dozen
individuals who had free access to the highly secured vault where
two computer hard drives that contained the nuclear files were
kept.
</P>
<P>
   Polygraph tests were expected to begin to be administered to
some of the Los Alamos scientists within days, Energy Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders, meanwhile, said they planned to act
today on the nomination of John A. Gordon, the deputy CIA director,
to head a new semi-independent nuclear weapons agency. Gordon's
nomination, held up for months over a disagreement on how much
power the agency should have within the Energy Department, is now
expected to get swift approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the new disclosure that two computer hard drives were
missing at Los Alamos was likely to give Republicans plenty of
ammunition to criticize the Clinton administration's national
security record. And while Energy Secretary Bill Richardson emerged
largely unscathed last from the Wen Ho Lee case, which also
involved missing nuclear secrets, this time Richardson is expected
to be a prime target.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident occurred on his watch. He'll have to be made
accountable,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of investigations into another Los Alamos security flap
is not what Richardson, the most prominent Hispanic in the
administration, had expected as he hopes to remain in contention as
a potential vice presidential running mate to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson moved swiftly to try to regain the offensive in what
is an embarrassing disclosure of security bungling even if the two
computer hard drives -- which contain sophisticated data used to
dismantle an array of U.S. and even Russian nuclear devices -- are
eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In these developments Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Richardson announced that two highly respected elder statesmen
-- former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, R-Tenn., and former
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. -- would investigate the disappearance of
the hard drives and make recommendations on security improvements
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   -- Retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy Department's
top security official, said the FBI was conducting a criminal
investigation of the matter. Twenty-six people had unescorted
access to the vault, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six lab managers, including the chief of nuclear weapons
programs, were placed on leave with pay because of the incident. A
lab spokesman, John Gustafson, said the action was taken ''to
ensure the independence and complete appearance of independence''
of an investigation by the University of California, which manages
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lost no time in attacking the administration on the
latest security bungle. And both House and Senate intelligence
committees and armed services committees announced hearings for
today and Thursday on the missing computer drives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Energy Department has not heeded warnings about the dire
need for security reforms,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., calling
the latest incident ''an unacceptable security breach.'' He
maintained there is some evidence the devices may have been stolen,
but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators remained at a loss about what happened to the hard
drives, which are the size of a deck of cards. Habiger said the
employees who had access to the vault where the drives were stored
were ''dedicated, loyal Americans.'' He expressed doubt that the
devices were stolen and said it was more likely they were misplaced
or accidentally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The devices were found missing on May 7 as scientists sought to
secure them from a massive wildfire threatening the lab complex. A
lab investigation did not begin until May 24, and Energy Department
officials did not learn of the disappearance until June 1,
according to Habiger.
</P>
<P>
   The two drives, which can be used in laptop computers, contained
technical nuclear weapons data used by the Nuclear Emergency Search
Team to dismantle nuclear devices in case of an accident or
terrorist act.

<P>
   A state legislator backed by Virginia's Republican governor won
a very close GOP primary race for an open House seat Tuesday after
a campaign that brought bitter accusations of financial and
personal improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Eric Cantor, a member of the state
House of Delegates, had 20,902 votes, just over 50 percent, while
state Sen. Steve Martin had 20,637 votes, just under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke to Eric Cantor and in that conversation I let him know
that I offered my congratulations pending that recount,'' Martin
told cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor, who had Gov. Jim Gilmore's endorsement, had questioned
Martin's votes on legislative pay and expenses. Martin raised
issues about Cantor's family's dealings in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on a day of primary and runoff elections in five
states, an open House seat from South Carolina drew six GOP
candidates, while two Arkansas Democrats were in a runoff for a
House seat. Virginia also saw a contentious fight for a second open
House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor will face school superintendent Warren Stewart, whom
Democrats nominated at the last minute on Monday in the race to
fill the seat of GOP Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, who is retiring after
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an eastern Virginia House race, Jo Ann Davis, a member of the
House of Delegates, defeated businessman Paul Jost for the GOP
nomination, even though he spent nearly $1 million of his own
money, more than three times the combined total of all four of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Davis had 14,263 votes, or 35
percent, to Jost's 12,155 votes, or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She will face former Fredericksburg mayor Lawrence Davies, a
Democrat, in the November race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Herbert
H. Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   Jost, who also had the governor's endorsement, was attacked by
other candidates who said he supported abortion and gay rights, and
critics mailed out fliers with a photo of two men kissing, labeled
''Paul Jost's Vision of Virginia.'' Jost said he is opposed to
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life
is in danger. On gay rights, his campaign said Jost opposes all
forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest seats up for election Tuesday went unchallenged. No
primary opponents emerged for two-term Democratic Sen. Charles Robb
of Virginia, freshman GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine and
Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, seeking a third full
term. Even North Dakota's seat for governor, open because
Republican Ed Schafer chose not to seek a third term, went without
a primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   A crowded South Carolina race went to a runoff, with state Rep.
Henry Brown taking 44 percent of the vote. His nearest opponent,
former state transportation chairman H.B. ''Buck'' Limehouse, got
33 percent, after Limehouse outspent Brown by nearly 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The seat, in a coastal district, is held by GOP Rep. Mark
Sanford, who is sticking to a campaign pledge to serve just three
terms. Democrat Andy Brack, a former reporter and spokesman for
Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings, is unopposed in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   And in a South Carolina primary that will essentially determine
the general election winner, first-term GOP Rep. James DeMint
easily defeated Frank Raddish. Democrats did not run a candidate in
the heavily GOP district.
</P>
<P>
   With 83 percent of North Dakota precincts reporting, a majority
was voting to keep the state treasurer's post, a proposal that drew
criticism from state treasurers around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And early returns from six western counties showed a mixed
response to a proposal to set their clocks ahead to Central time
and join the eastern part of the state. Two counties endorsed the
plan, while results were pending from the others. Whatever the
vote, county and federal officials must agree on any change.
Several other counties aren't considering a move from Mountain
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a runoff for the Democratic nomination for an Arkansas House
seat, state Sen. Mike Ross defeated former TV reporter Dewayne
Graham 58 percent to 42 percent. Ross will face GOP Rep. Jay Dickey
in the fall.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Moves on Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are pushing forward with
plans for legislation meant to make it easier and cheaper for the
elderly to get prescription drugs, trying to get ahead of President
Clinton on what is bound to be a major election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, the White House will work with us and not against
us as we walk down this path,'' said House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Committee action on legislation could come as early as next
week, Archer said at a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the chief architect,
provided details about a bill Republicans are developing that would
enlist private insurers to sell government-subsidized and approved
prescription drug insurance policies to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the private sector can do a great job,'' Thomas
said, but ''the government will be there if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans highlighted Democratic endorsements for their plan
from Reps. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, and Collin Peterson, D-Minn. Most
congressional Democrats and President Clinton were critical.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday the Republican plan ''claims to help
everybody but is a false hope for most.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were in deficit and trying to do this, I would
understand why we would say, 'Well, we can't help everybody, so
we'll just help a few,''' Clinton said. ''But that's not the
situation. We can afford to do this right.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry itself seems skeptical about the
feasibility of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will withhold judgment on the House Republican proposal
until we see its details. Nevertheless, we continue to believe the
concept of so-called drug-only private insurance simply would not
work in practice,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the Health
Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Clinton of misrepresenting their plan for
political gain. The administration came out with its own proposal
more than a year ago. Polls since have shown that adding drug
coverage, which was omitted from the original Medicare program
created in 1965, has strong public support.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the GOP plan would have several provisions designed
to ensure that help with drug costs would be available to all older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the government would pay insurers 30 percent to
35 percent subsidies to ensure that new drug policies are
affordable to all, not just retirees with the lowest incomes, whose
drug insurance premiums would be paid for directly by Medicare
under both the GOP and Clinton plans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also said the government would act as the ''insurer of
last resort'' if private plans failed to offer adequate coverage
options everywhere across the country. Details of that fall-back
coverage are still being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, out-of-pocket costs would vary
depending on which private plan the patient chose, although all
policies would have to provide minimum benefits and additional
protection from very high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration, Thomas estimated that with the help of
government subsidies, an insurance company could offer a drug
policy with monthly premiums of $35 to $40, a $200 to $250 annual
deductible, 50-percent copays and catastrophic protection covering
out-of-pocket charges after $5,000 to $6,000 in annual spending.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton proposes a standard drug benefit under
Medicare. Those who opted for the coverage would pay a monthly
premium starting at $26, no deductible and a 50 percent co-payment
toward prescriptions. The maximum annual government reimbursement
would be $1,000 at first, eventually rising to $2,500. The premium
too would rise, to a maximum $50.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have proposed including catastrophic coverage like the
Republicans' plan, but it is unclear how much that would increase
retirees' premiums or costs to the government under Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both sides estimate government costs of the new benefit
at around $40 billion over five years.

Lawyer Picked For Clinton Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A lawyer has been selected to argue for President
Clinton's disbarment over his testimony about his relationship with Monica
Lewinksy. Attorney Marie-Bernarde Miller will represent the state panel that
disciplines lawyers in its disbarment petition in circuit court in Little Rock.
Miller said Tuesday that she was hired June 7 but referred all other questions
about the case to the state Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct. The
committee recommended May 22 that Clinton be stripped of his license to practice
law in Arkansas over misleading testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

Number of Refugees Grows Worldwide

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor and wars across

Refugees said more people were living in refugee camps and makeshift housing at
the end of this decade than at the start. In 1990, 29 million people were either
refugees -- defined as people forced to flee their countries -- or internally
displaced residents who leave their homes but not their countries to escape

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Burn Homes in Colorado  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Five air tankers resumed an all-out
attack on a 4,500-acre wildfire in the foothills Tuesday evening
while 430 firefighters used picks, axes and shovels to dig
firebreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The wind-whipped Hi Meadow Fire raced through tinder-dry pine
trees and brush for a second day Tuesday about 35 miles southwest
of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   People forced from their homes watched from a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   After an inspection from the air Tuesday evening, officials said
29 houses scattered throughout several subdivisions had been
destroyed. Earlier Tuesday, officials said at least 39 houses had
been destroyed. No injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire grew by at least 1,000 acres Tuesday afternoon as
flames jumped from tree to tree, causing the fire to move ahead of
firefighters and then started burning back on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Three firefighters suffered minor burns and their truck was
severely damaged Tuesday when the fire advanced faster than
expected, said Lynn Barclay of the incident management team.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 miles north of that fire, high winds also fanned a
nearly 5,000-acre fire, which started west of Loveland on Monday
and has burned at least five structures. About 200 firefighters
worked on that blaze, which was also burning in dry brush and
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Meadow fire is believed to have been sparked by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people in the Pine Junction area remained out of their
homes, a mix of expensive second homes and modest frame and modular
houses owned by people who work in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens declared an emergency, making three counties
eligible for state money and putting the National Guard on alert.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to provide
additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and Mary Sousa and their daughter, Kelly, 8, stuffed two
cars with belongings and left their home near Bailey on Monday.
They were among the few families told they could return Tuesday,
but the Sousas didn't intend to unpack.
</P>
<P>
   ''As fast as that fire moved up the ridge yesterday, one change
in the wind direction and we'll have to get out of here,'' said
Rick Sousa, as he watched the fire smolder while he stood on a
ridge overlooking his home.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, gusts up to 40 mph grounded planes dropping
fire retardant and pushed flames from treetop to treetop. By
evening, the planes were back in the air. ''They're going to hit it
real hard,'' said Barb Perkins, a spokeswoman for the fire
management team.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts also complicated firefighting at the fire near
Loveland, which began with a campfire, Larimer County Sheriff's
Capt. Bill Nelson said. Two buildings believed to be homes have
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters concentrated on protecting the roughly 250 homes
amid stands of ponderosa pine and fir trees. About 420 people were
forced out of their homes and more evacuations were ordered Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado fires are among the latest to erupt in the
Southwest, which is parched from dry, record-breaking hot weather.
In New Mexico late Tuesday, a 300-acre fire near Mora forced 33
families to flee their homes in a trailer park. The blaze died down
later and the residents were expected to return Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is seeing the worst start of a fire season since
1996, the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The season began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing
areas of Florida and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos,
N.M. Some 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million acres have
been recorded nationwide so far, with the drought conditions
getting worse in the West.

<P>
   CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- A propane explosion and fire in a
cooking tent at a religious gathering injured eight people,
including six who were hospitalized in critical condition with
severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   The eight victims had been cooking for followers of Mata
Amritanandamayi, a religious leader visiting from India. About 200
to 300 people were scattered around the area Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The six in the hospital have second- and third-degree burns over
20 percent to 30 percent of their bodies, and were listed in
critical condition. The two others suffered minor injuries, said
Capt. Dave Wheeler of the Alameda County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigators were trying to determine what triggered the
explosion. The fire burned two acres of grassland and was
extinguished in under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also checking to see if the group had the
appropriate permits to set up in the rural area.

<HEADLINE> Kids Gain Weight When PE is Dropped  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Wobbling on a pair of inline skates,
16-year-old Amma Kankam leaned on a classmate and, following her
teachers' instructions, took a few tentative ''step-step-glides''
in an end-of-the-term skating class at Mount Vernon High School.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat gleaming on her forehead, Kankam came to a halting stop
and smiled. She said if she got good enough, she would take up
inline skating this summer. ''That's why I'm trying to learn,'' she
said. As if on cue, she lost her balance and tumbled to the floor.
''She was a lot worse a few days ago,'' said classmate Channaile
Gordon, helping her up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tumbles and collisions -- the kids wear helmets and
protective gear -- Gordon and her classmates said they'd rather
learn skating in PE class than play flag football or softball. ''We
actually want to do this,'' said Lexi Sack, 16. ''It's an easy way
to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   With kids getting more sedentary and obesity among children and
adults now a national health concern, schools all over the country
have started offering skating, aerobics, power-walking and mountain
biking.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not only to get kids interested in gym class, with
its dreaded uniforms and team-picking that agonized the less
athletically inclined kids, but to train them in physical
activities that will keep them from becoming the next generation of
couch potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some physical educators call it ''The New PE.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to bridge that gateway from the school
environment to living a healthy lifestyle when they leave school,''
said Mary Marks, health and physical education coordinator for
Fairfax County public schools in northern Virginia, which has
revamped its physical education program to emphasize lifetime
fitness. ''We hope that kids will like the activities and continue
on in their adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic rise in childhood obesity -- 10 percent to 15 percent
of American kids are overweight or obese, double the number in 1980
-- has occurred as many states have dropped requirements that kids
take gym class every day, as recommended by the U.S. surgeon
general.
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 percent of adolescents are taking one or more gym
classes a week, according to a recent University of North Carolina
study that said gym class cutbacks were partly to blame for the
rise in overweight kids.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is the only state that still requires daily gym class
and four years of PE for high schoolers. Virginia requires two
years; many states require just one year of PE to graduate and let
kids in band or ROTC slide.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Illinois, schools can get around the requirement.
Nineteen percent of the state's 895 school districts have received
waivers for the daily requirement to devote more time for other
classes or because they don't have proper facilities for PE
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to improve test scores, school officials say they
have to cut back on gym to free up class time for math, reading and
other core subjects. Chicago public school officials wanted to
reduce PE requirements to two years for high schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were asking, 'Do our kids need to be playing or
studying?''' said Tom Hernandez, spokesman for the state education
board.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a decline in mandatory PE classes is just one of
many factors contributing to the problem of overweight kids.
Computer games and TV keep kids indoors; busy parents with no time
to cook rely on fast or prepared foods that are loaded with fat;
kids left alone after school are filling up on junk food, and
children in high-crime areas stay away from neighborhood
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are all changes that have occurred simultaneously with
the epidemic,'' said William Dietz, CDC's nutrition and physical
activity czar.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who don't get enough exercise could be at greater risk for
diabetes, heart disease and other ailments, so teaching them to
stay active when they're young is important to staving off health
problems later in life, says Fairfax County's Marks.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of physical education has even gotten the
attention of lawmakers in Congress. Several are pushing to add a
$400 million grant program to expand and improve PE in public
schools to an education funding bill now before Congress.

<HEADLINE> GOP Concerned About UAW Holiday  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Election Day this November will be a holiday
for some 400,000 autoworkers, and that has Republicans concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday, written into major United Auto Worker contracts for
this year and 2002, will make it easier for those workers to vote --
and to help in get-out-the-vote efforts. And they're mostly in the
Midwest where close contests in big states could end up deciding
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett said, ''It certainly
puts us at a competitive disadvantage for the volunteers needed for
Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't really, exactly happy when you put 400,000 additional
Democratic grass-roots people in the field -- although let me say
I'm well aware that the Republicans are getting about 40 percent of
the labor vote and we'll appeal to pro-Republican union members,''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Center for Applied
Politics at the University of Akron, said having more autoworkers
voting and volunteering on Nov. 7 could have a major impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The UAW workers will make the most difference where the
election is the closest, where there is a 2 to 3 percent
difference,'' Green said. ''And the industrial Midwest will be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The holiday provision was written into contracts the United Auto
Workers agreed to last year with the Big Three automakers and
Delphi Automotive System. About 400,000 UAW members nationwide work
for the Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler -- and
for Delphi, GM's former parts unit, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest totals are for Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, with
substantial numbers for Missouri, Wisconsin, New York and Illinois,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler ''considers this the largest soft
money contribution in American political history,'' said John
Truscott, a spokesman for the Republican governor. ''Companies will
have to pay salary and benefits for them to go out and campaign for
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democratic Chairman David Leland sees things differently.
He says the Republican concerns suggest the GOP is ''afraid of the
electorate. I think anything we can do to encourage voter
participation helps the democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the idea of taking Election Day off is to
increase voter turnout -- not to help a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about Democrat and Republican -- it's about people.
Getting people in the right place on the right day,'' said Willie
Hubbard, president of UAW Local 1250, in suburban Cleveland, which
represents 4,200 workers at a Ford engine plant.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krell, communications director for the UAW at its Detroit
headquarters, agreed. ''Many countries have their election days off
and most countries have a much higher voter participation than we
do,'' he said. ''It's not about partisanship, it's about
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has not endorsed Gore, and its president Stephen Yokich,
said the union should consider alternatives such as Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader after Gore backed normalizing trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bennett, the Ohio Republican chairman, said union leaders
and the Democratic Party are ''synonymous.''

   He said he, too, strongly supports voter participation but
doesn't like one party getting an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has suggested the Republicans include making Election
Day a national holiday in their party platform this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That idea doesn't seem to have received much attention from the
GOP at a national level. A Republican National Committee
spokeswoman working on party platform issues hadn't heard of
Bennett's idea when asked about it.

<HEADLINE> Bus With Sri Lankan Troops Explodes  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suicide bomber rammed his bicycle
into a bus carrying 25 military troops Wednesday, killing himself
and two civilians on a highway that links the capital with the
international airport, witnesses and police said.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide bomber and two passers-by were killed and another
six civilians were injured, police said. None of the air force
soldiers were hurt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police blamed the explosion on the Tamil Tiger rebels fighting a
separatist war since 1983 to establish an independent homeland for
the Tamil minority.
</P>
<P>
   The male bomber attacked the bus at Wattala, about six miles
north of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   An evasive action by the bus driver minimized the impact as the
blast damaged the rear portion of the vehicle. ''He managed to
swerve his vehicle, thus not allowing the bomber to hit the target
properly,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Arun Roy, said he was several cars behind the bus
when it exploded just after 7 a.m. north of Colombo on the road to
Bandaranaike International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suddenly heard a loud explosion,'' he said. ''I saw car
tires and vehicle tires and bodies flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been blamed for a series of suicide bombings and
other attacks in the capital, including a suicide bombing last week
that killed a Cabinet minister and 22 others.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers are posted at checkpoints throughout the capital and
other cities to guard against terrorist attacks, while 40,000
government troops are fighting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
for control of the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have cut off land access to the peninsula, forcing
the government to supply its troops on the peninsula by air and
sea.

of the Democratic Party's Platform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. James Hunt and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend will be in charge of the panel responsible for
drafting the document, party officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials want the platform to emphasize ''progress

<P>
   The platform, which spells out the party's goals and principles,
will be ratified during the Democratic National Convention, Aug.
14-17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The committee leadership represents geographic, gender and
ethnic diversity, an important theme at every Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, who hails from a key battleground state, has been
mentioned as a possible running mate for Gore and is viewed as
strong on child health issues. Belton has long been involved in
women's issues and co-founded a shelter for battered women. Hunt is
a Southern moderate in his fourth term and a possible vice
presidential pick. Townsend is a daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sun Media CEO Godfrey Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Paul Godfrey has resigned as chief executive
officer of Sun Media Corp., to be replaced on an interim basis by
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, 61, made the announcement to the newspaper's staff
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that I have accomplished at the Sun what I set out to
do and I want to explore new and exciting challenges,'' he said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mulroney temporarily adds the CEO title to his position as
chairman of the board of Sun Media. The search for a permanent
successor begins immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Media, taken over by Montreal-based newspaper and printing
giant Quebecor Inc. in January 1999, is the second-largest
newspaper company in Canada in terms of circulation, behind the
Southam group owned by Hollinger Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey will remain on the Sun Media board, and said he will
continue to work to bring a National Football League franchise to
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A chemical engineer by training, Godfrey spent almost two
decades in municipal politics before becoming publisher of the
Toronto Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Under Godfrey, the Sun group grew from four newspapers to
include eight metro dailies, eight community dailies and 174 weekly
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Paterson family filed federal lawsuit against school district  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The parents of a Paterson boy have filed a
federal lawsuit against the school district, claiming the learning
disabled student was deprived of his right to a ''free and
appropriate education'' because the district did not enter him into
special education.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed last month in U.S. District Court
here, the student, now 19, was first diagnosed with ''receptive and
expressive language delays'' when he was 3.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his education, speech pathologists at St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center and the district's own psychologists
re-evaluated him, finding that he had limited verbal skills and
difficulty understanding information. They recommended special
education.
</P>
<P>
   But the Paterson Board of Education ignored those reports until
he turned 17, according to Mary Hartnett, an attorney at the
Rutgers Special Education Clinic in Newark, who is representing the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The student received failing grades throughout grammar school,
but continued to be promoted into high school. When his mother
voiced concern, teachers told her the student was doing fine,
Hartnett said.
</P>
<P>
   After a social worker intervened in 1997, the student was
reclassified as ''educable mentally retarded.'' In 1999, the school
board agreed to pay for his education at a private school in Bergen
County, where he is performing at the third-grade level, Hartnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We filed the lawsuit because we didn't think any amount of
education would make up for all the years he lost,'' Hartnett told
the Herald and News of West Paterson for Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The student's identity, as well as that of the parents, was kept
confidential in the lawsuit. The family is also suing a series of
school officials who evaluated their son or participated in his
education - including former state commissioners of education,
school superintendents, principals, teachers and psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gillman, an attorney for the Paterson school board,
declined to comment on the case until the district files a formal
response.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our preliminary investigation indicates that the district
expects to be denying the charges,'' Gillman said. ''Regardless of
the litigation, the district is working with the child and his
parents to give him an appropriate education.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor's license revoked by state Health Department  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - The medical license of a Chautauqua
County doctor has been revoked following charges of moral unfitness
and willful abuse of patients.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Health Department's Professional Medical
Conduct office, Dr. Dan G. Alexander fondled patients on more than
one occasion and improperly filed medical records.
</P>
<P>
   In a 37-page review, the board said the obvious penalty for
Alexander was revocation of his license. The respondent must be
punished for heinous and immoral patient abuse, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patients to testify against Alexander was Debra Kost,
from Frewsburg in Chautauqua County, who along with her husband,
Robert, filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against the doctor in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   She became his patient on Nov. 6, 1995, and later accused
Alexander of overmedicating her and of sexual molestation. The
Kosts dropped their lawsuit earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kost said she was happy the state found Alexander guilty of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Barber of the Albany law firm Murphy, Burns, Barber and
Murphy, who represented Alexander during the hearings, said an
aggressive appeal was planned.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moving Through Pentagon Bills  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to pay for Pentagon programs next
year is advancing in Congress with Senate passage of a $287.4
billion spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure, one of 13 appropriations bills
needed to keep the government functioning after next Oct. 1, by a
lopsided 95-3 vote Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It now goes to a House-Senate conference panel, which will
reconcile it with the House version passed last week, which is
roughly $1 billion higher.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions include a 3.7 percent military pay raise, $4.6
million for continued development of a missile defense system and
funds for buying 10 F-22 Raptor aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate was turning to separate legislation
dealing with Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the spending bill, the Senate rejected, on a
65-32 vote, an amendment by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., that would have stopped the Pentagon from leasing
more executive jets for its top brass.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon already leases six executive jets and wants $48.6
million for six more, Harkin said. ''There is no justification for
additional luxury jets to ferry generals and admirals around from
meeting to meeting,'' said Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, said the leasing program was an attempt to save taxpayers
money ''to lease aircraft instead of replacing them,'' as do ''most
major businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final 95-3 vote, Sens. Boxer, Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., were the ''no'' votes. Not voting were
Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Senate approved another amendment by Boxer that
would restrict the Pentagon's use of powerful pesticides on
installations where there are children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is a $3 billion increase over the Clinton
administration request.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, suggested he may
seek to withhold aid to Israel -- or at least delay it -- to protest
Israel's decision to sell advance radar to China.
</P>
<P>
   His panel considers the legislation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building an aircraft for China and equipping it with
the U.S.-developed PHALCON airborne early warning radar system at a
cost of $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan previously suggested that $2.8 billion in aid to Israel
be cut by that $250 million. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
earlier this week voiced opposition to any such linkage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Callahan said that he would propose instead to hold
up the early disbursement of Israel's aid money for the time being.
Israel traditionally gets the money up front, in the first two
weeks of each new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would ''give the administration time to negotiate
what we hope will be an acceptable result.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the administration a possible way out, saying that if
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ''wants to issue a statement
saying it's not a threat to our national security, then the issue
is over with.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Daryl Johnston To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Two days after Steve Young walked away from
football to protect his health, Dallas Cowboys fullback Daryl
Johnston is doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. Wednesday at
Texas Stadium to announce he's leaving the game rather than take
any more hits on his fragile neck.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's rugged blocking opened holes for Emmitt Smith and
protected Troy Aikman as the Cowboys won Super Bowl titles
following the 1992, '93 and '95 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, those same hits ultimately led to a herniated disc in
his neck that cut short his 1997 season after six games, then
limited him to one game last season, his 11th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston has been expected to retire since doctors discovered
those complications.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement will save the team about $544,000 toward the
salary cap this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston and Young are both represented by agent Leigh
Steinberg, who has encouraged players to walk away while still
healthy enough to enjoy life after football.
</P>
<P>
   By running behind Johnston, Smith became one of the NFL's most
prolific runners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's definitely the best -- he was for me,'' Smith
said. ''He can handle his own against anyone else in the league. I
think he's done a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston became a fan favorite throughout the NFL. Stadiums
across the country roared his nickname ''Moose'' whenever he got a
rare carry or caught a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's grunt work was so appreciated that the Pro Bowl began
inviting true fullbacks and picked him in 1993 and '94, the first
two years under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas picked Johnston in the second round of the 1989 draft,
after making Aikman the No. 1 overall pick. Johnston played 149
straight games before undergoing surgery six weeks into the 1997
season to fuse two vertebrae in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to play every game in '98, then lasted only one week
into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Johnston had 753 yards rushing and 2,227 yards
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Johnston and Deion Sanders further distances
Dallas from its NFL champion teams of the mid-1990s -- with one more
loss likely to come.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Michael Irvin also is expected to retire because of a
neck problem. However, he is not under contract, so he is facing no
deadline to decide.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Look To Tie Series in Game 4  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sam Perkins has been around long enough to
know when the wind is shifting. Midway through the NBA Finals, he
thinks the breeze is at the Indiana Pacers' backs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the playoffs, momentum is everything,'' the 15-year veteran
said. ''Hopefully, we're starting to feel that momentum. We're like
a race car. We're speeding up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off a 100-91 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 3
on Sunday, Indiana can tie the best-of-seven series with a victory
in Game 4 tonight at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   While the refreshed, relaxed Pacers are talking like they have
all the answers, the Lakers are struggling with several unpleasant
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will Glen Rice get benched again by coach Phil Jackson, further
infuriating Los Angeles' third-leading scorer?
</P>
<P>
   Will Kobe Bryant's sprained left ankle prevent him from playing
at full speed?
</P>
<P>
   Will O'Neal continue to brick nearly two of every three free
throws he attempts?
</P>
<P>
   And even if all three of those fears are realized, will that be
enough to stop the Lakers from taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the
series?
</P>
<P>
   ''This team has dealt with a lot of distractions this year,''
forward Robert Horry said. ''The stuff that's going on now is just
more of the same. We're not worried. We still have Phil on the
bench, and we still have the big guy in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these distractions faze the Pacers, who have recovered a
wealth of confidence after two losses in Los Angeles last week.
While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Jalen Rose repeatedly used
phrases like ''When we tie the series'' and ''When it's 2-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second, Jalen. Don't you mean ''if'' the Pacers win Game
4?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's when,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting for the opportunity to play for a
championship in the NBA since I was in middle school. Now that
we've got that chance, we're not just going to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers want to seize that opportunity by putting extra
pressure on Bryant, who planned to play after missing all but 7{
minutes of the last two games. Los Angeles' star guard was walking
easily on his sprained ankle, but as Jackson said earlier, the
joint won't be fully healed until the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   While Bryant's ankle likely is strong enough for him to play and
contribute on offense, he could be limited in his defensive
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have to focus on more angles and position as opposed to
using my athleticism most of the time,'' Bryant said. ''I'll
probably be limited when I come back. So what? I've just got to
find a way to get around it. We've dealt with adversity all season
long. We'll deal with it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's physical health might be less troublesome to the Lakers
than Rice's mental state. On Tuesday, Rice remained embroiled in a
clash with Jackson, a controversy further fueled by comments from
Rice's wife alleging that Jackson is biased against her husband
because he failed to trade Rice for Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's frustration, you try to keep it in the community.
But when it seeps out, you have to do some damage control,'' Lakers
forward Rick Fox said. ''And we're dealing with that now, here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rice brouhaha may be forgotten if O'Neal dominates Game
4 the way he did the series' first two games. O'Neal followed a
43-point performance in Game 1 with a 40-point outing two nights
later. He had 33 points, but also another terrible night on the
foul line, on Sunday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has taken 58 free throws in the series, making just 22.
It's a weakness as big as the man himself, and it's one of the few
areas of soft underbelly on the Lakers -- other than their
ever-fluctuating mental state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers said they expect to foul O'Neal with regularity, as
they did in the series' last two games. Shaq said that's fine with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just vital that I go up to the line and make them like I
did in the first, second and third (playoff) series,'' O'Neal said.
''If we want to win the whole thing, I have to step up and do it.
And I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Lakers, including O'Neal, backed up Jackson's statement
that the Rice controversy is ''not a distraction to us. That's
nothing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice didn't agree, admitting ''it plays with your head a little
bit.'' Still, he said the relationship between himself and Jackson
was not a ''bad'' one, while Jackson said the two have had a good
relationship all year.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice's wife sees it differently. In an article published
Tuesday in the Los Angeles Times, she claimed Rice was being used
as a pawn by Jackson in his dealings with Lakers owner Jerry Buss
and team president Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jackson has never wanted Glen, he's always wanted somebody
like Scottie Pippen, and this is his way of getting back at
management for not letting him make a trade,'' she said. ''This is
Jackson's way of showing the people on top of him who is in
control. It's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all a mind game. It's all about control. Jackson did not
get his way with the general manager or the owner about trading
Glen, so who pays for it? Glen does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's wife, Christina Fernandez Rice, said she counseled her
husband to keep quiet about the situation -- until she thought it
was hurting the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many players would have stayed as quiet for as long as
Glen has? But finally, when the team is affected, you have to say
something,'' she said. ''Now if it was me, I would have already
been Latrell Sprewell II.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his wife's comments, Rice said he agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely. Why not?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 will be Friday night in Indianapolis before the series
shifts back to Los Angeles, if necessary, for Game 6 on Monday
night and Game 7 next Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Set the Standard in Golf  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus doesn't hear the
footsteps, even as he prepares for what is likely his last U.S.
Open on a course that has loved him almost as much as he loves it.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has never been much at looking back and reflecting on
his time in the game. And he's not about to start peeking over his
shoulder and wondering whether Tiger Woods can someday threaten his
record of 18 major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I keep track of his vs. mine?'' Nicklaus asked. ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the greatest golfer in modern history, Nicklaus helped
cement his stature with a win at Pebble Beach in the 1961 U.S.
Amateur and another in the 1972 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods is to eventually pass Nicklaus, he might find Pebble
Beach just as inviting to his chances of winning his first Open and
his third major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nicklaus, playing in his 44th Open, will be standing
by, keeping count.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poor Tiger. I mean, the first time he wins a tournament, 'OK,
Tiger, only 19 more to go,''' Nicklaus said. ''Poor kid has that
sitting in front of him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, of course, is favored to win his first Open, and it would
be fitting if it came at Pebble Beach. He's on a run reminiscent of
Nicklaus at his best, winning won 11 of his last 20 tour events,
including Nicklaus' Memorial two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The seaside links is not only the course where Nicklaus says he
would play if he only had one round of golf left, but is also a
favorite of Woods. Tiger first played here as a 13-year-old who
couldn't believe how long the course seemed.
</P>
<P>
   An Open win would give Woods three major titles in his first
four years as a pro, just one shy of the four Nicklaus held after
four years on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus might not be aware of it, but Woods certainly is. Woods
used to keep a list on his bedroom wall of Nicklaus'
accomplishments, and he knows where he stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty close,'' Woods said. ''I know he has probably two
more majors, or maybe three, whatever it is. It's been pretty good
and that's pretty remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as remarkable as the career of Nicklaus has been the play
of Woods, whose dominance over the past year included winning his
second major title at last year's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Longevity, though, will be the key to Woods' chances of catching
Nicklaus, whose major titles stretch 24 years from the 1962 Open to
the 1986 Masters. Nicklaus has played in 156 majors, and was
runner-up 19 times and in the top 10 a total of 71 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jack has obviously set the bar up pretty high for everyone to
try to chase after,'' Woods said. ''And to win as many majors as he
has and the record he has in the major championships is very
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 60, Nicklaus isn't expected to be a factor in what
will be his last Open unless the USGA grants him another exemption.
At the age of 24, though, Woods is only getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am playing pretty good right now,'' Woods said Tuesday
before a practice round on the picturesque course that straddles
rugged cliffs against the Pacific Ocean. ''I've played some pretty
good rounds and I've shot some pretty good numbers. And it just
kind of makes you believe that you're heading in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That piece of news may not be greeted with enthusiasm by the
other 155 players in a field that includes nine former champions
and the biggest group of amateurs (seven) since the 1985 Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus won the first Open at Pebble Beach in 1972, while 1982
winner Tom Watson and 1992 winner Tom Kite are also on hand.
</P>
<P>
   They will face a course that has changed since the last Open,
with a newly redesigned par-3 5th hole and a par of 71 after the
second hole was trimmed from a par-5 to a par-4.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is the deep rough the USGA loves to grow on
Open courses, and tiny greens that will be tough to hit if the wind
doesn't blow and almost impossible to get on if it does.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will try to probably leave it 20 or 30 yards short on some
greens so I have uphill chips and feel like I can get those
up-and-down,'' said Phil Mickelson, who finished second last year
when Payne Stewart sank a 15-foot putt to win at Pinehurst.
''There's probably going to be about six or seven greens where I
won't even try to hit them, if you can imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's death in a bizarre plane accident last October hangs
over this tournament, with players gathering Wednesday on the 18th
hole to whack balls into the ocean in a tribute to the late
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Then they will try to put aside those thoughts and concentrate
on the challenge at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just difficult sometimes to think about last year and
what took place and recall all the events,'' Mickelson said.

<HEADLINE> Sea of Cortez To Be Preserved  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A. Bates Butler III has been fishing for 30
years in Mexico's Sea of Cortez, once teeming with grouper,
hammerhead sharks, yellowfin tuna, barracuda and manta rays.
</P>
<P>
   Exploited and overfished, the sea -- also known as the Gulf of
California -- is now in danger of becoming barren. Butler, a former
U.S. attorney, and a group of Arizonans and Sonorans have formed a
nonprofit organization to help Mexico preserve its marine
resources.
</P>
<P>
   They'll discuss the sea's precarious health and urge Mexico to
create a Sonora Marine Park near Guaymas, Mexico, when the
Arizona-Mexico Commission meets here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see the sailfish that we used to see, we don't see
the marlin, the dorado are down. We haven't caught a tuna in the
last two summers,'' said Butler, a member of the commission. ''And
if something isn't done soon to protect the natural resources -- the
fish and other sea life -- there will not be a commercial fishing
industry and there will not be a sports fishing industry or a dive
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say commercial fishing in the sea has overharvested many
species, particularly through tuna boats that employ miles-long
baited lines or so-called gill nets, indiscriminately snaring and
killing marlin, dorado and sailfish as well as tuna.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is not with the fishing but the way it's being
done,'' said Francis Gilbert, development director for the Sonoran
Sea Aquarium being planned in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, too many small shrimping boats, and commercial
shrimp farming, have placed intense pressure on the shellfish. Some
mangrove swamps or estuaries -- critical natural habitat for shrimp,
crabs, fish and plant life -- have been eliminated by commercial
shrimp farms and by development.
</P>
<P>
   Mangrove trees are cut for wood, and polluted waste waters
discharged from shrimp farms alter the brackish water's delicate
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main problems are the economical problems of this
country,'' said Artemisa Castro, a marine resource management
scientist in Guaymas who has spent her last 15 years focusing on
the Sea of Cortez. Until early this year, she ran Mexico's National
Shrimp Research Program in Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ''Possible destruction of some species is only an environmental
consequence, but the real cause is our economic policies which
drive us to different management strategies,'' she said. ''It has a
lot to do with the society and the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions mean the long-term future of the sea is being
sacrificed for the immediate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make things change,'' Castro said. ''Things will
never change from top to bottom, they have to change from bottom to
top.''

<HEADLINE> Assad Buried in Home Village  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- World leaders brought to Syria by death
took time for the Mideast peace process, holding talks alongside
the funeral services for Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright bowed her head briefly
before Assad's casket Tuesday and then conferred privately with
Bashar Assad, the heir apparent of the president who died Saturday
at 69, for about 20 minutes. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
had quarreled bitterly with Assad, saluted before the coffin, then
kissed the son, clasping his hand and speaking for a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Albright emerged with a pledge from Bashar Assad to stick close
to his father's line on peace talks with Israel. Little more could
be expected of Assad's son, who at this stage must step carefully
while shoring up his support base.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, Assad was laid to rest Tuesday in the tiny
mountain village of Qardaha. Thousands of people converged outside
the mosque Assad built to honor his mother in his hometown, 125
miles northwest of Damascus. The soldier-pallbearers struggled to
keep mourners from pushing forward to kiss the flag-draped coffin,
trying to create order so prayers for the dead could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''His death is a national catastrophe,'' said Hafez al-Shuraiqi,
69, a former schoolmate of the president. ''Qardaha is proud of its
son. He was a great man, loyal to his friends, loyal to his country
and loyal to his ideals. I shall miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   After prayers at the mosque, Hafez Assad was entombed next to
his eldest son Basil in a grand mausoleum on a hill overlooking
Qardaha. Basil Assad died in a 1994 car crash, and it was then that
Assad began grooming Bashar to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad was meeting Albright and several high-level
visitors for the first time Tuesday. Others he had met before on
trips in the region as his father's envoy.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac greeted Bashar Assad warmly. The
two met in November when Bashar Assad traveled to France on his
first trip outside the Arab world on an errand for his father.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met with al-Sharaa on Tuesday,
saying their talks focused on relations between the two nations and
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's longtime leader committed himself to negotiations when
he joined multilateral peace talks in Madrid in 1991. But little
progress has been made on the Syria-Israel track since then.
</P>
<P>
   The United States managed to revive those talks last year, but
they stalled in January. Syria wanted assurances that Israel would
withdraw from the Golan Heights and withdraw to borders from before
the 1967 Mideast war in which Israel won the strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Israel refused to make such a pledge and insisted that security
and normalization issues be spelled out first.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, in Luxembourg for a meeting
with European Union foreign ministers, said he hopes a new Syrian
president will opt for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it will be in Syria's interest to continue with
the policy they have followed for the past 30 years,'' Levy said
Tuesday. ''We hope a new, young president ... will choose peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria's longing for the Golan was underscored even amid the
mourning. Among the dignitaries at the funeral was Hassan
Nasrallah, whose Hezbollah guerrillas took credit for pushing
Israeli troops from south Lebanon three weeks ago. When Nasrallah
arrived at the palace where Assad lay in state, the Syria TV
announcer said, ''Thank God you saw the south (of Lebanon)
liberated ... We will liberate our Golan, God willing.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's funeral also brought about scenes reminiscent of feuding
relatives' calling a truce after a death in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had a greeting kiss for Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlass, who less than a year ago called Arafat ''the son of 60,000
whores'' for making concessions to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's relationship with Syria, where many rival Palestinian
factions are based, has been hostile for years because Assad viewed
Arafat as failing to be steadfast against Israel. But with the
possibility of a final Palestinian-Israeli deal, many regional
equations are being rethought.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat stopped on the way to the palace for a brief meeting with
Nayef Hawatmeh, head of the Damascus-based Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. The DFLP was one of the staunchest
opponents of reconciliation with Israel in the 1970s, but recently
renounced violence in favor of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of rifts not mended, however, Rifaat Assad made his
own claim to power even before his estranged brother was buried.
Rifaat, who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to seize
power in 1983, told The Associated Press in Beirut through a
spokesman that he planned to return to Damascus at the
''appropriate time'' to contest his nephew's leadership.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Uncle Has Little Backing  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATAKIA, Syria (AP) -- Rifaat Assad once had a following here.
But no more.
</P>
<P>
   The home region of the late President Hafez Assad rallied around
his son and all-but-certain successor Bashar Assad on Tuesday,
rejecting the claim by Assad's exiled brother Rifaat that he is the
rightful heir.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot even say that man's name,'' said Nizam Nameh, a
48-year-old engineer in Qardaha, the Assads' home village outside
the northern port city of Latakia. ''Instead of coming here to give
his condolences, he is speaking such trash. Bashar has our full
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The feud erupted on the eve of Assad's funeral when Rifaat, who
has been banished since 1984 and stripped of all official posts,
said through a spokesman he would return to Syria and challenge
Bashar's claim to leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's ruling Baath Party, the parliament and the military all
have thrown their support behind Bashar Assad, whom his father had
groomed to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear where Rifaat, who has been living in Europe, was
Tuesday as his brother was being buried. Reports said Syrian
officials have ordered Rifaat's arrest if he tries to return.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Syrians appear to be backing Bashar as well.
</P>
<P>
   Imad Ballan, a 42-year-old shopowner in Latakia, admitted he
felt initial alarm when he heard Rifaat was planning to return. But
Ballan, wearing black mourning clothes and carrying a picture of
Bashar Assad, soon shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter. He has no following, no popular base,'' he
said. ''Nobody takes him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old Rifaat made his reputation as a loyal and
ruthless enforcer for his brother. In 1982, he led crack army units
in an assault that crushed an uprising by Muslim fundamentalists in
the northern city of Hama. The death toll reportedly came to more
than 20,000, though it was never officially disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year, as Hafez Assad lay in a hospital recuperating
from a heart attack, Rifaat's tanks began maneuvering on the
streets of Damascus in moves that were seen as an attempted coup.
Relations between the brothers rapidly cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Rifaat's latest threats to seize power, authorities
were moving against him. In October, army troops cracked down on
his supporters in Latakia, reportedly resulting in hundreds being
killed and wounded. Syrian officials never commented, but Rifaat's
military power base was believed to have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his estrangement, Rifaat has returned to Syria for other
family funerals. In 1992 he came for the burial of the family
matriarch, Na'isa. And he returned for the 1994 funeral of Basil
Assad, the president's eldest son who died in a traffic accident --
spoiling Assad's hopes that his firstborn would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In Qardaha, retired Brig. Ali Sfeir, 59, said most in the area
saw Rifaat Assad's claim to power as baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Assad gave us stability,'' he said. ''It's an
inheritance we will not squander.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Team Survives in Tenn. City  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- When Lincoln Ziyenge says he'll do almost
anything to play soccer, he means it.
</P>
<P>
   The man who grew up playing with a plastic bottle stuffed with
newspaper as a soccer ball makes the four-hour trip from
Huntsville, Ala., at least three times a week to play for the
Tennessee Rhythm of the United Soccer Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep his amateur status, the Zimbabwe native does it for
free -- not even gas money for his Oldsmobile, which is pushing
150,000 miles after a year of commuting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just the circumstances that I have to deal with for the
love of the game,'' said Ziyenge, who is working on a marketing
degree at the University of Alabama-Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Love of the game is the only reason the Rhythm, the oldest
franchise in the USL, still exists in a city where the NFL's
Tennessee Titans, the NHL's Nashville Predators and Southeastern
Conference collegiate teams attract most sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rhythm began as the Nashville Metros in 1989, the team
was only the second professional franchise in the city. The other
was the Triple-A Nashville Sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Metros worked their way up the USL ladder and spent years
getting a contract with the city and a home field.
</P>
<P>
   Just when they felt established, two of the team's owners
withdrew their financial support last year three weeks before the
season started.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing not to give up, general manager Devinder Sandhu and
original partner Lynn Agee found two more partners, asked a player
to serve as coach, then recruited new players to the 25-member
team.
</P>
<P>
   They also moved to a new field at Battle Ground Academy, a
private prep school 14 miles south of Nashville, and renamed the
team the Tennessee Rhythm -- playing off Nashville's notoriety as
the capital of country music.
</P>
<P>
   Few thought the patchwork team would win a game, but the Rhythm
went 11-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're like Jason from the horror movie,'' said Sandhu, an
engineer and former Vanderbilt University soccer player. ''You
never know if we're dead. We just keep coming back and coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Brett Mosen, the team's coach in 1995, was hired back for
the current season, which runs through September.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a challenging job without a doubt, with the type of
players we're having to bring in, obviously with less experience,''
he said. ''But that's something I'm quite prepared to step up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhythm play in the A-League, just a step below Major League
Soccer. MLS teams can borrow A-League players, and the Colorado
Rapids did just that with midfielder Danny Devall this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee plays the Dallas Burn on June 14 in the second round
of the U.S. Open Cup, a competition open to everyone from church
teams to MLS members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at it as an opportunity to prove there's not
such a huge gap as people believe been MLS and A-League,'' Mosen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But beating the Burn might be easier than the winning over more
fans in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans and Predators attract most of the attention. The
Sounds and the Nashville Kats of the Arena Football League get the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhythm average about 1,000 fans per home game in Franklin, a
city in Tennessee's richest county and where youth soccer has grown
in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials are trying free passes, an Internet site and
advertisements geared at groups that follow non-traditional sports,
but game attendance remains low.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors could help, too, but those also are difficult
to get, president Dan Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the sponsorship money has just about been absorbed by the
Predators, Titans and the Kats,'' Lucas said. ''We cannot compete
with those types of organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rhythm will continue to use the personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are invited onto the field after games to meet players and
get autographs. Teams can get personal lessons from a player or
coach for a negotiable fee.
</P>
<P>
   It's a labor of love for players like Ziyenge, who coaches
Alabama-Huntsville's women's soccer team to make ends meet. Only
the coach and two other team officials get full-time salaries, so
most players work full-time jobs around their practice and game
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   That proves tricky when there's a game in San Diego or
Vancouver, but Ziyenge says it's worth the hassle and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my favorite game and I would do almost anything to get to
play,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Messier, Lemieux, Tocchet Available  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild
will get a chance to pick up a six-time Stanley Cup champion: Mark
Messier.
</P>
<P>
   Messier was left unprotected Tuesday by the Vancouver Canucks
and is available to the newest expansion teams when they stock
their rosters at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   If chosen, Messier might never play with the first-year teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't change our hope to sign him and it doesn't change
our desire to get him back,'' Canucks general manager Brian Burke
said. ''I don't think it was logical to protect him and certainly
lose a player.''
</P>
<P>
   With two years left on a contract scheduled to pay $6 million
per season, the 39-year-old Messier doesn't fit the mold of young,
inexpensive players typically targeted by expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   If either the Wild or Blue Jackets select Messier during the
June 23 draft, they inherit the remaining two seasons on his
existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   The teams would also assume an option to buy out those two years
for $2 million and a no-trade clause that gives Messier power over
his future destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If he's not chosen, the Canucks intend to buy him out and hope
to sign him as a free agent at a reduced cost.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make the day any less exciting for Blue Jackets GM
Doug MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting at a Tim Horton's at 4:30 this morning, looking
at the list,'' said MacLean, who called it a huge day for the
franchise that will begin play next season. ''Either I'm going
goofy or I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus, which won a coin flip, has priority in the expansion
draft and has the choice of where each team will pick in the
four-round process.
</P>
<P>
   Three goalies will be selected by each team in the first round,
followed by eight defensemen each in the second, 13 forwards each
in the third and two additional selections per club in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said the list was fairly close to what his staff
projected.
</P>
<P>
   Potential free agents available are more likely to be taken than
high-priced veterans, MacLean said, because of their compensation
value should they sign with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone on the lists is really available. Many side deals
have already been consummated to ensure that certain players won't
be lost by their current clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Doug Gilmour is one of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no issue there,'' Gilmour's agent Larry Kelly said.
''They've (the Sabres) made a deal and he won't be picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, who will turn 37 later this month, intends to retire
after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Each team, excluding Nashville and Atlanta, which began play in
1998 and 1999, respectively, can lose up to two players. The
Predators and Thrashers won't lose anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux, who helped New Jersey win its second Stanley Cup
this season, was among 22 Devils left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said he would like to add a veteran goalie to go along
with 22-year-old Marc Denis. Denis, the understudy to Patrick Roy,
was acquired from Colorado for the Blue Jackets' second-round pick
in the league's entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like a veteran to start off with, but it's got to be
the right combination for us,'' MacLean said. ''Denis is our future
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's John Vanbiesbrouck is one player that might fit
the bill. MacLean was his coach in 1996 when the Florida Panthers
advanced to the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure what's going to happen with John,'' MacLean said
of the Flyers goalie, who lost his starting spot to rookie Brian
Boucher. ''He has an option on his contract in the $3 million-plus
range. So I'll see what happens with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other available players include defensemen Marty McSorley
(Boston), Paul Coffey (Carolina), and Sylvain Cote (Dallas).
McSorley is still under indefinite suspension for his stick attack
against Vancouver's Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   Available forwards include Bob Probert (Chicago), Guy Carbonneau
(Dallas), Joe Kocur and Igor Larionov (Detroit), Dave Andreychuk
(Colorado), Stephane Richer (St. Louis), and Wendel Clark
(Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau, the NHL's oldest player at 40, has been mulling
front office offers and his return to the ice is still
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Fuhr (Calgary), Tom Barrasso (Ottawa) and Sean Burke
(Phoenix) are prominent goalies left unprotected. But Fuhr has
indicated he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Teams were able to protect either up to five defensemen, nine
forwards and one goalie, or up to three defensemen, seven forwards
and two goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the exposed forwards had to be under contract for next
season and must have played in either 40 games last season or 70
over the previous two.
</P>
<P>
   Through trades and signings of free agents, the Blue Jackets
have 16 players under contract heading into the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're an expansion team and we have a long way to go, but I
feel pretty good where we are,'' MacLean said.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Faces Housing Crunch  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The ''New Economy'' has all but
eliminated ''housing bargain'' from the lexicon throughout the San
Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Stephen Gray, whose $850,000 offer for a three-bedroom
home lost out to someone who bid twice the asking price. Said Gray:
''It's emotionally wrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay area houses sell so quickly buyers take risks that would be
unheard of elsewhere. Some make offers based on a 15-minute glimpse
at an open house and others bid as much as $200,000 above the
asking price. Some even are willing to buy a home ''as is'' --
without inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go through a process where you lose deal after deal and
deal -- and you're willing to do anything to get in,'' said Andrew
La Mont, a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the housing market has been transformed by the new
dot-com economy. The nation's strong job production in well-paid,
high-tech jobs has driven up the home prices at twice the rate of
inflation, according to the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's State of the Cities 2000 report, released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 21 of 25 metropolitan areas that are top high-tech
markets had rent increases greater than inflation. Rents surged by
more than 20 percent between 1995 and 1999 in Denver and the San
Francisco Bay area while they rose by more than 15 percent in
Boston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Seattle, San Diego and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, San Francisco has the most expensive housing market,
followed by Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco also is California's least affordable housing
market, with only 10 percent of buyers able to afford the $538,732,
median-priced home. The national affordability rate is 52 percent,
according to a report released this month by the California
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding wars have put median-priced homes for sale today beyond
the reach of 84 percent of Bay Area residents, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of future wealth through stock options won't pay
mortgages in Silicon Valley, where a one-bedroom cottage can cost
$800,000, or San Francisco, where two-bedroom homes start at half a
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get a lot of referrals from people looking to move here
because of work and they're already priced out of the market before
they even get here,'' La Mont said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many tech workers competing for so few homes,
middle-class Old Economy workers -- teachers, firefighters,
accountants -- are priced entirely out of the market, said Jeannie
Anderson, president of the San Francisco Realtors Association.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco school district has taken a novel approach to
try and lure teachers. The district recently announced it would
build affordable, teacher-only apartments, with HUD's assistance.
Ground breaking is scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   Humble neighborhoods across the bay in Oakland, Fremont and
Hayward no longer offer bargains. Even in East Palo Alto, once
labeled the murder capital of the world, the median price for an
average, single-family home was $325,000 in February -- up from
$215,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Doreen Martinez were among the lucky few to grab a
new home in South San Francisco. New homes are a rarity in the
region that most available land, even the steepest hillsides, is
already developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they had the preview, 3,000 to 5,000 people showed up,''
Doreen Martinez said. ''It felt like a rock concert. People had to
park in dirt lots then stand in line to get into the model homes.''
</P>
<P>
   They were put on a waiting list but eventually got their home
after a lengthy appeals process. They wouldn't say what they paid,
but said the four-bedroom home has appreciated about $100,000 since
they moved in last December.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, it was worth it, because we got what we wanted,''
Daniel Martinez said. ''But that's it for us. We'll be in this
house for the rest of our lives -- we're not moving again.''

<HEADLINE> Raptors Fire Carter As Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- It wasn't wins and losses that got Butch Carter
fired. It was just time for him to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not want out of Toronto, all right? I wanted out of a
bad situation,'' Carter said Tuesday after his dismissal as Raptors
coach. ''I think I've given this city and Raptor fans a lot to be
proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the best cities I've ever lived in in my life, but
I didn't want to be part of a bad situation that had been
created.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Glen Grunwald praised Carter for his work in
turning around the team, but said the coach was paying the price
for the cloud of controversy that swirled around the team in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my perception of the things that have gone on, it would
have been best for everybody involved that something changed,''
Carter said. ''What it boiled down to is that they were willing to
stand behind me, but that would not have been in the best interest
of everything we've accumulated here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on Carter's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Carter made comments and actions that led to criticism from the
team's veterans and perhaps will cost the club a chance to re-sign
young forward Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald put an end to the distraction that Carter had become,
saying there was no other alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great team, we have some great guys in our locker
room,'' he said. ''We have great ownership. We play in a great
arena before some magnificent fans. Our future is very bright.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think we've lost track of that story a little bit in
some of these off-the-court things and I think we need to refocus
upon that and keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who seemed relieved at his afternoon news conference,
led the Raptors to their first postseason berth. He was rewarded in
December with a contract extension through the 2002-03 season.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Richard Peddie declined to discuss details of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who called his coaching style ''workaholic,'' was
obviously not happy at the way some team beefs were aired outside
the locker room and in the media. But he made plenty of news
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a book written with his brother Cris, the star receiver of
the Minnesota Vikings, he attacked Indiana coach Bob Knight for his
behavior while Butch Carter played there. He sued former Raptors
and current New York Knicks center Marcus Camby, who calling him a
liar. Carter dropped the lawsuit after his legal challenge received
widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The coach made headlines again after a report he asked for
Grunwald's title in his annual job review before Grunwald and
Peddie. Carter said he did not want Grunwald's power, only his
title for added influence in dealings with free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also came under fire from veterans Antonio Davis and
Charles Oakley when he said there was a lack of leadership in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the last straw came last week when McGrady, on the verge
of free agency, cited the veterans' dissatisfaction with Carter and
ensuing turmoil as reasons why he wouldn't be back in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that this change, while disappointing to me on a
personal and professional level, is necessary if we are to continue
to build towards an NBA championship,'' Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of McGrady's future, Carter said: ''The kid is
smart enough to make his own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Signing Tracy McGrady was no slam dunk regardless,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Under Carter, the Raptors finished third in the Central Division
with a 45-37 record. The team was eliminated in a first-round
playoff sweep by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Carter noted the club played ''without a center and ... point
guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was also seen as instrumental in grooming McGrady and
Vince Carter, the two young stars of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''A young coach took a bunch of guys who were unhappy ... and we
made it work here,'' Butch Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was appointed head coach on June 12, 1998, after being
hired as interim coach on Feb. 13, following Darrell Walker's
resignation. He joined the team as an assistant coach before the
team's third season.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's regular-season record with the Raptors was 73-92.
</P>
<P>
   He followed Brendan Malone and Walker as head coaches with the
Raptors, who joined the league in 1995-96. Before joining the
Raptors, he was an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks from
1991-96.

<HEADLINE> Giants 3, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cincinnati's Aaron Boone was hospitalized
after being struck in the face by a seventh-inning fastball, and
San Francisco rallied for a 3-2 victory in the ninth Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1, the Giants rallied on two-out RBI singles by Barry
Bonds and Jeff Kent. The rally began with a one-out walk to Bobby
Estalella off Danny Graves (8-1), who blew a save and lost for the
first time this season. Marvin Benard followed with a single, and
after Bill Mueller flied out, Bonds hit a sharp grounder to right,
scoring Estalella with the tying run. Kent followed with the
game-winner up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen (1-2) got the win, striking out both batters he faced
to break a personal nine-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the game was marred by the frightening beaning.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the blow knocked his batting helmet off, and Boone
fell to the ground in pain as teammates and trainers rushed to tend
to him. He appeared to be bleeding from the nose area.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both sides and the crowd at Pacific Bell Park
watched in hushed silence as he lay face down, his feet kicking the
ground. After several minutes, he was helped up and the crowd gave
him a warm round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Boone then walked off the field with help from team trainers, a
towel wrapped around his face. He was taken to St. Francis Hospital
for precautionary tests and X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Russ Ortiz, locked in a 1-1 duel with former Giants
pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez, was lifted in favor of Felix Rodriguez,
and Juan Castro went in as a pinch-runner for Boone to load the
bases. Hal Morris, pinch-hitting for Fernandez, sent a slow roller
on the infield grass that scored Dmitri Young from third with the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, pitching against his former team for the first time,
walked a career-high six batters but also had five strikeouts,
twice fanning batters to end innings with baserunners in scoring
position. He allowed one run on three hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Scott Williamson got Bonds to ground into an
inning-ending double play in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz allowed two runs on six hits in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati took a 1-0 lead in the first when Pokey Reese
singled, stole second, took third on a groundout and scored on
Barry Larkin's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco evened the score in the fourth when Ellis Burks
walked and scored on Rich Aurilia's double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants are 5-14 in one-run games. ... Reds right
fielder Dante Bichette was not in the lineup for the second
straight night. He remains day-to-day since leaving Sunday's game
at Cleveland with a sprained right ankle. He got hurt sliding back
to second base on a pickoff throw. ... Shortstop Aurilia made a
surprise start after missing seven of the previous 11 games due to
a strained left hamstring. Manager Dusty Baker said Aurilia showed
much improvement in his running Monday, and decided to give him the
start.

<HEADLINE> Korean Leader Seeks Image Makeover  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean ruler Kim Jong Il has
been accused of being many things over the years: terrorist,
womanizer, drunk, recluse, liar, kidnapper. Now he might be a
contender for a new, unexpected label: statesman.
</P>
<P>
   At a historic inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang this week, the
world is getting its closest look ever at the 58-year-old portly,
bespectacled head of one of its most isolated countries.
</P>
<P>
   An image transformation is under way, even if the motives of
North Korea's leader are largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic spectacle of communism's first hereditary successor
making a surprise appearance at an airport Tuesday to greet South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung startled many South Koreans who had
been accustomed to government reports that portrayed him as a
villain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that the stereotype image of Kim Jong Il in my brain
was shattering,'' said Kwak Young-hee, a 45-year-old housewife.
''He was not a freak. He looked perfectly normal and a rather
capable leader.''
</P>
<P>
   By showing himself to the world on live television, a poised Kim
Jong Il revealed a taste for boldness, and a sense of the history
that pervaded his meeting with Kim Dae-jung after a half-century of
hostility on the divided Korean peninsula. Their unprecedented
meeting offered fresh hope for an end to Korea's Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised Korea's two leaders
for their ''vision and wisdom'' in opening dialogue, and they drew
encouragement from the region's major players: Japan, Russia, China
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kim Jong Il used President Kim's visit as an occasion to tell
the world that he is not a dangerous and reclusive leader ruling a
rogue country,'' said Kang Sung-yoon, a political science professor
at Dongkuk University in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il, who rules with the aid of a personality cult, will
have to do much more to win respect in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has masterminded an array of bombings, armed attacks
and kidnappings since the 1950-53 Korean War, most of them directed
at its southern neighbor. Its nuclear and long-range missile
programs remain of great concern in Seoul, Washington and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has yet to be explicit about why he agreed to the
summit, although desperation for economic resources from the rich
South is a likely factor. North Korea's economy is a mess and its
22 million people have relied on outside food aid since famine
killed hundreds of thousands in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il was groomed to succeed his father, North Korean
founder Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994 at age 82 -- a few weeks
before a planned summit with Kim Young-sam, South Korea's president
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, Kim Jong Il consolidated his control
over the military, outlasted predictions that his destitute regime
would collapse and may finally have felt confident enough to
fulfill his father's goal of hosting a summit.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was still a risky one for the North Korean, who is
aware that outside influence would chip away at his tight control
over his people. It's unclear how much he wants to open up.
</P>
<P>
   During a rare, secretive trip to Beijing last month, Kim Jong Il
hinted that he understood the need for economic, if not political,
change. He saluted China's capitalist reforms and toured a computer
firm.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of South Korean filmmakers who were kidnapped by Kim Jong
Il and brought to Pyongyang in 1978 escaped in 1984 with secret
recordings of the North Korean leader. On one tape, he expressed a
need to open up to the West but said such a strategy could endanger
the North Korean state.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown is whether Kim Jong Il, who is treated as a
virtual god by his people, is capable of the flexibility required
to negotiate deals with his South Korean counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   According to South Korean pool reports, Kim Jong Il was brusque
with his subordinates Tuesday, addressing them without the
honorific titles commonly used in the Korean language. With Kim
Dae-jung, he was chatty and charming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kim Jong Il is known to be a smart, able man,'' said Baek
Young-ok, professor of North Korean Studies at Myongji University
in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is evident when you see how he became a successor of his
father as a ruler of North Korea and succeeded in keeping his post.
But unlike his father, he is also known to be quite impatient,
expressive and straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to improve ties, South Korea has become a willing partner
in Kim Jong Il's image makeover. Four months ago, President Kim
Dae-jung drew criticism from the domestic opposition for describing
the North Korean as a ''pragmatist'' and a ''man of great
insight.''
</P>
<P>
   With summit euphoria in the South at a peak, that view has
become more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must reflect ourselves whether our negative view of him has
been built on prejudice and the high walls we have erected in our
minds,'' JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, said in an
editorial.

<HEADLINE> Erving Makes Plea for Missing Son  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- What was supposed to be a 20-minute trip to
a Lake Mary shopping mall on Memorial Day weekend has turned into
the 2{ week disappearance of NBA great Julius Erving's 19-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   Since that errand to buy bread for a family cookout on May 28,
there has been no word or clues to the whereabouts or fate of Cory
Marvin Erving.
</P>
<P>
   Before the disappearance, Erving's easygoing younger son was
working to put teen drug use behind him and earn his high school
equivalency after years of dealing with a learning disability.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminole County Sheriff's Office reported no major
developments in the missing persons case as of late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was hours after Julius Erving, executive vice president of
the Orlando Magic, appeared in a nationally televised news
conference with his wife and their three other adult children.
Erving asked for the nation's help in finding -- and safely
returning -- his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm begging, wishing, hoping and I'm praying,'' said the Hall
of Famer and former NBA MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Erving openly discussed his son's learning disability and his
drug problems that date back to when Cory was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since eighth grade he has been in special classes to deal with
the disability ... it's a mild form of dyslexia,'' Erving noted,
while describing a very close family in shock and pain over the
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been one time when there has ever been a lack
of communication in our family. ... For Cory to be out of the
circle brings about great concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wednesday's Phiadelphia Inquirer, family members
said Cory Erving had rarely gone more than three days without
contacting them. But he has run away once before, according to
Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the Erving family filed a missing persons report for
Cory in January, 1999, a disappearance that began when he ran away
from a drug rehabilitation center as his mother was dropping him
off for court-ordered treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Erving was arrested in early April for possession of
alcohol by a person under age 21.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Cory and his brother Cheo, 27, were arrested in
nearby Altamonte Springs. Police stopped the two in a parking lot
about 3 a.m., near a car with a door open that appeared to have its
glove compartment rifled.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found a crack pipe in Cheo Erving's pocket.
Cory was charged with burglary of a motor vehicle -- a felony -- and
loitering and prowling, but charges were dropped in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   His family described Cory as a fun-loving prankster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, just in support of him, we would tease him about
all the diplomas he's garnered from drug rehab centers. ... He has
about five or six of them,'' his father said in subdued tones.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bad dream has gone on for 16 days now ... 16 bad days,''
Erving said. ''We are in dire need of help.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first believed something was amiss, the Ervings tried
to find Cory with the help of a private investigator. Then, on June
4, they filed a missing-persons report.
</P>
<P>
   A $25,000 reward is being offered for the son's safe return, and
Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger reports the search has
expanded, with his office passing along information on Cory to law
enforcement authorities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had no critical witnesses whom we have gleaned
information about his whereabouts,'' Eslinger acknowledged. ''We've
exhausted many leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Eslinger speculated that Cory might have had a confrontation
with someone before he disappeared, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Fliers put out by the sheriff's office list Cory Erving as a
''Missing and Endangered Adult''. Officials said that was because
his whereabouts are not known, and that the description does not
imply physical or mental impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The flier also said he ''may be in the company of a white female
with blonde hair who may drive a white vehicle,'' without giving
any further details.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Julius Erving acknowledged he is the father of tennis
player Alexandra Stevenson. Her mother, sports writer Samantha
Stevenson, raised her as a single parent.

<HEADLINE> Panel Backs Media Leakers as Felons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly
has endorsed legislation that would make disclosing classified
information to the news media a felony punishable by up to three
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members, led by Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., say
existing laws make prosecutions difficult and don't encompass all
kinds of classified materials, The Washington Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To prosecute leakers under current law, prosecutors must show
they leaked on behalf of a foreign power or divulged ''national
defense'' data, which excludes much important information,
committee members say.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment groups and Attorney General Janet Reno have
opposed the bill, saying criminal prosecutions are not necessarily
the best way to stop leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, along with FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and CIA Director
George J. Tenet, is scheduled to testify Wednesday at a closed
hearing of the Senate committee concerning the bill. The Post,
quoting an unidentified administration official, said Reno would
oppose the bill at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's bill says any government official who
''knowingly and willfully discloses ... any classified
information'' to an unauthorized individual is guilty of a felony
and may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to three
years, Shelby was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Change in Census Data Release Urged  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Census Bureau would be given
the final say over whether to release politically sensitive sampled
population data from this year's count, according to a Commerce
Department proposal that Census officials said would be announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statistically adjusted data from Census 2000 could
dramatically affect the way Congressional and state legislative
lines are redrawn next year. The authority to release that data
currently lies with the commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will officially be announced at a news conference
Wednesday, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes the process transparent,'' Prewitt said. ''This
makes sure there is no partisan intent on how we conduct the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, which Prewitt has said
he favors. Supporters of sampling believe it will help account for
portions of the population missed in previous counts, including
minorities and inner-city residents who historically vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department. Both Daley
and Prewitt were appointed by President Clinton, and may not be in
their positions by early next year, when the decision to release
sampled data must be made.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could become a formal regulation by September,
following a public comment period, Census spokesman Steve Jost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the reapportionment of
congressional seats must be made using raw, or nonsampled data. It
left open the possibility for states to use sampled data when
redrawing state and congressional district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsampled data is due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. If
released, sampled data would be released by next April.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, in general, fear sampled data could skew those
political boundaries to Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, called the
proposal ''politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think this changes things at all because all it does
is move the decision-making process from one political appointee to
another,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the proposal, Jost said there was no guarantee that
sampled data would be released. Prewitt said the proposed policy
change removes partisanship from the decision-making process
because it is put into the hands of ''technical experts and career
statisticians'' not concerned with political outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the next president will appoint the next heads of
the Commerce Department and Census Bureau. So, if presumptive
Republican nominee George W. Bush should win the presidency in
November, he would have the power to change the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush, if he wanted to, could repeal the regulation and
take away the authority that this administration is delegating to
the career professionals at the Census Bureau,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's ranking Democrat. ''If he wants
to do that, that's going to be one hell of a Kodak moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Act states that the commerce secretary has the power
to delegate the authority over ''whether it is feasible to
release'' sampled data, said Jost, the Census spokesman. That power
was taken away following the last census, in 1990, from the census
director's office by the then-Republican commerce secretary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed decision returns to that prior long-standing
precedent which was changed in 1990,'' Jost said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP To Push Party Fundraising  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House Republicans, battling a strong
Democratic campaign for control, are assigning fund-raising quotas
to the rank and file, with any rebels directed to ''set up a
personal meeting'' with Speaker Dennis Hastert to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, dubbed Battleground 2000, is aimed at raising $16
million for Republicans to use in roughly three dozen hotly
competitive races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders arranged a closed-door session of the rank and
file for today to outline the details. Officials said Tuesday night
that each lawmaker, including those who are retiring, was receiving
a quota to be raised from supporters or donated from their own
campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the plans said lawmakers would be told
that committee assignments, full committee chairmanships and
subcommittee assignments would be handed out in the new Congress
based in part on an individual's fund-raising performance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to material prepared for the meeting, any
lawmaker who declines to assume responsibility for their allotted
fund-raising quota will be asked to ''call the speaker (House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.), and ''set up a personal meeting to
tell him why.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who chairs the House campaign committee,
said Republicans will rely on the money to ''tailor individual
campaigns in races where we think control (of the House) will be
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money will be spent on basic campaign operations
such as voter identification and direct mail, while some will be
dedicated to television commercials tailored to an individual
district.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, Davis vowed, ''will not be outhustled or
out-organized.''
</P>
<P>
   A switch of six seats this fall would deliver control of the
House to Democrats. Thus far, Democrats have stayed competitive
with Republicans in fund-raising, and will have the advantage that
comes with far fewer open seats to defend than the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months before election day, Republican
presidential contender George W. Bush leads in the polls. But
campaign committee spokesman Jim Wilkinson said, ''We think Bush
could win and we'd still lose the House if we don't get the
fundamentals done.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats have both leaned on individual
lawmakers to pitch in for other campaigns in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Republicans mounted an effort dubbed Operation
Breakout, which wound up financing late-campaign commercials that
touched on President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and the impeachment scandal that was then brewing.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the effort turned out to be a failure, since many
Republicans blame the commercials for an unexpected loss of seats
in November.
</P>
<P>
   This time, officials said the effort will be more tailored based
on the makeup of individual districts and races.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson declined to identify the three dozen or so races where
the money will be allocated. But other officials have said in
recent months they are widely scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many are currently held by lawmakers who are retiring this fall.
But each party has a small number of incumbents expected to face
particularly difficult challenges.

<HEADLINE> Type O Patients Pose Medical Irony  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The United Network for Organ Sharing is considering
changes in
transplant policies for type 0 livers, but not for other organs.
The current and proposed policies for livers, and the standing
policies for lungs, hearts and kidneys:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Livers:
</P>
<P>
   Current policy: Prohibits transplanting O livers into patients
with other blood types who are the least sick -- those classified as
status 2b or 3. Allows transplanting O livers to non-O patients who
are the most sick -- those classified as status 1 and 2a.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed policy: Would not change the rules for patients in
status 1, 2b or 3. For status 2a -- patients who are sick enough to
be in the hospital but do not face imminent death -- O livers would
not be transplanted into patients with blood types A or AB.
Patients with blood type B, which is quite rare, could still get
type O livers.
</P>
<P>
   --Lungs: Type O organs are strictly reserved for type O patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Hearts: Type O organs are directed to type O patients first,
but only within the sickness category. So a sicker patient with a
different blood type would get a heart before a less-sick O
patient.
</P>
<P>
   --Kidneys: Type O organs only go to O patients -- unless there's a
perfect tissue match with someone of another blood type. (Kidneys
are the only organs that rely on tissue typing in addition to blood
type for placement.)

<HEADLINE> Runway Near Misses Targeted by NTSB  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''Stop!'' shouted the frightened air traffic
controller as a giant Boeing 747 that had just landed headed into
the path of another jumbo jet preparing to take off from the
Chicago runway.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy was avoided as the second plane climbed quickly, but the
incident was closely studied Tuesday as the National Transportation
Safety Board issued recommendations for avoiding such close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Luck was with the passengers and crew aboard the two planes,
observed NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, ''but relying on luck doesn't make
good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall noted that more than 320 runway close calls were reported
nationwide last year, a number that has been rising over the years
as airport traffic increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago case and another in Providence, R.I., in which
planes on the ground become lost in the fog were studied before the
board issued its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Those now go to the Federal Aviation Administration, which has
already launched its own effort to reduce such incidents and plans
a national runway safety summit June 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   In the Providence case last Dec. 6, United Airlines Flight 1448
became lost in the fog and turned down a wrong taxiway leading
toward a runway where a FedEx plane was taking off.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear from radio conversations that the United
flight wasn't where it ought to be, the air traffic controller,
also blinded by fog, ordered it to halt. She then cleared a US
Airways flight to take off, but that pilot refused to go until he
was sure where everybody was.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after all movement at the airport was halted, the
United pilot was able to read runway signs to determine where he
was and could then taxi to a safe location so operations could
resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago case occurred April 1, 1999, when an Air China
International 747 cargo plane with a crew of eight aboard landed
and turned onto the wrong taxiway. It then began to cross a runway
just as a Korean Air 747 with 357 passengers and 22 crew members
started to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected appearance of the Chinese jet on the runway
prompted the controller to shout ''Stop!'' just seconds before the
planes would have collided. It was too late for that, but the
Korean pilot was able to lift off early and veer sharply to the
left, avoiding disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In their recommendations, board members criticized the FAA for
slow progress in developing technology to avoid runway incidents.
They urged the agency to speed up that effort and to:
</P>
<P>
   --Require that a pilot get a specific clearance before crossing
each runway. Currently that clearance is implied when a pilot is
told to proceed to the takeoff point, or a multiple clearance may
be given to cross several runways.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit planes waiting to take off from idling on an active
runway at night or in conditions where they might not be visible to
incoming planes.
</P>
<P>
   --Adopt the English language phraseology recommended for ground
operations by the International Civil Aviation Organization, and
direct controllers to speak clearly and slowly, especially when
dealing with foreign planes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already follows most ICAO terminology but
there are some differences that may confuse pilots from other
countries. For example, if an American controller wants a plane to
go to a runway and stop until given further directions, the pilot
will be told to ''taxi and hold short'' or ''position and hold
short.'' The ICAO direction would be ''line up and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Downward looking radar is in service at some airports and that
can help controllers monitor planes' movements. Improved versions
are under development, said John Mayrhofer, director of the FAA's
runway safety program.
</P>
<P>
   A system called Airport Movement Area Safety System, to begin
service later this year, sounds an alert when planes seem to be
heading for a collision. It is expected to be in the nation's 34
busiest airports by 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But NTSB officials questioned whether AMASS will give enough
warning, and urged that other systems also be studied.
</P>
<P>
   Mayrhofer said an improved system is under development that uses
ground sensors and Global Positioning System readings as well as
radar.

<HEADLINE> 2 Named To Probe Nuke Material Loss  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The disappearance of nuclear secrets from a
vault at the Los Alamos weapons lab has prompted a criminal
investigation and unleashed another torrent of criticism about
security at the Energy Department, leaving the Clinton
administration scrambling to contain the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which was brought into the case when the Energy
Department learned on June 1 of the disappearance of the nuclear
secrets from the New Mexico facility, was conducting a criminal
probe. The investigation was expected to focus on some two-dozen
individuals who had free access to the highly secured vault where
two computer hard drives that contained the nuclear files were
kept.
</P>
<P>
   Polygraph tests were expected to begin to be administered to
some of the Los Alamos scientists within days, Energy Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders, meanwhile, said they planned to act
today on the nomination of John A. Gordon, the deputy CIA director,
to head a new semi-independent nuclear weapons agency. Gordon's
nomination, held up for months over a disagreement on how much
power the agency should have within the Energy Department, is now
expected to get swift approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the new disclosure that two computer hard drives were
missing at Los Alamos was likely to give Republicans plenty of
ammunition to criticize the Clinton administration's national
security record. And while Energy Secretary Bill Richardson emerged
largely unscathed last from the Wen Ho Lee case, which also
involved missing nuclear secrets, this time Richardson is expected
to be a prime target.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident occurred on his watch. He'll have to be made
accountable,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the secretary needs to do is get his house in order,''
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Wednesday on NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of investigations into another Los Alamos security flap
is not what Richardson, the most prominent Hispanic in the
administration, had expected as he hopes to remain in contention as
a potential vice presidential running mate to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson moved swiftly to try to regain the offensive in what
is an embarrassing disclosure of security bungling even if the two
computer hard drives -- which contain sophisticated data used to
dismantle an array of U.S. and even Russian nuclear devices -- are
eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In these developments Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Richardson announced that two highly respected elder statesmen
-- former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, R-Tenn., and former
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. -- would investigate the disappearance of
the hard drives and make recommendations on security improvements
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   -- Retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy Department's
top security official, said the FBI was conducting a criminal
investigation of the matter. Twenty-six people had unescorted
access to the vault, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six lab managers, including the chief of nuclear weapons
programs, were placed on leave with pay because of the incident. A
lab spokesman, John Gustafson, said the action was taken ''to
ensure the independence and complete appearance of independence''
of an investigation by the University of California, which manages
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lost no time in attacking the administration on the
latest security bungle. And both House and Senate intelligence
committees and armed services committees announced hearings for
today and Thursday on the missing computer drives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Energy Department has not heeded warnings about the dire
need for security reforms,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., calling
the latest incident ''an unacceptable security breach.'' He
maintained there is some evidence the devices may have been stolen,
but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators remained at a loss about what happened to the hard
drives, which are the size of a deck of cards. Habiger said the
employees who had access to the vault where the drives were stored
were ''dedicated, loyal Americans.'' He expressed doubt that the
devices were stolen and said it was more likely they were misplaced
or accidentally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The devices were found missing on May 7 as scientists sought to
secure them from a massive wildfire threatening the lab complex. A
lab investigation did not begin until May 24, and Energy Department
officials did not learn of the disappearance until June 1,
according to Habiger.
</P>
<P>
   The two drives, which can be used in laptop computers, contained
technical nuclear weapons data used by the Nuclear Emergency Search
Team to dismantle nuclear devices in case of an accident or
terrorist act.

<HEADLINE> How Nuclear Secrets Disappeared  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A chronology of events involving the disappearance of
two
computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets from a vault at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, according to Energy Department
officials.
<TEXT>
<P>
   April 7: A member of an emergency nuclear response, or NEST,
team recalls seeing the hard drives in the vault during an
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   April 27: Another member of the response team does not recall
seeing the two drives, contained in one of three emergency response
''kits'' in the vault, but says if they had been missing he would
have taken notice.
</P>
<P>
   May 2-4: The NEST emergency response team participates in an
exercise at the Lawrence Livermore weapons lab in California. It's
not known whether ''Kit No. 2'' -- later to be found with the drives
missing -- was used in the exercise.

   May 4: A wildfire begins in federal parkland near the Los Alamos
laboratory and quickly spreads out of control.
</P>
<P>
   May 7: With the laboratory threatened by the fire, members of
the NEST team late in the evening inspect the vault to assure the
three kits are ''out of harm's way'' and discover the two drives
missing from Kit No. 2. The discovery is not reported.
</P>
<P>
   May 8: The Los Alamos lab is evacuated because of the fire
threat and scientists disperse.
</P>
<P>
   May 22: With the fire danger over, operations resume at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   May 24: A group of scientists begin an ''intense search'' for
the missing hard drives, but senior lab officials are not informed
of the possible loss.
</P>

   May 31: Los Alamos lab director John Browne first learns of the
missing hard drives and the next day informs Energy Department
officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   June 1-2: Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the DOE's top security
official, and Edward Curran, chief of counterintelligence, are
informed of the loss and meet with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   June 4: A team of 22 FBI agents and a dozen DOE investigators,
led by Habiger, descend on Los Alamos and begin investigation,
interviewing those with access to the vault and continuing the
search.
</P>
<P>
   June 12: The Los Alamos laboratory announces in a news release
that two top-secret hard drives containing nuclear data had been
found missing.
</P>
<P>
   June 13: Six laboratory managers, including the head of the
nuclear weapons programs, are put on paid leave, pending the
investigations. Richardson complains about not being informed about
the loss for nearly three weeks and promises disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   June 14: Congressional intelligence and armed services
committees begin hearings into the security breakdown. At Los
Alamos, FBI and DOE officials begin plans to give polygraph tests

<HEADLINE> TV Series Chronicles 'The Rockies'  </HEADLINE>
By SANDY SHORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John Turner wanted to be the best potato farmer
west of the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, the transplanted Utah farmer tilled a 350-acre plot and
planted spuds at the foot of the Teton range in northern Wyoming.
''When he went to dig them up in the fall, they were about the size
of your thumb,'' said his grandson, Harold Turner, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   So John Turner tried something else. As recounted in a new cable
television series called ''The Rockies,'' his business ventures,
including the Triangle X dude ranch, followed a path as tortuous as
a twisted mountain trail, ending in the creation of one of
America's greatest treasures -- the Grand Teton National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rockies,'' a four-part mini-series, relates the history of
the vast mountain region through the stories of ''schemers and
dreamers'' like Turner, an unlikely lot of men and women who helped
shaped it into one of America's favorite outdoor playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Debuting at 9 p.m. EST June 19-22 on The History Channel, the
series has all the ingredients of a first-rate movie -- intrigue,
violence, an illicit love affair, unsavory business tactics and a
near insurrection -- set against the backdrop of the towering,
snowcapped Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 million years ago, the mountains that comprise the
Rockies were thrust from the bottom of an inland sea, creating the
longest mountain range on the continent, running 4,000 miles from
northern Canada into New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on a single narrator, the program uses
historians, authors, entrepreneurs and residents to weave
independent tales into a rich tapestry illustrated by historical
photos, re-enactments, and spectacular footage of the
14,000-plus-foot peaks, alpine valleys and whitewater rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably opening with well-known explorers Lewis and Clark,
the program details their desperate winter struggle to cross the
Continental Divide, aided by guide Sacajewea and the Nez Perce
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the series, the narrators recount the Nez Perces'
doomed flight toward Canada after a bloody battle with soldiers who
were trying to move them to a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Other segments focus on Civil War hero John Wesley Powell's
mapping trek through the canyons of the Green River in Wyoming; the
expedition to chronicle the wonders of what later became
Yellowstone National Park; construction of the railroads across
narrow mountain passes; and Brigham Young's standoff against the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous days of the West's gold and silver rush are seen
through the life of Horace Tabor, who ran the general store in the
1870s in Leadville, still the highest town in North America.
Married to the stern-looking, bespectacled Augusta, Tabor made a
moderate living, occasionally giving down-on-their-luck miners
supplies in exchange for a share of any claim they made.
</P>
<P>
   One day, his kindness paid off and Tabor struck it rich with the
Matchless Mine, soon earning the moniker of Colorado's Silver King.
He divorced his wife and later married his mistress, Elizabeth Baby
Doe, in an ugly public scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Tabor's downfall began when he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S.
Senate in 1882, and accelerated when the price of silver dropped in
1893 from $1 an ounce to less than 50 cents an ounce. His heavily
mortgaged properties were seized by creditors, and Tabor died broke
at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 36 years, Baby Doe continued to work the Matchless
Mine, dying penniless in her cabin near the mouth of the mine in
the winter of 1935.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more touching stories is that of miner Mannus Duggan,
who worked in a Butte, Mont., copper mine when production was at a
high during World War I. An accident involving an electrical cable
sparked a fire in the mine on June 8, 1917, trapping dozens of
miners one-half mile beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan gathered 27 of the trapped miners behind a makeshift
bulkhead, where they waited a day and a half for the fire to burn
itself out. After 38 hours, help arrived and the men staggered
toward an elevator for the long-awaited climb to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan, however, went back to help stragglers; he died in the
mine, a letter to his wife in his jacket pocket. In all, 168 men
were killed, the worst mine disaster in the Rockies' history.
</P>
<P>
   No story about the Rockies would be complete without a mention
of its ''white gold'' -- powdery, deep snow that's perfect for
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Living on the East Coast, Pete Seibert was just 12 when he
decided he wanted to open a ski resort. He grew up and enlisted in
the 10th Mountain Division, a group of elite fighting men who
trained on skis near Leadville to fight the Nazis in the Alps
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Colorado and went to work in the fledgling ski
industry, searching relentlessly for the perfect snow. In March
1957, he climbed to the top of Vail Mountain. ''There's no question
in my mind that was the best I'd seen,'' Seibert recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He built trails, a gondola and a chairlift.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest, as they say, is history.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit on Children's Book Opens  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery's ''The Little Prince''
is a classic with prose so lyrical and drawings so delicate it
could have landed on Earth from its title character's distant
planet.
</P>
<P>
   But an exhibit of the author's manuscript and preliminary
drawings at the Morgan Library shows how hard he worked creating
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery wrote ''The Little Prince'' at a rented house near
Northport, Long Island, in the summer and fall of 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The author and aviator had come to New York after France fell to
the Germans in 1940. ''The Little Prince'' was published in 1943,
the same year Saint-Exupery returned to service in World War II as
a reconnaissance pilot.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most beloved books, it tells the story of a
mysterious child from tiny Asteroid B-612 who travels to Earth,
where he meets a wise fox and the pilot-narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left to rejoin his squadron in North Africa,
Saint-Exupery gave his handwritten manuscript and some preparatory
drawings for the book to a friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt. The
Morgan acquired them in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibit coincides with the centenary of the author,
who was born on June 29, 1900. His plane disappeared on July 31,
1944, three weeks before Paris was liberated.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which runs through Aug. 20, includes some 20
drawings as well as manuscript pages, a signed copy of ''The Little
Prince,'' the author's typed contract with the publisher and three
sketches of Saint-Exupery by the French muralist Jean Pages.
</P>
<P>
   Written in a tiny, barely legible hand on thin, onionskin paper,
the manuscript pages are full of line-outs and revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the book reads as if it was so effortlessly
compiled, you can see from the manuscript that he worked very, very
hard to get just the right tone in telling his story,'' says Robert
Parks, curator of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee stains the corners of several pages, and one drawing is
marred by a cigarette burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know from reports of his friends that he liked to write
late into the night,'' Parks says. ''He kept himself awake by
drinking lots of strong black coffee, and the manuscript has the
proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pictures differ just slightly from ones in the book.
There are several drawings of a baobab tree on a tiny planet; in
the book, three baobabs strangle the Little Prince's home.
</P>
<P>
   Other drawings in the exhibit were apparently rejected, like one
depicting the narrator, who is never shown in the finished book.
</P>
<P>
   The fox, who tells the Little Prince ''it is only with the heart
that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the
eye,'' is not the long-eared sprite from the book but a larger,
fleshier animal.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings and manuscript pages were last displayed in 1993 on
the 50th anniversary of the book's publication. ''Because of their
fragility they are not put on view very often,'' Parks says.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's other books, which largely deal with his
experiences in the early days of aviation, include ''Wind, Sand and
Stars'' and ''Flight to Arras.''

<HEADLINE> New Book Chronicles the Holocaust  </HEADLINE>
By DEBRA HALE SHELTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- It was 1945. The war had just ended, and Jewish
immigrants were moving into Louis Weber's West Side neighborhood.
Through the eyes of this 9-year-old Jewish boy, something was
disturbingly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was stunned by their faces,'' Weber recalled years later.
''They looked deadened, empty. The people had numbers tattooed on
their arms, and I didn't know why. I knew the families of these
newcomers, but no one would tell me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust survivors' story eventually was told, over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, the son of Polish Jews who came to America in the early
1920s, could not forget the atrocities. Nor could he forget the
struggles of his own parents, who left for Canada and later the
United States when the Russian army was plundering Jewish villages
and killing tens of thousands in Poland and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Weber decided to use his resources as the head of a
thriving publishing company to help keep the story alive ''so that
all those people who died didn't die in vain.'' He recently
published ''The Holocaust Chronicle: A History in Words and
Pictures,'' a not-for-profit book that traces the tragedy from its
origins to its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Weber's company, Publications International Ltd., already has
donated 10,000 copies of the 768-page book, written primarily by
six professors, to schools, synagogues, churches, libraries and
other organizations. More donations are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized I'm in a unique position to bring the Holocaust
story to a wide audience, as well as to give something back to the
Jewish community,'' the 63-year-old publisher says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the board of The ''1939'' Club, a Los Angeles-based
organization of Holocaust survivors and their families, honored
Weber and his company with the group's Media Award, which goes to
those who have contributed significantly to an understanding of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a unique book because it is so user-friendly in
the sense that you don't have to read it cover to cover at one
sitting. ... Each page has a wealth of information,'' says William
Elperin, president of The ''1939'' Club, which gets its name from
the year Adolf Hitler's forces invaded Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Weber sees the book as a legacy to his children and
grandchildren. Their pictures abound in his office in suburban
Lincolnwood, along with scores of books on everything from
Corvettes to cooking to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The book, checked by a team of Holocaust scholars, includes an
80,000-word timeline of Holocaust-related events covering about
3,000 years of history. Yet even that, the book acknowledges, is
not complete. ''Many facts of the Holocaust died with the
victims,'' the introduction says.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains more than 1,700 pictures, including the cover
picture of a big-eyed, dark-haired little girl discovered by
British troops in the typhus ward of the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp in Germany in April 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a face that shows apprehension; it shows pride, a hint of
defiance,'' says David Hogan, who as editor-in-chief selected the
picture. The child's name and fate are not known.
</P>
<P>
   The book is accessible. The writing is lively, and both the
words and the pictures put human faces on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven million people died during the Holocaust. Six million
were Jews. Among other targeted groups were Gypsies, Polish
citizens, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, the handicapped,
Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses and other political and religious
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the persecuted who appear in the book:
</P>
<P>
   --Mania Halef, a little girl photographed in 1936 in a play suit
with a ribbon in her hair and a doll in her hands. In 1941, the
7-year-old was shot during the Germans' massacre of more than
33,000 Jews at a ravine outside Kiev, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   --An unidentified boy dressed in rags and bandages and carrying a
tin cup, as he wanders through the streets of Poland's Warsaw
Ghetto. His swollen and splotchy feet and legs are those of an old
man. He stoops as he stares at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   --A group of small children posing for a photographer just before
they are killed. One cries, rubbing her eyes. A few smile, unaware
of their fate. They are among the estimated 1 million Jewish
children who died during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   --An elderly, bearded Orthodox Jew being forcibly shaved for
entertainment by SS troops, a violation of many Eastern European
Jews' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Weber has helped support Jewish charitable
organizations, but this is his company's first book dealing with
the Holocaust. The company is best known for its cookbooks and
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures for the Holocaust book were chosen after sifting from
many thousands in the collections of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington, D.C., and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, as well as
other archives and private collections.
</P>
<P>
   The book is available in stores for prices ranging from $16 to
$35.
</P>
<P>
   Publications International's Web site carries the book's entire
text and many of the images. It will be regularly updated with
Holocaust-related developments.

<HEADLINE> Joshua Redman: Leap Into the Beyond  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman believes in
taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   That was true nine years ago when, after graduating summa cum
laude from Harvard, he passed up a chance to attend Yale Law School
to become a professional jazz musician. It remains so today with
his newest CD ''Beyond'' (Warner Bros.), whose original tunes take
him into new musical territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rewards are worth the risk,'' the 31-year-old Redman said.
''I see jazz and art in general as this unfolding process of
constant search and adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Redman had no illusions about the risks involved
in forgoing a career as an Ivy League lawyer to play jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40 years ago, his father, Dewey Redman, gave up a secure
job as a schoolteacher in Texas to move to California to play jazz.
Although he became one of the most highly regarded tenor
saxophonists on the progressive jazz scene -- working in bands with
Ornette Coleman, Keith Jarrett and Charlie Haden -- he still went
through some lean years.
</P>
<P>
   After his parents separated, Joshua was raised in Berkeley,
Calif., by his mother, Renee Shedroff, a dancer and school
librarian who sometimes had to rely on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   His career has been smoother sailing, and it would be easy for
him to grow complacent and coast on his past successes.
</P>
<P>
   Redman has enjoyed a meteoric rise since winning the prestigious
Thelonious Monk Institute Competition for saxophonists in 1991,
which led to a major record deal with Warner Bros. His seven CDs as
a leader have regularly topped Billboard's traditional jazz charts,
and his quartet steadily tours worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sponsorship deals with fashion designers such as
Donna Karan and film appearances, most notably in Robert Altman's
''Kansas City,'' in which Redman (as Count Basie band saxophonist
Lester Young) recreates the legendary tenor battles of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   But Redman has not been afraid to risk the opprobrium of jazz
purists by his willingness to embrace other musical genres. He
performed the song ''Waiting on a Friend'' on a Rolling Stones
video -- a piece the rock band originally recorded with one of
Redman's saxophone idols, Sonny Rollins -- and jammed with the Dave
Matthews Band at a concert in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in purity of expression not a purity of style. I've
grown up listening to and loving all kinds of music ... and I've
always felt comfortable allowing everything that I've liked to
influence the way I play jazz,'' Redman said in a telephone
interview from his St. Louis hotel room before a recent concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jazz for me is the most inspiring and enjoyable music to play,
but I see the value in all forms of music. For me what's important
is that what I play is truly expressive of what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   On his previous CD, ''Timeless Tales (For Changing Times),''
released in 1998, Redman set out to break down the barriers between
jazz and the rock, soul and funk he grew up with. He mixed his own
arrangements of jazz standards with completely transformed versions
of more contemporary pop songs by the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Stevie
Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes these songs 'Timeless Tales' is the openness of the
music,'' Redman said. ''The melodies have to have a power and
presence that are unforgettable ... but the songs can't be too
clearly defined and not leave any room for other interpretations.
... The songs that attract me generally are those that have strong
melodies but also open and suggestive harmonies.''
</P>
<P>
   With ''Timeless Tales,'' Redman seemingly hit on a winning
formula with both critics and the public. But on ''Beyond,'' he
chose a riskier tack by going only with original material.
</P>
<P>
   ''After I finished 'Timeless Tales,' I got immediately inspired
to write a lot of my own music,'' he said. ''There is a different
feeling to the two records, but there are a lot of things in common
... the involvement with complex time signatures, a type of band
fluidity and collective interaction ... and some of the things that
define my sound from a harmonic and melodic standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman says his compositions on ''Beyond'' are more complex than
anything he's written before. But the complexity is balanced by the
strong, simple melodies. That balance is evident right from the
opening track, ''Courage (Asymmetric Aria),'' which is in an odd
13/4 time signature but has a rolling groove.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Beyond,'' Redman stakes out some new musical ground. The
11-minute ''Twilight ... And Beyond'' expands on a musical theme he
originally wrote for Anna Deveare Smith's play ''Twilight,'' about
the Los Angeles riots. It represents Redman's first attempt at an
extended suite-like composition. On ''Leap of Faith,'' with its
intertwining melodic lines, he is joined by fellow tenorman Mark
Turner, marking the first time Redman has invited another horn
player to record on one of his CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't conceive of this as a kind of slash-and-burn tenor
contest,'' Redman said. ''It's about a spirit of communication and
conversation, not a spirit of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman says the heart of the album is the collective spirit of
the quartet he has been able to keep together for the past two
years -- with pianist Aaron Goldberg, bassist Reuben Rogers and
drummer Gregory Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   ''With these compositions and the way this band plays together,
there's really a sense of mapping and charting out some new musical
territory,'' Redman said. ''I definitely feel like musically it's a
step beyond many of the things that I've done before.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music is also expressive of a certain kind of spiritual or
philosophical awareness that I've begun to have over the past
couple of years. It's just a sense I've had that I need to ask
deeper, more probing questions out of life and try to find a way to
lead a meaningful life.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2{ years ago, Redman and his wife Gabrielle Armand, the
director of jazz marketing for Columbia Records, moved from a
Manhattan duplex to a three-story Dutch colonial in the more
bucolic suburb of Sleepy Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that living in a relaxed environment -- and perhaps
more importantly being in a wonderful, loving relationship -- has
contributed to a sense of peace, satisfaction and happiness which I
think has allowed me to probe deeper,'' Redman said. ''I have found
a type of balance in my life that I didn't have five years ago when
it was just all about being on the road and playing music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned how to turn opportunities down. ... I reached a
point where I was always in demand to perform, and I feel very
grateful for that, but I realized I couldn't do that all the time.
It was starting to hurt my music and my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Redman says he has ''no regrets'' about his
decision to take a chance on jazz rather than follow the safer path
to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, I would love to be able to do everything that interests
me, but I'm very happy with the choices that I've made,'' Redman
said. ''I just feel so lucky to be able to play the music that I
love and make a living at it.''

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Bigger Tobacco Warnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) -- The European Parliament endorsed
anti-smoking measures Wednesday that require tobacco makers to
print health warnings covering almost half of a pack of cigarettes
and cut the amount of tar and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   However, the EU assembly rejected a call for cigarette packs to
show photos of smoke-stained teeth, scarred lungs or young children
imitating smoking adults.
</P>
<P>
   The 626-member assembly voted for health warnings to cover 35
percent of the front and 45 percent of the back of cigarette
packages-- up from a 4 percent requirement now. The new warnings
would cover up to 47 percent and 50 percent of the packs in
countries with two and three languages, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation -- to take effect Jan. 1, 2003 -- now goes to the
health ministers of the 15 European Union nations who are expected
to give it their blessing on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfried Dembach, a spokesman for the European Community
Cigarette Manufacturers, a Brussels-based trade group, called that
''disproportionate'' saying what counted for consumers was the
information in the warning, not the size of the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly's vote went well beyond what the EU executive
Commission had proposed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission sought to limit health warnings to 30 percent of
the packaging. The tobacco industry had been lobbying for a maximum
of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament also cut the maximum amount of tar per
cigarette to 10 milligrams from 12 mg, and cut both the maximum
amount of nicotine to 1 mg and the amount of carbon monoxide to 10
mg.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it added a new requirement: cigarette makers can
no longer distinguish between ''low tar,'' ''mild'' or ''light''
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   EU Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne
welcomed the parliament's vote. ''I am greatly encouraged (by its)
strong support for the Commission proposal for a directive on
tobacco products,'' he said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the amendment to put pictures of rotting teeth and
smoke-ravaged lungs on a pack of cigarettes disappointed some
members of the EU assembly.
</P>
<P>
   British labour member Catherine Stihler said, ''A picture paints
a thousand words. And using these pictures would have saved
thousands of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bowis, a British conservative, welcomed removal of low-tar
descriptions saying terms as ''light,'' ''mild'' and ''low-tar''
were ''dangerous and misleading. It is dangerous because people
inhale mild cigarettes more deeply and misleading because it gives
the impression that it is somehow safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules adopted Wednesday are part of a larger package of
anti-smoking measures designed to prevent EU nationals from
lighting up. The EU estimates 500,000 EU nationals die prematurely
every year from tobacco-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a British parliamentary committee urged that tougher
health warnings be required on cigarette packs, including messages
that smoking can make men less potent.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Commons health committee said the messages ''should
be harder-hitting and more relevant to consumers than those
currently used.''
</P>
<P>
   d The Tobacco Manufacturers' Association criticized the report
as confrontational and said the government should ''talk
constructively'' to the industry.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday after the
government's most closely watched inflation gauge rose less than
expected, raising investors' hopes that the economy is growing at a
pace moderate enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 63.99 at 10,685.83.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 6.68 at 1,476.12, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 7.13 at 3,843.93.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price
Index inched up 0.1 percent in May. Many analysts had expected an
increase of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which showed costs for gasoline, tobacco and
clothing falling, raised hopes that inflation is now under control
and the Fed will be willing to leave interest rates unchanged at
its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming on the heels of the recent spate of weaker economic
reports, the better than expected inflation news will probably
cause the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged,'' said Mark
Vitner, economist at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Six rate increases in the past year have resulted in some modest
signs of a slowdown, allowing investors to look forward to a ''soft
landing,'' in which the economy slows down without grinding to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.50 to $70.375. On Tuesday, the company
appealed a federal judge's decision to split the company in two.
Microsoft is fighting to have the appeal heard by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has been sympathetic in the past.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is gunning to have the case
moved directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, technology stocks lagged behind the broad market.
Qualcomm fell $4.625 to $76.75 and Oracle fell $1.813 to $79.875.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line industrial stocks were helping the Dow's advance. Alcoa
rose $1.25 to $29.438 and Honeywell rose $1.813 to $51.875.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shot up $7.125 to $60.125 after confirming that it is in
merger talks with French conglomerate Vivendi SA and its
pay-television unit Canal Plus. The Wall Street Journal said the
deal would value Seagram at about $70 a share, or $32.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher. Crude oil prices are hovering
near their highest levels in three months amid speculation earlier
this week that OPEC will not increase oil production. Exxon Mobil
rose $2.188 to $83.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 425.96 million
shares, compared with 391.40 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.84 to 515.59.

<HEADLINE> Samuel L. Jackson Is Cool 'Shaft'  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Samuel L. Jackson is pretty cool, but put him in
a black leather jacket and his coolness factor goes off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of fashion, paired with outfits selected by costume
designer Ruth Carter, turns New York Police Detective John Shaft
into a style icon in John Singleton's update of the '70s ''Shaft''
films that starred Richard Roundtree and fueled the craze for
bell-bottoms and platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaft is not too uptown, too downtown, and he's not of the
hip-hop generation. His style is of the street,'' Carter explained
during a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Shaft's life is fashion savvy. Shaft hurls the
ultimate insult at a Dominican drug lord (Jeffrey Wright) when he
says the dealer's outfit is a designer knockoff. In jail, a wealthy
murder suspect's shoes are coveted by another prisoner, who is
stylishly dressed in the latest hip-hop fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Unrealistic? Not really. New Yorkers -- from the richest to the
poorest -- are very aware of their clothes, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's expected on the street for you to be fashion conscious,
especially for men,'' said Carter, 40, who visited Madison Avenue
shops and Cuban restaurants, and watched the African Day Parade to
see what real people were wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wears four leather jackets in the film, each
representing one of Shaft's moods.
</P>
<P>
   The ''classic'' Shaft favors a three-quarter-length jacket with
raw-cut edges and a wool collar by Giorgio Armani. The ''rebel''
Shaft wears a double-breasted Valentino pea jacket. The
''no-nonsense'' Shaft wears a leather blazer by Versace. And the
''approachable'' Shaft wears a full-length suede jacket, an
original designed by Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitting the cast, which includes Vanessa Williams and Busta
Rhymes, required hundreds of leather jackets, Carter said. (Many of
the jackets are the victims of gunfire in the film.)
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go to New York, you see a thousand different styles
of leather jackets on the streets. They are the quintessential New
York look, and that's what I was trying to re-create,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson follows fashion and knows what looks good on him. But he
trusted Carter to create Shaft's wardrobe, which is mostly black,
and he never looked better. Shaft's look is dark, she said, so he
can blend in anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who hasn't been able to give up the black in her
wardrobe since she moved from the East Coast to Los Angeles, also
worked with Jackson in ''Do the Right Thing'' and ''The Great White
Hype.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Christian Bale, who plays the villainous Walter Wade Jr.,
Carter outfitted him in classic suits, mostly by Cerruti, with
little variation from outfit to outfit. Bale's character is someone
trapped by his own surroundings -- and by his clothing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bale's character ventures into the drug lord's world, he
puts on clothes from Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch that have been adopted
into street fashion. But he doesn't know how to pull the look
together, and instead of blending in, ends up looking like a preppy
yachtsman in his plaid shirt and baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Hollywood's influence on fashion, Carter
said her job is to re-create real life on film, noting that black
detectives tend to dress up to gain respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job is to keep it real. You can't make it a fashion show
in the classic sense,'' she said. ''I'm doing a fashion show for
the everyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaft's signature three-quarter-length leather jacket carries a
$1,298 price tag at Emporio Armani stores. There are also mock
turtleneck sweaters at $298 and leather pants at $698 based on the
''Shaft'' wardrobe created by Armani for Jackson. Could the average
New York police detective afford such expensive clothes?
</P>
<P>
   ''Heck, no,'' Carter said. ''Shaft is realistic in his style,
but maybe not the price points.''

<HEADLINE> Jerry Lee Lewis Is Still Rocking  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TESUQUE, N.M. (AP) -- He's been demonized, ostracized and jeered
out of a country.
</P>
<P>
   He's the pyromeister who once torched his baby grand for a grand
finale. A rock 'n' roll wrecking machine who trashed pianos a
decade before The Who turned onstage mayhem into trademark encores.
The hell-raiser who racked up a half-dozen marriages and a 40-year
roller coaster career of hit records, scandals, accolades and
sordid tales of drugs, booze and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lee Lewis is a living legend who keeps on cranking. Elton
John has called him the ''greatest piano player ever.'' Bruce
Springsteen says Lewis ''doesn't play rock 'n' roll, he is rock 'n'
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I still like my style of rock 'n' roll, and I still love
workin','' said Lewis, who has sold more than 25 million records.
Fourteen years ago, he became one of the first musicians inducted
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He averages 50 shows a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about money. It never was about money. This is my
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent performance at the Camel Rock Casino, Lewis -- backed
up by The Jerry Lee Lewis All-Stars band -- sent the packed house a
message: At 64, he still has enough drive and adrenaline to deliver
a fervent dose of Eisenhower-era chart-busters.
</P>
<P>
   On his classics ''Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' and ''Great
Balls of Fire,'' Lewis proved he could still wail like he did back
when he dethroned Elvis Presley as the prima donna of Sun Records.
</P>
<P>
   He was the maestro of the eighty-eights, cascading across the
keyboard, thumping down rolling bass lines and hammering out
pulsating chord riffs on vintage covers ''Lucille'' and ''Roll Over
Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of the keyboard rock 'n' roll legends,'' said
Lawrence Scucci of Santa Fe, one of the 1,300 fans who turned out
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a fan of his for years. In a lot of ways, to see him
up front as he was in the '50s and '60s is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, born in Ferriday, La., on Sept. 29, 1935, got his first
musical influences from swing, R&AMP;B, Delta blues, Jimmie Rodgers and
Carl McVoye, a cousin who popularized the song ''You Are My
Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   His cousins figured prominently in his career: There was alter
ego Jimmy Swaggart, a piano prodigy-turned-evangelist who chastised
Lewis for taking up what was often called the ''devil's music'';
Mickey Gilley, who became a successful country artist; J.W. Brown,
his bass player, who backed up Lewis when he first exploded onto
the charts; and Myra Gale, Brown's daughter and Lewis' third wife,
who scuttled his 1958 British tour after three gigs when the press
leaked her age -- she was 13 -- and audiences booed him off the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daddy's broken a lot of rules and taken a lot of heat over
the years,'' said Phoebe Lewis, 36, his daughter and manager, who
lives with her father in Nesbit, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he lives for his music and his fans. He's an
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in his chair a few minutes before his performance,
Lewis -- wearing a white polo shirt, black pants and spit-shined
cowboy boots -- took a draw off his pipe and reflected on the early
dissenters who slammed his music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the nature of the people,'' he said. ''Rock 'n' roll came
on so strong, that after listening to the likes of Perry Como, it
scared the socks off them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis cut ''End of the Road,'' his first track, in November
1956. The following year was his golden year. ''Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On'' quickly soared into the Top 40 country and R&AMP;B charts
and hung on for 20 weeks. ''Great Balls of Fire,'' written by Otis
Blackwell, rocketed into the Top 10 on the pop, country and R&AMP;B
charts. It became the best-selling record in Sun Records' history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Lewis scored his last rock 'n' roll Top 40 hit -- a
remake of Ray Charles' ''What'd I Say.'' After that, he began
shifting to country and western.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1968 and 1972 -- a period when rock 'n' roll was being
redefined by British and San Francisco-based bands -- Lewis chalked
up 15 C&AMP;W hits. ''To Make Love Sweeter for You,'' ''There Must Be
More to Love Than This,'' ''Would You Take Another Chance on Me''
and ''Chantilly Lace'' reached the No. 1 spot on the charts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Lewis shifted back to rock 'n' roll and put together
''The Session,'' accompanied by Peter Frampton and Alvin Lee. That
same year, his 19-year-old son Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. died in an auto
crash.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Lewis accidentally shot his bass player, who
survived and eventually sued. In 1976, he was arrested for
brandishing a gun outside Presley's Graceland mansion in Memphis,
Tenn. Two years after that, he was immersed in a series of lawsuits
with Elektra Records.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth wife drowned in a swimming pool in 1982. His fifth
wife died at his home from a drug overdose a year later. During
that same period, Lewis came under scrutiny from the Internal
Revenue Service and grappled with drug problems and ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder starred in ''Great Balls
of Fire,'' a film based on Lewis' life and directed by Jim McBride.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was supposed to be based on my mother's book,'' said Ms.
Lewis, referring to Myra Gale Lewis. ''My mother and I were excited
about going to see it, but when we came out, we felt like we'd been
kicked in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the director was an idiot. One minute it's a drama,
the next a comedy, the next a musical. They took an incredible
story and turned it into a half-assed, Hollywood middle-of-the-road
blase, gutless, vanilla movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lewis recorded the rock album ''Young Blood.'' And
backed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, he performed
''Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' and ''Great Balls of Fire'' at the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   For his show at the Camel Rock Casino, Lewis put together a
crowd-pleasing blend of ballads, country, rock and pop, including
the standards ''Georgia,'' ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' and ''She
Even Woke Me up to Say Goodbye'' and hits by Hank Williams and
Chuck Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he isn't the essence of rock 'n' roll, who is?'' asked Greg
Johnston, who was in the audience for the Camel Rock show.
</P>
<P>
   The answer might be Elvis Presley. But that doesn't seem to
bother Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have walked 300 miles to see Elvis perform,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you know what? When I put my first record out, he came to
see me.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Ronnie Milsap  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- There's a bit of resignation in Ronnie
Milsap's voice, but the stronger emotion is determination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Folks say you need a record that anybody 20 years old can
catch on to, just like that,'' Milsap said, snapping his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap, who scored hits throughout the '70s and '80s, quit
releasing new music five years ago. Now that he's back, Milsap
knows he needs to connect with an audience that grew younger while
he was away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all part of what you can market,'' the 54-year-old Milsap
said. ''The whole thing -- as always -- is being able to sell
records.''
</P>
<P>
   He has just re-released his old hits on the double CD ''40 1
Hits'' (Virgin Records). Two new songs on the collection represent
his first attempt at radio play in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of one of the singles, ''Time, Love and Money,'' for
trade magazine Music Row, critic Robert K. Oermann wrote: ''Turn it
up! This radical reworking of a legend brings out the passion that
has always lurked just beneath his surface. If Kenny (Rogers) can
come back to No. 1, so should Ronnie on this slammer with a
message.''
</P>
<P>
   ''40 1 Hits'' is a good reminder of the impressive track record
the blind piano player from the Great Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina has built over 25 years, including perennial radio
favorites ''Almost Like a Song'' and ''I Wouldn't Have Missed It
for the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Nashville president Scott Hendricks, who has produced
Faith Hill and Brooks &AMP; Dunn, is helping Milsap modernize.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I'm going to take you into the 21st century if I
have to take you dragging and clawing and screaming,''' Milsap said
with a laugh. ''He understands today's music probably better than I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Milsap was born near Robbinsville, N.C. He has been blind since
birth due to congenital glaucoma. When he was 6, he was enrolled at
the Governor Morehead School for the Blind in Raleigh. The school
taught classical music, and Milsap learned violin and piano.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he led a rock group called The Apparitions. Then
he moved on to a junior college in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''In college, I was the only blind person there,'' he said.
''But I could sit around this room where a piano was ... all day
and take requests and sing for people. And it meant something.''
</P>
<P>
   He scored an R&AMP;B hit in 1965, ''Never Had It So Good.'' He moved
from Atlanta to Memphis and became a popular club performer and
recording session pianist for producer Chips Moman.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, Milsap played on records by Petula Clark,
Dionne Warwick and Elvis Presley. He can be heard singing at the
end of Presley's hit ''Kentucky Rain,'' hitting some high notes
that were out of the king's vocal range. Presley would book Milsap
as the entertainment for his private parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Milsap got a job at the King of the Road Motor Inn in
Nashville, and found himself the entertainer that other
entertainers came to see.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was somebody famous up there with me every night,'' he
said. He jammed with Charlie Rich, Faron Young, Mac Davis and most
other stars of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap signed with RCA records in 1973. He scored his first No.
1 hit with ''Pure Love,'' written by ''Kentucky Rain'' songwriter
Eddie Rabbitt.
</P>
<P>
   His first six albums were straight-ahead country, though Milsap
was always different because he played piano and had an R&AMP;B lilt to
his vocals. He crossed over to the pop charts with ''It Was Almost
Like a Song'' in 1977. His other crossover hits included ''I
Wouldn't Have Missed It for the World'' and ''Any Day Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Crossover was such a despised word back then,'' said Milsap.
''I was chastised for just a guitar solo on 'Stranger in My House'
for being too rock.''
</P>
<P>
   A switch to the Liberty label in 1993 was unsuccessful. In 1995,
he began performing at a theater named for him in Myrtle Beach,
S.C. He returned to Nashville three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I wanted to be in the studio trying to get stuff on the
radio,'' Milsap said. ''Every blind guy loves the radio.''

   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney has donated $1 million to the
Arizona Cancer Center to establish a breast cancer research
endowment named in honor of his late wife. McCartney has also given
$1 million to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York City, where Linda McCartney also received treatment. McCartney
recently helped raise $150,000 at a benefit in New York for the
Garland Appeal, an organization that supports cancer research with
no animal testing. A 360-page ''Beatles Anthology,'' written by
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, will be published in
the fall. McCartney was born on June 18, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Country singer Kathy Mattea, born on June 21, 1959, has chosen
to embrace maturity with her new ''The Innocent Years'' CD (Mercury
Records). Most of the songs on the album are about what's important
as youth fades, although the wry breakup song ''BFD'' is tacked on
at the end to show that she hasn't lost her sense of humor.
Mattea's folk-based country music has proved durable since she made
it big in the late 1980s with ''Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen
Roses.'' ''I'm not 13. I can't be LeAnn Rimes,'' Mattea says. ''My
job is to be me, and do it with as much dignity as I can.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Questions With Alicia Silverstone  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alicia Silverstone likes the way her new movie,
a musical version of Shakespeare's ''Love's Labour's Lost,'' makes
her feel ''uplifted.''
</P>
<P>
   And the audience?
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody who has seen it walks out of the theater dancing and
singing -- and those are people who walk in pretty grumpy,'' the
23-year-old actress said during an interview to promote the movie.
</P>
<P>
   However, Silverstone wasn't doing pirouettes when the role
required her to do a Ginger Rogers-type turn as the Princess of
France. Like many of the actors in the film, she had no previous
musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried about the singing -- that I wasn't going to be
able to pull it off, thinking I wasn't very good. But once you got
there, the environment was such a work environment and it went so
well, that my fear went away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone is pleased with her performance. Her favorite song
is ''No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)'' by Irving Berlin, the song that
credits her as the lead vocalist. But she's more likely to be
caught humming Berlin's ''There's No Business Like Show Business,''
an ensemble number led by co-star Nathan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just love this movie so much. I would probably be very sad
if anyone didn't like the movie,'' said Silverstone (before the
critics had reviewed the film and given it a lukewarm response).
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone wrote nasty things about it, it would hurt my
feelings because I think it's such a great movie, and I've seen
audiences see it and love it. I wouldn't want anybody to get in the
way of audiences being able to see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh, who doubled as director, Alessandro Nivola
(''Mansfield Park''), Adrian Lester (''Primary Colors'') and
Natascha McElhone (''The Truman Show'') also play leading roles in
the romantic comedy that moves Shakespeare's classic tale of
courtship to the kingdom of Navarre during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   1. Has it been hard for you to make the transition to an adult
role in ''Love's Labour's Lost'' while keeping your ''Clueless''
and ''Batman &AMP; Robin'' fans?
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone: I don't really know what audiences think. ... It is
a very similar thing to 'Clueless' because of the energy. I am
definitely a little bit older than I was, but not much. This is
very giddy and silly and lively, so it seems like it should attract
the same audience.
</P>
<P>
   2. You seem to space out your acting projects by several months
and sometimes even years. Is that a personal choice or do you find
it difficult to find good roles?
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone: There just aren't enough good scripts to be working
a lot, so if you're working a lot, you're doing some good movies
and some bad movies. I don't want to do bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   And you need life experience to act. If you only act, you kind
of become this crusty sort of thing because you're not getting life
experience, you're only getting movie-set experience.
</P>
<P>
   3. Two years ago you became a vegan. How did you become involved
in animal rights?
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone: There are so many things you can do to stop animal
cruelty. ... At first I was an animal rights activist who ate meat,
and that doesn't make any sense. ... I would tell myself, 'What
difference am I going to make, I'm not going to make any difference
in the world if I do this?' But then I got an education. Basically,
I saw all these documentaries and read all these books and I went,
'There's no way I can eat this.'
</P>
<P>
   4. Are you sensitive about what is written about you?
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone: Take the things I really care about, like animal
rights, if I'm misquoted about that stuff, it really hurts my
feelings because it's something I care about so much.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you hadn't gone into acting, what would you be now?
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone: I've wished that I was a teacher, or dancer -- now
that I did this movie.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Moves on Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are pushing forward with
plans for legislation meant to make it easier and cheaper for the
elderly to get prescription drugs, trying to get ahead of President
Clinton on what is bound to be a major election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a fundamental difference'' with Democrats, said Rep.
Richard Burr, R-N.C. at a House Commerce subcommittee hearing on
Wednesday. ''It is the argument about whether the government
controls this new benefit or whether we use the competition of the
private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have said committee action on GOP
legislation could come as early as next week. While they have
highlighted Democratic endorsements -- from Reps. Ralph Hall,
D-Texas, and Collin Peterson, D-Minn. -- most congressional
Democrats and President Clinton are critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just political cover and empty promises,'' said Rep.
Frank Pallone, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers were joining Clinton at the White House on
Wednesday to speak out against the GOP initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers raised concerns that their
party is moving too quickly, with too few details worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a tragedy to put a bill on the floor that most
members don't understand what the implications will be,'' said Rep.
Greg Ganske, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry itself seems skeptical about the
feasibility of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence suggests that it would be extremely difficult to
ensure the universal availability of drug coverage to seniors
through this type of proposal,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America, in testimony prepared for
Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the plan's chief
architect, provided details about a bill Republicans are developing
that would enlist private insurers to sell government-subsidized
and approved prescription drug insurance policies to Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the private sector can do a great job,'' Thomas
said, but ''the government will be there if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused Democrats and Clinton of
misrepresenting their plan for political gain. The administration
came out with its own proposal more than a year ago. Polls since
have shown that adding drug coverage, which was omitted from the
original Medicare program created in 1965, has strong public
support.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the GOP plan would have several provisions designed
to ensure that help with drug costs would be available to all older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the government would pay insurers 30 percent to
35 percent subsidies to ensure that new drug policies are
affordable to all, not just retirees with the lowest incomes, whose
drug insurance premiums would be paid for directly by Medicare
under both the GOP and Clinton plans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also said the government would act as the ''insurer of
last resort'' if private plans failed to offer adequate coverage
options everywhere across the country. Details of that fallback
coverage are still being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, out-of-pocket costs would vary
depending on which private plan the patient chose, although all
policies would have to provide minimum benefits and additional
protection from very high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration, Thomas estimated that with the help of
government subsidies, an insurance company could offer a drug
policy with monthly premiums of $35 to $40, a $200 to $250 annual
deductible, 50-percent copays and catastrophic protection covering
out-of-pocket charges after $5,000 to $6,000 in annual spending.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton proposes a standard drug benefit under
Medicare. Those who opted for the coverage would pay a monthly
premium starting at $26, no deductible and a 50 percent co-payment
toward prescriptions. The maximum annual government reimbursement
would be $1,000 at first, eventually rising to $2,500. The premium
too would rise, to a maximum $50.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have proposed including catastrophic coverage like the
Republicans' plan, but it is unclear how much that would increase
retirees' premiums or costs to the government under Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both sides estimate government costs of the new benefit
at around $40 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> Census To Get Authority Over Data  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Census Bureau would be given
the final say over whether to release politically sensitive sampled
population data from this year's count under a Commerce Department
proposal announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statistically adjusted data from Census 2000 could
dramatically affect the way congressional and state legislative
lines are redrawn next year. The authority to release that data
currently lies with the commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt offered details of the proposal
at a news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure that when this important decision is
made, it is made by the experts based on sound, statistical
science,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said in a statement.
''Politics shouldn't play any part in this decision, and this
regulation is a way to ensure that it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, which Prewitt has said
he favors. Supporters of sampling believe it will help account for
portions of the population missed in previous counts, including
minorities and inner-city residents who historically vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department. Both Daley
and Prewitt were appointed by President Clinton, and may not be in
their positions by early next year, when the decision to release
sampled data must be made.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could become a formal regulation by September,
following a public comment period, Census spokesman Steve Jost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the reapportionment of
congressional seats must be made using raw, or nonsampled data. It
left open the possibility for states to use sampled data when
redrawing state and congressional district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsampled data is due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. If
released, sampled data would be released by next April.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, in general, fear sampled data could skew those
political boundaries to Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, called the
proposal ''politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think this changes things at all because all it does
is move the decision-making process from one political appointee to
another,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the proposal, Jost said there was no guarantee that
sampled data would be released. Prewitt said the proposed policy
change removes partisanship from the decision-making process
because it is put into the hands of ''technical experts and career
statisticians'' not concerned with political outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the next president will appoint the next heads of
the Commerce Department and Census Bureau. So, if presumptive
Republican nominee George W. Bush should win the presidency in
November, he would have the power to change the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush, if he wanted to, could repeal the regulation and
take away the authority that this administration is delegating to
the career professionals at the Census Bureau,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's ranking Democrat. ''If he wants
to do that, that's going to be one hell of a Kodak moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Act states that the commerce secretary has the power
to delegate the authority over ''whether it is feasible to
release'' sampled data, said Jost, the Census spokesman. That power
was taken away following the last census, in 1990, from the census
director's office by the then-Republican commerce secretary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed decision returns to that prior long-standing
precedent which was changed in 1990,'' Jost said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moving Through Pentagon Bills  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to pay for Pentagon programs next
year is advancing in Congress with Senate passage of a $287.4
billion spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure, one of 13 appropriations bills
needed to keep the government functioning after next Oct. 1, by a
lopsided 95-3 vote Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It now goes to a House-Senate conference panel, which will
reconcile it with the House version passed last week, which is
roughly $1 billion higher.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions include a 3.7 percent military pay raise, $4.6
million for continued development of a missile defense system and
funds for buying 10 F-22 Raptor aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate was turning to separate legislation
dealing with Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the spending bill, the Senate rejected, on a
65-32 vote, an amendment by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., that would have stopped the Pentagon from leasing
more executive jets for its top brass.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon already leases six executive jets and wants $48.6
million for six more, Harkin said. ''There is no justification for
additional luxury jets to ferry generals and admirals around from
meeting to meeting,'' said Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, said the leasing program was an attempt to save taxpayers
money ''to lease aircraft instead of replacing them,'' as do ''most
major businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final 95-3 vote, Sens. Boxer, Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., were the ''no'' votes. Not voting were
Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Senate approved another amendment by Boxer that
would restrict the Pentagon's use of powerful pesticides on
installations where there are children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is a $3 billion increase over the Clinton
administration request.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, suggested he may
seek to withhold aid to Israel -- or at least delay it -- to protest
Israel's decision to sell advance radar to China.
</P>
<P>
   His panel considers the legislation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building a $250 million aircraft for China equipped
with a sophisticated Israeli-developed airborne surveillance system
known as PHALCON, which provides capabilities similar to those of
the U.S. AWACS system.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan previously suggested that $2.8 billion in aid to Israel
be cut by that $250 million. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
earlier this week voiced opposition to any such linkage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Callahan said that he would propose instead to hold
up the early disbursement of Israel's aid money for the time being.
Israel traditionally gets the money up front, in the first two
weeks of each new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would ''give the administration time to negotiate
what we hope will be an acceptable result.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the administration a possible way out, saying that if
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ''wants to issue a statement
saying it's not a threat to our national security, then the issue
is over with.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Crack Ecstasy Smuggling Ring  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service, after a yearlong
investigation, has cracked an international smuggling ring that it
says brought into the United States an estimated 9 million tablets
of the hallucinogenic drug ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through painstaking work, Customs investigators were
ultimately able to arrest the accused ringleader and bring down a
huge ecstasy trafficking syndicate,'' U.S. Customs Commissioner
Raymond Kelly said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said 25 people have been arrested in connection with the
smuggling organization, including accused ringleader Jacob Orgad,
an Israeli emigre who operated in Los Angeles, New York and Europe,
Customs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''His people seemed to have a presence in every major city where
ecstasy is the rage,'' said Fred Walsh, assistant special agent in
charge of Customs' field office in Los Angeles, where the case
began.
</P>
<P>
   Orgad was arrested by Customs agents in New York on April 7 and
is accused of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,
conspiracy to import and distribute narcotics and other violations,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Richards, Orgad's attorney, said his client is innocent.
''The government's case is based entirely on the false testimony of
convicted drug dealers or couriers who were caught red-handed,''
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs spokesman Dean Boyd said the 24 other people have been
arrested in a variety of locations including Houston, Los Angeles,
New York and Paris, France, over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Spearheaded by Customs, the investigation is called ''Operation
Paris Express.'' To date, the investigation has resulted in
Customs, the Drug Enforcement Administration and French authorities
seizing nearly 650,000 tables of ecstasy. Those tablets are
estimated to have a retail value of $19.5 million, Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   Three BMW cars, two handguns and more than $170,000 in U.S.
currency also were seized during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the 9 million tablets the organization is estimated
to have smuggled into the United States, ''the targeted
organization represents the largest ecstasy trafficking syndicate
that Customs has dismantled to date,'' the agency said in its
release.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in July 1999 when Customs inspectors in Los
Angeles intercepted three women arriving from Paris with a total of
140,000 ecstasy pills in boxes of toys and false compartments of
their luggage, Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-count indictment that was issued by a federal grand jury in
California said the ring employed 30 to 50 couriers who posed as
tourists or business executives. The couriers allegedly received
$10,000 to $15,000 plus free vacations in France for smuggling the
pills in false-bottomed suitcases, Customs agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs has been beefing up its enforcement in this area as
record amounts of the drug flow into the United States. Since Oct.
1, Customs has seized nearly 6 million doses of ecstasy. For all of
fiscal year 1999, it seized 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is chemically known as MDMA for
Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. Users normally experience feelings
of euphoria and an increased desire to interact socially. Blood
pressure, heart rate and body temperature increase dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy Said Rising Faster  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life expectancy in major industrialized nations is increasing
faster than their governments are predicting, which could strain
pension plans and other programs in those countries, a U.S.
researcher says.
</P>
<P>
   If residents live as long as the researchers predict, it will
push the ''dependency ratio'' -- the ratio of those over 65 to
working people -- from 6 percent higher in Britain to 40 percent
higher in Japan by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The dependency ratio in the United States is now .22 residents
over age 65 to every resident age 20 to 64, and should increase to
nearly .40 by 2050, said researcher Shripad Tuljapurkar.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy estimates are important for governments trying
to determine how much money to set aside for pensions, health
programs and other social spending for the aged.
</P>
<P>
   Tuljapurkar and his colleagues graphed death rates over the past
half century in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan and Britain, and developed a mathematical model to extend the
curve into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The study was prepared by the Los Altos, Calif.-based Mountain
View Research firm Tuljapurkar heads. It was published in
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Spencer, chief of the population projections branch for
the U.S. Census Bureau, said the Mountain View researchers compared
their estimates to U.S. projections that have since been updated.
</P>
<P>
   The previous U.S. Census estimate for life expectancy for
Americans born in 2050 was 80.45 years. The current U.S. estimate
for 2050 is 83.9 years, compared with 82.91 years projected by
Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest discrepancy was in Japan, where the researchers
predicted life expectancy would be 90.91 years for those born in
2050, compared with the official government estimate of 82.85
years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimated Canadians born in 2050 would live
85.26 years, compared with the 81.67 years estimated by the
government. In Britain, the difference was 83.79 years to 82.5; in
France it was 87.01 to 83.5; in Germany, 83.12 to 81.5; and in
Italy, 86.26 to 82.5.
</P>
<P>
   Tuljapurkar acknowledged some countries may have updated their
life expectancy estimates since he collected the data used in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Haub, a demographer with the Washington-based Population
Reference Bureau, said many countries are coming to the realization
that life expectancy estimates will have to be revised upward.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a hesitancy to raise life expectancy values to
a more than traditional level, which usually has been about 85,''
Haub said. ''Now, there's a recognition that you may have to.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 65; Nasdaq Down 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday after the
government's most closely watched inflation gauge rose less than
expected, raising investors' hopes that the economy is growing at a
pace moderate enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But trading was fairly choppy as investors moved cautiously,
reallocating money from technology stocks to industrial names that
have been neglected in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 65.36 at 10,687.24.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 5.90 at 1,475.34, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 21.25 at 3,829.81.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price
Index inched up 0.1 percent in May. Many analysts had expected an
increase of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which showed costs for gasoline, tobacco and
clothing falling, raised hopes that inflation is now under control
and the Fed will be willing to leave interest rates unchanged at
its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming on the heels of the recent spate of weaker economic
reports, the better than expected inflation news will probably
cause the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged,'' said Mark
Vitner, economist at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Six rate increases in the past year have resulted in some modest
signs of a slowdown, allowing investors to look forward to a ''soft
landing,'' in which the economy slows down without grinding to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.875 to $70.75. On Tuesday, the company
appealed a federal judge's decision to split the company in two.
Microsoft is fighting to have the appeal heard by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has been sympathetic in the past.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is gunning to have the case
moved directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, technology stocks lagged behind the broad market.
Qualcomm fell $6.688 to $74.688 and Oracle fell $1.875 to $79.813.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line industrial stocks were helping the Dow's advance. Alcoa
rose $1.25 to $29.438 and Honeywell rose $1.25 to $51.438. Analysts
said many investors who have been encouraged by the recent slate of
benign economic reports are seeking out these names because they
appear undervalued relative to technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shot up $7.25 to $60.25 after confirming that it is in
merger talks with French conglomerate Vivendi SA and its
pay-television unit Canal Plus. The Wall Street Journal said the
deal would value Seagram at about $75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher. Crude oil prices are hovering
near their highest levels in three months amid speculation earlier
this week that OPEC will not increase oil production. Exxon Mobil
rose $2 to $83.188.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 605.13 million
shares, compared with 391.40 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.27 to 515.02.

<HEADLINE> 'Youth' Cells May Promote Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental lab technique for growing cells to transplant
into people may activate a gene that promotes cancer, a new study
says.
</P>
<P>
   The technique uses an enzyme, called telomerase, which has been
called a potential fountain of youth for cells. Telomerase made
headlines in 1998, when researchers reported that it let human
cells remain young and continue to divide indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the treatment might also keep people young
captured public attention, but the scientific focus has largely
been elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For example, researchers have been hoping to use telomerase to
treat conditions like diabetes or liver disease. They envision
taking tissue from a patient and using the enzyme to build up a
population of rejuvenated cells that could be implanted in the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been shadowed by concerns that telomerase
treatment might promote cancer, even after other research in 1998
found no sign of that connection.
</P>
<P>
   The new result doesn't mean scientists should abandon hopes for
telomerase, said study author David Beach of University College
London in England. Instead, he said, it suggests the enzyme isn't
the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   Beach and two colleagues in the United States present their work
in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers worked with human breast cells. After they
inserted a gene to make the cells produce telomerase, and the cells
were grown in a lab, scientists found the cells had activated a
gene called ''c-myc.'' That gene is active in a wide variety of
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The cells in the experiment were not cancerous, but they had
''moved one step closer to becoming tumor cells,'' Beach said. That
suggests a risk of cancer if telomerase-treated cells were used in
therapy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So ''we have got to do a bit more biology'' to overcome that
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase itself apparently didn't switch on the gene. Instead,
the prolonged cell life in the lab apparently set the stage for the
gene to be turned on by something else.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Shay of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas, an author of the original 1998 study, said he had
not seen the cancer gene activated in other kinds of cells treated
with telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the gene gets turned on or not may depend on what kind
of cell is under study, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills 3 Policemen in Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) -- Three police officers were killed and
another seriously injured when a driver stopped initially for not
wearing a seatbelt opened fire from his car Wednesday in the
western city of Dortmund, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was found hours later in a wooded area with a gunshot
wound to his head, having apparently tried to commit suicide. He
died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Dortmund prosecutor Heiko Artkaemper said it seemed the man had
been afraid of being caught driving without a license.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began Wednesday morning, when two officers stopped a
black BMW after noticing the driver was not buckled in.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the man opened fire without warning, killing a
36-year-old officer and seriously wounding his partner.
</P>
<P>
   The man sped off, but was stopped about 12 miles away by another
police control point and again opened fire. Two officers were shot
in the head and killed.
</P>
<P>
   While a statewide search was underway for the car, a passer-by
noticed it parked in a wooded area and called police.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Jails Gunman Freed by Italy  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The gunman who shot Pope John Paul II was
locked in a solitary confinement cell in the Turkish prison that he
once escaped from, and Wednesday began serving the rest of a
10-year sentence for assassinating a newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Italy pardoned Mehmet Ali Agca on Tuesday after he served almost
20 years in prison for the 1981 attempted assassination of the pope
in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   Agca, who is believed to have had links with Turkish right-wing
extremists, has to serve the remaining nine years and seven months
of his sentence for shooting Abdi Ipekci, a liberal newspaper
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Agca's return has raised hopes that the gunman will be able to
shed light on the killing of Ipekci, who had written critical
columns on nationalists and was investigating the actions of
Turkish criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
   There have been allegations that Agca killed Ipekci on the
instructions of gangs that may have had ties to the state and that
he was aided in his escape from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit welcomed Agca's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lifting of a secret curtain over the Abdi Ipekci murder
could shed light on the dark pages of recent history,'' Ecevit
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Agca is to appear in an Istanbul courtroom to be
arraigned in the 1979 robbery of a soft drink factory as well as
the theft of a car that he allegedly used to escape from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kenan Altmisdort said Agca was also wanted for the
robbery of a jewelry shop, but that Turkey may need Italy's
permission to prosecute Agca on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   According to an extradition agreement with Italy, Turkey will
not retry Agca in the Ipekci case and will seek Italy's permission
if Agca is tried in new cases other than that involving the
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was put in solitary confinement in Kartal prison -- the same
prison he escaped from in 1979. It was not clear how long he will
be kept in solitary.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities increased security at the prison, boosting the
number of searches on visitors and slashing the time that visitors
could see prisoners from a half hour to 10 minutes, the Anatolia
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Agca will serve his 10-year sentence for the 1979 assassination
of Ipekci, minus the 158 days that he was in prison in Turkey
before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his pardon in Italy, many questions remain about Agca's
role in both shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Agca at first said that he acted alone in shooting the pope, but
later said the Bulgarian secret service and the KGB were behind the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Agca confessed to killing Ipekci but later retracted
his statements. Ipekci was shot nine times by two gunmen; Agca was
convicted for the shooting; the second gunman remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish court sentenced Agca to death in absentia a year after
his escape. A 1991 amnesty reduced the sentence to 10 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, a Turkish soldier said ultra-nationalists paid
him to provide Agca with a military uniform and sneak him out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Many ultra-nationalists regard Agca as a hero for having killed
Ipekci.
</P>
<P>
   Sevket Can Ozbay, a lawyer who represented the families of slain
soldiers during the trial of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
made a request to the Justice Ministry on Wednesday to represent
Agca, NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if his request would be accepted. Ozbay faces
disciplinary action by the Ankara Bar Association for attending the
Ocalan hearings either wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the
blood-red Turkish flag or draping the Turkish flag around his
shoulders like a cape.
</P>
<P>
   Ozbay said he has known Agca for 25 years, NTV reported.

<HEADLINE> Possible Pre-Eclampsia Link Studied  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   A potentially fatal complication of pregnancy may be caused by a
substance produced by the placenta, according to a new study that
raises hopes for predicting the condition or finding a better way
to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   The condition, pre-eclampsia, affects about 10 percent of first
pregnancies, causing high blood pressure and other symptoms in
pregnant women that can threaten the mother and child. The primary
treatment is to deliver the baby early, contributing to premature
birth problems.
</P>
<P>
   The placenta product believed to be responsible, neurokinin B
(NKB), was found by searching for genes that direct the placenta to
produce substances that affect blood vessels in the mother, said
P.J. Lowry, one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   NKB levels were found to be as much as 100 times higher in a
group of eight women with the condition than in 16 pregnant women
without it, the British researchers reported in Thursday's issue of
the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also injected female rats with NKB, which caused
a sharp increase in blood pressure when given at levels 20 times
normal for a pregnant rat, said Lowry, a neuroendocrinologist at
the University of Reading, in England.
</P>
<P>
   Additional studies are planned on larger groups of pregnant
women to see whether high NKB levels during early pregnancy predict
the emergence of pre-eclampsia. If the substance is found to cause
pre-eclampsia, a medication could be developed to block its
effects, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings should stimulate further research, but it is much
too soon to say whether NKB is the culprit, said Dr. James Roberts,
a researcher at the Magee Women's Hospital at the University of
Pittsburgh who was not involved with the British study.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Woody Allen was a hit in his off-screen role as
a neighborhood activist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleasantly surprised,'' Allen said Tuesday after the
city Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously rejected a
proposed apartment tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side. ''I'm so
used to losing.''
</P>

   The 17-story building was slated to go up on Madison Avenue in
the Carnegie Hill Historic District. Allen testified against the

commission members.

<P>
   ''Invariably when I'm filming, I come to Carnegie Hill to film
because there are very few areas anywhere on the island where I can
really present the city in the way that I want to world to see
it,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Allen said he was pessimistic about preservation
battles, but added ''if you love the city you really have to try
all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Past Korean Accords Have Failed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Since 1971, North and South Korea have
held many rounds of talks to discuss issues such as the reunion of
families and political and sports exchanges. Twice before
agreements promoting the peninsula's reunification have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 12, 1971: Red Cross officials of the two Koreas begin talks
to reunite tens of thousands of families separated by their closed
border. After 300 sessions over 14 years, they agree to grant
temporary reunions for only 100 family members.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1972: South Korea's intelligence chief and a confidant
of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung sign a joint communique pledging
to work toward reunification of the peninsula. Hailed as a major
peace document, the accord is scrapped one year later when
Pyongyang criticizes Seoul for having its secret agents capture a
South Korean opposition leader overseas and bring him home to be
prosecuted for anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4, 1990: North and South Korean prime ministers start
talks that lead to a Dec. 13, 1991, agreement promoting peace and
eventual reunification. It is never put into practice, partly
because of a dispute over the North's suspected development of
nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 70; Nasdaq Down 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday after the
government's most closely watched inflation gauge rose less than
expected, raising investors' hopes that the economy is growing at a
pace moderate enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But trading was fairly choppy as investors moved cautiously,
reallocating money from technology stocks to industrial names that
have been neglected in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 70.31 at 10,692.19.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 4.38 at 1,473.82, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 14.45 at 3,836.61.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price
Index inched up 0.1 percent in May. Many analysts had expected an
increase of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which showed costs for gasoline, tobacco and
clothing falling, raised hopes that inflation is now under control
and the Fed will be willing to leave interest rates unchanged at
its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming on the heels of the recent spate of weaker economic
reports, the better than expected inflation news will probably
cause the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged,'' said Mark
Vitner, economist at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Six rate increases in the past year have resulted in some modest
signs of a slowdown, allowing investors to look forward to a ''soft
landing,'' in which the economy slows down without grinding to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.688 to $70.563. On Tuesday, the company
appealed a federal judge's decision to split the company in two.
Microsoft is fighting to have the appeal heard by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has been sympathetic in the past.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is gunning to have the case
moved directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, technology stocks lagged behind the broad market.
Qualcomm fell $7.813 to $73.813 and Oracle fell $2.063 to $79.625.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line industrial stocks were helping the Dow's advance. Alcoa
rose $1.938 to $30.125 and Honeywell rose $1.25 to $51.438.
Analysts said many investors who have been encouraged by the recent
slate of benign economic reports are seeking out these names
because they appear undervalued relative to technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shot up $7.25 to $60.25 after confirming that it is in
merger talks with French conglomerate Vivendi SA and its
pay-television unit Canal Plus. The Wall Street Journal said the
deal would value Seagram at about $75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher. Crude oil prices are hovering
near their highest levels in three months amid speculation earlier
this week that OPEC will not increase oil production. Exxon Mobil
rose $2.063 to $83.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 725.78 million
shares, compared with 717.06 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.38 to 515.13.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Dealt Legal Blow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court on Wednesday dealt a
legal blow to an Israeli soldier's fight against extradition to
Canada on murder charges, saying Israel need not request additional
evidence that the soldier said proved his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   A district court ruled last month that Daniel Weiz, 19, can be
extradited to Canada to face second-degree murder charges in the
November killing of Dimitri Baranovski, 15, in a Toronto park
during a scuffle over money and a pack of cigarettes. Two other
teens in Canada are in custody facing similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Weiz petitioned the Supreme Court to order Israel's attorney
general to request affidavits given in Canada by teen-agers who
were at the park but said they did not see Weiz participate in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said that additional evidence from Canada
would not affect the lower court's ruling that the affidavits it
did consider -- from three teens who said they saw Weiz beat
Baranovski -- constituted grounds for extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Weiz, who lives with his mother in Israel, was visiting his
father in Toronto at the time of the killing. He has admitted to
being in the park but denies kicking and stomping Baranovski to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, an Israeli citizen can be extradited to stand
trial in another country but has the option of serving the sentence
in Israel if convicted. Weiz holds Canadian residency, and Canada
has promised to return him to Israel to serve any time in prison.

<HEADLINE> Will Bashar Press on With Crusade?  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- From the second floor of his home, former
Prime Minister Mahmoud el-Zoubi could hear the conversation below
between members of his family and an unexpected visitor carrying a
court summons. The talk halted abruptly when a gunshot rang out.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi had chosen to end his life rather than answer
corruption charges, knowing his inquisitors enjoyed the backing of
Bashar Assad, the son of President Hafez Assad and the head of an
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With his father's death Saturday, the 34-year-old son and chosen
heir must decide if he should carry on with the campaign. While it
won him praise and support from ordinary Syrians, it now means
risking alienating powerful figures whose backing he may need to
consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption in Syria pervades all levels of society, including
the ruling Baath Party and the political establishment set up by
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corruption has become so entrenched that it has reached the
point where people brag about their corruption,'' said George
Jabbour, a former adviser to Hafez Assad. ''The civil servant who
does not accept bribes is now a fool and the clean politician is an
ass.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi, who killed himself with a single shot to the head on
May 21, was prime minister for 13 years before he was forced to
resign in March. The Damascus city police commander, who had come
to deliver the summons, rushed el-Zoubi to a hospital where he was
declared dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi's deputy for economic affairs, Salim Yassin, and his
transport minister, Mofeid Abdul-Kareem, are under investigation,
also on corruption charges. Several directors at various ministries
have been sacked as part of Bashar's drive to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hikmat Al-Shihabi, Syria's chief-of-staff for 20 years
until 1998, fled to the United States this month to join a son in
California. According to a London-based Arabic newspaper, he felt
his turn might be next. Unconfirmed reports circulating in Damascus
speak of millions of dollars illegally earned from arms deals.
</P>
<P>
   While Assad was alive, Bashar had a free hand in going after the
corrupt. But if he is to continue, Bashar could upset the delicate
balance of power that his father maintained between the majority
Sunni Muslims and the minority Alawite sect to which the Assad
family belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad gave Alawites, who are an offshoot of the Shiite
sect, control of powerful positions in the army and the Baath party
while the Sunnis were given a free rein to get rich on trade and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The formula was severely tested at times during Hafez Assad's
rule, but has on the whole miraculously lasted. Bashar may not want
to put it to another test in his early days at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that Bashar will put on hold his
anti-corruption campaign, even if temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''He now has balances to consider and must pay attention to
delicate considerations.'' said Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a political
sociology lecturer at the University of Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   An indication that Bashar would follow the footsteps of his
father came in an editorial in the government newspaper, Tishrin,
which reflects the official view.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians bidding farewell to Assad expressed their loyalty to his
''struggle and his unshakable ... positions in defending the
homeland and not conceding an iota of territory or a single
right.'' They reassured the late leader of support for his son, who
''has made public his determination to complete the immortal
mission (of his father) and the march toward construction and
liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for Bashar, however, may come from the ordinary people
who realize that a clean administration could give them a better
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assad is in heaven and Bashar is our hope,'' was one of the
more popular slogans chanted by ordinary Syrians during mourning
processions for Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's conflict with Israel and its military involvement in
Lebanon since 1976 have sapped its limited resources. Reforms in
the state-dominated planned economy have been painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   But was Bashar's campaign really about corruption?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that it was in reality a purge inspired by
Assad to get rid of likely opponents to his succession. In a
country where the media is under tight state control and
information is nearly impossible to come by, it may take years for
the truth to be known.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Bashar will most likely put the campaign on ice
until he strengthens his hold on power.

<HEADLINE> Songwriters Trying To Get Noticed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Songwriters' Hall of Fame has been sleepy,
rudderless and homeless for much of its 31 years. Talk about an
identity problem: Its former chairman, Frank Sinatra, was a great
interpreter of songs but didn't write any.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the direction of veteran songwriter Hal David, the
New York-based organization is making a big bid for attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, it will honor some of the biggest names in
music -- Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Curtis Mayfield, Neil Diamond,
James Brown, Don Henley and Glenn Frey -- at a ceremony in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years I've regretted watching the way the music
business has gone to where the artist, the performing artist, is
the focus of attention,'' said David, author of ''Raindrops Keep
Falling on My Head,'' ''Close to You'' and ''I'll Never Fall in
Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When people hear a song, they think of Frank Sinatra or
Madonna, whoever it might be, even if the artist didn't write the
song,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's induction ceremony is a dry run for what organizers
hope becomes an annual televised event that stands with such yearly
music moments as the Grammy Awards, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
induction ceremony and MTV Video Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Krantz, a partner in the John Schreiber Group, a television
production team, was organizing Thursday's ceremony to make it
TV-friendly. If all goes well, he hopes a TV deal for future years
is in place by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David was installed to shake things up at the hall, which was
founded by the late lyricist Johnny Mercer. Sinatra died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David's big plans include finally getting a physical location
for the Hall of Fame. David said he is close to an agreement with
New York University to build one in a dormitory the college is
building. The hall would have its own entrance.
</P>
<P>
   David won't criticize his organization for failing to lodge
itself in the public consciousness before he took over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the timing wasn't right,'' he said. ''The timing is
right now.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> North and South Korean Accord Text  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Text of the agreement signed by the
leaders of North Korea and South Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Upholding the lofty wishes of the Korean people yearning for
peaceful reunification of the fatherland, President Kim Dae-jung of
the Republic of (South) Korea and Kim Jong Il, chairman of the
National Defense Commission of the Democratic Peoples' Republic of
(North) Korea, held a historic meeting and summit talks on June
13-15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the meeting and talks held for the first time in the
divided Korean history carry grave significance in promoting mutual
understanding and developing South-North relations and achieving
peaceful, national reunification, the top leaders of South and
North Korea declared as follows:
</P>
<P>
   (1) The South and North, as masters of national unification,
will join hands in efforts to resolve the issue of national
unification independently.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Acknowledging that the different formulas that the North and
South favor for reunification have common factors, they will strive
to work together to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
   (3) The South and North will exchange groups of dispersed family
members and their relatives around Aug. 15 and resolve as soon as
possible humanitarian issues, including the repatriation of
communist prisoners who have completed their terms in jail.
</P>
<P>
   (4) The South and North will pursue a balanced development of
their national economies and build mutual trust by accelerating
exchange in the social, cultural, sports, health and environmental
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   (5) In order to put these agreements into practice, the South
and North will hold a dialogue between government authorities at an
early date. President Kim Dae-jung cordially invited National
Defense Commission chairman Kim Jong Il to visit Seoul and he
agreed to do that at an appropriate time.

<HEADLINE> Hardship Is Reality for N. Koreans  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Beneath chandeliers, gloved waiters
tend banquet tables laid with linen. Sleek limousines slide past
manicured gardens. Child stage performers prance in opulent
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily controlled television images from Pyongyang this
week during a summit between leaders of North Korea and South Korea
depict a cultural capital, an elegant city studded with monuments.
Yet hardship is the reality of life for most North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the communist country's 22 million people don't get
enough to eat, don't have electricity in their homes and walk
everywhere because there is no transport. By some estimates, up to
two million people died of famine in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented summit, at which Korea's leaders signed a deal
Wednesday agreeing to work toward reunification, was a chance for
impoverished North Korea to showcase its regal capital. The face it
showed to the world was one of splendor, but the pomp highlighted
the economic divide between the ruling class and the powerless.
</P>
<P>
   The TV footage of parades, state dinners and stage performances
was an example of how tightly North Korea tries to regulate its
image. Fifty South Korean journalists were allowed to accompany
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on his trip to Pyongyang, while
foreign reporters were barred from traveling there altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean journalists described how North Korean minders
kept a close eye on them, limiting them to filing only pool reports
and banning impromptu interviews with people on the street. Most
television footage of street scenes was filmed from moving
vehicles, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of traffic in Pyongyang is a sign that living
conditions are basic. But the image campaign of North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il has swayed some people in South Korea, who have avidly
watched live television reports from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always thought North Koreans were so poor and lived so
differently, but on television, their lives didn't seem so bad,''
said Hwang Hye-yon, a 55-year-old cloth vendor in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''But perhaps it's a facade they were showing to the world, and
maybe it's different behind that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is far more precarious in rural areas, where
international aid workers say food shortages remain widespread
despite better harvests after several years of low yields caused by
bad weather and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean officials, who have relied heavily on outside food
aid since 1995, have become more candid about the urgency of their
needs. Yet they have controlled the access of most foreign aid
workers, prompting several aid groups to pull out of the isolated
country since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is done to hide all the interesting things we
should see and know,'' said Jean-Fabrice Pietri of Association
Contre La Faim, a Paris-based aid group that left North Korea in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Pietri said he had to inform North Koreans of field visits one
week in advance. On some occasions, he said, officials said they
could not give him lists of nurseries in an area because they were
''military secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Many villages, especially those in mountainous areas, are
struggling to provide enough food for residents, said Erich
Weingartner, a former employee of the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   More street markets are visible as people struggle to make a
living in defiance of socialist edicts forbidding private
enterprise. The government, unable to feed its people, largely
ignores these violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even in some provincial cities, you see a lot of people with a
little table and they might sell just a few items along the side of
the road,'' Weingartner said. Goods include baskets and other
handicrafts, balls of bean paste, furniture, and fruit and
vegetables grown in home gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The images of Pyongyang that have been broadcast back to Seoul
have featured mostly tree-lined avenues and monolithic state
buildings, not the city's cramped neighborhoods with outhouses and
no power.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Byong-joon, a South Korean doctor who traveled to the North
Korean port of Nampo by ship earlier this year to donate a batch of
eggs, said officials there heavily monitored his movements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said: 'I am a dentist. Let me look around a hospital,''' Kim
said. ''They wanted me to stay in the hotel. I was a little
disappointed.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monitoring Gusinksy Case  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia's international reputation could be
severely harmed if the government restricts press freedom, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Tuesday's arrest in Moscow of media tycoon
Vladimir Gusinsky, Boucher said U.S. diplomats have spoken with
Russian authorities and are closely following the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important that Mr. Gusinsky is afforded due process
rights and protections in accordance with the Russian constitution
and law,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been a series of recent events in Russia that
have drawn international attention to the issue of press freedom,
including a police raid last month on the headquarters of
Gusinsky's Media-Most holding company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Press freedom is an important issue to us,'' Boucher said.
''The secretary and the president both made that clear in Moscow
during the summit'' earlier this month with Russian President
Vladimir Putin. ''And we're looking very, very very closely at this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States agreed that ''Russia's international
standing will be severely damaged if the government lets stand
actions that are intended to intimidate independent media and
voices with whom it does not agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was arrested Tuesday night and put in Moscow's
Butyrskaya jail. He was being held on suspicion of taking part in
the theft of $10 million in state funds in a privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest has been widely viewed as revenge for Media-Most's
criticism of the Putin government and assailed as a step toward
Soviet-style repression of dissent. Media-Most includes NTV
television and several other media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Putin denied Wednesday that Gusinsky'a arrest was punishment for
criticizing the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said during a two-day visit to Spain that he had not
known about the arrest and promised to look into the case on his
return. If the law were violated, Putin said, he would take action
against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interfax news agency, Putin said he did not
''see a political aspect'' in the arrest. ''As for criminal, I
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Press Club in Washington said the arrest was ''a
very troubling incident.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While the facts are still unclear, there seems to be an
indication that the new Russian leaders under President Vladimir
Putin are moving to shut down a private news organization that has
been critical of the government,'' said Richard A. Ryan, the club's
vice president, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said any efforts to close down or control press freedom ''is
a setback to the advance of democratic reforms in Russia.''

<HEADLINE> Jailed Tycoon Built Media Empire  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Gusinsky began his professional life as a
theater director, then moved on to real-life high drama in the
bare-knuckled world of Russian business.
</P>
<P>
   His enterprises included founding Russia's largest independent
media company, and Gusinsky is regarded by many as a prime force in
developing a free press after decades of state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's NTV television station and Segodnya newspaper
frequently have run reports critical of Russia's Chechnya policy
and on alleged high-level corruption. Gusinsky's arrest Tuesday on
charges of swindling and grand larceny are interpreted as a Kremlin
attack on press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Gusinsky started out as a provincial theater
director in the town of Tula and then organized theater tours in
Siberia in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As economic reforms sprouted in the Soviet Union in the late
1980s, Gusinsky became one of the early entrepreneurs to take
advantage of them. He hustled his way up from small-time,
fast-dollar dealing to become one of the tycoons known as
''oligarchs'' for their influence on national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Boris Yeltsin consulted him, along with the
other moguls, on key decisions, and NTV coverage helped Yeltsin win
re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the early reform years, Gusinsky first jostled to buy and
sell office furniture and computers, then worked in real estate and
in a consulting venture to advise American businesses on how to
cope with Russia's complicated and often chaotic business climate.
In 1989, he founded the Most commercial bank, which was the first
in Russia to offer customers credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business in Russia at Gusinsky's level of wealth carries
physical risks and like other moguls he relied on large and
well-armed private security company, which has become a source of
friction with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Kremlin security guards raided Most offices and forced
company security guards and employees to lie face down in the snow
at gunpoint. Later, pro-Kremlin media reported that the government
was investigating Gusinsky's staff on allegations of corruption and
abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky fled the country for a few months and later said he
feared for his life at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But NTV continued to run piercing reports on the first war in
Chechnya, sometimes reporting from rebel positions, bringing
Russians harsh images of their government's bloody military
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Like other oligarchs, Gusinsky rallied behind Yeltsin during his
1996 campaign to defeat his communist challenger for the
presidency, and later that year won a license to open a private
satellite network. The license was widely seen as a reward for
favorable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But relations again soured between Gusinsky and the Kremlin as
he resumed critical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   NTV broadcast reports on the influence of rival tycoon Boris
Berezovsky on Yeltsin and his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and on
official decisions, and continued criticism of Yeltsin's successor
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has said the Kremlin tried to bribe him with millions
of dollars for favorable coverage last summer, but that he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Police raided his companies last month, saying they were
investigating illegal eavesdropping by his security service. A
court later ruled the raid illegal.

<HEADLINE> Witness Changes Tune vs. Rapper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A witness testifying in an assault case
against Stanley ''Flesh-N-Bone'' Howse contradicted statements he
made to police and said the rap star never threatened him with an
assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' Tarrance Vickers said Monday before Superior Court
Judge Darlene Schempp. ''I didn't say none of that to any of the
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Howse, of the Grammy-winning rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, was
charged after a Dec. 26 incident in which he allegedly brandished
the weapon after arguing with another man over Howse's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   When Vickers, the man's brother, tried to intervene, Howse drew
an AK-47 out of a baby crib, inserted a magazine, pointed it at
Vickers and then chased the two brothers, prosecutor Shellie
Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers disavowed just about everything police said he told
them.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he and Howse got into a scuffle, and both men
ran away in different directions when police came.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have no gun,'' Vickers said. When the prosecutor
showed him the assault rifle, Vickers said, ''I've never seen that
gun, not that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Howse faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Insane Clown Posse Show Canceled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- A scheduled concert by the rap group
Insane Clown Posse was canceled after a promoter said police forced
him to hire too many security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Jade Nielsen said he would have had to nearly double his
security staffing plans for Wednesday's concert at the Kato
Entertainment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you attempt to (promote a concert) in a private club
... and you have the city telling you what you can and can't do,
it's a form of censorship,'' Nielsen said. ''I have a problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankato Public Safety Director Jim Franklin called that claim
''poppycock at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not censorship,'' he said. ''That's simply providing a
community with a level of public service.''

   The four-day fair -- where country music stars and wannabes work

<HEADLINE> Girl Bone Breaks Linked to Cola  </HEADLINE>
By DON BABWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Teen-age girls who drink soda -- particularly cola
-- are far more likely to break a bone, a Harvard study found.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Wyshak, an associate professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health and Harvard Medical School, speculated that girls
drinking soda aren't getting enough milk, which contains calcium
that strengthens bones.
</P>
<P>
   But she also suggested that a chemical in colas -- phosphoric
acid -- may actually weaken bones.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in this month's Archives of Pediatrics &AMP;
Adolescent Medicine, was based on questionnaires filled out by 460
ninth- and 10th-grade girls in a Boston-area high school.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of broken bones was three times greater for girls who
drank carbonated beverages in general and five times greater for
active girls who drank colas. The study did not specify how much
soda the girls drank.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 57 active girls who didn't drink colas suffered
fractures, compared with 38 of the 107 active girls who reported
drinking colas.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Soft Drink Association, Sean
McBride, said: ''We strongly question the results of the journal
article.'' He said there is no scientific evidence that anything in
colas causes fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes amid growing concern among experts, who say
Americans are not getting nearly as much calcium as they need, in
part because they are drinking soft drinks instead of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be a wake-up call for parents and health care
professionals alike,'' said Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition
at the Center For Science in the Public Interest, a consumer
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Neville H. Golden, director of
the Eating Disorders Center in the Division of Adolescent Medicine
at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the
study suggests that ''osteoporosis is a pediatric disease as
opposed to a disease of older people and that we can have some
impact on it early.''
</P>
<P>
   In a previous study, Wyshak found increased bone fractures among
adult women who drank carbonated beverages.

<HEADLINE> Disputed Matisse Painting Returned  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Organizers of a touring art exhibit from Russia's
Hermitage Museum abruptly bought a famous Matisse a one-way ticket
back to St. Petersburg, pre-empting what they feared would be a
court-ordered seizure in Italy over its ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dance'' was supposed to go on display in Milan on June 26,
after being the highlight of a hugely successful six-month exhibit
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at the Hermitage's request, authorities put the work on
a flight to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest turn in an international dispute pitting the
Russian museum against the heirs to the pre-Russian Revolution
industrialist who first collected the painting, Sergei Shtukin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hermitage's decision speaks for itself,'' Mario Guttieres,
a lawyer for Shtukin's grandson, Andre-Marc Delocque-Fourcaud, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Delocque-Fourcaud asked Italian authorities to
confiscate ''The Dance'' on the grounds he is the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   Delocque-Fourcaud told France's Le Figaro newspaper the painting
was taken from his family in 1918 after the revolution, along with
450 other pieces his grandfather had collected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the thief was Lenin himself doesn't justify the
theft,'' Delocque-Fourcaud told Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained of the ''commercial exploitation'' of the
canvas, which became the trademark of the Rome exhibit and was used
on show souvenirs such as wrapping paper, scarves and ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
   A Rome court is expected to rule in July whether international
copyright law was violated, Guttieres said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dance,'' painted by the French master in 1910, depicts
five bodies dancing in a circle against a blue and green
background.
</P>
<P>
   Shtukin's family has campaigned for years to get it back, along
with the collection's other pieces, which include works by Picasso
and Braque.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the Matisse painting was in Paris for an exhibit
at the Pompidou Center, Shtukin's daughter Irina, appealed to a
French court but her claim was rejected. She died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government also has rebuffed the family's claim to
the collection.

<HEADLINE> Greek Church Escalates ID Battle  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- The leader of the Greek Orthodox
Church told followers Wednesday to unite against the government in
an identity card dispute that has set Greece's most powerful
institutions against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a rally of more than 100,000 people, Archbishop
Christodoulos sharply escalated a fight that strikes at the essence
of the Greek identity and whether politicians can govern without
the consent of the Orthodox church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your efforts are futile,'' cried Christodoulos in an obvious
attack against the long-governing Socialists. ''The people do not
follow you. ... You think you will accomplish you plans with the
sword of power. You are mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown began with government plans to strip the religious
affiliation entry from state ID cards. The government says privacy
laws require the change, which is strongly supported by rights
groups and religious minorities such as Jews and Muslims who claim
the IDs make them targets for discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But the church and many followers see the religious entry as an
important symbol of the historical role of the Orthodox church,
which considers itself the true guardian of Greek identity.
</P>
<P>
   For church leaders, there also is the fear of possible moves
toward a formal separation of church and state in Greece. About 97
percent of the native-born population are baptized into the Greek
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The church protests have upset government leaders. Premier
Costas Simitis' government, which is trying to bring Greece into
the mainstream of the European Union, complained the church was
adopting a political character ''not in line with its role,'' said
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis called the rally ''a
mob, not the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear the situation in the church could spawn great dangers
for the future of this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crusade also has split the church itself. Some top clerics
have refused to join the protests, saying the ID issue is purely
political. The spiritual head of the Orthodox faith, Patriarch
Bartholomew I, issued a letter to Simitis saying the ID reforms are
the ''jurisdiction of the state,'' the government-run Athens News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police were on full alert around Thessaloniki during Wednesday's
rally, and Christodoulos' 80-minute speech was broadcast live on
Greek news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another rally is planned for Athens on June 21.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Sec'y Urges AIDS Awareness  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers pulled a crinkled dollar bill out of his pocket Wednesday
and told a gathering of puzzled AIDS orphans and HIV-positive
Tanzanians that his job was to sign bank notes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain the connection, he told the group that had
gathered at the Wamata AIDS center that his job was to make sure
there is money to do things that make a difference in the battle
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very real economic and financial issue,'' he said.
''It can stop countries from realizing what they can realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers was in Tanzania on the second stop of a five-nation
African tour to highlight U.S. appeals for international debt
relief and AIDS awareness on the continent. Other stops include
Nigeria, South Africa, Mozambique and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old Wamata project, funded by international donors,
aims to provide support and counseling, mostly to HIV-positive
young people. It also carries out AIDS testing and supports orphans
of those who have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised speech Sunday, Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa warned of the rapid spread of AIDS in this East
African nation of 31 million people and the danger it poses to its
fragile economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Mkapa told listeners he sympathized with those who had lost
loved ones to AIDS because he himself had lost relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, there were three known cases of AIDS in Tanzania; in
1998 there were 600,000, with one in 10 Tanzanians HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of AIDS victims and HIV-infected Tanzanians is
probably much higher, Mkapa said, adding that the statistics were
based on those who were being treated in hospitals or health
centers, or who had been tested for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Summers announced a $25,000 grant to the Wamata center ''to
support people like you who speak out about the disease.'' The
United States is providing $7 million to Tanzania to deal with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to make the fight against AIDS
in Africa and providing debt relief for the world's poorest nations
top priorities during the so-called Group of Eight summit next
month in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Debt relief will come, and it will come as soon as it is clear
that debt relief is going to efforts like this,'' Summers said,
just before signing a dollar bill ''to the good people of the
Wamata health clinic.''

<HEADLINE> Rain Floods Central, Southern Chile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Streets in the capital were turned to
rivers Wednesday and thousands were forced to flee their homes
after days of heavy rains forced the government to declare a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The rains, which began Monday, were the worst in 20 years,
affecting and a large portion of central and southern Chile, said
Interior Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.
</P>
<P>
   Some 75 percent of the streets in the capital were submerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Mapocho River, which crosses through the capital, overflowed
its banks, flooding fields on the outskirts of the city. Many
routes into the capital were closed because of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Santiago is clearly not prepared for this kind of rain,''
President Ricardo Lagos said Wednesday as he surveyed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The neighboring port city of Valparaiso was also hit by the
flooding, and landslides were reported outside town. Both cities
were declared disaster zones.
</P>
<P>
   Activity in the capital ground to a halt, as classes were
suspended and government employees were authorized to stay home.
Some subways were shut.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people were forced to leave their homes, especially
in working class neighborhoods and the slums. Many more have been
left homeless because of flooding in the interior of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The weather bureau said about six inches of rain has fallen
since Monday. Rain is expected to decrease gradually and stop
Thursday, it said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Knocks Out State Dept. Phones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fire, apparently caused by an electrical
short, knocked out phone service in parts of the State Department
on Wednesday and forced workers on two floors to evacuate the
building after they locked up classified material.
</P>
<P>
   The fire flared in a basement room near the 21st Street side of
the building. Batteries that power some telephones were put out of
commission, Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was confined to the basement and the damage did not
appear to be widespread, he said. While fire engines responded,
scores of evacuated waited outside for more than an hour until the
fire was extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Geoffrey Grambo said a cable that
leads into a voltage room shorted, melting five large storage
batteries used as a back up power source at the building.
</P>
<P>
   Grambo says firefighters used sacks of concrete to prevent
battery acid from spreading inside of the building. Workers and
visitors had to be evacuated because of smoky conditions on the
building's upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Grambo says there were no reported injuries.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Cancel Some US Purchases  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will consider canceling $250 million
worth of military purchases from U.S. companies if U.S. aid is cut
because of Israel's sale of an airborne early-warning system to
China, Israeli officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes a cut in aid to Israel.
However, U.S. Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, has said he may
seek to withhold or delay aid to Israel because of the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, R-Ala., initially said the $2.8 billion in annual U.S.
aid to Israel should be cut by $250 million -- the cost of the spy
plane Israel is selling to China. However, on Tuesday, Callahan
said he would only propose a delay in releasing the aid in hopes
that this would give the Clinton administration time to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Aircraft Industries has installed a PHALCON airborne
early-warning system in a Russian-made Ilyushin plane. China has an
option for three more planes. U.S. officials have said they fear
the spy plane will pose a threat to Taiwan, a U.S. ally, and upset
the military balance in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said if aid is
cut over the China deal, he would recommend that some Israeli
orders placed with U.S. companies be canceled and instead filled in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will recommend that we ... forego the purchase of boots,
clothing, textiles, foodstuffs -- purchases which were diverted,
unfortunately, to the United States, to the detriment of the
lowest-paid sections of our population,'' Sneh told parliament in
response to a legislator's question. Sneh's spokesman, Hillel
Fertouk, said the idea was to cancel $250 million in orders -- the
same amount Callahan threatened to cut.
</P>
<P>
   But Sneh also said a decision by Congress to cut the aid would
be ''unprecedented in its gravity and hostility,'' and therefore he
did not believe it would happen.

<HEADLINE> Heredity Is Culprit in Cataracts  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heredity plays a far larger role in the development of cataracts
than widely blamed lifestyle factors such as smoking, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could lead researchers to seek genes linked to
cataracts and develop genetic tests to identify those most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a real breakthrough study,'' said Sheila West,
a Johns Hopkins University cataract researcher. ''I think this is
exactly what we've needed to reorient our research on the genetic
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cataracts, which are a progressive clouding of the eye's lens,
would develop in virtually all people if they lived to be 120 years
old. But smoking and steroid drugs are seen as risk factors, while
quality of diet and exposure to sunlight have also been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   A British team of researchers for the first time quantified the
genetic component of age-related cataracts in a study published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The team studied 506 sets of identical or fraternal female twins
ages 50 to 79. Identical twins, who develop from the same egg, are
especially useful for such research because they are genetically
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers worked up an overall cloudiness score for
patients' eyes and statistically analyzed the participants' age,
heredity, lifestyles and environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   They found that age explained 38 percent of cloudiness, but
heredity accounted for even more at 48 percent. The other factors
combined for just 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not just your age that is the cause,'' said Dr.
Christopher Hammond of St. Thomas' Hospital in London, who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, researchers cautioned that even 14 percent
makes other factors very important, since cataracts are so common.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon routinely operate on cataracts and replace the
clouded-over lens with plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Congenital and disease-related cataracts are blamed on different
causes than age-related cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hammond colleague, Dr. Clare Gilbert, said if future
genetic tests identify who is most susceptible to cataracts, those
people can then limit their exposure to the risks.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Attack Sierra Leone Village  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebels attacked and burned a
village near a U.N. peacekeeping outpost Wednesday as civilians
fled rebel-held central Sierra Leone, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether there were any casualties in the attack
on the settlement several miles north of Jordanian U.N. troops
stationed at Rockel Bridge, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, some 40 miles east of Freetown, the capital, is on
the outer edge of a horseshoe-shaped security cordon maintained by
U.N. troops around the city. On Tuesday, rebels and Jordanian
soldiers exchanged gunfire near the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also attacked the town of Lunsar, some 55 miles east of
Freetown, overnight for the third time since Monday, government
soldiers said. The report could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which has been completely abandoned by civilians, has
changed hands several times since the Revolutionary United Front
rebels reignited Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war in early May,
prompting a flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said 45,000 people have fled over the past week to the
crossroads town of Mile 91 from the rebel-held central towns of
Magburaka and Makeni. Aid workers says a government helicopter
gunship has dropped bombs on the rebel-held towns in recent days.
The gunship also reportedly has dropped leaflets urging rebels to
surrender their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 1,000-strong British force that has spent more than
five weeks guarding the capital against a possible rebel attack was
pulling out Wednesday in helicopters and planes. A few remaining
troops were due to leave Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were taking over from the British troops. The
United Nations has nearly doubled the strength of the force in
recent weeks, from 6,000 to 11,850 troops, in a bid to help
maintain security in the war-ravaged West African country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 200-person British military training team,
including about 150 troops charged with providing security to the
trainers, was staying behind to begin equipping and training 1,000
Sierra Leonean soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and mutilated
and raped many others in a campaign to topple Sierra Leone's
government.

<HEADLINE> Census May Get Authority Over Data  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying it would remove partisan influences
from a politically sensitive decision, Commerce Secretary William
Daley proposed Wednesday to give the head of the Census Bureau the
final word over whether to release sampled population data from
this year's count.
</P>
<P>
   The statistically adjusted results could dramatically affect
congressional and state legislative redistricting next year. The
authority to release that data currently lies with the commerce
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, while Census director
Kenneth Prewitt favors it. Supporters of sampling believe it could
account for portions of the population missed in previous counts,
including minorities and inner-city residents who vote Democrat,
and Prewitt has said it is virtually impossible to find every
person in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department oversees the Census Bureau. Both Prewitt
and Daley were appointed by President Clinton, but each may not be
in their positions by early next year, when the decision to release
sampled data must be made.
</P>
<P>
   If left up to him, Prewitt said his choice will be based purely
on what is best to do scientifically, not politically.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure that when this important decision is
made, it is made by the experts based on sound, statistical
science,'' Daley said in a statement. ''Politics shouldn't play any
part in this decision, and this regulation is a way to ensure that
it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, called the
proposal ''politics as usual.'' He proposed that an independent,
third-party panel play a role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision just moved from the hands of one political
appointee to another,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called it a
''victory over partisan politics,'' since Prewitt has said the
sampled data would not be ready before Jan. 20 -- the day the next
president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can continue to debate the merits of sampling over actual
enumeration. Prewitt is a political appointee, but in charge of a
largely scientific agency. I believe he has more credibility in
this arena,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said 99 percent, or 119 million, of the country's 120
million households had participated so far in Census 2000 either by
mail or at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   At-home visits for the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation of
315,000 households, which sampled data will be based on, begins
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that reapportionment of
congressional seats must be made using raw, or nonsampled data. It
left open the possibility for states to use sampled data when
redrawing state and congressional district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsampled data is due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. If
approved, sampled data would be released by next April.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, in general, fear sampled data could skew those
political boundaries to Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the courts, though, that ultimately decide the
legitimacy of sampling. Virginia is suing the Justice Department,
which enforces voting rights regulations, for the right to use
nonsampled data for redistricting without first getting federal
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could become a formal regulation by September,
following a public comment period, Prewitt said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Firefighter in Hot Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York City firefighter was in hot water
Wednesday for his guest appearance on the saucy HBO program ''Sex
and The City.''
</P>
<P>
   In the June 4 season premiere of the Golden Globe-winning
comedy, Michael Lombardi, 38, played a fireman engaged in a brief
but steamy affair with the character played by Kim Cattrall.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said in a statement Wednesday
that he would not comment on the discussions with Lombardi, a
12-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department is, however, in the process of reviewing our
outside authorization policy to ensure that firefighters and fire
officers exercise discretion when performing outside employment,''
Von Essen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Uniformed Firefighters Association, which represents
Lombardi, said it would ''vigorously represent'' the actor/fireman
if any disciplinary action were taken by the department.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi had some notoriety before his appearance on the show.
He appeared in People magazine's 1998 issue on the ''Sexiest Men
Alive'' and in the fire department's 1999 ''Firehouse Hunks''
calendar.

<HEADLINE> Report Details Senator Investments  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wealth of senators is riding the tech
stock roller coaster, invested in more traditional stocks, bonds
and real estate, or tucked away in safe and simple bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At least one senator, Jeff Bingaman, holds margin trading
accounts. Some have a second career, including songwriter Orrin
Hatch and authors Joseph Lieberman and John McCain, their financial
reports covering 1999 show.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., listed three blind trusts
together worth a minimum of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The annual financial reports are designed to disclose the types
of investments and liabilities lawmakers have, not their net worth,
so holdings are only reported within broad ranges. The largest
category, inhabited by one of Rockefeller's trusts, is $50 million
and up.
</P>
<P>
   Another wealthy senator, Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., owns Bank of
Montreal stock inherited from his father. It was valued at between
$25 million and $50 million, although the senator sold shares worth
$250,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the major asset of Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., was a
$50,000-$100,000 account in the Senate credit union that earned
between $2,500 and $5,000 in interest last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., lists only a Senate credit union
account worth less than $1,000 and debts including $15,000-$50,000
to Mastercard and a loan in the same range from the Senate credit
union.
</P>
<P>
   One senator, Christopher Bond, R-Mo., may have less money than
his son. Bond reported retirement accounts worth between $252,000
and $655,000. His son, Sam, a Princeton University student, had an
investment portfolio with assets worth between $388,000 and
$920,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, whose family money came from brick making, sued his
investment manager and PaineWebber in 1993, alleging his $1.3
million trust fund had been drained. Bond settled with PaineWebber
in 1996 for $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Bond's investments, including a trust from his grandparents'
will, were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the investors favoring computer, Internet, and
telecommunications stocks was Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
chairman of the Senate Democratic campaign organization. He owned
stock in Amazon.com, CompUSA, Global Crossing Ltd., and Egghead.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli was an active trader who bought and sold stocks the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla., reported owning
shares of America Online, Cisco, Compaq, Dell and Oracle last year.
He sold shares of chip maker Intel as well as Microsoft, which a
federal judge recently ordered split into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, his Democratic counterpart, Assistant Minority
Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, concentrated on real estate. He has a
property investment partnership with holdings throughout the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   His major assets include an office building in Las Vegas, worth
$500,000-$1 million; 100 acres of land in Bullhead City, Ariz., in
the same range; and mining claims worth $200,000-$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., owned several tech
stocks in an individual retirement account valued at $28,025:
America Online, Intel, Lucent Technologies and Microsoft. He also
holds a brokerage account worth between $3,000 and $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has a half interest in a rental real estate partnership
that owns property in Hattiesburg, Miss., worth $50,000-$100,000,
and also owns a 161-acre lot in Carroll County, Miss., in the same
asset range.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota listed ownership
in 22 investment funds and bank accounts worth between $197,000 and
$730,000. Daschle owned six apartments, but sold three of them last
year -- two in Arlington, Va., and one in Sioux Falls, S.D. --
bringing in between $45,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bingaman, D-N.M., appears willing to take some investment
risks; he has two margin accounts worth between $250,000 and
$500,000 each, allowing trades on borrowed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah, writes inspirational songs for performers such as
Gladys Knight. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman earned
$6,125 in ''composing income'' for Prime Recordings Inc. of Provo,
Utah, and royalties including $500 from MTV.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., received $144,579 in royalties for his book
''Faith of My Fathers'' and donated the amount to charity. He also
signed an agreement with USA Films for rights to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, D-Conn., earned a $45,000 advance from publisher
Simon &AMP; Schuster for his book, ''In Praise of Public Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, owns stock in CBS and Fox
Entertainment Group. Both networks have been recipients of
Lieberman's ''Silver Sewer'' awards, aimed at embarrassing networks
that show sexually explicit or violent programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., received $12,499 for regular
appearances on the ''Face Off'' radio program and donated the
payments to charity. He is the beneficiary of trusts worth more
than $2 million, plus four trusts of unreported value.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., married last year and reported several
wedding gifts, a sculpture of a torso among them. Its value was not
listed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes GOP's Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in two days, President
Clinton criticized Republican plans to provide prescription drugs
benefits to senior citizens. Still, he offered what he said was an
''olive branch'' in reaching a bipartisan solution this year.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Republicans, who want to rely on private
insurance companies, are opposed to his idea of providing drug
benefits directly through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a White House event Wednesday to promote his plan,
Clinton said that as long as all senior citizens have the option of
getting prescription drug benefits at an affordable price through
Medicare, he is willing to consider giving them other
private-sector choices as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to offer another olive branch. If they want to offer a
number of options to people, and one of those options is ... a true
Medicare program that is available at the same price to all
seniors, then we could talk,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less, Clinton said, would be ''an empty promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared with Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.,
and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and
representatives from senior citizen groups.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee could take action on the
Republican plan as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the Clinton
administration is misrepresenting the Republican plan, which is
supported by some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am perplexed by the president's partisan attack on
congressional efforts to provide a prescription drug benefit to all
Medicare beneficiaries,'' Hastert said. ''Partisanship is the wrong
prescription when it comes to this vital issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., is the chief architect of the
Republican proposal that would enlist private insurers to contract
with Medicare to provide the drug benefits. Thomas said the
government would act as the ''insurer of last resort'' if private
plans failed to offer adequate coverage options everywhere across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says it is not acceptable if the
Republican plan offers this ''last resort'' option only to senior
citizens with few, if any, private options to chose from. Also,
Clinton said, those private choices might not be affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's be clear,'' Clinton said. ''A private insurance model
simply cannot guarantee affordable coverage for all. To make the
promise of affordable coverage real for all older Americans, there
must be a true Medicare drug option.''
</P>
<P>
   At a White House event Tuesday with Democratic lawmakers from
rural areas, which often are overlooked by private insurance
companies, Clinton said the Republican plan ''claims to help
everybody but is a false hope for most.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry has questioned whether the private sector
could offer affordable stand-alone prescription drug policies to
all senior citizens, whose medicine costs are typically high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence suggests that it would be extremely difficult to
ensure the universal availability of drug coverage to seniors
through this type of proposal,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 66; Nasdaq Drops 54  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip issues advanced Wednesday after a
closely watched inflation gauge rose less than expected. But
technology stocks slumped, dragged lower by industry leaders like
Qualcomm and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was choppy as investors reallocated money from
technology stocks to industrial names that have been neglected in
recent weeks. Analysts said the choppiness betrayed some confusion
about the best way to play the market now that a modest economic
slowdown appears to have begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are torn between enthusiasm over how strong the
world remains and concern about the fact that things are indeed
decelerating,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief market strategist at
Key Asset Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.11 to close at
10,687.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index edged up 1.10 to 1,470.54, and the Nasdaq composite index
fell 53.65 to 3,797.41.
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks rose after the Labor Department said the Consumer
Price Index inched up 0.1 percent in May. Many analysts had
expected an increase of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which showed costs for gasoline, tobacco and
clothing falling, raised hopes that inflation is now under control
and the Fed will be willing to leave interest rates unchanged at
its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming on the heels of the recent spate of weaker economic
reports, the better than expected inflation news will probably
cause the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged,'' said Mark
Vitner, economist at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Six rate increases in the past year have resulted in some modest
signs of a slowdown, allowing investors to look forward to a ''soft
landing,'' in which the economy slows down without grinding to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.625 to $70.50. On Tuesday, the company
appealed a federal judge's decision to split the company in two.
Microsoft is fighting to have the appeal heard by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has been sympathetic in the past.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is gunning to have the case
moved directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, technology stocks lagged behind the broad
market. Qualcomm fell $10.875 to $70.50 and Oracle fell $2.688 to
$79. Intel fell $5.063 to $126.438.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line industrial stocks helped the Dow's advance. Alcoa rose
$1.75 to $29.938 and Honeywell rose $1.25 to $51.438. Analysts said
many investors who have been encouraged by the recent slate of
benign economic reports are seeking out these names because they
appear undervalued relative to technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet market watchers are cautioning that the hoped-for economic
slowdown could eventually stall corporate earnings for nearly every
company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors have been so focused on figuring out what the Fed is
going to do,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst with
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ''At this point, they'd do
better to focus on the face that a slowdown is going to hurt
corporate earnings. Stocks with high valuations could be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shot up $7.125 to $60.125 after confirming it is in
merger talks with French conglomerate Vivendi SA and its
pay-television unit Canal Plus. The Wall Street Journal said the
deal would value Seagram at about $75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher. Crude oil prices are hovering
near their highest levels in three months amid speculation earlier
this week that OPEC will not increase oil production. Exxon Mobil
rose $1.438 to $82.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.12
billion shares, compared with 1.11 billion at the same time
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.09 to 509.67.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained
1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.2 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Child Murder Case Reopened in Paris  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- DNA testing on a 16-year-old postage stamp may help
identify ''the Crow,'' the mysterious suspect in the drowning
murder of a 4-year-old boy, one of France's most sordid crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A French court on Wednesday ordered genetic testing on the stamp
to help unmask ''the Crow,'' who claimed responsibility in a letter
for the drowning of ''Petit Gregory,'' or ''Little Gregory,'' as
the child became known throughout France. The letter was sent to
the boy's grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's body was found in the Vologne River in the eastern
Vosges region on Oct. 16, 1984. His hands and feet were bound.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolved case gripped France for more than a decade with its
elements of jealousy among rival family clans in a rural backwater,
extortion, the birth of illegitimate children, crimes of passion
and death threats signed by someone who signed letters: ''the
Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first suspects was Bernard Laroche, a first cousin of
the boy's father, Jean-Marie Villemin. Laroche had been seen near
the Villemin home around the time the child disappeared from his
front yard, and was allegedly jealous of his cousin because his own
child was born severely handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Laroche was released for lack of evidence, and in a fit of
passion, Villemin killed him. He spent several years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion later fell on Gregory's mother, Christine Villemin,
but charges against her were dropped in 1993. The Villemins then
left the region where the family had lived for generations and
settled in a Paris suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Dijon in central France ordered genetic testing on
a piece of the stamp that was glued on an envelope sent to
Gregory's grandparents several months before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that either saliva or a sponge was used because
self-sticking stamps did not exist in France at the time. The case
was closed before DNA testing became widespread in French police
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists earlier this spring used DNA to uncover the identity
of a 10-year-old boy who died in a Paris prison -- more than 200
years ago. Using the DNA from the dead boy's heart, scientists were
able to identify him as Louis XVII, the son of King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette and heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last chance for the truth to come out,'' said Paul
Lombard, lawyer for the Villemins, who requested the testing. He
said it would take several months for testing to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using the latest scientific techniques is very important
because if they allow us to identify the Crow, then we will have
taken a big step toward solving the murder,'' he told French radio.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp and copies of tape-recorded phone calls to the
Villemins from ''the Crow'' are the only pieces of material
evidence left in the legal file.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ordered a semantic analysis of the words used in
the letters.
</P>
<P>
   The first letter warned the Villemins that the sender would
carry out previous, unspecified threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll carry out the threats against the chief and his little
family,'' the letter said, in an apparent reference to the boy's
father. ''He'll console himself with his money, life or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Another letter, dated the same day as the boy's murder,
expressed chilling satisfaction and claimed responsibility for the
child's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you'll die of sorrow, chief, your money won't bring
your son back, this is my revenge, poor jerk,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Crow'' was never heard from again.

<HEADLINE> US: Korea Summit Won't Affect ABMs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's deliberations on
whether to deploy a national missile defense will not be influenced
by the tension-easing summit between North and South Korea, the
State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there is a threat to the United States that will come
up in coming years. And we need to be able to deal with that,''
said spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   A missile defense system would be aimed at protecting the United
States against what U.S. officials consider ''rogue states,'' such
as North Korea, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that because other states, as well as terrorists,
also pose a threat, the success of the Korean summit is unlikely to
influence U.S. debate over whether to build a national missile
defense system. Proponents have pointed to the threat from North
Korea as a major justification for deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher noted that North Korea made a commitment last year not
to test an upgraded long-range missile in its possession and said
he hoped this would continue.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ''I don't think we see in (the summit) the seeds
of anything that would change the possibility of a missile threat
to the United States that we would have to deal with.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Nuclear Weapons Chief  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by another security breach at the Los
Alamos weapons lab, the Senate swiftly confirmed on Wednesday the
No. 2 man at the CIA to head a new nuclear weapons agency within
the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The White House welcomed the action, but it did little to blunt
sharp criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress
over the disappearance of secret computer files containing
information on how to dismantle an array of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the Department of Energy a national security risk?'' asked
Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., as the department's security experts and
the Los Alamos lab's director testified at a Senate hearing about
the missing nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
   As accusations and dismay swirled around the Capitol over the
embarrassing loss, investigators at the New Mexico lab began giving
polygraph tests to the first of about two dozen nuclear scientists
who had free access to the highly secured vault where the nuclear
data had been kept on two computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   With his Energy Department under congressional attack, President
Clinton said he retained faith in Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
but the president, in remarks to reporters, left little doubt that
he was deeply troubled by the latest security flap.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the answers we need on this issue,'' Clinton
said. ''We've just got to see this through. It's a serious matter,
and I don't think any of us need to be characterizing anything
until we know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. John A. Gordon, now deputy CIA director, won
unanimous confirmation by the Senate after his nomination had been
held up for months. The vote was 97-0 with no one eager to suggest
opposition in light of the Los Alamos controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon in a statement acknowledged he will ''face many
challenges and difficult problems'' but said he looked forward to
addressing ''these challenges'' as head of the new agency, which
will still report to Richardson. Gordon will assume his new job
June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, saying he was outraged about the security breach and
the fact he was not told of it for nearly a month, said that he
wants Gordon to ''immediately conduct a top to bottom review of our
three nuclear weapons labs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want accountability. There is going to be disciplinary
action,'' Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, senior Energy Department officials, appearing at
hearings in both the Senate and House, told lawmakers that the FBI
had taken over what now is a criminal investigation. They
acknowledged that so far they have no idea what happened to the two
hard drives which were last seen on April 7 and discovered missing
a month later. The incident was not reported to DOE officials until
June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the DOE's director of
security, discounted the possibility that the missing hard drives
might have disappeared during a training exercise in early May at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
</P>
<P>
   DOE and FBI agents conducted interviews and ''extensive
searches'' at Livermore and ''we concluded ... that in fact when
the Los Alamos team went to Livermore they did not, in fact, take
any of the (missing) equipment,'' he told senators.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Curran, the DOE's director of counterintelligence, told
senators he doubts espionage was involved. He said the
investigation was ''at a very sensitive stage.''
</P>
<P>
   While the loss of the nuclear material appeared to focus on 26
scientists -- members of an emergency response, or NEST, team -- who
had access to the vault, six lab managers, including the head of
the nuclear programs, have been put on paid leave ''pending an
explanation of their actions,'' said Curran.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos lab director John Browne said ''several'' of the six,
although not senior lab officials, knew that the devices were not
in the vault on May 7, but did not tell anyone up the chain of
command. None of the scientists was identified. On that day,
members of the response team wanted to safeguard the disks from
wildfires that threatened to engulf the lab, but found the
container empty, said Browne, who said he did not learn of the
missing material until May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been quick to blame Richardson, who a year ago
declared he was improving security and assured that nuclear secrets
were safe. He did not attend either the House or Senate hearings
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Intelligence panel
remarked sarcastically that perhaps he would have found time to
attend ''if the secretary would spend less time trying to get the
vice president elected.''
</P>
<P>
   After a speech at the National Press Club, Richardson told
reporters he thought the department had been ''adequately
represented'' at the Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also were critical.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, coming after the alleged espionage controversy
involving former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee last year,
represents ''a culture of indifference about security,'' said Sen.
Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee later in the
day, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said he was ''troubled and incensed''
by the loss of nuclear weapons data that could help someone
dismantle -- or possible make -- a nuclear device. He accused the
administration of ''lackadaisical oversight.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Say eFOI Law Being Ignored  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many government agencies still don't make
their computerized records electronically accessible to the public,
despite the 4-year-old Electronic Freedom of Information
legislation, groups say.
</P>
<P>
   A report from OMB Watch, a nonpartisan organization that
monitors the work of the Office of Management and Budget, says the
1996 eFOI amendments were intended to bring the Freedom of
Information Act into the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   But ''of the 64 agencies examined, seven have no useful eFOIA
presence, 57 have varying degrees of compliance with the
requirements and as of November 24, 1999, no agency had complied
fully with the amendments,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials from the Justice Department, the Defense
Department and the OMB say government agencies are doing the best
they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe federal agencies are in substantial compliance with
the eFOI,'' said Ethan Posner, the Justice Department's deputy
associate attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came up Wednesday during a hearing in front of the
House subcommittee on management, information and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice McDermott, OMB Watch's information policy analyst,
blamed a lack of funding and oversight from OMB and the Justice
Department for the ''overwhelmingly inadequate'' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, and Ian Marquand of the Society of
Professional Journalists, complained that many government agencies
put information on the Internet in PDF (portable document format)
which makes it hard to use the data. The agencies also use their
Web sites to promote their agendas and flood them with useless
data.
</P>
<P>
   ''Real data collected by the government that could be useful to
reporters is being withheld,'' Dalglish said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquand also complained about the amount of time it takes to
get information, even on the Internet. Most of the FOI requests
come from the public, not the press, he said. ''One important
reason is time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Posner said the Justice Department answers ''many, if not most''
of its eFOI requests within the 20-day limit, however.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Gotbaum, executive associate director and controller at
the Office of Management and Budget, singled out the Justice
Department for praise. ''They have gone the extra mile in regard to
FOI and eFOI,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government agencies promised to submit written answers to
the complaints to the subcommittee later.
</P>
<P>
   This was OMB Watch's second investigation of eFOI law
compliance. In 1998, it said it found widespread apathy and
noncompliance. There has been improvement since, although the group
said agencies still had a long way to go.

<HEADLINE> Better School Meat Standards Sought  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is planning new
safety standards for the ground beef it buys for the nation's
schools after a judge barred the agency from shutting down its
biggest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The rules will be similar to the pathogen testing requirements
that McDonald's and other fast-food restaurants impose on
meatpackers, said Ken Clayton, associate administrator of USDA's
Agricultural Marketing Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some special responsibilities here. It's important
that kids and others who get our products have confidence that what
we're sending out to them is the highest product we can get,''
Clayton said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department is in the middle of a dispute with the
meatpacking industry over its attempts to close down Supreme Beef
Processors Inc. of Dallas, which supplies about 15 percent of the
ground beef for the federal school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has failed a series of USDA-mandated tests for the
salmonella bacteria. But U.S. District Judge Joe Fish, in a ruling
last month, agreed with the industry that the testing was not a
fair measure of a plant's sanitation and barred the department from
withdrawing its inspectors, an action that would force the facility
to close.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said the new rules for school-bound beef will be
released within a month, in time for the department to start making
purchases for the 2000-2001 school year. The department buys about
125 million pounds of beef a year, most of it ground.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say what microbes the rules will target. Jack in
the Box, a hamburger chain that was rocked by food poisonings in
1993, requires packers to test for several pathogens, including E.
coli O157:H7, the most serious pathogen in ground beef, and
salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer advocate praised the department's move.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we buy for the nation's school children should not be the
bottom of the barrel. It should be the very, very best,'' said
Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Consumer Federation of
America's Food Policy Institute. ''The schools should at least
match what McDonald's, Jack in the Box and Burger King require.''
</P>
<P>
   The department on Tuesday urged Supreme Beef to close
voluntarily, but the company refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has never been a food safety issue. It's a political
issue. There's no food-safety relevance,'' said Steven F. Spiritas,
the company's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   USDA suspended purchases from Supreme Beef last November but
later resumed. Under the agency's current purchasing rules, meat is
considered safe for schools as long as it is inspected by the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services said the Food and Drug Administration
needed to step up its oversight of state food inspection programs.
FDA, with the help of states, regulates the safety of most foods
other than meat and poultry, which fall under USDA's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The number of audits that FDA does of state inspection programs
dropped by 59 percent between 1993 and 1998, the inspector general
said. In 1998, FDA district offices did not conduct a single audit
in 21 of the 38 states that perform inspections under contract with
the agency, the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they were enhancing their auditing program,
with a goal of checking each state inspector once every three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving in the right direction and providing the kind of
assurance that the consumer expects,'' said Joe Levitt, director of
FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

<HEADLINE> UN Approves Action Against Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A U.N. labor organization on Wednesday approved
measures against Myanmar in response to widespread use of forced
labor, but gave the country four months to prove its willingness to
change.
</P>
<P>
   In a 257-41 vote with 31 abstentions, International Labor
Organization delegates agreed to invoke a special article in ILO
rules against Myanmar, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution recommends that ILO members -- governments,
workers and employers -- ''review their links with Myanmar and take
appropriate measures'' to ensure the country cannot use the links
to extend its system of forced labor. It also refers the issue to a
high-level U.N. committee and agrees it will be discussed at every
future ILO conference until Myanmar is shown to have stopped using
forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Several Asian nations opposed the measure. Myanmar denounced it
as ''most unfair, most unreasonable and most unjust,'' and Japan,
China, Malaysia, India and other nations spoke out against it.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, the resolution put off action until the ILO
governing body meets in November to review whether Myanmar is
making serious efforts to stamp out forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ILO and the world community have sent a loud and clear
message that we will no longer tolerate horrific forms of forced
labor,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Myanmar Ambassador Than Mya insisted his country was the
victim of an ''arbitrary judgment based on misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the ILO barred Myanmar from receiving assistance
after a commission reported on the widespread use of forced labor
for infrastructure projects in the country. Myanmar claimed workers
offered their labor freely for the development of the nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- For Steve Stricker, the U.S. Open is
a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker arrived at Pebble Beach along with his brother-in-law,
Mario Tiziani, who qualified for his first Open by winning a
sectional last week at Boone Valley Golf Club in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm on his tail pretty much everywhere I go,'' Tiziani said
Wednesday. ''Basically, he's taken me by the hand and led me
around. When he putts, I putt. When he hits balls, I hit balls. I'm
like a fish out of water, and he definitely knows his way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker will be playing in his sixth straight Open and seventh
overall. He has finished fifth the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''His goals are a little different than mine,'' said Tiziani,
whose sister, Nicki, is married to Stricker. ''But I think being
here with him is good for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiziani, 29, has been playing on the Buy.com and Canadian tours.
But his most unusual moment came at a Hooters tournament in 1996,
when he finished with a hole-in-one on 17 and a double-eagle on 18
-- and still missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Dennis Tiziani, doubles as the golf coach at
Wisconsin and Stricker's swing instructor.

   DALY'S CADDIE: If John Daly makes a long putt, his caddie
might be prone to say, ''He shoots, he scores!''
</P>
<P>
   Former NHL player Dan Quinn is carrying the bag for Daly at the
U.S. Open, taking over after his regular caddie, Ron McCann,
injured an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who played with the Pittsburgh Penguins and several other
NHL teams, got a call from Daly two days after shooting a record
score to win the Mario Lemieux Celebrity Invitational by 14 shots.
The two became friends several years ago at a charity event in
Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is unbelievable,'' said Quinn, who is at Pebble Beach for
the first time. ''It's a chance of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, 35, will try to qualify for the PGA Tour this fall.
</P>

<P>
   AILING SUTTON: This is not how Hal Sutton wanted to prepare
for the U.S. Open -- spending more time in the fitness trailer than
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who played last month despite a sore Achilles' tendon,
was warming up on the range Tuesday morning when he felt a twinge
in his back.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to play one hole and decided not to risk further
damage. He was treated for a lower back sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt pretty bad,'' he said. ''And I thought, rather than
push this ... I felt like I changed my golf swing trying to do
that. So I decided to get it worked on.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, he said he was feeling better and said he should
be OK for the first round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to try to beat age,'' he said with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe practice is overrated, anyway. In March, Sutton managed to
get in only nine holes of practice before The Players Championship.
Then, he went out and held off Tiger Woods on the TPC at Sawgrass
to win by a stroke.
</P>

   WATCH THE DEER: A pair of deer weren't the least bit concerned
about getting in the line of fire at the Pebble Beach driving
range.
</P>
<P>
   The animals meandered around the range Wednesday, munching on
grass while dozens of balls fell around them. Occasionally, they
would scoot into the nearby woods when the ball picker got a little
close, only to wander back out when things quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   ''That just shows you how much brains they have,'' Fred Funk
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the deer have enough sense to stay away from the
target flags, restricting their diet to less-dangerous ground.
</P>

   DIVOTS: Duffy Waldorf stopped by the driving range wearing a
T-shirt and gym shorts. Going to hit a few, Duffy? ''I don't think
that would be too smart in this outfit,'' he replied. Then he
headed back to the PGA's mobile fitness trailer, parked nearby. ...
Mark O'Meara hasn't won since capturing a pair of majors, the
Masters and British Open, in 1998. This year, he has missed the cut
four times and hasn't finished higher than a tie for ninth at The
Players Championship. ''It's been frustrating,'' he said. ''But
it's coming.'' ... California artist Thomas Kinkade set up his
easel alongside the 18th fairway, working on a painting that is
expected to be finished by Thursday and made into a lithograph to
sell. Proceeds will be donated to the Payne Stewart Foundation.
Kinkade plays golf but won't give his handicap. ''People will ask
me what I shoot, and I answer 70,'' he said. ''I don't tell them
it's only for nine holes.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson No. 1 at Bills' Mini-Camp  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Rob Johnson has come to the Buffalo
Bills minicamp calm, cool and focused, having reclaimed the title
of No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson even was spotted sharing a couple of laughs with fellow
quarterback -- and sometime nemesis -- Doug Flutie during practice
Wednesday at Orchard Park Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been pretty relaxed. I don't worry about that. If
I take care of myself and play well, I won't come out of the game
unless I get hurt,'' Johnson said. ''And if I don't play well, then
I shouldn't be in there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid the sour Buffalo memories of the Tennessee Titans'
''Music City Miracle'' was the role Johnson played in that AFC
playoff game in January.
</P>
<P>
   The game was only Johnson's second start of the season; Flutie
had been the starter through the team's first 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bills' final possession, Johnson drove the Bills 38 yards
on six plays to set up Steve Christie's go-ahead 41-yard field goal
with 16 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That, as far as Johnson is concerned, still means something.
</P>
<P>
   ''We left the field and thought we had won,'' Johnson said.
''For me it was nice. It was the last drive of the game, and it
felt like we won a playoff game on the road against the best team
in the AFC.''
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Johnson wants to show he can play like that on a
consistent basis. Acquired from Jacksonville in 1998 for two draft
picks, including a first-rounder, Johnson's tenure with the Bills
has been beset by bad luck and injuries -- he lost the starting job
to a rib injury five games into the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a jammed finger on his left, non-throwing hand,
Johnson is healthy now.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Eric Moulds likes what he has seen in Johnson the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks pretty sharp. He's coming in and knows what to expect
and what it takes to be a starting quarterback in this league,''
Moulds said. ''In that position, he has to be one of the leaders on
the team. He knows his position, I think he'll handle it well.''

<HEADLINE> Witness pleads for mercy for convicted killer in boy witness case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The grandmother of three of Russell
Peeler's children described him as a warm, loving father as she
pleaded for his life to a jury that will decide whether he gets the
death penalty in the murders of an 8-year-old boy and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In rambling testimony filled with asides to the jury, Mary Bush
said she does not believe Peeler arranged the killings of Leroy
''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke. The same jury
convicted Peeler in the killings last week, finding that Peeler
ordered his brother, Adrian, to commit the murders to prevent B.J.
from testifying against him in an earlier murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wouldn't go as far as to be the monster they're trying to
create,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That boy there is not the one,'' she said. ''Russell is not no
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was called by the defense on the second day of a hearing to
decide Peeler's punishment. He will receive either life in prison
without the possibility of release or death.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pleaded with the jury to spare Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is somebody's life. This is somebody's mother's child,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the jury that Peeler, now 28, had three children with
her daughter, Angelina Keene.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Peeler taught his oldest daughter, Russell, 9, to use
a computer and ''set a good example for her.'' He also has
3-year-old twins, Sheila and Russell, named after his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loves his children very much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan
Benedict told Bush that the state had an enforcement action against
Peeler for $20,000 in unpaid child support. He also asked Bush if
she was familiar with ''The Bush Mob,'' a drug gang started by
members of her family.
</P>
<P>
   She described it as ''a bunch of kids,'' but Benedict said one
of the group's leaders was now serving a prison sentence for
murder.
</P>
<P>
   As she stepped down from the witness stand, Bush muttered to the
jury, ''Be careful. That's all I got to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's brother, Oswald Clarke, said outside court that he was
upset that Bush focused on Peeler's children in seeking mercy from
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''His children? What about B.J.?'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also called the controversial host of a local cable
show to testify on Peeler's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry ''Jer'' McClellan said he was a close friend of Peeler
when the two were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan described Peeler as a ''jokester'' and ''class
clown.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was never violent - never got into any fights that I know
of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Peeler seemed to change after his mother died of
cancer in 1993 when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when his mother died, it took a lot out of him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Corradino asked McClellan if
he had been convicted on drug charges in 1993. McClellan
acknowledged the conviction, but said he had turned his life
around.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan's local access show was pulled off the air in 1996 by
Cablevision of Connecticut after several viewers complained about
the appearance of a topless stripper. McClellan, who sometimes wore
a sanitary napkin on his head while performing, had argued that
federal law barred Cablevision from editing or censoring his show.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in Peeler's penalty hearing is scheduled to resume
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Former Brooklyn loan official convicted in contract killing scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former U.S. loan official was convicted
Wednesday of trying to arrange the killing of a witness in a New
York bank fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found Vincent Scarabino, 60, guilty of federal
murder-for-hire charges following a 10-day trial in Brooklyn
federal court. The defendant - a former deputy director of the
Small Business Administration's Brooklyn office - was arrested in
February at his home in Spring Hills, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accused Scarabino of hatching the scheme after an
old friend, Stanley Liebman, told him he was worried that the
testimony of a former business partner would send him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Liebman opted to cut a deal with federal authorities,
agreeing to secretly make tape recordings - played for the jury -
in which Scarabino talked about hiring two seasoned hit men to kill
the partner.
</P>
<P>
   Scarabino, who is under house arrest in Brooklyn, was ordered to
return to court on Monday, when a sentencing date is expected to be
set. He faces up to 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jackets' Coach Search Narrowed  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Columbus Blue Jackets president and
general manager Doug MacLean is narrowing the scope of his search
for a head coach, but he doesn't expect to hire anyone until after
the entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on a vacation in Prince Edward Island on Wednesday,
MacLean said he has interviewed five candidates twice and still has
to interview three more people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still continuing the interview process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Booth News Service reported Wednesday that Detroit Red Wings
associate coach Dave Lewis had interviewed twice for the Blue
Jackets' job.
</P>
<P>
   Other publications have reported that several additional
candidates have been interviewed at least once: former Calgary
Flames head coach Dave King, Hall of Famer Bill Barber, former
Edmonton coach Ron Low, ex-San Jose assistant Paul Baxter and
current Los Angeles assistant Dave Tippett.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of those names are in the mix,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has spent the past 12 years with the Red Wings, working
under head coaches Jacques Demers, Bryan Murray and Scotty Bowman.
He was an NHL defenseman for 15 years before that. The
45-year-old's focus is on the Red Wings' defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowman missed the start of the 1998-99 season after
offseason knee surgery, Lewis shared the head coaching
responsibilities with fellow associate coach Barry Smith,
considered to be Bowman's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL expansion draft is June 23 and the entry draft is June
24-25. The Blue Jackets, who begin play this fall, will obtain most
of their players over that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But MacLean said no coach would be in place to help with those
selections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be after the draft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, MacLean said he would prefer to hire a coach with
NHL experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''That may be an assistant coach, that may be a head coach,'' he
said. ''There's also some excellent minor pro coaches in the
American Hockey League and the IHL. We've seen the last two
expansion teams go that route.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Court Considers Sentence  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Murder or mercy?
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Supreme Court faced that question Wednesday in hearing,
for a second time, the case of a Saskatchewan farmer who killed his
severely disabled 12-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has traveled through every layer of the criminal
justice system, revolves around the appropriate punishment for
Robert Latimer: In 1993, he put Tracy Latimer in his pickup truck
and piped in exhaust fumes until she died of carbon monoxide
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy suffered from cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk,
talk or feed herself. She had undergone a series of operations on
her back, hips and legs, and Latimer has said he and his wife,
Laura, believed she faced a lifetime of painful surgery that would
amount to torture.
</P>
<P>
   Saskatchewan courts twice convicted Latimer of second-degree
murder. The first conviction, in 1994, was overturned by the
Supreme Court because some jurors had been improperly questioned by
police. The second, in 1997, carried a mandatory life sentence
without possibility of parole for 10 years, but jurors suggested a
lesser sentence to Judge Ted Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Noble agreed, calling the minimum 10-year prison term cruel and
unusual punishment under the circumstances. He invoked a rarely
used exemption from the mandatory sentence, ordering Latimer to
serve one year in prison and another year restricted to his farm.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saskatchewan appeals court overruled Noble in 1998 and
reimposed the mandatory sentence. Now the nine-member Supreme Court
must decide, in a ruling expected next year, whether Latimer
qualifies for the constitutional exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply a most tragic case of a man who loved his child
too much,'' Latimer's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, told the justices
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years of legal wrangling, the case has provoked
debate among Canadians, pitting activists for the disabled and
right-to-life advocates against people who supported Latimer with
thousands of cards and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Supreme Court building in Ottawa on Wednesday,
several Latimer supporters walked in slow circles, some carrying
signs. One of them, Deltry Zollmann, said Latimer only did what
''any father would do if he loved his children.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Saskatchewan government and advocacy groups
for the disabled, who intervened in the case, said giving Latimer a
lesser sentence would effectively mean society's most vulnerable
members are unequal. They noted no appeal would exist if Tracy had
been healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There cannot be two laws -- a law for the able-bodied and a law
for people with disabilities,'' said Pat Danforth of the Council of
Canadians with Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, however, argued that Tracy's unique circumstances
would prevent any precedent for other disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a case of open season on the most vulnerable in
society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Sumner, a philosophy professor at the University of
Toronto, said the case has spawned suggestions that homicide laws
be expanded to offer less-severe penalties for so-called
''compassionate killings.'' No laws have changed, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner said Canadians generally believe Latimer committed a
crime that deserves punishment, but not the harsh sentence
mandatory for second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not merely a matter of Tracy Latimer being
disabled,'' Sumner said, noting the girl faced ''continuous pain''
and additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Latimer, who is free pending the Supreme Court ruling, has said
he would prefer a lengthy prison term to the alternative of seeing
Tracy suffer indefinitely. He was absent from Wednesday's hearing.

   ''I guess really you just hope for the best and avoid the whole
mess,'' he said of the hearing from his farm near Wilkie, in
central Saskatchewan. ''They'll get around to me soon enough.''

<HEADLINE> Pat Buchanan gains New Jersey support, vows to build Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - Presidential contender Pat Buchanan
pounded home his populist points, opposing everything from world
trade agreements to illegal immigrants, and then collected New
Jersey's Reform Party delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan came to the state convention Wednesday, the same day
Reform Party leaders announced the resignation of their chairman,
who heads the effort to draft national founder Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claimed that by the November election he will be on the
ballot in all 50 states. His campaign has been collecting delegates
and support from nearly every state Reform Party organization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made a long-term commitment to the Reform Party. This is
just not about running this fall. This is a long-term enterprise,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   That is despite attacks launched by supporters of Perot, whom
they hope will oppose him for the party nomination, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a measure of astonishment and resentment at
how very strong our efforts are,'' Buchanan told reporters.
''People feel they are being outnumbered and overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former talk show host said his campaign is not designed to
turn the Reform Party toward his stance on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in 100 percent agreement with the Reform Party
platform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also said repeatedly he is committed to building the
Reform Party into a national organization that can eventually win
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am in this thing to win the presidency of the United States
of America and we are in this thing to build a new party that is
right,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief voting session, party members chose a slate of
delegates for the national convention in Long Branch, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The 125 party members assembled in a conference room at Raritan
Valley Community College heard delegates one by one say they
support Buchanan as their presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   They also chose a new state party chairman, Buchanan's state
campaign chairman Joe Sansone.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Buchanan spent 40 minutes saying he was the
candidate a majority of Americans would choose as president.
Provided they could hear his message, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate said it was a cabal of national media groups
conspiring with prominent Democrats and Republicans to keep him out
of any televised debates of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get in those debates, we've got a fighting chance to win
it all,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also addressed Perot supporters and his own opponents,
saying he welcomed any legitimate challenge for the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's OK, as long as they've got themselves a candidate and
they don't engage in obstruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Buchanan told reporters that the opposition comes only
from the Perot supporters left in the party.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Buchanan was the only presidential candidate to
appear before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a full slate of Buchanan supporters,'' party official
Beverly Kidder said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weapons Resurface in Solomons  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NGALIBIU, Solomon Islands (AP) -- The bullets were made for the
carbines U.S. soldiers battling Japanese troops in the jungles and
mountains of the malaria-ridden island of Guadalcanal -- a pivotal
battlefield during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Once buried in ammunition dumps around the island, the shells
have been dug up and pressed into service in a new conflict: the
fighting between Isatabu militants who want to push migrant
Malaitans off Guadalcanal, the South Pacific nation's main island.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence erupted last week, the Malaitans quickly
gained an edge, stealing machine guns and other weaponry from an
armory. So their foes, the Isatabus, retreated into the jungles and
foraged for weapons left behind by American GIs.
</P>
<P>
   Isatabu rebel leader Andrew Tee said his troops have no need to
buy more ammunition from outside the Solomon Islands. ''We get our
arms from the American rubbish, what they left,'' said Tee, wearing
a maroon beret and a thick green combat belt with a U.S. Army
supply pouch and canteen hanging on it.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, which began last week when Malaitans seized the
capital, Honiara, prompted the resignation Wednesday of the prime
minister, who has agreed to let a 12-member committee of government
and opposition leaders negotiate peace with the warring islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands are rich in American war history. President
John F. Kennedy's PT-109 patrol boat sank here and he sought refuge
on one of the hundreds of islands in the archipelago. U.S. forces
won a six-month battle against the Japanese, the first major
offensive in the Pacific. The victory began the island-hopping
campaign that brought Allied forces to Japan's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The island group, slightly smaller than Maryland, is also the
home of Iron Bottom Sound, the underwater graveyard of more than 40
U.S. and Japanese warships.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of the war can be seen at Isatabu roadblocks outside
Honiara, where fighters proudly show off U.S.-made shells strung
together in bandoliers made from strips of rubber cut from tire
inner tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure they still fire. They're from the United States,'' said
one fighter, biting into a boiled potato and wearing a traditional
loincloth made from tree bark fibers. Fearful they might be
identified, the rebels would not give their names or allow
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabus say they have plenty of other American weapons,
including rifles and machine guns, though they would not display
U.S. ammunition dumps or other World War II-vintage weapons they
claim to have.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels at the roadblock in a clearing of coconut
trees carried homemade single-shot rifles with handcarved stocks
and pipes fashioned into gun barrels. A spring snaps a pin that
fires the 61 mm bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The guns are no match for the M-16 machine guns wielded by the
Malaitan rebels, who with about 500 fighters control the capital, a
small strip of shops and modest A-frame homes on stilts sandwiched
on one side by the South Pacific and a lushly vegetated small
mountain range on the other.
</P>
<P>
   One long road runs through Honiara and the Malaitans have sealed
it off with roadblocks on the east and west ends. Men in camouflage
cargo pants, floppy Australian military sun hats and bandoliers of
M-16 bullets stop the occasional car that dares to cross rebel
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Malaitans came to Guadalcanal with U.S. troops, who
used them to carry supplies. Thousands more followed and settled in
squatter villages or bought land from the Isatabus.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaitans, who now hold many of the best jobs in the
capital, have a reputation for being more industrious than
Isatabus, whom they say are lazy and waste good farm land. The
Isatabus complain the Malaitans are arrogant and too aggressive and
should move back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Isatabus have been kicking the Malaitans off land in Guadalcanal
and about 20,000 were forced to return to Malaita in the past 18
months. Malaitans then took up arms against a government they said
was ignoring their plight.
</P>
<P>
   But with Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu's resignation
Wednesday the crisis may be ending. The move was applauded by
Malaitan leader Andrew Nori, who predicted a smooth transition of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Nori said his forces will turn in their weapons if all parties
agree to a peace deal and the complaints of evicted Malaitans are
addressed. ''The laying down of arms certainly will be on the
agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tee, the Isatabu leader, was disappointed to hear Ulufa'alu
had caved in and resigned. However, the fighter said his forces
were ready to continue honoring a cease-fire, which ends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they fight, we fight. If they sit down, we sit down,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Family attractions planned for Camden waterfront  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The signs posted at entrances to the city
say, ''Welcome to Camden. Experience the Rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many poor cities, there traditionally hasn't been much for
children and families to do in Camden. But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   Ground for a minor league baseball park will be broken Thursday.
Tall ships from around the world will sail down the Delaware River
next week and opening ceremonies for the Republican National
Convention will be held on Camden's waterfront in July.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the waterfront will be home to the battleship USS
New Jersey museum, and an aerial tram will link the Camden and
Philadelphia riverfronts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a playground for adults and children,'' Paul
Drayton, executive director of the Delaware River Port Authority,
said Wednesday. The Port Authority and the Cooper's Ferry
Development Association have been the driving forces behind the new
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   -Ground will be broken Thursday for the 6,425-seat baseball
stadium. The team will be part of minor league's Atlantic League,
which includes the Atlantic City Surf and the Newark Bears. The
ballpark is expected to be completed in May and the team will begin
play in the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   -More than 20 tall ships will berth along the Delaware River for
OpSail 2000 from Friday, June 23 through Thursday, June 29. Events
will include a parade of ships, arts festival, laser shows,
fireworks and public tours of the ships.
</P>
<P>
   -Opening ceremonies for the Republican National Convention,
which begins July 31, will be held on Camden's riverfront, and
delegate and corporate events will be held at the Thomas Kean New
Jersey State Aquarium and the Sony E-Center.
</P>
<P>
   -Construction is expected to begin in the fall on an aerial tram
linking Camden and Philadelphia. The tram will be able to carry up
to 2,500 people per hour in 8-person gondolas. It will travel 165
feet in the air, next to the Ben Franklin Bridge. The tram will
land at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia and near the aquarium in
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   -The USS New Jersey Memorial will include a 250-foot pier with
an enclosed walkway and an interpretive center. The ship, which was
launched in 1942, will be restored and converted into a museum.
</P>
<P>
   -A visitors center has opened on the waterfront across the
street from the aquarium and the Camden Children's Garden. Two more
visitors centers are planned: One is scheduled to open in 2002 at
the aerial tram station and one in 2003 at Camden's light rail
station for the line being built to link Camden and Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia and Camden waterfronts attract 3 million
visitors per year. Officials hope to increase that to more than 8
million, Drayton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to be a model - two cities, one waterfront.
All together, it far surpasses any other waterfront,'' he said.
''It's going to be a destination in and of itself.''

<HEADLINE> Man accused of killing two taken to psychiatric center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A security guard accused of killing his wife
and mother-in-law before holding his son hostage was taken
Wednesday to a state psychiatric facility.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Kemoum was transferred to the Ann Klein Forensic Center near
Trenton at the recommendation of doctors at University Hospital,
where he had stayed Tuesday after his arrest, Essex County
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemoum, 49, held his 9-year-old son hostage at their Newark home
for six hours after slashing the throats of his wife and
mother-in-law, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended Tuesday afternoon after a police sergeant
posed as a television cameraman and got Kemoum to release the boy,
also named Ali, in exchange for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''interview,'' Kemoum, 49, accused his wife of sexual
abuse and his employers of mental abuse, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemoum walked outside and was arrested an hour later after
police told him his son was asking for him at the hospital,
although police did not know that to be the case, according to
police Director Joseph Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemoum worked as a night security guard at a Bear Stearns
brokerage in Whippany, but was unhappy that he had been unable to
find work as a chemist for five years, Mayor Sharpe James has said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemoum had lived with his son, wife Amada Dominguez and
mother-in-law Carmen Dominguez in the home for about nine years,
neighbors said. Dominguez, 54, operated a dental practice there.

<HEADLINE> Top Military Man Alleged To Be Spy  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A retired Army Reserve colonel was accused of
spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for 25 years Wednesday after
being arrested in a government sting aimed at some unfinished
business from the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   George Trofimoff, 73, allegedly sold military secrets to the
Soviets when he was a civilian employee of the U.S. Army at an
installation in West Germany where refugees and defectors from the
Soviet bloc were interrogated. The charges could bring life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the position he achieved in the reserves, prosecutors
called him the highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever charged
with espionage. U.S. Attorney Donna Bucella said Trofimoff has been
under investigation by German and American officials for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was arrested at a Tampa hotel after meeting with an
FBI agent who was posing as a Russian operative delivering a
payment. His wife, Jutta -- who authorities said was not involved --
was waiting in their car.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, prosecutors unsealed a federal indictment detailing
the espionage charge against him -- that he gave the Soviets
''documents, photographs, photographic negatives and information
relating to the national defense of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the Russians paid Trofimoff and gave him an
award for bravery. Frank Gallagher, agent in charge of the FBI's
Tampa office, said Trofimoff was paid $250,000 over the course of
his 25-year spy career.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff retired from his Army civilian job in 1995 after 35
years. He has been living on Patriot Drive in a gated community in
Melbourne, Fla., and works as a part-time bagger at a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Pizzo ordered Trofimoff
held without bail and gave him a court-appointed attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff's telephone number in Melbourne was unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was born in Germany to Russian parents and became a
U.S. citizen in 1951. He joined the Army in 1953, served for three
years and in 1959 was hired to a civilian working in military
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said he sold classified information he obtained
while serving as a civilian chief of the U.S. Army element of the
Nuremburg Joint Interrogation Center in Germany from 1969 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Trofimoff used his unlimited access to
classified information at the center to tell the KGB what the
United States knew about the Soviets and their allies. Trofimoff
also knew of weaknesses in American intelligence-gathering and
passed that information on to the KGB, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff also received the Order of the Red Banner, the Soviet
award presented to bravery and self-sacrifice in the defense of the
socialist homeland, prosecutors said. The Soviet Union broke apart
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Trofimoff was recruited into the KGB by a
boyhood friend, Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl, a Russian Orthodox
priest who served as the Archbishop of Vienna and Austria and
temporary Archbishop of Baden and Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff allegedly took documents from the his work and
photographed them, passing the film on to Susemihl and other KGB
officers during meetings in Austria. The indictment also notes
eight meetings between Trofimoff and KGB officers, naming the KGB
agents in three instances.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff and Susemihl were arrested in Germany in 1994 on
espionage charges, but were released when German officials could
not prove their case within the five-year statute of limitations.
Trofimoff told German authorities the money he received from
Susmihl were personal loans.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statute of limitations for spying under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Susemihl died in 1999 and Trofimoff moved to a gated community
in Melbourne that is popular with retired military officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very good neighbor and a good friend,'' said one
resident, John Callaway. ''These people are wonderful people. What
happened, that's way in the past.''

<HEADLINE> Long Branch eighth-grader dies during pool outing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Fifteen counselors were on hand Wednesday
to help Long Branch eighth-graders deal with the death of a
classmate at a pool outing.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Robertson, 14, died at 4:27 p.m. Tuesday at Raritan Bay
Medical Center, Old Bridge Division, about two hours after he was
found on the bottom of a pool at the Birch Hill Swim Club on Route
9 in Old Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Robertson's death was not immediately known. An
autopsy was expected to be performed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Bridge Police Department did not return repeated phone
calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at the Long Branch Middle School was somber and some
students left early, school district spokeswoman Theresa Falcone
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids were very upset and sad,'' she said. ''They
immediately thought of ways to honor him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and 190 of his classmates along with 14 teachers were
at the swim club to celebrate the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone said there were four lifeguards - two at each shallow
and deep section - monitoring the students.
</P>
<P>
   However, a statement released by Superintendent Joseph M.
Ferraina and middle school principal Robert A. Celli indicated that
there were two lifeguards on the scene, The Asbury Park Press of
Neptune reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some students suggested that lifeguards did not respond promptly
to cries for help, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've spoken to teachers,'' Falcone said. ''Everyone responded
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcone said teachers observed Robertson swimming without any
problems in the deep section Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's class was scheduled to hold an eighth-grade dance
Wednesday night in honor of the boy, Falcone said.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors will be available through Friday and any additional
days as they are needed, Falcone said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General's employee charged in on-line sex sting  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A scientist in the state attorney general's
office was arrested and charged with driving to New Jersey under
the mistaken belief he would have sex with a 13-year-old girl, the
FBI announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Brian C. Johnson, 26, of Rexford, had been
communicating via the Internet with a person he thought was a
13-year-old girl, federal agents said. The ''girl'' was actually an
FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying himself by the screen name ''Bailey26,'' he made
plans to meet the girl Tuesday in Middlesex County, New Jersey to
have sex, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson arrived, though, he was greeted by members of the
North East Regional Child Exploitation Task Force who arrested him
and charged him with the federal crime of interstate travel for the
purpose of engaging a minor in a sex act.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been suspended without pay while the FBI
investigation continues, said Paul Larabee, a spokesman for
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is an environmental scientist specializing in computer
analysis of environmental issues. He was hired in February 1997 and
makes $53,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office stressed he is not a member of its
legal staff.
</P>
<P>
   Larabee would not say if Johnson used state computers in the
alleged offense. Simultaneous with his arrest, federal authorities
seized his work computer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. and
released after posting $50,000 bail.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- More women will compete at the Sydney
Games than at any other Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers said about 3,952 women will take part, 38
percent of the total number of athletes. At the 1996 Atlanta Games,
34 percent of the athletes were women.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has supported the increased representation of women in

</P>
<P>
   The Australian Olympic Committee successfully lobbied for sexual

</P>
<P>
   The AOC said Wednesday that planned reductions in the size of
women's indoor volleyball and water polo squads had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 women's squads for indoor volleyball had been cut from 13
to 11 players to accommodate extra beach volleyballers and the late
inclusion of women's water polo. The full quota was restored this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Women's water polo squads had initially been limited to 11
players but would now contain 13, in line with the men's water polo
squads.
</P>
<P>
   The change means an additional 24 female competitors will be
eligible for the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives launch ad barrage against party-swapping congressman  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Long Island voters stopping in at their local
7-Eleven will get an eyeful of a party-swapping congressman Michael
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group that does not have to disclose their donors
has set up 50 electronic billboards on Tuesday at convenience
stores in Forbes' Suffolk County district that show the newly
minted Democrat with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Majority Issues Committee is also sending out
20,000 fliers to Democratic houses on eastern Long Island touting
Forbes votes for impeachment, and school prayer and against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes became a Democrat last summer, accusing GOP House leaders
of being too extreme. Republicans now say Forbes is their top
target for defeat in November. The stakes are high. Democrats must
win only six seats to take back the House in November.
</P>
<P>
   The three-panel anti-Forbes billboards read: ''Who stood with
Newt Gingrich 100 percent? Congressman Mike Forbes stood with Newt
Gingrich 100 percent on the Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   They conclude: ''Call Congressman Mike Forbes and tell him you
are proud he stood by Newt Gingrich his first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was first elected in 1994 as part of the Republican
Revolution when Gingrich took control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that the extremist Republican leaders in the House
will do anything and say anything to keep their desperate hold on
the majority,'' Forbes said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He added the attack against him was distorted, failing to
mention that he opposed Gingrich's cuts to the environment and
child care. And he said the ad blitz by the secretive group points
to the need for legislation to make tax-exempt organizations
disclose their donors.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation has gained momentum lately as spending by the
growing ranks of ''527'' groups - so named because they are created
under Section 527 of the tax code - has proliferated in
presidential and congressional campaigns this year.
</P>
<P>
   A loophole allows the groups to tell the Internal Revenue
Service that they are political organizations, but in the FEC's
eyes they are engaged in issues, not politics. Thus, they do not
have to disclose their donors like parties and political action
committees must.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to close the loophole is expected to come up for a vote
in the House before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Gallant, chairman of the Republican group, said he planned
to target 25 competitive House races this year to get the
conservative message out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Forbes ran as a rock-ribbed Newt Gingrich conservative
and now he's aligned himself with Hillary Clinton,'' Gallant said.
''We're making him choose between his new liberal friends and his
past voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his group was no more secretive than organized
labor, which typically backs Democratic candidates and does not
have to disclose its members.

<HEADLINE> AMA Issues Anti-Bacterial Alert  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Amid mounting concern about the emergence of
antibiotic-resistant germs, the American Medical Association urged
the government Wednesday to step up regulation of anti-bacterial
soaps, lotions and other household products.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted by the AMA's policymaking House of
Delegates stopped short of discouraging the use of such products.
</P>
<P>
   That recommendation was amended after the Cosmetic, Toiletry and
Fragrance Association expressed concern that it would alarm the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted without debate at the annual meeting
of the nation's largest organization of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the CFTA said Wednesday that the AMA is
diverting attention from proven causes of anti-bacterial resistance
and said consumers ''should continue to use anti-bacterial personal
care/cleaning products in the home with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are concerned the anti-microbial products may be
contributing to the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria. When
a product is overused, it hastens the evolutionary process by which
bacteria develop defenses against agents designed to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA noted the development of a range of products such as
soaps, lotions and mouthwash that are advertised as containing
anti-bacterial agents to fight infection.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA said there is no scientific data showing that such
products have any infection-fighting benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The group's action follows a warning Monday from the World
Health Organization about the growth of drug-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the convention:
</P>
<P>
   --Rejected a resolution seeking a moratorium on gene patenting,
referring it to the AMA board of trustees for review.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to support the prescription of syringes for addicted
patients, in conjunction with addiction counseling, to help prevent
the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as AIDs.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission about
the potential risk of eye injury from bungee cords. Doctors
testified about patients being blinded when the cords unexpectedly
recoiled.

<HEADLINE> Kamin transfer criticized by Whitman critics, allies  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Critics can't seem to agree. Was Gov.
Christie Whitman too lenient or too strict in pushing Motor
Vehicles Director Richard Kamin into another high-paying state job
after a probe faulted him for bungling the new auto emissions test?
</P>
<P>
   Some Whitman critics say Kamin is being made a scapegoat, that
higher-ups and the governor herself deserve more blame for last
winter's failed unveiling of the new test.
</P>
<P>
   But others wonder how someone at the center of the $500 million
boondoggle could be retained at such a high salary.
</P>
<P>
   An investigatory panel headed by retired state Supreme Court
Justice Alan Handler last week identified six-year DMV veteran
Kamin as one of a trio of state officials who ignored or squelched
warnings that Parsons Infrastructure and Technology was unable to
deliver New Jersey's enhanced auto emissions test on time and as
promised.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser extent, the Handler report also criticized
Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein, Environmental
Commissioner Robert Shinn and the governor's office for failing to
more closely monitor the project.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was awarded the contract to design and construct a test
to more accurately measure tailpipe pollution to bring New Jersey
in line with federal clean air rules. But the new test has been
plagued by breakdowns and other problems since its start last
December, leading to long lines and frustrated motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman responded to the Handler report by offering Kamin a
lateral salary move from the DMV to the DOT's Office of Customer
Advocacy and Administration.
</P>
<P>
   For the same salary of $97,650, he will oversee 100 people and a
$4.8 million office budget. His new responsibilities include
department personnel, community relations, correspondences, ethics
and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Kamin, whom the Handler report concluded was ''curiously
disengaged'' during the Parsons affair, has declined comment on the
report and his new post.
</P>
<P>
   Kamin served in the state Assembly prior to his appointment as
DMV director in 1994. At least two other former lawmakers have
worked in the same DOT office that Kamin will now head, leading
some critics to wonder whether it has become a patronage dumping
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kamin replaces former office director Joseph Bubba, a former
state senator who landed the job after posting a key vote in favor
of Whitman's 1997 controversial pension bond sale. Former Sen. Jack
Casey, a Burlington County Democrat, was hired amid complaints in
local political circles that he sold out to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Anthony Impreveduto, D-Hudson, a frequent
Whitman critic on auto emissions, said Kamin didn't deserve to be
singled out for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there bungling on the whole Parsons project? Yes. Was Dick
part of it? Yes. Was he the sole person? No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that Kamin was so intimidated by pressure from the
governor's office that he failed to do what was best for the
motoring public and the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least she's showing some kind of compassion giving him
something, instead of firing him and leaving him out for the
wolves,'' Impreveduto said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Schluter, R-Mercer, one of the Legislature's
experts on ethics and government patronage, said he too was
troubled by the governor's decision to transfer Kamin.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was obviously singled out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jack Conners, D-Camden, who has criticized the
Whitman Administration's transportation policies in the past, said
Kamin deserved a demotion or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Conners found fault with Kamin's new destination, the office of
customer advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of looks like the old elephant burial ground,'' he
said. ''It's the place to put people when they don't do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough and Weinstein bristled at the
Democratic charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the governor is doing exactly the appropriate
thing,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear there were mistakes made in the project,'' said
Weinstein. ''But to say he should be executed, I think is a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said Kamin is just the sort of person he wanted to
replace Bubba, a former lawmaker with the networking and
communication skills to ease tension in local communities over
state transportation projects.

<HEADLINE> Parents urged to help enforce new law regulating pesticide use at schools </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and
environmental advocates on Wednesday urged parents to help enforce
a new state law regulating the use of pesticides at schools and
daycare centers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, which takes effect July 1, local or regional
school boards are required to notify parents or guardians before
pesticides are applied at schools. At the start of the school year,
school officials must provide parents and staff with a written
statement of the board's policy on pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until this new law, parents often knew more about pesticides
applied to lawns next door than they did about pesticides applied
at schools,'' said Blumenthal. ''I think this law offers some real
opportunity for public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires schools to use licensed workers to apply
pesticides and keep records of pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and officials from Environment and Human Health Inc.
want parents to learn about the law and notify the state if any
school fails to comply. There is no set penalty, but Blumenthal
said the state will take violators to court seeking an order to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by EHHI found that one-third of 77 Connecticut
school districts were routinely spraying pesticides even though
there was no known pest problem. The nonprofit organization
comprised of Connecticut doctors, public health and public policy
experts, sent surveys to 149 school districts- 77 of which
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Alderman, president of EHHI, cited Cheshire as a community
that already follows the guidelines spelled out in the law. The
town school department pays a pesticide specialist to visit the
schools every month to determine if there is a problem, rather than
spray for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the survey respondents said they only used
professional pest control operators, 12 percent said they used only
school personnel to spray, and 23 percent said they used both.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that most districts using professional pest
control operators spray more often than schools whose own personnel
do the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   EHHI also found that three school districts were still using
Dursban, which has become the center of a national debate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the federal government and manufacturers agreed to
phase out the pesticide chlorpyrifos - commonly sold under the
trade names Dursban and Lorsban- because of the concern that it
poses health risks to children in homes, schools and parks. The
product may remain on store shelves until the end of 2001, a
decision which prompted complaints from some health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Children are particularly sensitive to pesticides for a variety
of biological and behavioral reasons, said John Wargo, a Yale
professor who specializes in children's exposure to toxic
substances.
</P>
<P>
   EHHI was unable to track the number of children who may have
been sickened by pesticide use at schools. Symptoms of pesticide
poisoning are similar to those of flu, food poisoning or intestinal
problems, said Wargo, a member of the EHHI board. Pesticide
poisoning cannot be detected using standard blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who supported the measure said it is necessary to make
sure pesticides are applied properly and with the least exposure to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important step,'' said Wargo.

<HEADLINE> Woman pleads guilty to manslaughter in death of elderly 'husband'  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Nevada woman who admits that she killed her
elderly husband with prescription drugs here 6{ years ago while
stealing his money pleaded guilty Wednesday to second-degree
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia S. Mitchell, 35, admitted in Manhattan's State Supreme
Court that she ''recklessly and repeatedly'' fed Valium, Tylenol
with codeine, and other drugs to 85-year-old Andrew G. Vlasto while
she emptied his bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, brought to justice because of Vlasto's persistent
relatives, will be sentenced by Justice Bonnie Wittner on July 6 to
five to 15 years in prison, the maximum penalty for the top count
in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell married Vlasto, a Greek immigrant, in August 1993
although she has three children with a man she lived with in Las
Vegas for years, prosecutors said. She was arrested there in April
1999 in Vlasto's death.
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell was arraigned here last year on manslaughter and
larceny charges, Assistant District Attorney Youmin Kim said the
''voodoo'' ceremony in which she and Vlasto were married with no
witnesses was an illegal sham.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Daniel Castleman said Mitchell was
not charged with murder because ''we don't believe she intended to
kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She hadn't finished cleaning him out,'' Castleman said. ''He
had property in Greece that she wanted. She just wanted to keep him
malleable, as she admitted in court, but she overdid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, plying Vlasto with drugs to make it easy for her to
take his money, apparently gave him an overdose in Atlantic City in
October 1993. She took him to Thomas Jefferson Hospital in
Philadelphia where he was detoxified and she was warned by doctors
that the drugs were dangerous for Vlasto.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later in New York, Mitchell took Vlasto to Bellevue
Hospital Center where he was again diagnosed with having an
overdose of drugs in his system. Vlasto died on Nov. 10, 1993, in
Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy, performed over Mitchell's objections, showed that
Vlasto died of pneumonia and sepsis, ''complicated by an overdose''
of several prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say Mitchell got prescriptions for the drugs from a
doctor she knew and gave them to Vlasto. The doctor, Lewin Moseley,
died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's former lawyer, Barry Fallick, said after her
arraignment that she was a fortune teller in Manhattan when she met
Vlasto. Fallick had said that Vlasto had hired her to work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had already stolen $80,000 from Vlasto's bank accounts
in the first month of their marriage, prosecutors said, and
quick-acting relatives saved the rest of his $500,000 estate.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about Mitchell arose after a friend of Vlasto's
nephew, James, sent him a San Francisco Examiner story last June
about five men, aged 87 to 96, who were ''slowly poisoned to
death'' between 1983 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   James Vlasto turned the clippings over to the district
attorney's office and the investigation began. Castleman credited
Vlasto with doing much of the ground work, such as poring over bank
records, telephone records, hospital files and prescription forms,
that got the investigation moving.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasto said Mitchell's plea and promised sentence ''means
closure for our family. My uncle died in a horrible way but justice
finally has been done.''

<HEADLINE> House Republicans moving ahead with Medicare drug proposal  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - House Republicans are pushing forward with
plans for legislation meant to make it easier and cheaper for the
elderly to get prescription drugs, trying to get ahead of President
Clinton on what is bound to be a major election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a fundamental difference'' with Democrats, said Rep.
Richard Burr, R-N.C. at a House Commerce subcommittee hearing
Wednesday. ''It is the argument about whether the government
controls this new benefit or whether we use the competition of the
private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have said committee action on GOP
legislation could come as early as next week. While they have
highlighted Democratic endorsements - from Reps. Ralph Hall,
D-Texas, and Collin Peterson, D-Minn. - most congressional
Democrats and President Clinton are critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just political cover and empty promises,'' said Rep.
Frank Pallone, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers were joining Clinton at the White House on
Wednesday to speak out against the GOP initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers raised concerns that their
party is moving too quickly, with too few details worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a tragedy to put a bill on the floor that most
members don't understand what the implications will be,'' said Rep.
Greg Ganske, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry itself seems skeptical about the
feasibility of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence suggests that it would be extremely difficult to
ensure the universal availability of drug coverage to seniors
through this type of proposal,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America, in testimony prepared for
Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the plan's chief
architect, provided details about a bill Republicans are developing
that would enlist private insurers to sell government-subsidized
and approved prescription drug insurance policies to Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the private sector can do a great job,'' Thomas
said, but ''the government will be there if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused Democrats and Clinton of
misrepresenting their plan for political gain. The administration
came out with its own proposal more than a year ago. Polls since
have shown that adding drug coverage, which was omitted from the
original Medicare program created in 1965, has strong public
support.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the GOP plan would have several provisions designed
to ensure that help with drug costs would be available to all older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the government would pay insurers 30 percent to
35 percent subsidies to ensure that new drug policies are
affordable to all, not just retirees with the lowest incomes, whose
drug insurance premiums would be paid for directly by Medicare
under both the GOP and Clinton plans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also said the government would act as the ''insurer of
last resort'' if private plans failed to offer adequate coverage
options everywhere across the country. Details of that fallback
coverage are still being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, out-of-pocket costs would vary
depending on which private plan the patient chose, although all
policies would have to provide minimum benefits and additional
protection from very high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration, Thomas estimated that with the help of
government subsidies, an insurance company could offer a drug
policy with monthly premiums of $35 to $40, a $200 to $250 annual
deductible, 50-percent copays and catastrophic protection covering
out-of-pocket charges after $5,000 to $6,000 in annual spending.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton proposes a standard drug benefit under
Medicare. Those who opted for the coverage would pay a monthly
premium starting at $26, no deductible and a 50 percent co-payment
toward prescriptions. The maximum annual government reimbursement
would be $1,000 at first, eventually rising to $2,500. The premium
too would rise, to a maximum $50.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have proposed including catastrophic coverage like the
Republicans' plan, but it is unclear how much that would increase
retirees' premiums or costs to the government under Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both sides estimate government costs of the new benefit
at around $40 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Schmidt Out Until August  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Schmidt, the Pittsburgh Pirates' opening
day starter, won't need surgery on his aching right shoulder but
probably won't pitch again in the majors until August.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was diagnosed with inflamed tissue in his right rotator
cuff during an examination on Wednesday in Birmingham, Ala., by Dr.
James Andrews, who specializes in reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rotator cuff injuries are among the worst a pitcher can have
and, if they require surgery, often require an extended
rehabilitation period.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tissue in there has to be quieted down,'' Pirates general
manager Cam Bonifay said. ''But it is not a surgical case right
now. There was no tear, nothing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he consulted with Andrews, who has operated on
numerous athletes, because, ''I want to know once and for all
what's wrong in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's injury is a setback to a Pirates' starting staff that
hasn't pitched nearly as well as projected. Expected to be the
team's strength coming out of spring training, Pirates starters are
averaging less than six innings per start and are 15-22 with a 4.77
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is 2-5 with a 5.40 ERA after going 13-11 last season.
</P>
<P>
   With Schmidt hurting, the Pirates recalled right-handed rookie
Bronson Arroyo, who allowed five runs in five innings in his first
major league start, a come-from-behind 7-6 victory over the Atlanta
Braves on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 27-year-old Schmidt's second trip to the disabled
list this season. He spent two weeks on the DL in late April with
soreness in his shoulder, a condition that began during spring
training and his lingered since.
</P>
<P>
   Bonifay said Schmidt won't be ready to pitch again for 4-6
weeks, or until after the All-Star break. Even when he is ready, he
will probably need several minor league rehabilitation starts
before he can rejoin the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first two or three weeks, he won't be throwing,'' Bonifay
said. ''He'll be building it up and letting the inflammation clear
out. Then he'll start a slow-throwing process to build himself up
and then he'll pitch off a mound. The total time is six to eight
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt will be on a strict pitch count once he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo is expected to stay in the rotation, although Bonifay
said it is possible another move will be made now that the Pirates
know Schmidt will be out for an extended period.

Vivendi Restarts Seagram Talks
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Take Seagram Co., the Montreal-based
entertainment and liquor giant. Add France's Vivendi, the water
company. Stir gently. For $30 billion US and up, take a sip.
</P>
<P>
   The long-rumored possibility of Seagram getting swallowed up in
a large-scale corporate takeover returned Wednesday on word of
talks with Vivendi and Canal Plus, Vivendi's pay TV unit.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram and Paris-based Vivendi confirmed they're having talks
but there was no sign of a mixture that might be brought to the
table quickly and no one knew the exact size of the bar tab.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers' published estimates of the deal's value ranged from
between $30 billion US to $32.7 billion -- about $70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram said it's in discussions ''to create a three-way
strategic business combination'' after being approached by Vivendi
and Canal Plus. ''The discussions involve an exchange of Seagram
shares for the stock of the combined entity,'' a Seagram statement
said.

Alliance MPs To Join Pension Plan
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian Alliance MPs who once denounced the
parliamentary pension plan as a gold-plated abomination are about
to join it -- some willingly, others grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation sponsored by the Liberal government, but
fast-tracked through the Commons with the tacit approval of
Alliance strategists, all 301 MPs will soon be members of the
contentious plan.
</P>
<P>
   That includes more than 30 Alliance members, elected as
Reformers in 1993, who until now had made a political point of
staying out.
</P>
<P>
   They would normally have to start from scratch and serve another
six years in the House before becoming eligible for retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a special provision of the bill allows them to fork over
about $50,000 in retroactive premiums to cover the seven years they
have already spent in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   That would make them fully-paid members right away, entitled to
minimum benefits of $19,000 a year once they are out of politics
and reach age 55.

Report: Gender Barriers Exist at Top Executive Level

ceiling they're still picking shards of glass out of their scalps,
suggests a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a woman may hold a top management position doesn't
mean that all barriers are instantly removed for the female CEO and
other women in a company, says a study by the Conference Board of
Canada, a non-profit research organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is based on a survey of more than 600
executives and 94 in-depth interviews, suggests the number of women
in senior management in the private sector is half that of the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising, says the report's author Barbara Orser,
are different views on how men and women believe others perceive
them as executives.
</P>
<P>
   Half the women surveyed by the board felt women managers are
perceived as being less professional and not as committed to a
corporation as their male counterparts, while three-quarters of
male CEOs disagreed with that view.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Pledge To Talk Reunification  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In the biggest step toward peace since
the end of the Korean War, the leaders of North and South Korea
signed an agreement Wednesday pledging to work for reconciliation
and eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also agreed to allow reunions of families that
have been separated for 50 years by the closed and heavily armed
border, to hold another summit meeting and to promote South Korean
investment that is desperately needed in the North's failing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry about anything. Have a good night's sleep and a
safe trip home tomorrow,'' North Korean leader Kim Jong Il said to
his counterpart, President Kim Dae-jung, after the two signed the
accord following hours of talks in Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agreement did not deal with two major strategic
concerns: the North's demand that the United States withdraw its
37,000 troops from South Korea, and the North's nuclear and
long-range missile programs that have led Washington to label it as
a dangerous ''rogue'' state.
</P>
<P>
   The United State wants to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty it signed with Moscow and develop a missile defense system
to deal with the threat from countries like North Korea, a proposal
Russia has warned would lead to a new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification itself is an enormous task that some observers say
could take decades, even if both countries honor the accord.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Clinton administration praised the
agreement, saying it hopes the two Koreas can uphold it and benefit
from it. ''It's certainly our hope that they can find some way to
build on the success of the last two days,'' said White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hong Koo, South Korea's ambassador to Washington, said
American troops in South Korea will remain there for the indefinite
future. Asked in an interview whether the summit will lead to a
U.S. troop withdrawal, Lee said, ''That's a long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement signed in Pyongyang is more detailed than similar
ones that were reached by lower-ranking officials in 1972 and 1991.
Those deals, which also called for reconciliation and
reunification, quickly gave way to renewed hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans were surprised by the warmth and openness
displayed by the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, the reclusive leader
who rules by decree and who has been widely condemned for human
rights abuses in his country.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he warmly met his counterpart, South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, at the airport in Pyongyang on Tuesday, the
North Korean leader seemed prepared to reach out to the West and
its successful, free-market economies.
</P>
<P>
   After the late-night signing, the two leaders smiled broadly,
shook each others' hands vigorously and toasted each other with
glasses of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung praised Kim Jong Il for helping him reach a
''historic agreement'' and said the two must ''proceed together on
a path of reconciliation and cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, many South Koreans also welcomed the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never thought seriously about reunification with North
Korea. For me, that has always been an abstract and remote issue.
Now it suddenly looms as a very realistic dream,'' said 27-year-old
Paek Hong-ki.
</P>
<P>
   But others were cautious about whether North Korea would comply
with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreements look very superficial,'' said Kim Sun-ja, 47.
''We will have to wait and see if this reunion of separated
families actually takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit was covered by about 50 South Korean reporters who
traveled to Pyongyang and were filing print and television pool
reports to the hundreds of foreign reporters who had to remain
behind in Seoul, 120 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement said the cross-border visits would occur this
summer and involve an unspecified number of the tens of thousands
of families that have lived on opposite sides of the Demilitarized
Zone for decades. The last such exchange occurred in 1985 and
involved only 50 people from each side.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea also agreed to repatriate an unspecified number of
convicted North Korean spies who have completed their jail terms in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   The accord said the next inter-Korean summit would be held in
Seoul, the South Korean capital, but no date was set. Such a visit
would indicate Kim Jong Il's sincerity in pursuing reconciliation
because it would expose him to the kind of press coverage and
potential protests that he never faces at home.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders' three-hour meeting began in Pyongyang on
Wednesday, Kim Jong Il surprised the world by starting it with
lighthearted comments.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his gray Mao-style jacket and sitting opposite Kim
Dae-jung at a conference table, Kim Jong Il praised his counterpart
for making the brave decision to travel to North Korea for the
first time ever on Tuesday for the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   In talks that Kim Dae-jung held earlier Wednesday with other top
North Korean officials, they discussed opening highway and railway
lines across the two countries' border for the first time in more
than 50 years, holding a second summit in Seoul, and creating a
''hot line'' telephone service for discussions during crises. But
no agreements were reported on this.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula's rail and road lines were closed around 1948,
when the two Koreas formed their own governments and sealed their
border. The 1950-53 Korean War ended in a draw -- no peace treaty
was even signed -- and troops remain massed on both sides of the
Demilitarized Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung was scheduled to fly home late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> New York talc firm wonders about asbestos impact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALMAT, N.Y. (AP) - A north country producer of talc products
hopes a decision by the nation's top three crayon manufacturers to
eliminate the ingredient after it was linked to asbestos doesn't
affect other corners of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to tell because you don't know how this thing is
going to go,'' said John W. Kelse, manager of the corporate risk
management department for R.T. Vanderbilt, the Norwalk, Conn.-based
company that owns Gouverneur Talc Co.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1.3 percent of the talc produced by the company at Balmat,
Vanderbilt's largest mining and minerals processing plant, is used
in crayons. The company's fear is that other manufacturers will
eliminate talc from their products because of concerns it is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission found small amounts of
asbestos or asbestos-like fibers when it tested crayons and
recommended crayon manufacturers come up with a substitute for the
talc. Talc is used to fortify crayons.
</P>
<P>
   Talc is also used in some chalk and modeling clay, and CPSC
Chairwoman Ann Brown said this week the agency will review the
composition of those products to see if they should also be
reformulated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope not, but you never know,'' Kelse said.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos has been found to cause cancer and a wide variety of
lung diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Balmat is 32 miles northeast of Watertown.

<HEADLINE> Moynihan receives waiver to accept hefty gift  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan accepted
a $250,000 cash award from the Heinz Family Foundation, financial
disclosure forms released Wednesday show.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan received a waiver from the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee
so he could accept the gift. Senate rules limit most gifts to $50.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, the New York Democrat was awarded the Heinz
Foundation's ''Touchstone Award'' in Public Policy, the first
elected official to receive the honor.
</P>
<P>
   In making its finding that Moynihan could keep the cash, the
committee said that ''neither the Heinz Family or the Heinz Family
Foundation has a direct interest in or takes positions on
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 15, 1999, Ethics Committee letter noted that the
foundation was nonprofit and nonpartisan and has not ''targeted''
elected officials to receive the award.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Moynihan was signed by Sens. Bob Smith, R-N.H.,
and Harry Reid, D-Nev., chairman and vice-chairman of the Ethics
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Touchstone awards were established in 1992 in the memory of
Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz, a Republican. His widow, Teresa, is
now married to Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee
and is completing his fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   His office did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the committee, Heinz Foundation officials said
Moynihan had been selected ''because he is the epitome of the
scholar statesman, an exemplar of the renaissance man who ... has
played a decisive role in determining how this country has and will
react to so many of the vexing social issues that have confronted
it over the last half century.''
</P>
<P>
   Past recipients of the public policy award include former
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his $136,700 Senate salary, Moynihan also took in
$1,019 in royalties from some of the 18 books he has authored.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer reported a salary of $140,686 - $129,143
from the Senate and $11,543 from his final days in the House in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among his unearned income, Schumer listed a thrift savings plan
valued at between $50,001 and $100,000 that brought him between
$2,501 and $5,000 in interest. Schumer also has a New York City
deferred compensation trust valued at between $100,001 and
$250,000. He earned between $5,001 and $10,000 on that trust.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer reported one liability - a mortgage on his home in
Brooklyn of between $50,001 and $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Gets Sentence Shortened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A court this week slashed from 30 years
to five the sentence of a Colombian man who admitted fatally
shooting a U.S. drug agent in a Bogota discotheque.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Figueroa, 25, already has served 19 months for the
November 1998 killings of the Drug Enforcement Agency worker and
another man. Counting good behavior and days worked in prison,
Figueroa could walk free in less than one year, his lawyer, Jaime
Rodriguez, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning a lower court, the Superior Court of Bogota ruled
that Figueroa was acting in legitimate self-defense when he pulled
out a 9 mm pistol and shot Frank Moreno, a 37-year-old DEA agent,
after a scuffle. But Figueroa used excessive force in defending
himself, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the DEA, which had hailed
the original 30-year sentence handed down in January as a sign that
justice works in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, the son of a wealthy Bogota family that owns a chain
of leather stores, turned himself in a week after the crime and
admitted to shooting Moreno after the two fought in the nightclub.
A 20-year-old bystander who caught a stray bullet in the neck also
died in the melee. Figueroa was convicted in both killings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, of Edinburgh, Texas, had recently married and had been
in Colombia about a year when he was killed. The DEA contends the
argument in the nightclub had nothing to do with Moreno's job
duties.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Huge Social Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted narrow approval Wednesday for
the biggest and most hotly contested spending bill of the year, a
$339.4 billion measure for education, health and labor programs
that left each party claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a veto threat by President Clinton, Republicans rammed
the huge fiscal 2001 measure through the House by a near party-line
217-214 vote. It was the first time since 1997 that the full House
had approved the always controversial bill, and it came only after
days of lobbying by GOP leaders on their rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill would boost spending for the Education
Department and many other programs above this year's levels, it
assures an election-year clash with the White House because it
would cut many Clinton proposals.
</P>
<P>
   It ignores his plans for hiring teachers and rebuilding
crumbling schools and cuts the president's proposals for child care
and job training for teen-agers. It would also block his effort to
complete federal rules aimed at preventing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be some responsibility in these things,'' Rep.
J.C. Watts, the No. 4 House GOP leader, said after the vote. ''You
can't just add 20, 30 percent to these bills as they would do ...
and not worry about how you pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Clinton renewed his promise to veto the
bill, which contains nearly $9 billion less than he wants. The
Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a version of the
measure that is $4 billion higher than the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''A bill that fails to provide key resources for education,
child care, worker training and other priorities is unacceptable,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The fist-pumping and applause from members of both parties after
the bill's passage underlined the vote's political stakes.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders want to quickly finish Congress' 13 annual spending
bills to allow more time for re-election campaigns. They could have
ill-afforded an embarrassing defeat of the bill that provides
federal aid for schools.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that because of the bill's cuts in Clinton
proposals, they will use the vote against Republicans from marginal
districts who supported the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the linchpin to our taking the House back'' in the
November elections, said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who oversees
House Democrats' campaign efforts. ''In my view it sets up every
debate we have with Republicans over where our priorities should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of three the House worked on Wednesday that
face Clinton veto threats.
</P>
<P>
   The House also debated a $14.6 billion measure financing the
Interior Department and federal cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto that measure because it
would slash Clinton's plans for acquiring federal and state
parkland and bar the government from managing the eight new
national monuments that Clinton has designated this year.
</P>
<P>
   By 214-211, the House voted to cut about half the budget --
nearly $127 million -- of a Clinton program that subsidizes fuel
efficiency research by auto companies and others. The vote pitted
the White House and auto industry against fiscal conservatives and
environmental groups, who argued that the program focuses too much
on polluting diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee used a
voice vote to approve a third bill facing a veto threat, a $35.5
billion measure for the Commerce, Justice and State departments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's objections to that bill include its failure to provide
$150 million he requested to help state and local communities hire
1,000 prosecutors to handle cases involving gun-related crimes. The
committee rejected, 31-18, a Democratic effort to include the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bill ''absolutely guts our administration's
proposal for the largest gun enforcement initiative in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill did provide Clinton's full $14.5
million request for hiring more U.S. attorneys and had millions of
dollars in other programs that can be used to combat gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunately a political spin that's coming out of the
White House,'' said Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., the bill's chief
author.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lost a parade of near party-line votes aimed at
changing other items Clinton objects to. They included:
</P>
<P>
   --A provision that would make it harder for the Justice
Department to pursue the government's multibillion-dollar lawsuit
against the tobacco industry by blocking it from accepting money
from other agencies to help pay for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   --A $241 million cut in the $739 million Clinton requested for
U.S. payments for international peacekeeping operations. Included
was a requirement for lawmakers' approval for peacekeeping efforts
in Sierra Leone and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   --A $199 million reduction in the $340 million Clinton wants for
the Legal Services Corp., which provides legal help for the poor.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii OK's Marijuana as Medicine  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's governor signed a bill Wednesday
approving the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii became the first state to decriminalize the use of
medical marijuana through the Legislature. Alaska, Washington,
California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Maine and the District of
Columbia have done so through ballot measures.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ben Cayetano said the new law was one aspect of his effort
to make Hawaii the health care center of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to see this bill before me,'' he said. ''My own
feeling is more states are going to come on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is against federal law for doctors to prescribe the drug, and
the Justice Department is challenging the state laws that let
doctors recommend marijuana to patients suffering from cancer,
glaucoma and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hawaii's law, patients with certain qualifying illnesses
must obtain a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana and must
register with the state Department of Public Safety to avoid
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The department first must come up with rules to govern the
registration process, and Donald Topping of the advocacy group Drug
Policy Forum estimated that could take up to two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will allow patients who have been using marijuana to do so
without fear or prosecution,'' Topping said. ''There are a number
of people who would like to use it but have hesitated because of
the illegality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 500 and 1,000 people in Hawaii will be eligible to use
medical marijuana, although the exact number is hard to discern
because some people keep quiet about their use, Topping said.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Bars Gore at Church Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic bishop barred Al Gore from
campaigning at a church hospital Wednesday, forcing the Democratic
presidential contender to shuffle his schedule and talk up his
health care plans at another site.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off the snub, which the bishop linked to Gore's
abortion-rights stance, the vice president visited a
nondenominational facility and promised more money for health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered quick help for elderly Americans who need
prescription drug coverage and accused pharmaceutical companies of
having ''too much power'' over drug stores and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Pennsylvania's coal country, the second stop on
his three-week ''progress and prosperity tour,'' offered an abrupt
reminder that courting Catholic voters can be a delicate task.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the vice president arrived here Tuesday night,
Bishop James C. Timlin sent word that Gore was no longer invited to
Mercy Hospital in Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mercy Hospital has decided not to give Vice President Gore
a platform, lest there be any misunderstanding about the hospital's
Catholic identity and its commitment to the sanctity of life,''
Timlin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore shifted the health care forum to the corporate offices of a
health care company, Allied Services.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate acted as if the snub had never happened, telling
the crowd at his backup site, ''It was not an accident that I chose
this place for the second of my series of speeches'' on the
economy. Several members of the audience carried local newspapers
with a headline reading, ''No Mercy for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a positive link between Gore and the church, aides
gave Monsignor Andrew McGowan a prominent seat at the address.
Positioned behind Gore, the Catholic leader was visible for TV and
newspaper photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic voters are being pursued by both Gore and Republican
rival George W. Bush. They make up a huge voting bloc in the
Midwest, where the race likely will be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was criticized in the GOP primary for visiting an
anti-Catholic university in South Carolina, and has shared the
stage with dozens of priests ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics are not single-issue voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Catholic voters have historically supported pro-choice
candidates if they're right on every other issue,'' said pollster
Ed Sarpolus of Michigan, another battleground state loaded with
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his abortion-rights stance, President Clinton won the
Catholic vote in 1992 and 1996. About 40 percent of anti-abortion
Catholics voted for Clinton in 1996, Sarpolus said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Catholic on Bush's list of
potential vice presidential candidates, supports abortion rights
and has butted heads with Catholic leaders, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Pennsylvania started with a minor slip Tuesday
night. He praised local Democratic legislative candidate Jim
Wansacz, but called him ''John.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the rally had all the trapping of a fall campaign stop:
Air Force Two was lit to a glow by portable lighting, a
picture-perfect backdrop for an enthusiastic crowd of local
Democrats. Two of three local television stations carried the
arrival live.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to generate similar coverage throughout the
three-week campaign designed to claim some credit for the nation's
roaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a Harrisburg, Pa., TV station about Clinton's role in
the campaign, Gore said, ''He's been the architect of the policies
that have ... made the difference in the recent prosperity. As for
the campaign, I'm campaigning on my own, on my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus Wednesday was on health care, and he will promote
targeted tax cuts Thursday in Ohio before taking a four-day weekend
off.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, he helped raise $1 million for the Democratic
National Committee at a pair of New York fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, he reiterated his pledge to protect Medicare
surpluses, expand children's health insurance programs and add a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He promised the drug plan by 2002, moving his deadline up by
four years. Gore also pledged to increase funding to health care
providers, such as nursing homes, whose federal payments were
lowered in the 1997 budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore toured a family-owned drug store and questioned
why drug companies sometimes charge veterinarians less than
pharmacists for the same drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tells me the pharmaceutical companies have too much power
over the pharmacies and customers,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   DNC TV ads now running in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other swing
states highlight Gore's position on making prescription drugs
available to seniors. The DNC plans to switch to another topic, yet
to be determined, this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, and Ohio, with 27, are
crucial for both major party presidential campaigns. Polls show
Bush with a slight lead in Ohio; the race is tighter still in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, visiting Washington while Gore was in his home state,
said the vice president doesn't deserve credit for the economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recovery has everything to do with our entrepreneurs, work
force and business and community leaders and has very little to do
with people on Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Ridge said in a speech to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> One alleged pusher found unfit, the other ordered to undergo exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An apparently homeless man who was indicted for
allegedly trying to push two people in front of oncoming subway
trains was reported psychologically unfit to stand trial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two court-appointed psychiatrists reported to Justice Brenda
Soloff in Manhattan's State Supreme Court that Paul O'Dwyer, 47, is
not fit to stand trial on charges of attempted murder, reckless
endangerment and assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office has until June 28 to
notify the court whether it intends to contest the finding that
O'Dwyer is unfit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer was arrested May 22 at the Broadway-Lafayette subway
station near Houston Street in Lower Manhattan after at least two
people told police he tried to push them onto the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justice Herbert Adlerberg ordered a mental
examination of Julio DeJesus, 36, of the Bronx, who was arrested
June 4 after he allegedly tried to throw Elizabeth Perez, 24, onto
the tracks in the subway station at 110th Street and Central Park
West. Perez was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   An onlooker, Rene Nunez, 26, captured DeJesus and held him for
police after he started dragging Perez toward the platform's edge.
DeJesus was charged with attempted murder, attempted assault and
reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Adlerberg said he wanted DeJesus' psychiatric exam results by
July 17.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Struggles To Get Power Back  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Crews struggled Wednesday for the second day in
steamy heat to restore power to Detroit city buildings, schools,
police stations and jails after the century-old municipal power
system failed.
</P>
<P>
   The outage, which began Tuesday afternoon, trapped people in
elevators and on elevated trains and turned some intersections into
traffic free-for-alls at rush hour. School ended early, city
workers went home, court hearings adjourned unexpectedly and
inmates were put on lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no crime or traffic accidents related to the
outage during the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt pretty lucky that no one was hurt,'' said Gregory
Bowens, a spokesman for Mayor Dennis Archer.
</P>
<P>
   The 911 emergency system in the city of 1 million was not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Bowens said he could not predict when electricity would be fully
restored to the 4,500 buildings, 87,000 street lights and 1,250
traffic signals powered by the city Public Lighting Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is, the backup to the backup failed and that never
happened before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residential and business customers supplied by Detroit Edison in
the nation's 10th-largest city did not lose power.
</P>
<P>
   As of 7 p.m. Wednesday, electricity had been restored to 72
percent of the agency's 1,400 ''customers'' -- ranging from single
entities like the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building to those
with multiple locations, such as the Detroit Public Schools and 250
of its 263 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've heard some grumbling in the hallways from other
employees. One of them said the temperature in his office was 89
degrees. And they've turned off the down escalator,'' assistant
city ombudsman Stina Santiestevan said.
</P>
<P>
   With a high of 88 degrees Wednesday, Santiestevan didn't say how
hot her office was. ''I'm not sure we want to know,'' she said.
''But it was my luck, I had to wear a suit today to the City
Council meeting. I told them, 'Watch out -- I may show up tomorrow
in shorts and a halter top.'''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit City Airport's tower operated with emergency receivers,
but passengers had to be searched with hand-held metal detectors
instead of the walk-through kind.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs on one of three lines that connect the Public Lighting
Department to Detroit Edison were under way when a second failed
Tuesday, the mayor said. The remaining line could not handle the
load, and the city's entire generating system shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Edison said it warned the city to scale back power usage
Monday after the first line failed. ''They were in the process of
doing that, but it didn't happen quick enough,'' spokesman Scott
Simons said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the electricity used in the outage's early stages came
from generators the city had bought as a hedge against the Y2K
computer bug, which caused far fewer problems than feared.
</P>
<P>
   ''Y2K turned out to be this big nothing,'' Bowens said. ''But
the one and a half million dollars the city spent on generators
turned out to be money well spent.''

<HEADLINE> Request for Skakel juvenile records creates fuss  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A prosecutor's attempt to find out if the
Kennedy cousin accused in the 1975 murder of Greenwich teen-ager
Martha Moxley had a juvenile record led to a court appearance
Wednesday to clear up a potential conflict of interest question.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel was charged in January in Moxley's murder, nearly
25 years after she was found bludgeoned and stabbed to death with a
golf club on her family's Greenwich estate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Skakel, now 39, was 15 at the time of the crime, his
case is being handled in juvenile court, at least initially. Skakel
is the son of Rushton Skakel, brother of Ethel Kennedy, the widow
of U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled to begin next week to decide if there is
enough evidence to hold Skakel over for trial and whether the case
will be transferred to adult court.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors prepared for that hearing, they sought any
juvenile court records pertaining to Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Their request for information went to Joanne Goldberg, a
juvenile prosecutor in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldberg is married to Marshall Goldberg, a law partner of
Emanuel Margolis, a Stamford attorney who represents Michael
Skakel's brother, Thomas, who was a longtime suspect in Moxley's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Goldberg told prosecutors she could not participate in
the Michael Skakel prosecution because her husband's professional
relationship with Margolis could have created a conflict of
interest. Goldberg then passed the request to Michael Panza, an
investigator in the Stamford juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   In Court Wednesday, Michael Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman,
told Judge Maureen Dennis he did not want to have a full hearing on
the matter and later said he had ''complete faith'' in Goldberg's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But outside court, he said he was concerned about what he called
the prosecution's ''stampede to uncover negative information about
Michael Skakel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned about some manner of unbridled prosecutorial
efforts to convict Michael Skakel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said no juvenile records were found because Skakel was
never arrested as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has never had a juvenile record - never did,'' Sherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile records are routinely checked by both prosecutors and
defense attorneys in all cases as part of trial preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was absolutely no impropriety here,'' said Hillary
Bargar, the juvenile prosecutor who requested the records.

Largest Crackdown Made on Securities Fraud
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 100 reputed mobsters, stock promoters and
executives of Internet start-ups were accused today of strong-arming brokers and
manipulating penny stocks in the country's largest crackdown yet on securities
fraud. Sixteen indictments and seven criminal complaints unsealed in federal
court show how just how deep organized crime has dug its nails into the stock
market of the Internet era, said Richard Walker, director of enforcement of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In the biggest step toward peace since the end of
the Korean War, the leaders of North and South Korea signed an agreement
Wednesday pledging to work for reconciliation and eventual reunification. The
two leaders also agreed to allow reunions of families that have been separated
for 50 years by the closed and heavily armed border, to hold another summit
meeting and to promote South Korean investment that is desperately needed in the
North's failing economy.

Southern Baptists Say 'No' to Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Risking a wider split in the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention declared today that
women should no longer serve as pastors. The statement of faith is not binding
on congregations, and so the effect on the Southern Baptists' 1,600 or so
clergywomen -- about 100 of whom are pastors leading congregations -- is
unclear. But some members warned that congregations will quit the 15.9
million-member denomination over this, just as some did when the Southern
Baptists declared two years ago that wives should ''submit graciously'' to their
husbands.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A retired Army Reserve colonel was arrested today,
accused of spying for the Soviet Union during a 25-year Cold War conspiracy
while he worked in Germany. The U.S. Attorney's Office identified him as George
Trofimoff. Prosecutors called him the highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever
charged with espionage. They said he conspired to sell classified military
intelligence information to the Soviets when he was a civilian employee of the

Rwanda Won't Withdraw From Congo

   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda blasted U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Wednesday for recommending sanctions if the central African nation if it does
not withdraw its troops from Congo, saying such a resolution would end Congo's
fragile peace process. ''We are not going to leave ... until our security is
guaranteed, and we make no apologies about this,'' said Seth Kamanzi, a senior
Rwandan Foreign Ministry official. Annan urged the U.N. Security Council to
demand that both Rwanda and Uganda immediately withdraw from the northern

Judge Strikes La. School Prayer Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONROE, La. (AP) -- A federal judge today struck down a Louisiana law that
allows public schools to set aside time for prayer. A 1976 law initially allowed
for silent meditation. It was amended in 1992 to include the word ''prayer'' and
again last year to remove the word ''silent.'' The change to verbal prayer
amounted to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by the Legislature,
federal Judge Robert James ruled today.

contract with the Wizards today and accepted with relish his new lofty
assignment. Hamilton is the Wizards' fifth coach in three seasons. The team
hasn't won a playoff game in 12 years, with the only postseason appearance since
1988 coming in a three-game, first-round sweep by Chicago in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mugabe May Seize Mines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will consider
seizing foreign-owned mines and other firms as part of his campaign
to ''Africanize'' the country's assets, the Independent newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, whose government has supported the occupation of more
than 1,400 white-owned farms by black squatters this year, made his
comments in an interview with the British newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said foreign-owned gold, copper, asbestos and iron mines face
seizure once his government completes the redistribution of
millions of acres of the white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   ''After land, now we must look at the mining sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be Africans as owners, not just as workers,'' added
Mugabe, who said there are ''too many Britons'' in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have trained engineers of all kinds, skilled men, civil
engineers, electrical engineers, mining engineers, mechanical
engineers, geologists, agronomists, they're working everywhere,''
he said. ''But ownership? Working for who? At the end of the day
you must be able to say the resources are ours -- our people own the
mines, our people own the industry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said his bid to wrest economic control from Zimbabwe's
white minority will continue after parliamentary elections slated
for June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   He said the elections will be free and fair, despite opposition
complaints that its supporters have been intimidated and attacked.
At least 31 people, most of them opposition supporters, have died
in political violence ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be ready and willing to accept the outcome, whichever
way it goes,'' Mugabe said. But he dismissed as an ''impossible
proposition'' suggestions that the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change could win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   If opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai wins, ''then I will know
for sure that we have been visited upon by the devil,'' Mugabe
said.

<HEADLINE> USOC Drug Chief Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official in charge of making sure the U.S. Olympic team in
Sydney is drug free resigned, charging that his bosses were racist
and turned a blind eye to doping.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wade Exum, one of the U.S. Olympic Committee's
highest-ranking black staff members, said he had become a ''racial
token'' and had to leave as director of the Drug Control
Administration less than 3{ months before the Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the USOC was ''deliberately encouraging the doping
of athletes without considering the consequences to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC denied Exum's allegations and said his job performance
had been under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Exum, 51, said he was forced the leave the job he held for nine
years ''with much grief and disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to stay on. I wanted to continue to work in that
field,'' Exum said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ''But it had
become impossible under the conditions imposed upon me. I decided
to take the advice of my doctors and resign.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pineau, one of Exum's attorneys, said the former director
would file a lawsuit, probably in federal court, alleging racial
discrimination and ''his belief that the USOC neglected its duties
to protect athletes from the dangers of performance-enhancing
drugs.'' No time frame for the lawsuit has been set, Pineau said.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to colleagues dated June 5, Exum said: ''The
increasingly hostile, racist, threatening, jeopardy laden,
intolerable conditions imposed by this organization (USOC) has made
it unbearable for me to remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Exum resigned that day, effective immediately, in a letter to
the USOC in which he said he had become a ''racial token ...
ignored and unfairly belittled.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation was not announced until Wednesday in a brief
USOC statement, which said Exum's allegations were ''patently
false.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We categorically deny that any of the conditions he alleges
existed in his job environment,'' Scott Blackmun, the USOC's senior
managing director for sport resources and Exum's boss, said in a
telephone interview. ''His performance has been under review.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC statement said further comment would be made ''as
future circumstances warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Exum's job at the USOC was being phased out as part of a
transition to an independent drug-testing agency, a response to
critics who said the committee had too much at stake to police its
own athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency will be headed by chairman Frank
Shorter, a former Olympic marathoner, and CEO Terry Madden. The
USOC said there were no plans to appoint a successor to Exum.
</P>
<P>
   But that change to the new agency won't take effect until after
the Sydney Games, and Exum's old office will be in charge of doping
controls for athletes at Olympic trials and all other members of
the U.S. team until the games begin Sept. 15, including random,
unannounced testing.
</P>
<P>
   Exum joined the USOC as drug chief in June 1991, and kept a
fairly high profile in the campaign against illegal performance
enhancers.
</P>
<P>
   But his style and stance often clashed with others in the
Olympics and anti-drug fields, and Blackmun said the transition to
the new agency provoked a final flash point.
</P>
<P>
   According to Blackmun, Exum refused his request for a list of
names and addresses of members of the crews that collect urine
samples from athletes and deliver them to test centers, despite
legal advise that countered Exum's claim that such information was
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun said his office wanted to notify the crew members of
the coming change in case they wanted to apply for similar
positions with the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute lasted for almost three weeks, capped by Exum's
resignation, Blackmun said.
</P>
<P>
   Exum refused to comment on the matter but acknowledged that a
dispute over crew identification was the last straw.

<HEADLINE> Former Hospital Worker Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALISBURY, Md. (AP) -- A former hospital blood worker was
arrested Wednesday and charged with stealing pain medication from
patients' intravenous tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dawn Wood-Bullard, 36, was caught last month using a
syringe to siphon the drug Demerol from patients' IV tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Wood-Bullard was placed on administrative leave without pay, but
authorities said she returned to the hospital Tuesday night dressed
as a worker and allegedly siphoned morphine from the IV tubing of
two more patients. A worker recognized Wood-Bullard and called
security.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital said no patients were harmed in any of the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Wood-Bullard was accused of trespassing, theft, and reckless
endangerment, among other charges. She was held on $45,000 bond at
the Wicomico County Detention Center.

<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A 37-year-old New Haven man faces life
in a federal prison after being convicted of robbery under the
federal ''three strikes'' provision.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Suggs was convicted Wednesday of robbery and using a
firearm during a crime of violence for the July, 14 1999 robbery of
a New Haven gas station and mini-mart. He was charged under the
Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal offense to obstruct, delay or
affect commerce by robbery, extortion or threats of physical
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Suggs is the first person in Connecticut they
have sought to convict under the ''three strikes'' rule, which
mandates a life sentence for habitual violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Suggs has a criminal record dating back to 1983
that includes convictions for robbery and assault.
</P>
<P>
   He is to be sentenced on Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Seeks $16M for Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders, battling a
determined Democratic challenge to their majority, assigned
fund-raising quotas to the rank and file Wednesday as part of a $16
million effort to capture hotly competitive races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed door caucus a few blocks from the Capitol, the head
of the Republican campaign effort, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia,
mentioned several endangered GOP incumbents by name and warned,
''If we don't get it right this year, (they) won't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said participation in the program, dubbed Battleground
2000, would be mandatory, and committee and subcommittee
assignments in the next Congress would be influenced by individual
lawmakers' fund-raising efforts. If Republicans lose control of the
House this fall, ''committee decisions will be based on who helped
the team, not necessarily on seniority,'' according to material
prepared for the session.
</P>
<P>
   Material distributed at the session told Republicans ''if you
are unable to fulfill your commitment, please call...... to make
arrangements for a meeting with Speaker (Dennis) Hastert.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., made clear his interest in the effort in other
ways, deciding to assume the chairmanship of the effort and
addressing the rank and file on its importance to the party's
success this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said aspects of the program went beyond their own
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We implore our members to donate excess funds to the
committee, absolutely,'' said Erik Smith, a spokesman for the House
Democratic campaign committee. ''But we do not make leadership
positions and committee chairmanship contingent on the donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, working to gain the six seats they need to take
control of the House, have turned in a strong fund-raising effort
and held down the number of retirements from within their ranks,
two factors working to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, according to sources who attended the meeting, told
fellow Republicans the $16 million would go toward programs ranging
from ''voter turnout activities that rival the unions,'' to
campaign commercials tailored for individual districts.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged ''fundamentals like streamlined and focused
local campaigns, instead of shoehorned, cookie-cutter, national
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both parties say the outcome of about 35 races will
determine the battle for control this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Davis mentioned four in his remarks, according to one source who
attended: Reps. James Rogan and Steve Kuykendall of California,
Rep. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky and Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months before election day, Republican
presidential contender George W. Bush leads in the polls. But Jim
Wilkinson, a spokesman for the House GOP campaign committee, said,
''We think Bush could win and we'd still lose the House if we don't
get the fundamentals done.''
</P>
<P>
   The House now has 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats and two
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats have both leaned on individual
lawmakers to pitch in for other campaigns in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Republicans mounted an effort, known as Operation
Breakout, which wound up financing late-campaign commercials that
touched on President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and the impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the effort turned out to be a failure because
many Republicans blame the commercials for an unexpected loss of
seats in November.
</P>
<P>
   This time, officials said the effort will be more tailored based
on the makeup of individual districts and races.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson declined to identify the three dozen or so races where
the money will be allocated. But other officials have said in
recent months they are widely scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many now are held by lawmakers retiring this fall. But each
party has a small number of incumbents expected to face
particularly difficult challenges.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Cut Engine Research  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan House voted Wednesday to slash
federal subsidies for the automakers and others who conduct
research on more efficient car engines, dealing a setback to the
Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By 214-211, lawmakers voted to cut $126.5 million, or about half
the budget, from the program, the partnership for a new generation
of vehicles. A majority of Republicans and dozens of Democrats
voted to shrink a program that was started by President Clinton and
strongly supported by Gore, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration, the auto industry and Michigan
lawmakers lobbied to defend the program, they were opposed by a
coalition of fiscal conservatives and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the program said it would improve the country's
energy efficiency, strengthen its economy, help consumers and lead
to a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic that so many House members who complain about high
gasoline prices have cut the heart out of a program designed to
save American motorists millions of dollars in energy costs in the
future,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called it corporate welfare for the auto companies,
and said it focused too much on finding cleaner diesel engines,
which they said would still be dirty. Opponents ranged from
consumer advocate Ralph Nader to the pro-environment Sierra Club to
the conservative Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government should not be subsidizing profitable
industries with taxpayer dollars,'' said Rep. John Sununu, R-N.H.,
who sponsored the proposal with Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the program has given $19.7 million to
DaimlerChrysler, $11 million to the Ford Motor Co., and $8.7
million to the General Motors Corp., plus millions more to more
than 100 other private contractors, Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was included in the fiscal 2001 spending bill for
the Interior Department. The Senate has not yet written its version
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4578.

<HEADLINE> High school has two cases of measles; three more suspected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CENTRAL SQUARE, N.Y. (AP) - At least two students have measles
and school officials suspect three others may be infected.
</P>
<P>
   The Oswego County Health Department is working with Central
Square School District officials to investigate the outbreak of the
disease at Paul V. Moore High School.
</P>
<P>
   The students developed the initial symptoms in mid-May,
according to health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Measles is caused by a virus and is usually spread by nasal or
throat droplets of infected persons. The symptoms usually appear in
two stages. The first stage includes runny nose, cough and slight
fever. The fever gradually increases and after three to seven days
can rise to 103-105 degrees. A red blotchy rash appears on the face
and spreads over the rest of the person's body. The eyes may appear
reddened and be sensitive to light.
</P>
<P>
   People usually develop symptoms 7-18 days after they are exposed
to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Central Square is 16 miles southeast of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Foreign Investment Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Direct foreign investment in Venezuela
declined 25 percent between February and March of this year, the
government reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investment fell from $81 million in February to $61 million in
March, the central statistics office reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the March figure is only slightly below the year-ago figure,
when direct foreign investment was $63.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a surge in the international price of oil, Venezuela's
main export product, the economy shrank by a devastating 7 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The South American nation of 23 million people appears to be
slowly emerging from the recession, however, with economic growth
of 0.3 percent posted in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been keeping their money out of the country
largely because of political uncertainty surrounding President Hugo
Chavez's ''social revolution'' for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office 16 months ago, Chavez has decimated the
traditional political elite that ruled the country during four
decades of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution mandated elections to ''re-legitimize''
most public offices including the presidency, but balloting
originally set for May 28 was postponed due to technical glitches.
No new date for the election has been set.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Names Top Cop's Successor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana named a new
national police chief Wednesday, a day after legendary Gen. Rosso
Jose Serrano announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert, 57, Serrano's respected deputy, will
replace the man credited with dismantling the Cali cocaine cartel,
one of the world's most powerful mafias. Gilibert has been chief of
police in the capital, Bogota, and Colombia's second-largest city,
Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's retirement comes at a time when Colombia could use his
reputation in Washington. Pastrana is trying to persuade the U.S.
Congress to pass a $1.7 billion anti-narcotics aid package for the
South American country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and lawmakers consider Serrano, 58, a major force
in the war on drugs. In stepping down, he said he was tired of
attending police officers' funerals. Nearly 2,000 Colombian police
were killed during his five-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Serrano's accomplishments, Colombia has the world's
highest kidnapping rate, rampant drug trafficking and street crime
and a raging guerrilla conflict in which police stations are often
attacked.

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Cubs 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Benny Agbayani hit two solo home runs, his first
shots since connecting against the Cubs in Tokyo, and the New York
Mets beat Chicago 10-8 Wednesday in a game delayed by rain three
times for nearly 3{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura also homered for the Mets.
Agbayani and Piazza each drove in three runs and Todd Zeile had
three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Augie Ojeda hit his first major league homer and drove in three
runs for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch (4-4) won with two innings of relief. Armando
Benitez got four outs for his 16th save in 18 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Rain forced a 35-minute delay after the Mets batted in the first
inning. When play resumed, the Cubs took a 1-0 lead on Mark Grace's
RBI single off Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura tied it with his 13th home run leading off the Mets
second against rookie Scott Downs.
</P>
<P>
   There was another delay of 1:58 after the Mets hit in the
second. Pat Mahomes replaced Hampton, who slightly strained his
left groin, and gave up Ojeda's homer in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth to make it 2-all.
</P>
<P>
   Rain interrupted play a third time, this time for 50 minutes,
before the Cubs fourth. After that delay, Eric Young hit a
sacrifice fly and Joe Girardi hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza then tied it at 4 with his two-run homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton doubled to lead off the Mets sixth. One out later,
pinch-hitter Todd Pratt reached on third baseman Chad Meyers'
error.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott hit an RBI double that chased Daniel Garibay (1-2),
and Melvin Mora greeted Matt Karchner with an RBI double. One out
later, Piazza singled to drive in Mora and make it 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani hit a long homer to straightaway center leading off the
seventh to make it 9-4. Two innings later, he homered on to
Waveland Avenue over the left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani's only other home run was a pinch-hit grand slam
against the Cubs on March 30 in the season-opening series at the
Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs sent 10 batters to the plate in the seventh and pulled
within 9-8 on Glenallen Hill's RBI single, Ojeda's two-run single
and Willie Greene's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: This was the last game of the season between the Cubs and
Mets. ... Hampton's status was day-to-day. ... Cubs pitcher Kerry
Wood pinch-hit for Downs in the second, his first career pinch-hit
appearance. He struck out. ... The Mets have 13 homers in their
last six games. ... Young tried for an inside-the-park homer with
two out in the Cubs sixth but hesitated after rounding third,
slipped halfway home and was thrown out after a rundown.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 3, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Fred McGriff hit a two-run walkoff
homer to lead the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to a 3-2 victory over the
Anaheim Angels on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff hit a 1-2 pitch from Troy Percival over the right-field
wall as the Angels relinquished a two-run ninth-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   Percival (4-3), who blew his fourth save of the season, allowed
Jose Guillen's leadoff homer. Greg Vaughn followed with an infield
single, but immediately left after apparently aggravating a right
hamstring strain that kept him out of 10 of the last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Difelice came in to pinch run for Vaughn, and McGriff
followed with his 12th homer of the season. McGriff has four homers
and 11 RBIs against Anaheim in nine games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay starter Albie Lopez (3-4) gave up two runs and seven
hits in his second career complete game and first win as a starter
since May 22, 1997. His only other complete game came on August 4,
1994, while pitching for Cleveland against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's three-run ninth blew an impressive outing by Brian
Cooper, who gave up five hits, struck out four and walked one in
eight scoreless innings. Cooper has allowed four earned runs or
less in each of his 10 major league starts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio snapped a scoreless tie in the sixth inning with a
leadoff homer. Bengie Molina hit a solo homer for the second
consecutive game in the seventh, making it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have homered 79 times in the past 45 games, while
Tampa Bay has been outhomered 53-30 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper allowed just two singles through four innings. Bubba
Trammell opened the Devil Rays' fifth with a double, but was left
stranded as Cooper retired the next three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, who went 3-for-3, was also left stranded at second in
the seventh. The Devil Rays went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   After working out of jams in the first and second innings, Lopez
allowed just one base runner the next three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay right-hander struck out Darin Erstad, who entered
with an AL-best .380 batting average, Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon
twice each. Lopez finished with a season-high seven strike outs and
walked one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erstad went 0-for-4 and had his average drop five points to
375. ... Anaheim's Troy Glaus grounded out 4-6-3 in the seventh
inning. After fielding the grounder behind second base, 2B Miguel
Cairo flipped the ball to SS Felix Martinez, who threw Glaus out at
first. ... The Devil Rays placed 3B Vinny Castilla (lower back) on
the 15-day disabled list. ... Tampa Bay CF Gerald Williams
(strained left hip flexor) was out of the starting lineup for the
second straight game. ... Anaheim 2B Adam Kennedy is 14-for-27
(.538) with one homer and seven RBIs batting eighth this season.

<HEADLINE> Bryant Returns to Lakers Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Following a bit of intrigue in the Los
Angeles Lakers' locker room, Kobe Bryant returned to action
Wednesday night in Game 4 of the NBA Finals at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant hadn't played since spraining his left ankle late in the
first quarter of Game 2 last Friday against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection and first-team
all-defense pick, was in the starting lineup in Game 4, and seemed
to be moving around reasonably well in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   He missed his first shot, a 15-foot jumper two minutes into the
game, but drove the baseline and fed Glen Rice shortly thereafter,
and Rice nailed a 3-pointer. Bryant made his second shot, another
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, he started out defending Pacers point guard
Mark Jackson, and forced a turnover midway through the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 21.2 points per game in the playoffs despite his
two-point effort in Game 2, Bryant appeared in the trainers' room
to be treated about an hour and 15 minutes before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, a member of the Lakers' staff taped pages
from the pre-game notes on the windows to give Bryant and the
medical staff privacy from reporters in the adjacent locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a repeat of Game 3 on Sunday night, but in that
situation reporters were allowed to peer through the windows.
Bryant exchanged smiles with media members and, at one point,
signaled with his hand he was uncertain as to whether or not he
would play.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, because Lakers coach Phil Jackson told him not to
when Bryant approached him some 30 minutes before tipoff wanting to
play, but admitting to feeling pain when Jackson asked him to do
some lateral slides.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then told him to take the night off since the Lakers had
a 2-0 cushion in the best-of-seven series, later to become 2-1 when
Indiana won 100-91.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was sorely missed. His replacement, Brian Shaw, shot
3-of-10 in scoring six points, and none of the other Lakers stepped
up offensively or on the backboards to support Shaquille O'Neal,
who had 33 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the locker room scene Wednesday night, Jackson
told reporters Bryant had been limited in practice a day earlier,
but seemed to be laterally sliding without problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see how it goes during the course of the game,'' Jackson
said. ''If his conditioning is pretty good, I'll stay with him for
as long as he can go. How he plays obviously has something to do
with it. His explosiveness is not there, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he believed Bryant was at about 80 percent
efficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's death penalty advocates are
watching the negative publicity now swirling around capital
punishment in America. But they insist they are not worried.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' governor has suspended executions in his state after
it was found that 13 death row inmates there were deemed to have
been unfairly or wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Two disparate figures, President Clinton and Pat Robertson, have
urged states to review their death penalty procedures for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, a Columbia Law School professor released a study
showing that between 1973-95, two-thirds of death penalty
convictions nationally were overturned on appeal. Most often, the
quality of the representation defendants received was found by
appeals court judges to have been deficient, Professor James
Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   The capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight
of its own mistakes,'' Liebman declared.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with New York's death penalty law, insist two men who
helped put that statute on the books in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, New York state has done it right,'' George Pataki
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We created a (state) Capital Defender Office,'' he added. ''We
allowed not just access to quality defense attorneys, but also to
expert witnesses and to things like DNA technology. We were very
concerned in passing our bill to make sure that it's done the right
way and ours is done the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki invested a great deal of personal capital in the death
penalty. Restoring capital punishment and cutting taxes were the
twin centerpiece issues of the Republican's successful campaign for
governor against Mario Cuomo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years later, no one has been executed under the
law Pataki restored. Five inmates are on death row. The first, and
perhaps the most important, substantive constitutional challenge to
the death penalty law will not be heard by the state's highest
court, the Court of Appeals, until summer 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   It will come in a case involving the trial and conviction of
Darrel Harris in 1998 for killing three people at a Brooklyn social
club.
</P>
<P>
   Staunch death penalty supporter Dale Volker, a Republican state
senator from Erie County, said he is not surprised that capital
punishment has come increasingly under fire in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In times when murder rates and crime rates have dropped
dramatically, critics tend to assail capital punishment and other
stringent anti-crime laws as no longer necessary, Volker argued.
</P>
<P>
   He blames such a mindset in New York in the early 1960s for
compelling the state Legislature to abolish the death penalty - New
York last executed a murderer in 1963 - and to countenance light
penalties for dealers of hard drugs. The much-reviled Rockefeller
Drug laws were a harsh response at what years of laxness had
wrought, especially in inner-city neighborhoods across the state,
Volker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator said he believes he can explain to some
extent Liebman's findings of widespread inadequacy in the defense
of death penalty cases. Judges are ''very, very reluctant'' to let
a defendant move toward execution if there is even a ''wisp'' of
impropriety with that person's defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volker also suggested that defense lawyers themselves, knowing
their cases are hopeless, might be tempted to risk violating
ethical canons and to make errors that would ''win'' their
defendants new trials as part of a campaign to delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get a retrial after 10 years, it is almost
impossible to get a death penalty conviction'' due to the passage
of time, the death or disappearance of witnesses, the loss of
evidence and other factors, Volker reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''You delay, delay, delay, then you complain about the delays in
court,'' said Volker, a one-time police officer who is a lawyer.
''They say, 'Boy this thing is costing a ton of money.' ... It's a
game, I hate to say it, it's sort of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Capital Defender Office is compiling the voluminous
brief it hopes will convince the state Court of Appeals next summer
that New York's new death penalty law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But it will have trouble using Liebman's study as fodder. To do
so, the Capital Defender Office would have to argue that Harris did
not receive proper representation at his trial - from the Capital
Defender Office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Capitol Defender Office has won praise for its
expertise and the job it has done defending those possibly facing
the death penalty, office spokeswoman Pauline Toole said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Stashenko is Capitol Editor for The Associated Press in
Albany. He can be reached at P.O. Box 7165, Capitol Station,
Albany, N.Y., 12224.

<HEADLINE> Archway Cookies Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archway Cookies is recalling 100,000 packages
of cookies because they contain eggs without listing them as an
ingredient, which might endanger people allergic to egg products,
the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle Creek, Mich., company issued the recall for Gourmet
Rocky Road cookies because of a recent packaging change that left
eggs off the list of ingredients, the company said in a statement.
Archway said it hasn't received any reports of illnesses related to
the label change.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled Gourmet Rocky Road cookies come in 12-ounce
packages with the printed dates ''June 5'' through ''August 25.''
The ''Sugar Free'' version of the cookies is not included in the
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Plants in Boone, Iowa, and Ashland, Ohio, produced the
mislabeled cookies, which were distributed nationwide except for
several states. Those packages sold in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho,
Montana, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington
state don't contain the label error.
</P>
<P>
   People allergic to eggs could experience a serious or
life-threatening allergic reaction if they eat the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can return the product to the store where purchased
for a full refund or an exchange. People with questions can call
Archway toll-free at 1-888-427-2492 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EDT.

Crackdown Targets Securities Fraud
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Charges were brought today against 120 people in what
federal prosecutors said was the largest securities fraud crackdown in U.S.
history. Among those charged were members of all five New York City organized
crime families. The far-reaching fraud stretched over five years, and never
before have so many people been charged at once in such a case, U.S. Attorney
Mary Jo White said. She said 98 of them had been arrested by early afternoon.

Southern Baptists: No Women Pastors

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Southern Baptist Convention decided today that
women should no longer serve as pastors. The vote came two years after the
denomination said a wife should submit herself to the servant leadership of her
husband. ''Southern Baptists, by practice as well as conviction, believe
leadership is male,'' said the Rev. Adrian Rogers of Memphis, Tenn., chairman of
the drafting committee of a revised Faith and Message statement. ''While men and
women are gifted ... the office of pastor is limited to men by Scripture.''

FTC To Check High Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission became the latest federal
agency to agree to investigate a spike in gasoline prices in the Midwest, with
prices above $2 a gallon in Milwaukee -- 23 percent above the national average.
Investigators will explore whether any competitive behaviors, such as
price-fixing or collusion, are driving prices higher, FTC spokesman Mitch Katz
said today. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Energy
Department sent teams of investigators to Milwaukee earlier this week to examine
the issue amid a clamor of consumer anger and calls from politicians for
government to do something to reduce prices.

Ex-Army Reserve Col. Charged With Spying
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A retired Army Reserve colonel was arrested today,
accused of spying for the Soviet Union during a 25-year Cold War conspiracy
while he worked in Germany. The U.S. Attorney's Office identified him as George
Trofimoff. Prosecutors called him the highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever
charged with espionage. They said he conspired to sell classified military
intelligence information to the Soviets when he was a civilian employee of the
Army.

Judge Strikes La. School Prayer Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONROE, La. (AP) -- A federal judge today struck down a Louisiana law that
allows public schools to set aside time for prayer. A 1976 law initially allowed
for silent meditation. It was amended in 1992 to include the word ''prayer'' and
again last year to remove the word ''silent.'' The change to verbal prayer
amounted to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by the Legislature,
federal Judge Robert James ruled today.

Push for High-Tech Visas Stalled
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not long ago, Congress appeared to be moving to address
the high-tech industry's pleas for more workers, but now bills to allow more
skilled foreigners into the country have stalled and the industry is worried.
Increasing the number of H-1B visas, which allow college-educated foreigners to
work in the United States for up to six years, is a top priority for high-tech
companies striving to fill an estimated 300,000 vacancies nationwide. ''If we
don't solve this problem, all we're doing is make our companies less
competitive,'' said Roger Coker, head of U.S. recruiting for Texas Instruments.

Hamilton Signs Deal With Wizards

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan wanted a college coach for his Washington
Wizards, a team short on discipline and fundamentals, and he got it: Leonard
Hamilton of the University of Miami. Hamilton signed a five-year, $10 million
contract with the Wizards today and accepted with relish his new lofty
assignment. Hamilton is the Wizards' fifth coach in three seasons. The team

1988 coming in a three-game, first-round sweep by Chicago in 1997.

<HEADLINE> FTC To Check High Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT IMRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politicians in Illinois and Wisconsin are seeking suspension of
federal fuel regulations blamed for rocketing gasoline prices above
$2 a gallon in Chicago and Milwaukee in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission became the latest
federal agency to agree to investigate whether any competitive
behaviors, such as price-fixing or collusion, are driving prices
higher, FTC spokesman Mitch Katz said Wednesday from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Energy
Department sent teams of investigators to Milwaukee earlier this
week to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan said the high pump prices in the
Chicago area coincided with the June 1 deadline the Environmental
Protection Agency set for oil companies to begin producing
cleaner-burning reformulated fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current craziness doesn't make any sense,'' Ryan said at a
Wednesday news conference. ''Something just isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, prices have risen nationwide, but have soared
in the Midwest, particularly in Chicago and Milwaukee. The average
cost of regular gas on Wednesday was $2.11 a gallon in Chicago, $2
in Milwaukee and $1.61 nationwide, according to the American
Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he agrees with the goal of the federal program
to clean air pollution, but the EPA implemented the new rules too
quickly and without regard for consumer impact.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he has written five letters -- without response --
requesting an EPA rollback its rules, although not all the way back
to the dirtier fuels of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson and nine members of Wisconsin's
congressional delegation, including Kohl, have asked the EPA to
temporarily waive the requirement that only cleaner-burning
gasoline be sold in six southeast Wisconsin counties, including
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman Dave Ryan said Wednesday the agency was reviewing
that request.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices have risen steadily since May when service stations
started selling a new type of reformulated gas designed to cut down
on air pollution in the nation's biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to supply problems with the new formulations, Erin
Roth of the Wisconsin Petroleum Council, said other factors
contributing to the runup in gas prices include the high cost of
crude oil, increased demand during summer driving season and a
patent dispute over the process to make reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   Service stations just outside the six-county region in
southeastern Wisconsin where reformulated gas is required are
running out of fuel as motorists line up to save 20 cents or more
per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the boundary, service station owners told the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that business has gone down as much as
50 percent and may force layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Won't Withdraw From Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda on Wednesday blasted U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for recommending sanctions if the
central African nation does not withdraw its troops from Congo,
saying such a resolution would end Congo's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to leave ... until our security is
guaranteed, and we make no apologies about this,'' said Seth
Kamanzi, a senior Rwandan Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Annan urged the U.N. Security Council to demand that
both Rwanda and Uganda immediately withdraw from the northern
Congolese city of Kisangani, where they clashed last week, and that
they then make a complete pullout from Congo. Under Annan's
proposal, sanctions could be imposed if the two armies refuse to
leave the parts of Africa's third-largest nation they control in
cooperation with rebels who are trying to topple Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials told reporters that while Rwanda is committed
to completing its withdrawal from Kisangani, which is supposed to
be handed over to unarmed U.N. military observers, it will not
leave Congo until other foreign troops have done so, in accordance
with the peace accord signed last year in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Security Council goes on with this, Lusaka will be
dead,'' Ambassador Mike Rwigema said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, there were already signs that the
sanctions threat might end up being removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council opened initial consultations Wednesday on a
French draft resolution based on Annan's proposal. The council has
said it wants to adopt the resolution Friday. Such a tight deadline
and early indications of disagreement on other elements of the
draft indicated that the warning of sanctions -- the draft's most
divisive element -- could be watered down or removed altogether by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, and later Uganda, sent troops and arms into Congo to
back up the anti-Kabila rebels in August 1998. But since then, the
two allies have fallen out over the conduct of war and which rebels
to support, culminating in repeated clashes for the control of
Kisangani, the Congo River port that both sides deem strategic for
resupplying their troops elsewhere in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies fought pitched artillery battles for seven days
last week in Kisangani, killing at least 150 civilians and injuring
more than 1,100. The fighting ended Sunday after the Rwandan army
drove the Ugandans out of the northern sector of Kisangani and let
unarmed U.N. military observers deploy between the two former
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies were in the process of withdrawing from the city
when fighting broke out, and they have now agreed to complete the
withdrawal, said Senegalese Gen. Muntaga Diallo, head of the U.N.
observer mission in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fighting has further complicated the already
fragile peace accord between Congolese President Laurent Kabila,
the rebels and the five foreign armies involved in the war -- Rwanda
and Uganda on the rebel side and Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on
Kabila's side.
</P>
<P>
   Their withdrawal from Congo is supposed to be supervised by a
5,537-strong force of U.N. observers and troops. So far, just 200
observers have been deployed.

<HEADLINE> Braves 8, Pirates 4  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- John Rocker made a wild but harmless return to
the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday night, throwing six successive
balls before being lifted in an 8-4 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, exiled to the minors to battle his wildness following a
heated run-in with a reporter June 4, felt he had worked out his
control problems at Triple-A Richmond, but apparently didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander replaced Greg Maddux (9-1) with the Braves up
8-4, two on and two outs in the eighth to more boos than cheers, a
far different reception than he received in Rocker-friendly
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, whose volatile and often confrontational relationship
with the media developed from his offseason interview in which he
criticized gays and minorities, talked briefly but cordially to
reporters before the game. He said he threw almost all strikes in
three appearances in Richmond -- he charted his own pitches there --
and felt his control problems had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers from the crowd of 16,972 grew louder with each ball
to John Vander Wal, who walked on four pitches, none very close to
the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   After Rocker threw two more balls to Pat Meares, putting him in
danger of walking in a run, manager Bobby Cox came to the mound,
talked briefly to the reliever, then signaled for former closer
Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg worked out of the jam by getting Meares to ground
into an inning-ending force play grounder and got the final four
outs for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux gave up four runs in the first three innings, including
Vander Wal's two-run homer. He didn't allow a run after Chipper
Jones put the Braves ahead to stay in the fourth with his 14th
homer, a two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux struck out eight in 7 2-3 innings and broke the major
league record for career putouts by a pitcher with his 388th on
Vander Wal's groundout in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time Cy Young winner is 8-9 in Three Rivers Stadium,
with most of the losses coming when he pitched for the Cubs, but is
9-0 overall against the Pirates since last losing to them on April
30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While Maddux had his customary control, walking one, Pirates
rookie starter Jimmy Anderson (1-5) kept himself in trouble by
walking the leadoff hitter in each of his four innings. Three of
the four scored.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras walked and scored on Andres Galarraga's groundout
in the first, and Mark DeRosa walked ahead of Veras' RBI single in
the second. Jones' leadoff walk and second baseman Warren Morris'
run-scoring error on Brian Jordan's grounder led to a two-run
third.
Notes: Braves LHP Terry Mulholland reported soreness in a
hamstring, so Kevin Millwood will make his second start of the
series Thursday night. He lasted only 1-3 of an inning Monday. ...
Anderson has lost his last five decisions. ... Jones has a 12-game
hitting streak (17-for-45, .378). ... Pirates hitting coach Lloyd
McClendon was ejected in the sixth after Kevin Young struck out
looking on a pitch that appeared to be outside. ... Meares made his
first start since leaving Friday's game at Kansas City with a
bruised right shin ... Maddux is 5-0 since last losing May 3. ...
Brian Giles is 5-for-9 against Maddux.

<HEADLINE> IAPA: Cuba, Others Face Press Woes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The press is seriously restricted
in Cuba but it faces problems in Colombia, Venezuela and Peru as
well, the president of the Inter American Press Association said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has had a long history of harassing, intimidating and
restricting the press, Tony Pederson told a gathering of 1,400
editors and journalists. But he said the problems have increased
since the government began taking a tougher line against
independent journalists last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Peru and Colombia, threats to independent press,
though much less serious, are still troubling, he told the IAPA
members from across the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have long passed the days of governments closing newspapers
and jailing editors for no reason. But what we are seeing now are
pressures much more subtle,'' Pederson said citing repressive and
restrictive press laws, lawsuits and even economic harassment and
manipulation of government advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, measures passed by President Hugo Chavez's
government have had negative consequences for the press, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, Pederson said ''the government of Alberto Fujimori has
continued to show lack of regard for press freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson cited the case of Israeli-born Baruch Ivcher, who lost
his Peruvian citizenship and consequentially his TV station after
his reporters broadcast reports implicating the government in
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Murder also remains a popular means of silencing journalists
across much of Latin America, with some 200 killed over the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those killings occurred in Colombia, making it
the most dangerous country in the world for the press, he said.

<HEADLINE> Owner of historical home wants to build golf course there  </HEADLINE>
prhfc
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, Conn. (AP) - The owner of a home that served as
headquarters to French troops during the American Revolution wants
to put a golf course on the property.
</P>
<P>
   William W. Landon said he plans to name the nine holes on the
chip-and-putt course after Lebanon's many historical heroes, some
of whom lived in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood, the home Landon said he saved from demolition and has
been restoring for 15 years, will remain unaltered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing will be spared to make it the best, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are aghast at the golf course plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about a house that is not only historic, but is
directly across the street from the Congregational church, the town
hall, the green itself, the library - you name it, '' said local
historian Alicia Wayland. She also lives on the green.
</P>
<P>
   David Trumbull, the son of Gov. Jonathan Trumbull and father of
Gov. Joseph Trumbull, built Redwood in 1778 for his new bride,
Sarah Backus of Norwich.
</P>
<P>
   In 1780, they turned the home over to the French army unit
considered to be the most colorful and troublesome of the
Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   Landon's house, and the entire area surrounding the green, is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The designation is less of a deterrent to altering private
property than to projects proposed by the government, said Jack
Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission. In
this case, the historical home is not being destroyed so the
designation carries little weight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannahan has sent the town a letter urging officials to
consider the historical heritage of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Landon said the project will blend well with the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It fits wonderfully,'' he said. ''It would be an asset to the
town. I look to the right, I see the Lebanon green store. I look
across the street, I see the Lebanon Town Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The town zoning commission, which held a public hearing on the
proposal Wednesday night, did not indicate when they would rule on
Landon's request.

<HEADLINE> Padres Reliever Whiteside Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENCINITAS, Calif. (AP) -- San Diego Padres relief pitcher Matt
Whiteside was arrested for investigation of spousal abuse this week
after his wife complained to a sheriff's deputy outside a
convenience store in this northern San Diego County city.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside was booked into the Vista Jail early Monday morning
and was released on bail about six hours later. An arraignment date
has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials said Whiteside, 32, and his wife, Stephanie,
23, had been arguing in his pickup truck outside a 7-Eleven store.
Stephanie Whiteside spotted a sheriff's deputy nearby and walked
over to the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy followed Stephanie Whiteside back to the truck and
after interviewing both of them, arrested Matt Whiteside on a
domestic violence charge, sheriff's spokesman Ron Reina said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been resolved between us. It was resolved the next
morning,'' Whiteside said. ''It's fine. We don't want it to be an
embarrassment for the ballclub. It was unfortunate incident that
happened at the wrong time and the wrong place.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 8, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Chris Carpenter pitched eight strong innings, and
Brad Fullmer and Jose Cruz Jr. homered as the Toronto Blue Jays
beat the Detroit Tigers 8-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (6-5), who allowed at least one first-inning run in
six of his previous seven starts, breezed through the first five
against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who hit four homers and three doubles among their 21
hits in a 16-3 victory the previous night, had just one extra-base
hit -- Damion Easley's RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Detroit baserunner advanced as far as third base during
the first five innings, and that was the result of Carpenter's
two-out wild pitch following a walk and a groundout in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers loaded the bases on two singles and a walk with two
outs in the sixth, but Carpenter got Brad Ausmus on a routine fly
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who was tagged for six runs on seven hits in three
innings in a start against Detroit on May 28, gave up nine hits,
struck out seven and walked six.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver (3-6), seeking his third straight win, gave up six
runs on six hits including the homers to Fullmer and Cruz in four
innings. Weaver, who retired 13 of the first 14 in a 4-2 win over
St. Louis on June 9, walked two and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado started Toronto's three-run second with an
infield single and scored on Fullmer's ninth home run, his second
of the series. One out later, Cruz -- hitless in his previous three
games -- hit his 15th homer for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took a 4-0 lead in the third as Shannon Stewart doubled,
moved up on Homer Bush's bunt and scored on Raul Mondesi's
sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Castillo hit a two-run single to give Toronto a 6-0 lead
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado had an RBI double off Allen McDill for a 7-0 lead in the
fifth. Marty Cardova scored when Fullmer, who had three RBIs, was
hit by a pitch from C.J. Nitkowski in the ninth for Toronto's final
run.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The start of the game was delayed 27 minutes by rain. ...
Dave Mlicki, pounded for seven runs on nine hits over 1 1-3 innings
Sunday in a start against St. Louis, was demoted to the bullpen.
Mlicki, whose spot in the rotation was given to Willie Blair, took
over to start the sixth. ... Stewart was replaced in left field in
the fifth after experiencing mild discomfort in his right
hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Assault Rebel Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) -- Air force planes dropped bombs and
helicopters fired rockets Wednesday at a major Muslim rebel camp in
the southern Philippines, the military said, forcing 40,000
villagers to flee their homes to escape the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Two army battalions took part in the assault on the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front outpost near the boundary of Maguindanao and North
Cotabato provinces, said army spokesman Capt. Noel Detoyato. The
thousands of people from surrounding villages who fled their homes
pitched makeshift shelters in nearby town centers, local social
work officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Rajamuda is one of two remaining major MILF camps in the
southern Mindanao region. The army attack on the camp came several
hours after guerrillas ambushed a convoy bearing a Philippine
general, Detoyato said. Maj. Gen. Gregorio Camiling was unhurt in
the ambush in Maguindanao province, but one soldier was wounded and
one armored vehicle was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF is the larger of two groups fighting for an independent
Islamic state in the southern Philippines. The smaller but more
radical group, the Abu Sayyaf, is holding 21 mostly foreign
hostages on southern Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   Military operations against the rebels intensified in late April
after the government decided to shut down dozens of MILF satellite
camps. At least 184 government soldiers and militiamen have been
killed and more than 680 wounded in clashes since January -- the
most serious fighting in Mindanao since the height of the Muslim
rebellion in the 1970s. There are no reliable figures on rebel
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Government and rebel negotiators resumed peace talks two weeks
ago, but the military operations have continued. Another round of
talks is scheduled for June 28.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, President Joseph Estrada met with religious and
business leaders who are calling for a cease-fire in Mindanao.
Estrada said he joined them in their call for peace, but defended
the military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one in our quest not just for temporary peace, but more
importantly, lasting peace,'' he said, citing 227 alleged rebel
violations of a 1997 cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   When the violations became ''too much,'' Estrada said, ''I
reluctantly ordered the armed forces to meet what has now become a
full-scale military challenge to government authority.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Agent Ruled Immune in Idaho  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The FBI agent who killed the wife of white
separatist Randy Weaver during the Ruby Ridge standoff is immune
from state prosecution in Idaho, a federal appeals court ruled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooter Lon Horiuchi shot Vicki Weaver in 1992 while she
held her baby. At the time, federal agents had converged on the
family's cabin to arrest Randy Weaver on a weapons trafficking
charge. Horiuchi said he did not see Vicki Weaver when he fired at
an armed associate of Randy Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho prosecutors pursued a manslaughter charge against
Horiuchi, but the charge was dismissed by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal, ruling that Horiuchi was acting in his
official duty as a federal law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh praised the ruling, saying it
''supports what I have always believed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one in the FBI ever wants any situation to end
tragically,'' Freeh said in a statement. ''The reality is that with
alarming frequency, agents must put all their training, experience
and judgment to the test and make split-second life-and-death
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weavers' 14-year-old son and a U.S. marshal were also killed
during the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Devils Get Victory Tailgate Party  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Who needs a ticker-tape parade down
a canyon of heroes? This is New Jersey: A tailgate party on a
concrete prairie was just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 40,000 New Jersey Devils fans turned out
Wednesday in a parking lot at the Meadowlands Sports Complex to
celebrate the team's second Stanley Cup championship in six
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Light rain and cool temperatures did not deter fans from
saluting their team. They cheered wildly as captain Scott Stevens
came out with the Cup against a backdrop of fireworks and ticker
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens thanked the fans for their support, particularly when
the Devils were away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we're such a great road team,'' Stevens said on a
podium filled with the team and family members. ''We always have
you guys there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko summed up the team's feelings as he looked out at
the big crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most gratifying feeling in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson, who hasn't officially decided whether he will
coach the team next season, was greeted with chants of ''One more
year'' as he got up to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson indicated he would return as long as general manager
Lou Lamoriello also comes back under the team's new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Owner John McMullen sold the team to YankeeNets for $175 million
and will surrender control July 12. The team is expected to move to
Newark after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''In another month I'm going to join you as a fan,'' McMullen
told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is going to be a model for every other team in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans waving Devils flags and carrying homemade Stanley Cups and
pitchforks formed a sea of red and white. They arrived in the
afternoon for the start of a free Fan Fest with games, food and
music.
</P>
<P>
   State Police reported there were no arrests or reports of
trouble at the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowlands spokeswoman Helen Strus estimated the crowd at
40,000 to 45,000, based on a count of vehicles in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who was booed loudly by the crowd when
she appeared on the podium wearing a Devils jersey, praised the
team's tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are tough and they are gritty,'' Whitman said. ''They
hang together.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also defended the event's location.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody can have a parade anywhere,'' she said. ''This kind of
celebration is more interactive for the fans. It's better than the
fans standing around to see the team for 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration also featured a laser light show and video
highlights of the team's championship season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils beat the Dallas Stars 2-1 in double overtime
Saturday, propelling them to their first Stanley Cup championship
since 1995, when they swept the Detroit Red Wings in the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 fans turned out for a victory celebration after
that Stanley Cup, though their enthusiasm was somewhat clouded by
the team's threatened move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Devils Stay! Please!'' read one sign at the 1995 rally,
reflecting the prevailing fan sentiment. That celebration, too, was
held in the parking lots outside the Devils' home building, now
called Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   This time McMullen refused an offer from city officials to have
a ticker-tape parade in downtown Newark, where the team plans to
move unless a new arena is built in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bayonne and West Orange also offered to host the parade, but
McMullen -- calling the Meadowlands home -- declined.
</P>
<P>
   Devils advocates weren't the only ones celebrating, either: The
author of a ''New Jersey Devils Hate Page'' on the Internet tipped
a hat to the champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the fact this is an anti-NJ Devils site, I
congratulate the Devils on their Cup victory,'' the site said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers 54-51 at Half  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits was almost an even match for
Shaquille O'Neal as the Indiana Pacers, looking for a victory to
tie the NBA Finals, led the Los Angeles Lakers 54-51 at halftime of
Game 4 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Smits was dominated by O'Neal in the series' first three games,
but the veteran center made his first five shots and delighted the
Conseco Fieldhouse crowd as the Pacers, down 2-1 in the series,
tried to give Los Angeles consecutive losses for just the fourth
time all season.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led 33-23 after the first quarter, but the Lakers closed
the gap steadily in the second. Robert Horry's three-point play
with 1:59 left in the half cut the Pacers' lead to 50-49 before
Austin Croshere and Reggie Miller, who led Indiana with 13 points,
both scored late.
</P>
<P>
   But the most surprising aspect of the half was the performance
of Smits, who fed off the crowd's emotion and stood up to the
league MVP. Though O'Neal finished the half strong and got 13
points by hitting his last four shots, Smits had 10 points on
5-of-7 shooting, giving the Pacers an undeniable morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   Smits hit his first five shots until O'Neal, who had eight
rebounds in the half, blocked a fallaway jumper with 5:32 left in
the half. But the Pacers went right back to Smits, and he drew
O'Neal's third personal foul on the next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles got a boost of its own with the return of Kobe
Bryant, who sprained his left ankle early in Game 2 and missed all
of Game 3 but was in the Lakers' starting lineup. He played the
entire first quarter and much of the second, going 3-of-7 from the
field for six points and getting four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant moved without obvious limitations but seemed unsure of
the strength in his foot as he missed his first shot and was called
for a traveling violation early. One of the NBA's premiere
defenders, Bryant was assigned to guard light-scoring Mark Jackson
in an apparent concession to his injury.
</P>
<P>
   With the Indiana crowd screaming even louder than in Game 3, the
Pacers came out red-hot. They hit eight of their first 10 shots,
including two 3-pointers by Miller, to take a seven-point lead in
the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finished the first quarter with 10 points despite going
just 2-of-6 from the field, but he then went scoreless until the
final minute of the half, missing his only shot. The Pacers'
offensive star had a similar lapse in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed four of his first five shots from the field before
finding his legs. Against Smits, Dale Davis and Sam Perkins, he
looked frustrated and made an unusual appeal to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, who criticized Lakers coach Phil Jackson for his lack
of playing time in the series, played a much bigger role in Game 4.
He scored eight points on 2-of-4 shooting but took the ball to the
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Horry had 10 points off the bench for Los Angeles, while Rick
Fox had five. Croshere led the Pacers' bench with eight points,
while leading scorer Jalen Rose had six quiet points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, playing on his 39th birthday, hit a 3-pointer in the
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Deal in Albany to require sale of 'fire-safe' cigarettes  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Legislature and Gov. George Pataki
reached a deal Wednesday to require the sale of self-extinguishing
cigarettes in New York state by mid-2003.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved unanimously by the state Assembly and
Senate late Wednesday night, is designed to cut down on instances
where smokers cause fires through careless smoking or when they
fall asleep and start upholstery or mattresses smoldering.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials estimate that at least a third of the fire deaths
in the state occurred in blazes sparked by careless smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a reworked version of a bill Pataki vetoed on
May 25. That decision angered anti-smoking forces, who are riding
high in Albany this year after seeing the state's per-pack
cigarette tax go up from 56 cents to $1.11 starting March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill gives the state more time to set up guidelines for
the self-extinguishing characteristics of cigarettes and,
consequently, for tobacco companies to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The first measure required the marketing of only ''fire-safe''
cigarettes starting in April 2002. The new bill would give the
state two years to come up with the cigarette standards starting on
Jan. 1, 2001, and then tobacco companies would get until July 1,
2003, to begin marketing cigarettes meeting the guidelines
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The safety standards would be developed jointly by the state
Office of Fire Prevention and the state Health Department under the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also mandate that fire-safe cigarettes
cannot be more toxic to smokers than the conventional cigarettes
currently on the market. One of the objections in Pataki's veto
message was that no such stipulation was in the original bill.
</P>
<P>
   Included with the fire-safe cigarette bill was a related measure
to increase penalties and otherwise beef up state efforts to combat
''buttlegging'' - the sale of untaxed cigarettes. Critics say
bootlegging is already a serious problem, and would only get worse
when conventional cigarettes are taken off the market in favor of
the self-extinguishing variety.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Sciandra of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York said
his group is ''incredibly happy'' about the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sciandra and the bill's chief sponsor in the Assembly,
Democrat Alexander Grannis of Manhattan, said they think a New York
statute is likely to compel the tobacco industry to seek a
nationwide law in Congress rather than ing with state statutes
piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They panic,'' Grannis said. ''We will change this entire
industry, change how this industry manufactures its product.''
</P>
<P>
   A chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Queens Republican Frank
Padavan, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be voting today for self-extinguishing cigarettes to
save the lives of New Yorkers, but we are also igniting a bonfire
in the halls of Congress,'' Padavan said. ''The campaign started
here, but the best possible remedy would be a national fire-safe
cigarette standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a bill requiring fire-safe cigarettes in
California appeared before a state legislative committee in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kottak, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said that
trying to make a cigarette which would ''pass an artificial test
could have a direct, adverse impact'' on the health of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris spokeswoman Kati Otto said her company has been
test-marketing a cigarette that is less likely to ignite certain
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results both in the laboratory and in the test market have
been extremely positive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris thinks a national approach to mandating
self-extinguishing cigarettes ''is preferable to 50 potentially
conflicting state standards,'' she said.

   HAMILTON, Ohio (AP) -- A man who kept track of traffic deaths,
missing persons and other news-making tragedies took pleasure in
telephoning the victims' relatives to claim he had new information
about the cases, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mullins, 53, of Hamilton, is to be arraigned Thursday on a
misdemeanor count of telephone harassment. If convicted, he could
be sentenced to six months in jail and fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew what he was doing was wrong,'' Maj. Anthony Dwyer of
the Butler County sheriff's office said Wednesday. ''He indicated
he did take some pleasure from being able to call people, being
anonymous, the feeling that he got from that.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Mullins kept journals filled newspaper
clippings and handwritten daily entries aspanning 34 years, Dwyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently would call families on the anniversary of a
personal tragedy to claim that he had new information, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation started May 15 when a family reported
receiving an answering-machine message from a man who said he
needed to talk to a 13-year-old girl whose mother had been killed
in a car wreck in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is charged in only one case, investigators said he
may have made 100 or more such calls in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins could not be located Wednesday to comment on the
allegations. No telephone number is listed in his name.

<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Mike Futrell singled in the winning run with
two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning as Florida State staved
off elimination again with a 3-2 victory over Southern California
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Futrell, 0-for-3 with two strikeouts as he stepped to the plate,
lifted Ronald Flores' 1-2 pitch into right field to score Ryan
Barthelemy from third.
</P>
<P>
   Flores (6-2) gave up three hits in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jon McDonald (12-5) pitched a four-hitter for Florida State. He
struck out seven, walked four and hit three batters. The only two
runs he allowed were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ninth, Florida State (53-18) had just three hits and
the Seminoles' entire offense came from Marshall McDougall.
</P>
<P>
   McDougall hit two solo home runs, his 14th and 15th of the
season. His second was his fifth at Rosenblatt Stadium, tying him
with Barthelemy and former Seminoles star J.D. Drew for the most in
CWS history.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles need to beat LSU twice to advance to the
championship game. Florida State and the Tigers play Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California (44-20), meanwhile, exits the tournament
having stranded 29 runners on base, 17 in scoring position, in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a solid outing from freshman Anthony Reyes. He
gave up three hits and two runs in 7 1-3 innings. He struck out a
career-high 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans scored an unearned run in the fourth when Justin
Gemoll reached on Pichi Balet's throwing error and came home on
Beau Craig's single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   McDougall tied it at 1 in the fourth with a two-out solo home
run to left field. He tied it again in the seventh with his second
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal took a 2-1 lead in the sixth with the help of more
sloppy play by the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald hit Craig with a pitch. Craig moved to second with a
stolen base, but he should have been out. Blair McCaleb's throw had
him beaten by so much that Craig stopped in the basepath. But
neither Brett Groves nor McDougall could come up with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Craig moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on Balet's
second throwing error of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had plenty of opportunities to extend their early
lead. They left seven runners on base, including six in scoring
position, through six innings.

<HEADLINE> Down Broadway on a lawn mower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Broadway is known for lots of things - bright
lights, theater, yellow cabs - but lush lawns aren't among them.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Gary Hatter, who drove his lawn mower down
Broadway on Wednesday as part of what he says will be a five-month
effort to break the world record for longest distance traveled on a
mower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never come through anyplace like that,'' said Hatter, 46,
of Champaign, Ill., who was on his first visit to New York.
''Weaving in and out of cabs, them weaving in and out of you. ...
The traffic, the people. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatter, who began his trip in Portland, Maine, two weeks ago,
woke up Wednesday morning in Greenwich, Conn., and made it all the
way to midtown Manhattan on his big orange Kubota lawn mower, model
BX-2200, complete with a plastic roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people were just unbelievable, waving and thumbs up,'' he
said. ''I didn't stop, I was rolling. A lot of them would pull up
alongside me and congratulate me, wish me the best of luck. ... It
was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatter's first sight of New York City came when he entered the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nothing but shops one right after another,'' he said
later. ''I'd never seen so many people before. I was like, 'Holy
mackerel!'''
</P>
<P>
   After a day or two in New York, he plans to head for Trenton,
N.J., then toward North Carolina and through several Southern
states. After that, he'll veer north and head cross-country to
Seattle, go south to Los Angeles and then return east on a southern
route. All told, he expects to cover 14,000 miles in 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter, a former truck driver who hasn't worked in 21 years
because of a back problem, plans to break the current lawn mower
driving record, 4,039 miles over 51 days. He hopes his ride will
raise enough money for a back operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - The first female space shuttle commander
said she hopes more girls get involved in the space program as the
world strives to explore more of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Collins, who commanded a shuttle flight in July 1999,
urged young women to pursue the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're out there looking for women. And why, when we send out
our applications, why are only 18 to 20 percent women? Women do not
select technical fields for their career at the same rate as men. I
try to encourage young women to do what you enjoy, don't let
someone else tell you what to do with your life,'' she said at the
Ernie Davis Heisman Memorial Dinner Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Collins sees exploration into deeper space as the next logical
step for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the more distant future, back to the moon, onto Mars, but
the bottom line is we need to continue to expand,'' she said. ''I
hope to be alive when the first person walks on Mars, and I hope
that person is an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, an Elmira native, Dikembe Mutombo, a center for the
Atlanta Hawks, and John Mackey, a former football player for
Syracuse University and the Baltimore Colts, received humanitarian
awards at the dinner named for the 1961 Heisman Trophy winner.

Largest Crackdown on Securities Fraud Made

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 100 reputed mobsters, stock promoters and
executives of Internet start-ups were accused today of strong-arming brokers and
manipulating penny stocks in the country's largest crackdown yet on securities

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Risking a wider split in the nation's largest

women should no longer serve as pastors. The statement of faith is not binding
on congregations, and so the effect on the Southern Baptists' 1,600 or so
clergywomen -- about 100 of whom are pastors leading congregations -- is
unclear. But some members warned that congregations will quit the 15.9
million-member denomination over this, just as some did when the Southern
Baptists declared two years ago that wives should ''submit graciously'' to their
husbands.

price-fixing or collusion, are driving prices higher, FTC spokesman Mitch Katz

the issue amid a clamor of consumer anger and calls from politicians for

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Public Workers Protest  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Thousands of Venezuelan public workers
took to the streets of Caracas on Wednesday in a march to protest
the government's labor policy.
</P>
<P>
   The main union -- the Venezuelan Workers Federation, or CTV --
accuses the government of violating international labor laws by not
negotiating a new collective labor agreement for the public sector.
The workers are demanding a 20 percent increase in salary that
President Hugo Chavez had promised would take effect in May.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people turned out for the march Wednesday morning,
and some 40 policemen carrying anti-riot gear set up a barricade
outside the gates of the presidential palace. Marchers were urging
the government to restart negotiations for a new collective
agreement, acting union head Cesar Cedeno told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ortega, who works for a government arts foundation, joined
several other workers in carrying a cardboard corpse -- an effigy of
Chavez -- in a mock funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're carrying this corpse to protest the insecurity and
unemployment in the country, and the disrespect Chavez has shown to
us workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before it was dissolved on Jan. 31, a powerful assembly
that rewrote Venezuela's constitution suspended labor negotiations
with the public sector for six months. It also mandated the
election of a new union leadership. Chavez, a former coup leader
who took office 16 months ago promising a ''social revolution'' for
Venezuela, has repeatedly said current union leaders are part of a
corrupt oligarchy that needs to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio program earlier Wednesday, Finance Minister Jose
Rojas said the union doesn't have a legitimate reason to protest
because the government is abiding by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although Venezuela is the third-largest oil exporter in the
world, more than half the country lives in poverty. In March, the
official unemployment rate reached a record high 16 percent, though
private economists put the rate at closer to 25 percent. More than
half the labor force works in the ''informal economy,'' selling
wares in flea markets and on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million Venezuelans work for the government.

<HEADLINE> Mexican City Evacuated for Flood  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Authorities evacuated more than 200
people from their homes in this southern Mexican city Wednesday
after officials opened the floodgates of a dangerously full dam for
the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers surrounding Villahermosa, population 475,000, were
already swelling to alarming levels late Wednesday. Officials said
the rivers could rise as much as 20 inches over the next few days
as the water is slowly let out of the Penitas dam, which swelled
beyond its capacity after recent heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God, we're going under again,'' resident Demilde Sosa
said upon hearing the alert over the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say water has to be released from the dam to prevent
it from breaking and creating an even greater disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 230,000 residents of the city were
evacuated during a month of flooding that caused some of the worst
damage in the country. Waters rose to the rooftops of
already-flooded homes and businesses after officials opened the
dam, causing 60,000 people who had stayed behind to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the city will suffer another disaster like last
year's thanks to prevention efforts such as walls of sandbags that
are already in place, said the director of the local Civil
Protection agency, Sergio Jimenez. Nonetheless, he warned that
residents of low-lying areas should be prepared to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So far, half a dozen neighborhoods and outlying communities are
flooded. Families started leaving their homes late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lead Pacers 80-77 After 3  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Kobe Bryant heated up and Shaquille O'Neal
kept pounding away as the Los Angeles Lakers took a 80-77 lead over
the Indiana Pacers after three quarters of Game 4 on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who needed a victory to tie the NBA Finals, led the
entire first half but fell behind as Bryant, who sprained his left
ankle early in Game 2 and missed Game 3, scored 10 of his 16 points
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who dueled surprising Indiana center Rik Smits to a draw
in the first half, racked up 20 points and 17 rebounds after three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana suffered from the disappearance of Reggie Miller, who
scored 10 points in the first quarter but had just one field goal
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant picked up his fourth personal foul just seconds into the
third quarter, but he then scored on three straight possessions to
pull Los Angeles within 58-57. The Lakers took their first lead of
the game at 62-60 on Glen Rice's 3-pointer with 8:00 left in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's dunk with 2:30 left in the quarter gave Los Angeles a
73-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led 33-23 after the first quarter, but the Lakers closed
the gap steadily in the second and trailed 54-51 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana got an unexpected contribution from Smits, who hit his
first five shots of the game and had 16 points through three
quarters. Smits made three short hook shots in the third quarter
and even drew a technical foul against Ron Harper, who smacked
Smits on the shoulder as he ran through a pick.
</P>
<P>
   Smits was dominated by O'Neal in the series' first three games,
but the veteran center delighted the Conseco Fieldhouse crowd as
the Pacers, down 2-1 in the best-of-seven series, tried to give Los
Angeles consecutive losses for just the fourth time all season.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant moved without obvious limitations but started slowly,
seemingly unsure of the strength in his foot. One of the NBA's
premiere defenders, Bryant was assigned to guard light-scoring Mark
Jackson in an apparent concession to his injury.
</P>
<P>
   With the Indiana crowd screaming even louder than in Game 3, the
Pacers came out red-hot. They hit eight of their first 10 shots,
including two 3-pointers by Miller, to take a double-digit lead in
the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finished the first quarter with 10 points but barely
touched the ball in the next two quarters. The Pacers' offensive
star had a similar lapse in Game 3, and he didn't have a
fourth-quarter field goal in the series' first three games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed four of his first five shots from the field before
finding his legs. Against Smits, Dale Davis and Sam Perkins, he
looked frustrated and made an unusual appeal to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who criticized Lakers coach Phil Jackson for his lack of
playing time in the series, played a much bigger role in Game 4,
scoring 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry had 10 points off the bench for Los Angeles, while
Rick Fox added eight. Croshere led the Pacers' bench with 10
points, while leading scorer Jalen Rose had 10 points on 4-of-11
shooting through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, playing on his 39th birthday, hit a 3-pointer in the
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Toldeo: OAS On the Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo
said Wednesday that the Organization of American States will lose
credibility if it offers just lukewarm criticisms of President
Alberto Fujimori's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our expectation is that the OAS won't merely salute to the
flag,'' said Toledo, who boycotted the May 28 presidential runoff
vote, claiming it was rigged. ''If it does, the OAS's credibility
in the region will be very seriously examined.''
</P>
<P>
   An OAS delegation refused to monitor the voting, saying the
election was ''far from what could be considered free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 34-member nations later stopped short of questioning
Fujimori's win or imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they are sending OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria and
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy to Peru at the end
of the month to work on strengthening democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is still weighing its reaction to the
election. But a growing number of analysts are saying it is
extremely unlikely that Peru will face any international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he still does not recognize Fujimori's lopsided
victory, which gave him an unprecedented third five-year term.
Toledo has vowed prevent Fujimori's inauguration before Congress on
July 28 with massive street protests.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces last week pledged allegiance to Fujimori -- a
move that Toledo maintains was unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Two students hospitalized after being attacked by 25 other teens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - A group of about 25 teens severely beat
other two high school students with baseball bats, boards and pipes
outside a home here Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both 17-year-olds who were beaten were hospitalized with one
undergoing a CAT scan to determine if he suffered brain damage,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   That teen had a damaged eye socket, a possible broken nose, and
cuts that required stitches, police said. The other suffered
bruises and cuts. Both were treated at The Valley Hospital in
Ridgewood and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the injured teens are from Ridgefield Park and
Westwood and attend Don Bosco High School in Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came after the two took offense at a rumor
circulating about one of the boy's cousins and went to confront a
youth they thought was responsible for spreading at a house on
Demarest Avenue, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When they got there, they were met with the group of 25 teens
who had the weapons, police said.

<HEADLINE> Senate says it will wrap up its session ... for now  </HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Legislation that would prohibit
telemarketers from accessing bank accounts without the written
consent of consumers was passed Wednesday by both houses of the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was one of numerous bills passed in the state Senate
and Assembly as legislators scrambled to iron out last-minute deals
before the 2000 session ends. Senators on Wednesday held what
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said would be the last day of their
regular session.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and the Assembly approved two bills designed to
bail wealthy Nassau County on Long Island out of its financial
troubles. One measure calls for the creation of an interim
oversight board to review the county's budgeting. The second bill
would provide state aid to Nassau County, Buffalo and Yonkers, and
allow New York City to borrow $4 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   The two chambers also unanimously passed late Wednesday night a
bill requiring only self-extinguishing cigarettes to be sold in New
York by mid-2003 and an accompanying measure that increases
penalties for bootlegging cigarettes. Legislative leaders reached
an agreement on the Fire-safe Cigarette Act earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing bill targets deceptive practices that
lawmakers said were not addressed by the federal Telemarketing
Sales Rule of 1996. The bill would require telemarketers in New
York to be bonded and registered with the state. Telemarketers
would also have to state the purpose of the solicitation call and
the price of the goods before asking for personal and financial
information from the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would require telemarketers to keep
records of calls and sales for two years and ban courier pick-ups
for payments before a person can inspect the product.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons, which lobbied hard
for the legislation, applauded the bill. AARP's Ollie Owen said the
law has ''real teeth'' and that it would ''fill the gaps'' in the
federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Requiring written authorization for accessing these accounts
puts an additional step in the process which will help protect
people from impulsive decisions they can't back away from,'' Owen
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Office of the Aging, 85 percent of
victims of telemarketing fraud are people over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was part of a three-way agreement between the Senate,
Assembly and Gov. George Pataki's office. It now goes to the
governor for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, legislative leaders and Pataki reached a deal on
establishing automatic cost-of-living increases for the retirees of
state and local governments. The package, passed by the Senate
Wednesday night, still needed Assembly approval.
</P>
<P>
   Issues that remained unresolved Wednesday included legislation
to toughen penalties for sex assaults and school violence, to
impose more controls over the sales of guns and to toughen
penalties for so-called ''hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly passed a bill that would renew the law which
increased the speed limit on some New York highways to 65 mph. The
current law expires on Dec. 1, and the measure would extend its
validity for another five years.
</P>
<P>
   -Both chambers of the state Legislature passed a measure
requiring pet dealers to provide consumers purchasing cats and dogs
with information concerning the animal's health, medical history
and origin. The bill also called for licensing and inspection of
all pet dealers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   -The Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill to give
people falsely accused of abusing a child a way to appeal to the
state to get their names removed from the state's sex abuse
registry. Currently, people's names remain on the registry for 10
years, even if the accusations against them are found to be
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill that
would allow the state Department of Correctional Services to grant
work release to victims of domestic and sexual abuse who were
convicted of assaulting or killing their abusers. Under the
measure, eligibility would be determined in a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   -The Senate passed legislation that would create a DNA Review
Committee to examine cases where convictions were set aside a s a
result of DNA evidence. The panel will also analyze the
implications of DNA technology to the state's criminal justice
system, and it will have the power to review cases and recommend
legal or procedural changes.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly unanimously passed legislation that would make the
46-page state constitution gender neutral. The measure was approved
by the Senate on Tuesday. In order to become law, the bill must be
passed again by both houses in the next legislative term and
ratified by New York voters.

<HEADLINE> Special aid package for Nassau, NYC, Yonkers, Buffalo  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature voted Wednesday to
bail out one of the wealthiest counties in America, plus give
fiscal boosts to New York City, Yonkers and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package for Nassau County is designed to get the Long
Island county out from under a current shortfall of more than $100
million which is projected to grow to more than $300 million by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bailout deal, the county has agreed to make about $200
million in spending cuts over the next four years while state
taxpayers will contribute $105 million to the county over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-member, state-appointed board will oversee the county's
finances and if local officials fail to take a fiscally prudent
course, the panel will turn into a formal financial control board
with direct budgeting powers in the county.
</P>
<P>
   The county will also be able to save tens of millions of dollars
in interest costs by refinancing some of its current $2.7 billion
in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout bill was negotiated with the input of Gov. George
Pataki, and he is expected to sign the measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County counts some of the wealthiest residents in New
York state among the 1.3 million people within its boundaries just
east of New York City. Its median annual income of $58,155 is among
the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the county's budgeting say administrators and the
local legislature got into fiscal trouble by going eight of the
past 10 years without raising property taxes. In the meantime,
county expenses and the cost of labor contracts continued to go up.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Nassau County bailout, the Legislature also
agreed to have state taxpayers cover the interest on a 30-year loan
for $45 million to be taken out by Buffalo taxpayers; to allow New
York City to raise its debt ceiling from $7.5 billion to $11.5
billion; and to allow Yonkers to sell $10 million in bonds to share
the costs of a court-ordered desegregation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor said Wednesday the state
has begun to establish a dangerous precedent with bailouts like
those for Nassau County and, a few years ago, the city of Troy.
Whereas in the mid-1970s New York City repaid ''every cent'' of the
borrowing it had to do to pull itself back from the brink of
bankruptcy, the state has come to simply grant large sums of state
taxpayer dollars to troubled municipalities, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it begs the question that has been on everyone's
mind for a year or more: 'What exactly is wrong in Nassau
County?''' Connor told his colleagues in the Senate. ''A lot is
wrong there. What is good is there seems to be a bipartisan effort
to get to that answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor said the state probably has no choice but to intervene in
Nassau County's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat, not only to the taxpayers of Nassau County but to
the whole fiscal structure of the state, is very, very real if one
of our largest counties is permitted to founder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat,
blamed Nassau's problems on ''profligate spending'' and
''inappropriate management'' by county administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said there is a fundamental unfairness in making Buffalo
and Yonkers repay the money they are borrowing while giving Nassau
County state money free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stepping in is one thing, but giving money to the wealthiest
county in the state and one of the wealthiest in the country
without any requirement whatsoever that that money be repaid to the
state of New York is totally inappropriate,'' Grannis said.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County is also facing an ultimatum from Wall Street:
correct its finances by June 30 or face a devaluation of its bond
rating to junk status.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong political overtones to the issue. Republicans
have lost control to Democrats of the state Legislature in Nassau
County, apparently due to the financial morass, for the first time
since World War I. Republicans in the Senate need to return several
members from the county to their chamber this November to maintain
the GOP's majority in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 11, Rangers 10  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Delino DeShields singled home the winning run
in the bottom of the ninth inning as the Baltimore Orioles handed
the Texas Rangers their seventh straight defeat, 11-10 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles blew a 5-0 lead built on Albert Belle's 12th career
grand slam, then rallied from a 10-6 deficit with a four-run
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' losing streak is its longest since a seven-game skid in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The see-saw game lasted 3 hours, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken led off the ninth with a single against Tim Crabtree
(1-3). After John Wetteland replaced Crabtree and Brady Anderson
ran for Ripken, Will Clark flied out and Charles Johnson walked.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields then lined a single to right, and Anderson easily
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin (2-1) pitched a perfect ninth for the Orioles, who
won their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore tied the game in the eighth when Rich Amaral hit a
two-run single off Mike Venafro before B.J. Surhoff hit a two-run,
two-out single off Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez hit his 22nd homer and also had two doubles in a
seven-run fourth inning that gave Texas a 7-5 lead. David Segui hit
a three-run homer in the fourth, the second time in five games that
Baltimore yielded seven runs in an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's first grand slam since 1997 gave the Orioles a 4-0 lead
before Texas starter Kenny Rogers recorded an out. But Rogers
settled down and was in position to win his third straight decision
before the Rangers' bullpen collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played in a driving mist that made fielding
difficult and caused many in the announced crowd of 39,231 to leave
well before the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-0, the Rangers sent 12 men to the plate in the fourth
inning. Rodriguez doubled and Rafael Palmeiro walked before Segui
hit his eighth homer on a 3-2 count. After Texas loaded the bases
with one out, Jason Johnson replaced Pat Rapp and yielded an RBI
single to Luis Alicea, a sacrifice fly to Rusty Greer and a two-run
double to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez made it 8-5 in the seventh, driving the second pitch
from Luis Mercedes over the wall in center. Surhoff hit a solo
homer in the Orioles' half.
</P>
<P>
   Texas used sacrifice flies by Frank Catalanotto and Greer to go
up 10-6 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Alicea left in the fourth inning with discomfort in his
groin and Segui left in the seventh after fouling a ball off his
foot. Both are listed day-to-day ... Belle's homer was his 11th,
the fifth in his last 11 games. ... Surhoff batted third for the
first time since May 27. His homer was his 100th with Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Boyd Breaks Hand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies reliever Jason Boyd
broke a bone on his pitching hand when he slammed his glove on the
bench in the dugout after a poor outing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd gave up five runs in 2-3 of an inning in an 8-1 loss to the
Florida Marlins. He allowed three hits and three walks after
entering the game with Philadelphia trailing 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd was taken to a hospital after the game and appears to be
headed for the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander is 0-1 with a 6.05 ERA.
