EDITORIAL: OVER THE HORIZON IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   Summer is still a month away, but next winter is already
starting to drive decisions about the war in Yugoslavia. The logic
is inescapable: either hundreds of thousands of displaced ethnic
Albanians need to be safely resettled in Kosovo before freezing
temperatures return to the Balkans or the United States and its
allies must winterize refugee encampments in Albania and Macedonia
and help Montenegro do the same. If the combination of air power
and diplomacy fail to make repatriation possible soon, NATO will
quickly have to confront some hard decisions, including whether to
retain the option of using ground troops later this year to evict
Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar is inflexible. Harsh weather in the region,
especially in the mountains, comes as early as October or November.
If refugee camps are to be made habitable for the winter,
construction work must begin in June. If NATO wants to keep open
the possibility of invading Kosovo before snow and ice make
military operations extremely difficult, the alliance must start to
assemble the soldiers, tanks and other weapons now. It will take
two to three months to get an adequate land force in place.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the pace of diplomacy is picking up and debate about
the possible use of ground troops is intensifying, with Britain
pressing for an invasion, Germany resisting and Washington
wavering. Without strong American leadership, crucial decisions may
be deferred or fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it would be preferable to reach a political settlement
that allows the safe return of the refugees and the presence of a
well-armed international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Despite the
recent political turmoil in Moscow, Russian and American diplomats
are refining a deal that can be brought to the United Nations
Security Council. Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, discussed
the proposals with Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   We continue to believe that NATO bombing will eventually compel
Milosevic to support a political settlement that is acceptable to
NATO. If the parties can agree on the composition of a peacekeeping
force and a timetable for the withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo, other elements of an agreement would likely fall into
place. But if the negotiations falter or fail, NATO should have
other options available.
</P>
<P>
   Unless President Clinton and the nation have already concluded
that ground forces should never be used in this war, which does not
seem to be the case, preparations for an invasion should move
ahead. The gathering of an invasion force in the region would
itself brace Milosevic, and many of the NATO units could be used
for peacekeeping if the war ends during the buildup. The presence
of a robust ground force in the area does not mean it has to be
used, but the absence of one makes the invasion threat meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for winter housing for the refugees should also be
advancing. Heated shelter for hundreds of thousands of people
cannot be thrown up overnight. Moving ethnic Albanians to Western
Europe and America can help, but will not solve the problem. It may
not seem like it, but the time for making critical decisions is
rapidly approaching.

RESEARCH CONFIRMS ERROR IN BROKERAGE'S FILING OF DST STOCK
PURCHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It took a week and a lot of checking, but the
folks at Salomon Smith Barney confirmed Wednesday that they never
really owned 16.3 percent of DST Systems Inc., the Kansas
City-based mutual fund services firm.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to a computer-coding error.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, SSB FvLH &LR; m9agement Inc., part of Citigroup's Salomon
Smith Barney, reported publicly that it owned more than 10 million
shares of DST. The filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission was the first anyone had heard that Salomon Smith Barney
had put $560 million into DST stock.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Heckmann, an analyst at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas
City, immediately became suspicious of the filing, which had come
the day before DST's annual shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned how Salomon Smith Barney could have accumulated so
many DST shares in such short order. The daily trading volume
wasn't big enough, he said. The buying would have driven the stock
price sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   Heckmann even ruled out the unlikely possibility that Kansas
City Southern Industries Inc., a large DST shareholder, had
arranged a private sale of DST stock to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Heckmann's doubts grew stronger after word from Ken Hager, DST's
chief financial officer, that Salomon Smith Barney's institutional
buyers hadn't been in touch with the company. Heckmann said he
couldn't believe anyone would take such a big position in a company
without long talks with management.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Connie Kain, a vice president with SSB Citi Asset
Management Group, passed along confirmation from the company that
the filing represented holdings in the Smith Barney Mutual Funds.
She also promised to get a reporter an interview with the analyst
behind the decision to buy 16.3 percent of DST.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kain's search uncovered the error and she called with
the news Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had created the filing on a computer using a dummy
account, she said. The document was a test of the systems that
create the electronic SEC filings. But someone mistakenly put
genuine coding on the false document and it made its way to the
SEC, Kain said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the funds own less than 1 percent of DST shares, Kain
said. A corrected filing went to the SEC on Tuesday, and Kain said
a letter of apology was on its way to DST.
</P>
<P>
   DST officials, naturally, were caught unaware by the first
filing. But Hager said Wednesday that the corrected filing had
cleared up the situation.

TWO SUFFER THROUGH, FOR LOVE OF `STAR WARS' NUTS 
</HEADLINE>

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Karyn Walch and I are Star Wars soulmates.
That is, neither of us wanted to see it on opening night. There we
were, though. Karyn stood in line for 10 hours to buy tickets to
``The Phantom Menace,'' the newest (and oldest) Star Wars movie.
She had never seen any of the Star Wars movies. Still, she stood in
line for 10 hours because, well, she loves her husband very, very
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' a guy in line behind her said as he noticed someone
dressed up like a Star Wars character, ``that's a nice light saber.
I'd sure like one like that.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't know Karyn, a real-estate agent in town, but you may
have seen her husband, Rob. He was the one dressed as Obi-Wan
Kenobi on the front page of The Kansas City Star Wednesday. This
was in the moments before the first showing of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, my wife, Margo, was dressed as some sort of
wide-ranging, ambiguous Star Wars character, with a cape and a hood
and sandals. Between them was a stranger with his face painted to
look either like a professional wrestler or The Phantom Menace
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Around us, people began to have duels with their light sabers in
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Karyn and I just looked at each other and wondered what strange
roads had brought us here.
</P>
<P>
   There are three kinds of Star Wars people. The first could not
care less. Maybe they've seen one or two of the movies, maybe not,
but it doesn't matter because, to them, it's all some weird cult
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' they will tell you, perhaps with a touch of an English
accent, ``I'm not really a science fiction person.''
</P>
<P>
   The second group likes Star Wars just fine. Cute movies. She has
a crush on Harrison Ford, he has a thing for Princess Leia, the
music's good, the special effects are fun, whatever. It's all fun.
</P>
<P>
   That's my camp.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I married outside of my Star Wars culture. So did
Karyn. So we stood there, clinging to spouses, standing among 800
people outside the Glenwood Theatre who had eD

COURT INVOKES `DUCK' PRINCIPLE _ AND MICROSOFT COULD FOOT THE
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A federal appellate court has waded into ``If it looks
like a duck, if it walks like a duck...'' territory, and the
ripples promise to spread throughout the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether thousands of Microsoft ``permatemps'' _
temporary agency workers who have worked at Microsoft for a long
time _ should be eligible for company stock options available to
Microsoft employees.
</P>
<P>
   A court in California said last week that eligible permatemps
should be able to participate in Microsoft's employee stock
purchase plan, which provides a 15 percent discount on stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel drew on earlier court decisions that said
temp workers should be considered employees by ``common law.'' That
definition covers temps who have been on the same job for five
months or more and ard0substantially trained, supervised or
recruited by the company where they work, instead of byuwe staffing
service that signs their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Except for different-colored name tags, sources say you would
have trouble distinguishing Microsoft employees from Microsoft
temps. They look, walk and act like the same ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, certain to be appealed by Microsoft, could involve
big bucks. Microsoft could take a $20 million hit if forced to
extend employee benefits to up to 10,000 of its permatemps, current
and former.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the permatemps could profit handsomely.
Consider: The chief economist for the state of Washington, home to
Microsoft headquarters, says the average earnings of Microsoft
employees who exercised stock options last year were nearly
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Is that ducky, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, different vested interests in the workplace are
lining up for or against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services
issued a statement that the decision was unfair because it flew in
the face of the staffing service contracts signed by Microsoft and
its temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Employment Law Project said the decision was fair
because workers who do the same jobs should be treated the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   When the case finishes percolating through the judicial system,
the outcome will affect Microsoft the most, but all employers who
hire temporary workers should pay attention. That's a lot of people
and places. The temporary-staffing industry places about 3 million
temps in the U.S. workplace every day.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of temp employment stretches beyond high-tech
industries, where temps are a cost-effective and flexible way to
staff up for new projects. Temps are easy to let go when the
project is finished or when sales slide.
</P>
<P>
   While on board, though, temps are not necessarily cheaper than
employees. They often earn more per hour than their employee
counterparts, and the employer pays a premium to the staffing
agency that placed them.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether the decision stands and whether it is
interpreted narrowly or broadly. Meanwhile, it has put, shall we
say, a quack in the wall separating employee and temp workers.

SPENDING WATCHDOG COMMENDS ASHCROFT'S PORK-FREE LEGISLATIVE DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri can claim he's
perfect this morning and get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   A watchdog group in favor of cutting government waste and
keeping taxes low will announce Thursday that Ashcroft is the only
member of the Senate to get a 100 percent rating on various 1998
spending votes. Two senators got 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste annually
selects as ``Taxpayer Heroes'' members of the Senate and House who
score at least 80 percent in votes it deems to be of particular
taxpayer interest.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ``hero'' besides Ashcroft in the Missouri or
Kansas delegation is fellow Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of
Kansas, who scored 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total surprise to me,'' Ashcroft said. ``I hope people
respect the commitment I've made as governor and as senator to keep
taxes low.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft served two terms as governor and faces a challenge from
the current governor, Mel Carnahan, in his bid for re-election next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's political adviser, Roy Temple, said he didn't know
much about the ranking, but he noted that the National Journal
magazine reported in January that no one in the Senate had a more
conservative voting record than Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Against Government Waste evaluated votes on 20
Senate issues in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Ashcroft has been a leader in stopping pork barrel
politics and in this age of so-called budget surpluses it's very
easy for politicians to spend every penny they can get their hands
on,'' said Aaron Taylor, an organization spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Against Government Waste was founded in 1984 as a
spinoff of President Reagan's drive to cut wasteful spending, but
it is not a Republican organization, Taylor said. Its president,
Thomas A. Schatz, used to work for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had an average rating of 70 percent, compared with
18 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri got a 63 percent rating and
Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas got 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   House members were ranked on 28 votes from 1998. In Missouri,
Rep. Karen McCarthy, a Kansas City Democrat, received an 18 percent
rating. Reps. Richard Gephardt and William Clay, St. Louis area
Democrats, got zero.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy spokesman Phil Scaglia said such ratings are hard to
gauge in that last month McCarthy got a 72 percent rating _ the
best in the Missouri delegation _ from the Concord Coalition, a
bipartisan group that advocates fiscal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The government waste group gave a rating of 29 percent to Rep.
Ike Skelton of Lexington, Mo., and 50 percent to Rep. Pat Danner of
Kansas City, North. Both are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Vince Snowbarger of Johnson County, a Republican
defeated for re-election by Democrat Dennis Moore in November, got
a rating of 82 percent, the highest in the four-member Kansas House
delegation.

NEW TREATMENT CAN STAVE OFF COLD SYMPTOMS, BUT IT'S FAR FROM A
CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nasal spray that stops a cold dead in its tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, but don't put away your boxes of Kleenex just yet.
</P>
<P>
   A study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association found that an experimental drug sniffed as a nasal
spray or powder can reduce cold symptoms by almost half.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the researchers themselves are ready to stir hopes
of a cure just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not close,'' said Frederick Hayden of the University of
Virginia Health Sciences Center in Charlottesville. ``This is
really just a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug in question, tremacamra, serves as a decoy that keeps
cold viruses from attacking the body. Instead of latching onto
cells and doing damage, the virus binds harmlessly to molecules of
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden and researchers at the Medical University of South
Carolina in Charleston recruited about 200 healthy men and women
and isolated them in hotel rooms. About half sniffed a tremacamra
nasal spray or powder six times a day for seven days. The rest got
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers gave the subjects nosedrops containing a rhinovirus,
the most common type of cold virus, either before taking tremacamra
or shortly after treatment had begun. Most of the subjects got
colds.
</P>
<P>
   But those who received tremacamra rated their symptoms about
half as severe. And their nasal secretions _ weighed by collecting
all their used tissues into plastic bags _ were about half as
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said the study shows the drug works, in principle. But
some doctors remain skeptical about its practical application.
</P>
<P>
   ``This therapy is innovative, but the results aren't
breathtakingly dramatic,'' said Michael Luchi, an infectious
disease expert at the University of Kansas Medical Center. ``I
don't consider this a major breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   There are quite a few more steps, Luchi said, between this
experiment and a useful treatment:
</P>
<P>
   - Tremacamra has been tested against one rhinovirus, but there
are about 100 such viruses. Hayden believes the drug should be
effective against most of the rest. But rhinoviruses account for
only 40 percent of colds. Tremacamra promises no protection against
other types of cold viruses.
</P>
<P>
   - Tremacamra was tested on people before they developed cold
symptoms. It's unclear whether it would help someone with a
full-blown cold.
</P>
<P>
   - Taking tremacamra as often as the test subjects did is
impractical. Hayden believes it would have to be taken at least
daily through cold season to be effective.

POLICE SEE MORE REPORTS OF SUSPECTED RAPES AFTER DRUG INGESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City police lately have heard the same
story too often: At a bar, a young woman accepts a drink from a man
she has just met. They dance. Then the woman becomes dizzy and
blacks out. The next day she awakes in a strange place. She
suspects she's been raped. But can't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Sex crimes detectives think they know what happened: A man
slipped a drug into her drink and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Similar crimes have garnered national attention in recent years,
but police in Kansas City started noticing reports of drug-rapes
last fall, said Sgt. Jim Keane of the sex crimes unit. Keane said
he had seen two to six reports of the crimes each weekend, mostly
in the Westport, Country Club Plaza and Northland areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories these women are telling are so similar,'' Keane
said. ``They all received a drink from a man at a bar and then have
a gap of time where they can't remember what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane expects to see more cases as the weather warms, college
students return home and patrons crowd local bars.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Overland Park, Kan., and Independence, Mo., have
received similar reports within the past year, but not in the
numbers that Kansas City has recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park police Sgt. Joe Reed said he saw about five such
reports last year and one this year. Independence counted three
such cases in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we didn't see any problems like this,''
Independence Sgt. Gregg Wilkinson said. ``But now I can think of
three recent cases. You also have to understand that for every rape
reported, there are about 10 that aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' advocates said women, who suspect they were drugged and
raped, rarely make a report to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen about 10 women in this type of situation over the
last two years,'' said Michelle Paynter of the Metropolitan
Organization to Counter Sexual Assault. ``Most of them did not go
to a hospital or report it to police. They are just so
self-blaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when women report the case, proving a crime is difficult.
Some victims wait too long to report a crime, plus their memories
are hazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people can give us almost no leads at all,'' Keane said.
Few, if any, cases ever reach the prosecutor's office, because
there isn't enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Police and rape victim advocates are trying to educate women and
hospital workers about preserving evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``To detect these drugs, we need a urine sample,'' said Linda
Netzel, senior criminalist at the Kansas City Crime Lab. ``If
nurses don't know to ask for that and they take blood or no samples
at all, we lose the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tests conducted on women who have reported such incidents
have shown evidence of sexual intercourse. None have shown the
presence of the common drugs used to take advantage of women.
</P>
<P>
   With the threat of drug-rapes in Kansas City, police want to
warn women to change their habits at bars, parties and even at
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the victims have said, `But he looked like a nice guy,'
'' Keane said. ``I don't know what they think a rapist looks like.
Just because a man looks nice doesn't mean he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane said women should watch their drinks as closely as they do
their purses and should never accept drinks from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate women have to act this way, but they aren't
safe out there anymore,'' Keane said. ``Any nice guy you see in a
tavern could be a rapist.''

<P>
   Frisby, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission Northwest High
School, starts each school year by explaining to parents what their
children will learn: the habits, physical characteristics and life
processes of plants and animals, and evolution, to explain how
those processes developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without evolution, the building will fall down,'' Frisby said.
``It's the cornerstone of biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisby is adamant that the Christian belief in a universe
created by God has no place in his science classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Frisby's brightest students, 14-year-old Heather
Ellsworth, sees evolutionary theory as so much hogwash. She
believes God alone created the earth and everything on it, just as
the Bible says.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers take a low-key approach to teaching evolution, the
scientific theory that living things share common ancestors but
change over time. Others, such as Frisby, emphasize it.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of this discussion are Kansas' new science
curriculum standards. The version written by a state committee
would declare evolution one of five concepts that unite all
scientific disciplines. A competing proposal presented by a
conservative state school board member would remove the emphasis on
evolutionary theory and question its validity.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member Kansas Board of Education, split evenly down
conservative-moderate lines, is struggling to find consensus
between the two ideas. The courts and many in the science
community, including Frisby, say those ideas are mutually exclusive
inside science classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   On Heather's first day in freshman biology, Frisby told his
class that evolution holds the underpinnings for the life sciences.
After class, Heather approached him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mr. Frisby, I don't agree with evolution,' '' Heather
remembered. ``He said, `Let's agree to disagree.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And they've been disagreeing agreeably all year long. Frisby
hasn't changed his lessons to accommodate Heather's beliefs,
although last fall he did attend a creation science workshop at the
invitation of Heather's father.
</P>
<P>
   Heather hasn't changed her mind, either, but she answers test
questions on evolution by the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with that,'' said the Rev. Phil Ellsworth,
Heather's father and pastor of the evangelical Grace Christian
Fellowship Church in Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   Could this truce be the kind of middle ground that Kansas Board
of Education members are looking for?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Scharmann thinks it might be.
</P>
<P>
   As an education professor at Kansas State University, Scharmann
tells future teachers they should not present theories such as
evolution in ways that polarize their students. Teachers needs to
realize that students, like everyone else, value the beliefs
they've learned from their families and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trying to beat that out of them,'' Scharmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding doesn't mandate belief, Scharmann said. Science
teachers taking a realistic view of their students know this, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Students) don't have to believe these theories, just know how
to use them,'' Scharmann said. ``Evolution, like all good
scientific theories, is an excellent problem-solving tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The science standards that have revived the debate determine
what Kansas students will learn and be tested on.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, written by a state committee appointed in part by
the state board, are based on guidelines from national science
associations. Evolution takes a leading role, and that's what led
to the alternate proposal put forth by conservative board member
Steve Abrams of Arkansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' version would change the definition of science,
eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add to the
glossary a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and
complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has said the intent of his proposal is partly to allow
school districts the freedom to decide how to handle teaching
evolution. That's similar to the way the Missouri curriculum
standards work, said Orlo Shroyer, Missouri's assistant
commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over evolution is nothing new for members of the
Shawnee Mission Northwest science department.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the school's science test scores dipped
because teachers were avoiding evolutionary theory, said Robert
Siemens, the department chairman. So the department beefed up its
approach to evolution, Siemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a few students and parents objected to a mural in the
science hall depicting the evolution of humans from an apelike
creature to modern man. The mural remains, but the teachers wonder
for how long.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, the science standards are causing much
discussion, at least among the science faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers know that some students don't believe evolution
occurred. Although most of Siemens' students realize the theory has
a place in science classrooms, there always are a few who ask to be
excused from learning about evolution, saying it goes against their
religious belief in creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them have been taught that they have to believe one
or the other,'' Siemens said. ``And that's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Siemens and Frisby always end their units on evolution by
assigning students a paper on the origin of life. The assignment
gives students the chance to defend their beliefs, and some always
choose to write on creation.
</P>
<P>
   Frisby said that this year he has more students _ about 40
percent _ who don't accept evolution. One parent has offered
nm &LR; bate Frisby on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Ellsworth said she understands that Frisby has to
teac(AIY &QC; 1ution as the theory accepted by the majority of
scientists. Her father, Phil Ellsworth, said he's confident his
daughter won't be swayed from her basic religious belief that God
created the world.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ellsworths believe there's room in the science classroom
for more than one theory on the origin of life. But Frisby
adamantly disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm putting my face up against a brick wall,''
Frisby said. ``If there's no evolution, I can't teach. I can't
compromise.''

GIULIANI SNUBS CLINTON'S VISIT FOR RAIL HUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton flew to New York on Wednesday to
join Republican and Democratic leaders in celebrating a $484
million proposal to transform the General Post Office on Eighth
Avenue into a new Pennsylvania Station. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
boycotted the ceremony, disparaging both the cost and the scope of
a project that has gathered wide support among New York political
and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the visit to announce that he would ask Congress to
provide $60 million for the project, which has been championed by
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who attended the ceremony on
Wednesday. The design of the new station, with a soaring glass and
steel roof, is reminiscent of the original Pennsylvania Station,
which was considered a fine example of 20th century neo-classical
design. It was torn down 36 years ago. Officials said that an
additional $60 million is still needed for the project, an amount
Moynihan's aides described as relatively modest.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who spent the morning at City Hall, said he was
skeptical about the financing. He added that he had skipped the
event because he was afraid it would confer legitimacy on something
that should still be on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money isn't in place,'' the mayor said. ``And I don't want
to give the false impression that the money is in place, because
then the city will have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani first began discussing the station project with
reporters on Wednesday, he praised it as a ``really good project.''
But by the time he had finished, he was warning that it would be
plagued by cost overruns. He also said that the project Clinton was
celebrating was less ambitious than had originally been envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer going to have an entrance and exit on Eighth
Avenue _ it's going to be in the middle of the block in an
alleyway,'' Giuliani said. ``So it's a different project. I think
there's value to the project, but I don't want the city to have to
bear the big burden of paying for this.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Giuliani's complaints are unlikely to
jeopardize the project, even though they clearly annoyed some
officials involved in planning Wednesday's event. To date, New York
City has contributed just $25 million to the project, and
Moynihan's aides said that they would find the rest of the money
elsewhere if Giuliani declined to contribute more.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, several Democrats and Republicans
suggested that Giuliani's decision to skip the event had saved him
from appearing on a stage with public figures whom he might prefer
to avoid, including Gov. George Pataki, with whom he has quarreled
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's absence was apparent the moment Clinton strolled onto
the stage, which was set up in an old mail-sorting room at the
James A. Farley Post Office, with Moynihan and Pataki behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was represented by an adviser who sat not with Clinton
on stage but in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Tony Bullock, Moynihan's chief of staff, disputed Mr.
Giuliani's complaints about the financing, as well as his
prediction that it could end up costing as much as $600 million.
Bullock also said that he was not worried about finding the
remaining funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will finish this project,'' Bullock said. ``It is very,
very close now to getting final approval. We're counting on the
mayor's support and additional assistance as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The president used much of his speech to pay tribute to
Moynihan, who seemed moved each time the audience rose to applaud
and cheer him. Indeed, Wednesday's event seemed as much to pay
tribute to Moynihan, who announced last year that he would retire
at the end of 2000, as to rally support for the new station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Moynihan has been called the nation's best thinker
among politicians since Lincoln, and its best politician among
thinkers since Jefferson,'' Clinton said of the senator, with whom
he has frequently disagreed over the last seven years. ``Today we
might say he also may be the best arm-twister since Farley.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ It's easy to overlook the pitching on a team that
averages almost six runs per game, and that appears to be what's
happening to a trio of Astros starters who quietly have established
themselves among the best in the National League so far in 1999.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it never fails; any analysis of the Astros includes
questions about their pitching and highlights the fact they don't
have a dominant No. 1 starter. The Astros no doubt will continue to
be lumped in with the contending teams that hope to add a starting
pitcher at the trading deadline, but general manager Gerry
Hunsicker is hardly a man in search of starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of hearing that,'' Hunsicker said.
``Statistically, we have the best pitching staff in the National
League, and it's an insult to the pitchers we have when people keep
saying that we need an ace. Well, we had one (Randy Johnson) last
year, and we didn't get past the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many No. 1s are out there? Probably four or five. Would I
like to have one of those five? Sure. But I like the guys we have,
too, and I like the challenge of competing without the high-profile
guy that everyone says we are lacking. That makes it extra
satisfying when we quietly keep winning while everyone else is
debating what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday night's game against the Dodgers, the Astros'
starting pitchers led all NL starters with a 20-10 record and a
3.94 ERA. Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton and Jose Lima are the three
most responsible for those numbers. They have 18 wins among them
and a cumulative ERA of 3.12. They may not be aces, but each is a
strong card to play every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't ask for anything more from those guys,'' manager
Larry Dierker said. ``Then again, those guys have been doing it for
a while now, so we can realistically expect them to keep pitching
this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they really think of themselves as No. 1
starters, and in a way, that's good. I think that creates some
internal competition. But at the same time none of them has to
carry the burden of being the No. 1 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Tony Eusebio has seen the best starters in
baseball from the perspective of a hitter, and he doesn't believe
the Astros' Big Three have to take a back seat to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, they're right up there with the best in the
league,'' Eusebio said. ``No other club has three pitchers throwing
as well as they are right now. When they pitch, we know we have a
good chance to win the game, and that's all you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   If the All-Star team had to be picked today, Padres manager
Bruce Bochy, who will manage the NL stars, would have to give
strong consideration to each of the Astros' aces-in-waiting. Lima
is tied for the NL lead with seven wins, Reynolds was just a
victory off the pace entering Wednesday's start, and Hampton's 2.80
ERA ranks among the NL leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Hampton isn't quite ready to put the Astros' starters on par
with Atlanta's Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz, although
the Astros trio has outpitched the Braves' triumvirate of Cy Young
Award winners in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we complement each other very well, but it's so
early,'' Hampton said. ``We all pull for each other, and we all
want to be considered `the man.' If there's a losing streak that
needs to be stopped, each one of us wants to be the guy to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not just me, Shane and Lima; that's Sean Bergman and
Chris Holt, too. Each of us is off to a good start, but that
doesn't mean anything right now. As long as we have the best record
in the NL Central at the end of the year, that's the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is any indication of the type of starting pitching that
can be expected from the Astros for the remainder of the season,
winning the NL Central is a modest goal.

OBA CARR: ONE MAN, ONE FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR CITY, Calif. _ Oba Carr walks the treadmill at the Big
Bear Fitness Gym, his sturdy posture exuding strength. All around,
men and women pump iron, jump rope and hit the heavy bag. But Carr
barely notices. He gazes straight ahead, his steely eyes
transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's singular focus in recent weeks has been Oscar De La Hoya,
whom Carr will challenge Saturday in Las Vegas for the World Boxing
Council welterweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya admits he has trained hard for only the past four
weeks. Carr has been at it for eight. While De La Hoya and promoter
Bob Arum have been dismissing Carr by openly negotiating for a
title defense against Felix Trinidad, Carr has thought only about
De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   It all provides incentive for Carr.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Carr's third shot at a major title, but his first
with his father serving as his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Carr, who has otherwise trained Oba for his entire amateur
and pro career, was replaced for two years by promoter Don King,
who signed Oba in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry? Oba Carr is starving. And heaven help De La Hoya if he
is looking past him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid; it's ridiculous,'' Carr said. ``Hopefully, they
are overlooking me. If they are, they're going to get knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is doing nothing but getting me hungrier. It keeps me
more consistent. It keeps me focused on my objective. They must be
thinking I have some character disorder or something. I don't have
no disorder about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) is in better mental _ or,
as he calls it, spiritual _ shape than ever. He survived the rigors
of two years with King and said he came out the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   Against his father's wishes, Carr _ who turned pro in 1989 at 17
_ signed with King in 1994. King fired Eddie Carr as trainer and
brought in a slew of different trainers to work with Oba.
</P>
<P>
   When Carr, 27, fought for Trinidad's IBF welterweight title in
1994, he was just 22. He floored Trinidad in the second round, but
Trinidad rebounded and stopped him in eight. Panama Lewis was
Carr's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Carr, at 24, fought and lost a unanimous decision to
Ike Quartey, then the WBA welterweight champion. Stacey McKinley
trained Carr for that bout, his last with King.
</P>
<P>
   Back came Eddie Carr, who wishes he could have trained his son
for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don King and his crew, they came up with all these different
trainers,'' Eddie Carr said. ``In a fight with Trinidad, they would
rather have Panama Lewis in his corner. His English wasn't even
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult time for Oba. He doesn't blame Lewis,
McKinley or King for his losses to Trinidad and Quartey, however.
He blames his own immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   Carr describes himself as a ``righteous kid'' who never did
drugs and never got in trouble growing up in Detroit. But he wasn't
maturing the way he wanted to. So even though he had to grow up
around King for a while, he views it as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same individual I was when I fought for the
championship at 21, 22,'' he said. ``It's just all about having an
identity, and having peace of mind. You go through adversity, and
make it through that, and of course you are going to be a stronger
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Eddie Carr would have preferred to be with his son
all the way, he also believes Oba benefited from the time away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where, it sounds bad, but in every
bad experience, there's a learning experience,'' Eddie said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oba is hopeful he can put all of his experience to
work in what could be the biggest night of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they are overlooking Oba,'' Eddie Carr said. ``All
the billboards they have printed up just have a picture of Oscar on
it. They didn't even put Oba's picture on it, just his name in
small letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way they feel, they are in for a rude awakening.
See, we feel that the victory is already done in heaven. Now we
just have to do it on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   As confident as Eddie Carr is, his son is even more convinced he
will come out the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fighter in the world as hungry as me,'' Carr said.
``I've been training for eight weeks now, man, and for eight weeks,
every moment, every second, every hour of that eight weeks I have
been completely focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every second of those eight weeks have just been consistently
thinking about becoming world champion. The wickedness, the mad
evil, it's going to be there. Controlled evil.''

 &HT;    WebMD, Healtheon near merger
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD Inc. and Healtheon Corp. were poised late
Wednesday to finally unveil a high-profile merger that could put
the combined company's market value at $16 billion, its name at the
head of the Net's health care class and its headquarters in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for two companies that have yet to report a dollar in
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Internet market,'' said analyst Michele Pelino of
the Yankee Group. ``Almost no one is making money. It's all based
on future expectations and what they will do to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What these two could do is almost instantly become the
best-known Internet health care company, with the deep pockets
needed to brand its name on the consciousness of consumers and
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are dominant, but they'll be the key player
until you see some other alliances,'' Pelino said. ``I think this
gives them a jump on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding muscle is the involvement of Microsoft, which will trade
several hundred million dollars for a stake in the combined
company. The blessing of Microsoft alone can be critical for a new
venture, but the WebMD-Healtheon union will also include strategic
investments with chipmaker Intel and with Excite, an Internet
portal. In April, DuPont agreed to invest $220 million in WebMD
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The two merging companies mesh. Healtheon concentrates on
transactions, especially among insurers and heath care providers.
WebMD, which focused at first on doctors who pay fees, now
emphasizes its consumer side where advertising must pay the
freight.
</P>
<P>
   But both businesses are immature _ to put it mildly. Healtheon
last year had revenue of $48.8 million and reported a $54 million
loss. WebMD had a $7.8 million loss on revenue that was shy of
$100,000. But hype goes hand-in-hand with hope: Health care
accounts for 14 percent of the nation's $6 trillion economy, and if
the Internet grows, health care could be one of its huge segments.
Meanwhile, the Yankee Group estimates that the number of households
online with computers _ now one in four _ will double in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   So the stock valuation of WebMD and Healtheon as of Wednesday
would be the eighth largest among Georgia companies, greater than
that of Delta Air Lines, which last year had revenues of $14.1
billion and a $1 billion profit.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Healtheon rocketed $24.37 1/2 a share to close at
$80.25. With the pending acquisition of MedeAmerica, announced in
April, Healtheon will have about 100 million shares outstanding.
The companies are planning a merger of equals in which new shares
of the combined company would be issued to complete the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Many other pretenders are anxious to cash in on the presumed
Internet payday. Some have name recognition, like the Web sites of
Dr. C. Everett Koop and the Mayo Clinic. Others like Medscape,
Medirisk, Net.Medic, and Atlanta-based Medcast echo the offerings
of WebMD and Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some rivals, WebMD gets most of its content from others,
buying, licensing or linking to it. But WebMD has forged a series
of deals that are putting its name in the places where Net surfers
go, including previous agreements with Lycos and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based adam.com, another health care site focused on
consumers, believes the merger does not signal the endgame for
competitors, said company CEO Robert Cramer. ``Owning content _
especially proprietary medical and health content _ is a very
strong position to be in and nobody owns content like adam.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of adam.com rose 25 percent to close at a 52-week high of
$23.75.
</P>
<P>
   Choice of Atlanta as headquarters seems to follow the decision
to market the combined company as WebMD and make WebMD's founder,
Jeffrey Arnold, chief executive. However, there are no plans to
move Healtheon's more than 600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has apparently made peace with James Clark, a bitter
rival when he ran Netscape and now Healtheon's chairman. Clark will
remain with the combined company, although probably surrendering
the chairman's post to Michael Long, Healtheon CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that his presence was a sticking point,
WebMD's President and Chief Operating Officer Jay Gilbertson will
probably stay in some operational role.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will make a number of individuals rich _ at least on
paper _ and also swell the coffers of some corporate shareholders.
For example, corporate filings show that Premiere Technologies owns
about 12 percent of WebMD, whose office is in the same building. At
Wednesday's closing price, that share could be worth nearly $1
billion. Premiere's CEO, Boland Jones, sits on the WebMD board and
holds about 13 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold owns about 21.5 percent of WebMD, which would be worth
$1.72 billion by Wednesday's valuation.

EDITORIAL: PLANNING FOR GREATNESS TO COME

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   There are not enough names for the emotions that great
architecture inspires, and as a result the names of buildings
themselves become shorthand for the complex impressions they leave
behind. Grand Central is one name for many feelings, and so, in a
different key, is the United States Custom House and Rockefeller
Center. These constructions are a homage to reason, to the
constraints of site and the possibilities of engineering. But they
also allude to the human susceptibility to space, to the way
remarkable buildings remodel the emotional interior of the humans
who pass among them.
</P>
<P>
   The new Penn Station in Manhattan may well become such a
building. Its design, by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, was unveiled by President Clinton on Wednesday morning in
a ceremony at the James A. Farley postal building on Eighth Avenue.
Since 1963, when Pennsylvania Station was torn down and Madison
Square Garden erected in its place, the Farley building has stood
as the ghostlike twin of an intention the city first fulfilled, in
the original station, and then defiled. Now that intention is
revivified. There is no rebuilding the original McKim, Mead &AMP; White
Penn Station. But it is possible to re-embody something of its
spirit, to make the sacrifice of the original station, which
brought about the birth of the Landmarks Preservation Commission,
almost tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   In his reworking of the Farley Building, part of which was
designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, Childs has kept many of the grand
attributes of the old Penn Station _ unbroken vistas, the
interpenetration of light and loftiness on an enormous scale. But
rather than reconstruct the steel and glass roof that rose over the
concourse, and was invisible from the street, Childs has taken a
new departure. He has designed an arching glass and metal roof that
curves upward over the main entrance on 33d Street. It is as though
he had taken the concourse roof from the old station _ an open web
of steel and glass _ smoothed it out, and stood it on its side. It
will suggest to passersby, more than the facade of the original
Penn Station could, something of the grandness that lies within.
</P>
<P>
   A moment will come when the new Penn Station, nearly finished in
2003, will stand opposite Madison Square Garden and the banal
subterranean station that replaced McKim, Mead &AMP; White's building.
It will be one of those moments when two distinct paths through
urban history become visible side by side. One path is essentially
time-serving, a version of modernity in which the individual human
experience of space is considered insignificant, irrelevant to the
perception of the city as a whole. The other path, embodied by many
buildings still standing in New York and by the plans for a new
Penn Station, is one in which a person passing through them, or
within their shadows, finds something unexpected being kindled. It
does not happen to everyone every day. But it happens often to many
people, to tourists and commuters alike, and when it does it makes
a civic difference. &QL;

SCHROEDER'S BLUNT `NO' TO GROUND TROOPS REFLECTS DEPTH OF GERMAN
SENSITIVITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Schroeder's comments in
Brussels, Pickup 6th graf pvs, Ever since ...; SUBS grafs on
Chernomyrdin meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade, nothing made
public; now 2 takes.)

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The categorical declaration Wednesday by Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder that Germany would not countenance a NATO ground
war in Kosovo reflected the sensitivities of a country for which
even bombing Yugoslavia has already stretched political
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Schroeder lambasted
the debate in Britain over sending ground troops into Kosovo,
declaring, ``I am against any change of NATO strategy.'' He
reiterated the position in an interview with German television,
saying: ``It is my view that we will not deploy ground troops in
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder made his comments as senior officials from the Group
of Seven wealthiest nations and Russia met in Bonn to try to build
on a statement earlier this month that called for the deployment in
Kosovo of international ``civil and security presences'' and the
withdrawal of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued on May 6, marked the first time since the
bombing began two months ago that Russia and the West had spoken
with one voice. But it left open several contentious issues,
including the composition of any international force, the
circumstances under which NATO bombing would stop, and whether all
Serbian forces have to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Schroeder, said
a minimum of two weeks would be needed to overcome differences
between Russia and the West, and to bring the Yugoslav government
``to the level of vulnerability where it will agree to our
demands.'' He said the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia is likely to
continue at least until the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's remarks, in a telephone interview, reflected a German
conviction that the NATO policy of bombing combined with diplomacy
will work if given time, and that any suggestion of changing
strategy to using ground troops would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The German view, critical because Schroeder has been
coordinating the European response to the war, reflected historical
and political factors that make Germany's position unique, and
appear to limit NATO's options.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since World War II, the maxim that ``only peace'' would go
out from German soil has amounted to a mantra, repeated by
governments of the left and right alike. German participation in
the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia therefore amounts to a huge
departure, after which ground troops appear as a step too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``By German standards, the change of policy has already been
extensive and radical,'' said Karl Kaiser, a political analyst.
``We have come a huge distance in a short time, and managed to
bring public opinion along. But for the government, ground troops
would be too much at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support for the war has declined to 51 percent from 61
percent a month ago, according to an opinion poll published last
week.
</P>
<P>
   As the tide of opinion has begun to shift, the Green Party,
junior partners in Schroeder's government, has become more forceful
in seeking an end to the bombing, calling last week for a pause in
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting strains in the coalition are such that it appears
probable that any eventual NATO decision to use ground troops would
bring down the first ``Red-Green'' government of the modern German
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the German position is that the main
opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, has
up to now supported the NATO bombing, opening the way for a
bi-partisan approach that would be reassuring to a country still
alarmed by the prospect of internal divisions over a European war.
But the Christian Democrats, the party of former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, has said it will oppose a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not weaken on the military side, but equally we must
not change strategy that is making headway,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner spoke as senior officials from the Group of Seven
wealthiest nations and Russia met in Bonn to try to build on a
statement earlier this month that called for the deployment in
Kosovo of international ``civil and security presences'' and the
withdrawal of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued on May 6, marked the first time since the
bombing began two months ago that Russia and the West had spoken
with a single voice. But it left open several contentious issues,
including the composition of any international force, the
circumstances in which NATO bombing would stop, and whether all
Serbian forces have to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the meeting Wednesday, which was attended by
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was not intended to
resolve all those issues, but was part of a process that would
still take some time and should eventually lead to a U.N. Security
Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One basic difference remaining is the Russian and Chinese
insistence that NATO's bombing must stop before a diplomatic
solution can be found. This demand is rejected by the United States
and its allies, which insist that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must first accept the deployment of a NATO-coordinated
international force and withdraw his troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Mayorsky, the Russian delegate to the Bonn meeting, said
Wednesday that peace depended on NATO stopping the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution would spell out the conditions for and
perhaps the broad composition of any international force. It would
in effect give such a mission the firm basis in international law
that critics have argued the NATO campaign lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said the diplomatic efforts were focused on a new word:
``synchronization.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, diplomats are looking at the possibility of having
the beginning of a withdrawal of Yugoslav forces coincide with a
provisional halt to NATO bombing, the passing of a U.N. Security
Council resolution, and the start of a deployment of international
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This is a highly complex and time-consuming aim. But if
achieved, it might allow all sides to claim a bit of a victory and
so break the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy to the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin,
traveled to Belgrade Wednesday and held six hours of talks with
Milosevic. Chernomyrdin then returned to Moscow, where he is
expected to brief Talbott and Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish
president.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were immediately available about the content of the
discussions. The Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, said the two men
would meet again in Belgrade early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials have been sending open signals lately of
their readiness to negotiate a peace settlement and to accept the
outlines of an agreement proposed by NATO and the Group of Seven
industrialized nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have decided to coordinate their diplomatic
efforts through the Ahtisaari, who may eventually travel to the
Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from a country that is in the European Union but not in
NATO and, having worked on the conflict in Bosnia for some time, is
familiar with the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains open to question whether NATO will be able to
maintain its unity as that diplomacy moves forward at a modest
pace, and whether Milosevic can be brought to yield to demands that
still include the withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo and a
strong NATO presence there.
</P>
<P>
   That question is particularly acute because Germany's history
insures that one option that might increase pressure on Milosevic _
the use of ground troops _ is highly unlikely to be adopted by
NATO. Or, if it were, Germany would remain on the sidelines, with
unpredictable repercussions.

VIZCAINO PUT ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers utility infielder Jose
Vizcaino figures he overdid his side work Tuesday, taking too many
grounders for his ailing left hamstring to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of missing a few days, Vizcaino will miss a couple
of weeks after being placed on the disabled list Wednesday
(retroactive to Monday) before the Dodgers and Houston Astros
played at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino was listed as day-to-day after injuring his leg running
from third to home in Sunday's loss at St. Louis. He arrived at the
ballpark Wednesday and was unable to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to the stadium and I tried to jog, it was sore,''
said Vizcaino, who's batting .278 with eight RBI in 26 games.
``It's frustrating because I was playing. Especially (Tuesday),
because Eric (Young) was hurt. If I was fine, I would be playing,
and (Wednesday) he's not 100 percent and I would be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes away some of the Dodgers' infield depth. Manager Davey
Johnson likes Vizcaino's versatility, using him at second,
shortstop and third base.
</P>
<P>
   To fill Vizcaino's spot, the Dodgers dipped into the Toronto
Blue Jays farm system and obtained right-handed reliever Doug
Bochtler, another indication the Dodgers are searching for
right-handed answers in their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Bochtler was released by the Dodgers during spring training but
was re-acquired for cash considerations. Asked where the Dodgers
found Bochtler, Johnson seemingly summed up the season's bullpen
blues by saying, `` I don't know. Has he left?''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Bochtler, 28, spent the past seven weeks pitching
for the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse. He went 4-0 with
a 2.63 ERA in 14 appearances with Syracuse. He pitched for three
seasons in San Diego and spent last year with Detroit. He's 9-16
with a 4.45 ERA in four major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that would be an innings guy,'' Johnson said.
``With the (Antonio) Osuna (injury), we thought if he was available
we'd get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, White return: For the first time in eight games the
Dodgers' lineup looked normal. Center fielder Devon White, bothered
by a strained hamstring, played for the first time since May 9. He
batted seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the energetic leadoff hitter for the Dodgers, missed
Tuesday's series opener with Houston after being spiked during the
weekend series in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said White was ready Tuesday but decided to give him an
extra day off. Meanwhile, Johnson waited until Young took some
ground balls at second base prior to Wednesday's batting practice
before filling out his lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get my game back out there,'' said Young, who missed
four games earlier in the month with a strained right calf. ``I
have to go out and get back on track. (If) I'm out there, I'm going
to run. (The ankle) will let me know how much I can do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson backs Perez: Even though Johnson yanked left-hander
Carlos Perez after 31/3 innings Tuesday _ a common early exit
during a Perez start this season _ Johnson said he remains
committed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Perez is concerned,'' Johnson said, ``I'm going to
stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though Johnson has many options. None of the
starters at the minor-league level appears ready and only reliever
Jamie Arnold is suited to making a spot start out of the Dodgers'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who signed a three-year, $15 million contract in the
offseason, is 1-5 with a 6.63 ERA and has been pulled before the
fifth inning of three starts.

EDITORIAL: ONE NATION, FOR RICH AND POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched welfare case, the Supreme Court this week
struck down a California law that discriminated against newcomers
by holding them, for one year, to the benefit levels of the states
from which they had moved. Fourteen other states, including New
York, have similar laws that are now in jeopardy. By implication,
the ruling also negated a provision of the 1996 federal welfare
overhaul approved by Congress that specifically authorized states
to offer disparate benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-to-2 decision powerfully reaffirmed the right of equal
citizenship for rich and poor alike. In essence, it extends the
principle of fairness behind the court's decision three decades ago
in Shapiro vs. Thompson. In that case, the court ruled that denying
welfare benefits to newcomers violated the right to travel implicit
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the court moved beyond the loosely
defined right-to-travel rationale by breathing new life into the
so-called privileges and immunities clause of the 14th Amendment _
a clause providing that ``No state shall make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering the practical arguments raised by California, the
majority opinion cited evidence to show that the state's concern
that its higher benefits would make it a ``welfare magnet'' were
overblown, and that it had other ways to save money on benefits
besides unconstitutional discrimination. ``Citizens of the United
States, whether rich or poor, have the right to choose to be
citizens `of the state wherein they reside,''' wrote Justice John
Paul Stevens for the majority, quoting from the opening sentence of
the 14th Amendment. ``The states, however, do not have any right to
select their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only the second time in this century that the court has
used the privileges and immunities clause to strike down a state
law. In so doing, the court reinforced the ingenious architecture
of the federal system that binds the 50 states into one nation.
Perhaps, too, the decision signaled a new commitment by this court
to protect individual rights.

L.A. WOMAN DISCOVERS LONG-LOST NIECE IN DIRE NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Elated at reaching her sister in Ukraine for the
first time in 25 years, Lioudmila McDonald's joy soon turned to
grief.
</P>
<P>
   A niece she had never met needed open-heart surgery to save her
life, and only surgeons in the United States had the necessary
expertise and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors agreed to donate their services, but now the
teen-ager needs $8,000 to cover other costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much frustration,'' said McDonald, 45, of suburban
Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hope _ hope something is going to go through. And
then, nothing. It would be so much easier to step away, or just
disown her, but I can't do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her niece, Karina Molchasian, already has had two unsuccessful
operations in Ukraine to repair a hole in her heart, a congenital
defect. The condition leaves her constantly tired and breathless.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles doctor volunteered to do the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't fix it, most likely she's going to die from it at
a certain point,'' said Dr. Alfredo Trento, chief of cardiac
surgery for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``At a certain point, it
may be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Trento said a cure for her heart problem would be
routine, not a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heart operation is always a complex operation,'' he said.
``But if that's what it is, a simple hole in the heart, it can
easily be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Valencia-based charity, Healing the Children, secured Trento's
help and found a way to bring Karina here.
</P>
<P>
   But a forbidding obstacle remains _ the hospital needs $8,000 to
defray its costs for supplies used in the operation. Until that's
collected, Karina won't be going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald fled the Soviet Union in 1978. Since then she
continually tried to locate her younger sister. When she finally
reached her in September 1997, McDonald began contacting charities
and hospitals seeking help for her niece, and published a plaintive
letter in a Russian-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from neighbors who have chipped in a few hundred
dollars, results have been scant.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who is a nurse at Cedars-Sinai put McDonald in touch
with Trento, who in turn put her in touch with Healing the Children
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group has 13 chapters nationwide, and started 20
years ago in Spokane, Wash. Since then it has sponsored 65,000
treatments and operations for children overseas and brought 5,000
others to the United States for help, said executive director Cris
Embleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big, fancy organization,'' Embleton said. ``This is
moms and dads who want to help other moms and dads.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the group sends volunteer doctors overseas to operate
on needy children, performing procedures common in this country but
unavailable in those areas. And for operations in the United
States, Healing the Children gets airlines to donate travel
expenses, doctors to volunteer their services and hospitals to
offer six-figure treatments for nominal costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on people reaching out, and we have been so
rewarded,'' Embleton said. ``It's an opportunity to see miracles.''

STATE GOES AFTER BIGGER TARGET WITH E-MAIL `SPAM' SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Another lawsuit has been filed under Washington
state's anti-spam law, but this time it's not against a small-time
operator.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the $6 million lawsuit is a Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   CTX Mortgage, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dallas-based Centex,
flooded a Mount Vernon, Wash., Internet service provider with
misleading junk e-mail, the lawsuit filed in Skagit County Superior
Court alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The first few lawsuits filed under the state's new law banning
fraudulent junk e-mail were filed against much smaller, sometimes
elusive, operators.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the alleged damage in this case also is
significantly worse than in earlier cases, said Brady Johnson,
Seattle attorney for Connect Northwest, a Mount Vernon-based
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said CTX overwhelmed Connect Northwest's network by
sending 5,800 unsolicited e-mail messages April 8 and 9 advertising
home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's anti-spam law, it is illegal to send
unsolicited commercial e-mail with misleading subject lines and
with phony return addresses and false headers hiding the origin of
the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The law provides a $1,000 penalty for each illegal e-mail sent
through an Internet service provider's server. That adds up to $5.8
million if Connect Northwest can prove it received 5,800 illegal
spams.
</P>
<P>
   The CTX spam was illegal in all respects, Johnson said. The
subject line for the messages touting home mortgages said ``a gift
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   CTX apparently used a computer program that generates likely
e-mail addresses, Johnson said. Though some of the addresses are
valid, many are not. For each bad address, Connect Northwest
generated an automatic ``message undeliverable'' response back to
the sender. But since the return address on the mortgage e-mail was
phony, that message was also bounced, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly escalating number of messages were eventually cut
off by filters, but not before bringing down Connect Northwest's
primary and backup mail servers and shutting down service to
customers for a short time. If owner and system administrator Alex
Free had not been present, the service disruption would have been
much worse, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   CTX issued a statement on Wednesday saying it was investigating
the incident. ``What we have learned is that the e-mails in
question represent an isolated incident involving an outside
vendor,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said CTX is trying to ``distance itself'' from its
vendor, which sent the e-mail, but legally should not be let off
the hook for the vendor's alleged misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Free called CTX Mortgage April 8 to notify them that their junk
e-mail was causing problems for his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't seem too concerned,'' Free said, in a prepared
statement. CTX put him in touch with a company lawyer who said he
didn't see any problem with their e-mail campaign, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday CTX, which refused to be interviewed, released its
own response asserting: ``CTX takes the anti-spamming laws
seriously and immediately stopped the activity pending
investigation of this matter. It is contrary to CTX's policy to
make any type of inappropriate solicitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kendall, president of Telebyte Northwest, a Silverdale-based
Internet service provider, was excited at news of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah,'' he said. Kendall is the current president of the
Washington Association of Internet Service Providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lawsuit this major, this is a precedent-setter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said spam is a serious headache for Internet service
providers, and the state's law is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get control of (spam), we're in real danger of
losing the Internet,'' Kendall said. ``It's becoming an avalanche
of garbage that's filling up our e-mail boxes and the e-mail pipe.
Technical solutions will not cure the problem. It will only
mitigate and slow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall estimated that even after Telebyte puts in place filters
and technical fixes, some 10 percent to 20 percent of the e-mail
that comes through Telebyte servers is spam.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis, who has brought two
lawsuits under the law and is close to bringing a third, said,
``The law is doing what it's meant to do if it can be effectively
used by private individuals or, in this case, by an Internet
service provider to protect its own private network.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson brought the state's first suit under the law on behalf
of four individuals last year. But the alleged spammer, a Los
Angeles man, dropped out of sight, and Johnson never could serve
him with the suit. Johnson said Wednesday a private detective found
the man and he will soon be served.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suits filed in state courts under the law has yet
gone to trial. Johnson said he's been eager to resolve some of the
questions about the law in court, and because CTX is a large
company that will defend itself, some of those questions may start
to be cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the law alleged spammers are expected to question
is how difficult it is for them to determine whether recipients of
their e-mail messages are Washington residents.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said in this case, that shouldn't be an issue,
because Connect Northwest states on its home page that all its
subscribers are Washington residents.

RED SOX SHUT OUT YANKEES, 6-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After witnessing a listless performance by Hideki Irabu
and a lethargic effort by the Yankees against a 23-year-old pitcher
who was recalled from Class AAA on Wednesday, Joe Torre might want
to reconsider his decision to return to manage this sputtering
team. It would have been easier for him to watch this torturous
display on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre is back for good two months after undergoing prostate
cancer surgery, and it is his job to inspire and improve the
Yankees, who tumbled to an ugly 6-0 loss to the Red Sox on
Wednesday night at Fenway Park in a game that was delayed by rain
for 73 minutes after the eighth inning before the Yankees bowed out
meekly in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The defending World Series champions have lost seven of their
last eight games and have not played like a club that was deemed
one of the best teams in baseball history last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spoiled last year,'' Torre said. ``We didn't have any
malfunctions. Someone is going to take a beating soon. Tonight it
was us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a series in which the Yankees proved
something to the Red Sox and even to themselves. The Yankees' grip
on first place in the American League East had loosened, but they
had an opportunity to smack the plucky Red Sox and continue
controlling the division. Instead, they have lost two straight and
are one and one-half games behind the first-place Red Sox, and they
have given Torre plenty to ponder in his first two days back in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   All Torre has to do is analyze the reams of statistics that are
available to him each day to decipher why the Yankees are hurting.
After Irabu was clipped for five earned runs and nine hits in three
and two-thirds innings, it meant that the Yankees' starters were
5-10 with a 6.15 earned run average in the last 20 games. After the
Yankees went 0 for 4 with runners in scoring position on Wednesday
night against Brian Rose, it meant they were batting .157 (11 for
70) in thaat situation in the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned,'' Torre said. ``Not to the point of
thinking that we can't do something. It's just a matter of winning
to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen on Wednesday night, and Torre was
disenchanted with Irabu, who could not keep his fastball or his
forkball down and who failed to put hitters away after getting two
strikes. Irabu surrendered three hits and two runs in the fourth
inning, all after he had been ahead 0-2 on the batters, and that
enabled the Red Sox to grab a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I got a strikeout on some of those 0-2 counts, it
could have changed the game,'' Irabu said. ``I might have thrown my
forkball too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was understandable for the Yankees to lose Tuesday night to
Pedro Martinez, who leads the major leagues with eight victories.
But the proud Yankees would admit that it was unacceptable to fall
tonight to Rose, a pitcher who was an emergency replacement for
Juan Pena (tendinitis in right shoulder) and who entered the
evening with a 1-4 record and a 7.38 era in 10 career games in the
major leagues over three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose mastered the Yankees even more than Martinez did. Using
a fastball and a changeup and taking advantage of the Yankees' lack
of patience, Rose rolled through the lineup with precision. He
breezed through the fourth on five pitches (all three Yankees swung
at the first pitch), and he did not get to a three-ball count until
he walked Paul O'Neill in the sixth. In all, Rose stifled the
Yankees on six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who is 3 for his last 42, stranded four runners
in his last two at-bats as the Yankees, who were shut out five
times in 1998, were blanked for the third time in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get down, we're trying too hard,'' Tino Martinez said.
``We're trying to do it all with one swing. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Irabu had permitted only 3 earned runs in his previous 14
innings and since Torre loves having Ramiro Mendoza in the bullpen,
it seems obvious that Irabu is secure in the rotation. Or is he?
The Red Sox nicked Irabu for two runs in the first, and Jason
Varitek, who had two homers and two singles, crushed a 436-foot
home run to right to nudge the lead to 3-0. All that was before
Irabu fell apart in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After jumping ahead of Varitek and Darren Lewis 0-2, he gave up
singles to both. Two outs later, Irabu had an 0-2 count on John
Valentin. But Valentin worked the count to 3-2 and lined a
one-bounce double off the center-field fence. That is when Torre
popped out of the dugout to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees need more changes, too. Soon.

SOME FIND FILM EASY TO RESIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A short time ago (Wednesday, actually) in a galaxy
close, close by (OK, it's our very own Milky Way) (italics) some
(end italics) citizens of the Blue Planet took little note of the
opening of the most hyped movie in the history of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the debut of George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' was, well, just another movie, albeit one with
lots of bells and whistles, light sabers and the mother of all
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it turned out to be a case of too much information for
too long a time.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Magana, 22, of suburban Granada Hills is already one with
the force. A seaman in the U.S. Navy, Magana will head out for
deployment Friday. He's taking the advice of a notorious
personality when it comes to fitting ``Phantom Menace'' into an
already tight schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Howard Stern says it's not that great so I think I'll go
with Howard. I'll wait until it comes out on video,'' Magana said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Wodetski and her 7-year-old son, Jordan, had some time to
kill before a visit to the dentist so they could have worked the
movie into their schedule. They chose to shop instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really jazzed about it but we'll probably go see it,''
the Palmdale resident said. ``I've heard about it in the news but
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Luke Skywalker fan, was not begging his mom to take
him to the movie, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only guy I like,'' he said of the original film's
protagonist. ``I used to watch a lot of `Star Wars' movies but I
wasn't in school. But not anymore. I've got to go to school now.''
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills resident Mike Zabarsky, 27, admits to being a big
fan of Lucas' series. In fact, he's stored a complete collection of
toys from the original ``Star Wars'' to eventually pass on to his
children.
</P>
<P>
   However, the owner of Play It Again Sports in suburban
Northridge didn't give himself the day off to catch the
most-talked-about flick in the world.
</P>
<P>
   No fan of standing in line or being stuck in a parking lot,
he'll wait until the excitement dies down before seeing the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a book. I already know the ending, so why go
see the beginning right away? But I like the `Star Wars' mythos.
The Greeks had Homer and we've got Lucas. It's a departure from
reality, it's got a clear message and it's attention-grabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the release of this movie, Lucas really grabbed the
attention of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Print and electronic journalists churned out story after story,
day after day in advance of the opening. The only thing absent were
splashy television ads, which the movie didn't need, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been advertising itself for the last year or so,'' said
Rich Ingrassia, an entertainment industry analyst at Paul Kagan &AMP;
Associates in Carmel. ``Why spend money when ``Entertainment
Tonight'' is showing the trailer every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia has seen the movie and said it lives up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Leyland, editor in chief of PR Week, a trade publication,
said Lucas knew he had a good story and that the media would be all
over it.
</P>
<P>
   So a big advertising budget was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland compares the opening of ``Phantom Menace'' to the recent
launch of products like the Volkswagen Beetle and Apple's iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a good story to tell and the media wants it you don't
need to advertise because the media will lap it up,'' Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of reaction turned off Jeff Griffith, 29, of suburban
Woodland Hills, a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate media hype. I hate anything that's big because it's
big. It works negative for me,'' he said, noting that ``Phantom
Menace'' is not on his ``must see'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Granted it's still early, but ``Menace'' did not seem to be
setting any fashion trends Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Segal, manager of the Hair House, a styling salon, said no
one had rushed in requesting a copy of the Queen Amidala coiffeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could change. We get a lot of younger people in towards
the weekend,'' she conceded.

AVALANCHE'S NEWFOUND BALANCE IS NOT JUST A SNOW JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Colorado Avalanche team the Stars will face in the
Western Conference finals beginning Saturday is not the same
run-and-gun unit that was upset in the first round of last season's
playoffs by the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche isn't even the same team that struggled in the
first round this year against the San Jose Sharks or the one that
lost the first two games to the Detroit Red Wings in the conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche team that comes to Reunion Arena for Game 1 at
6:30 p.m. Saturday is the one that just swept four games from the
defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings. It's the one that took
three of the needed four wins on the road. It's the one that has
learned to temper its dangerous offensive talent with a trapping
system that balances offense with a newfound respect for team
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those four games against Detroit, they became a different
team,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``They play smart,
conservative hockey. I think they've found a balance. When you know
that you have enough top-end people who can score, you feel that
you don't have to put on a show. Now, they're patient; they just
feel the other team is going to crack, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars winger Mike Keane, a member of the 1996 Stanley Cup
champion Avalanche: ``They're a much different team than when I
played there. They're a much different team than when we played
them earlier in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the addition of a defensive system to the
world-class scoring ability of Joe Sakic, Theo Fleury and Peter
Forsberg makes the Avalanche tough to beat. Adding Fleury (five
goals, nine assists) and gritty center Dale Hunter in late-season
trades created depth. Getting solid performances from rookies Milan
Hejduk and Chris Drury added energy. Shuffling Adam Deadmarsh and
Shjon Podein provided calm defensive hands to a high-energy forward
group.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to beat that system, Hitchcock said, is with
patience and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're overly aggressive, you can get burnt. If you're
careless with the puck, you're going to get burnt,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Your whole group has to stay on the same page. And, really,
that's been the strength of our team all year _ staying on the same
page in a team system.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience combined with intelligence has allowed the Stars to
plow through two early series in which they were pushed hard by the
Edmonton Oilers and St. Louis Blues. And while there were tenuous
moments and five overtime games, the Stars still have posted an 8-2
record in the playoffs, tied with the Buffalo Sabres for tops in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 3-2 in overtime games in the playoffs and 6-2 in
games decided by one goal. And Hitchcock and his players say they
have to be ready to take an attitude of patience to the new-look
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done and what we do is win close hockey games.
That's who we are,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``The past
three years, we've been winning games 2-1 and 1-0 with every game
coming down to the last second. But that's been a good thing for
us. We're used to playing in that kind of high-pressure game every
night.''

FOR ROY AND BELFOUR, THE PUCKS STOP HERE

<P>
   DALLAS _ The thing about Stars goalie Ed Belfour and Colorado
Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy is they are just as capable of falling
on their behinds as standing on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   There is rarely a middle ground when it comes to these goalies,
and that means there isn't likely to be any two players who have a
greater impact when the Western Conference finals begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With everything from tempers to rash acts in common, can you
even tell them apart?
</P>
<P>
   This goalie once told Jeremy Roenick that he couldn't hear him
because his two Stanley Cup rings were plugging his ears. He went
on to win a third later that season. ... He demanded a trade from
the only team he had ever known because his coach kept him in a
game where he had been getting shelled. ... He gets so intense
during games that he starts bobbing his head incessantly. ... He
has been credited with getting his team to this series.
</P>
<P>
   This goalie once slashed Martin Lapointe _ in his groin _
because he stepped into his crease despite it being at a crucial
point in a crucial playoff game. ... He once screamed at his
backup, Jeff Hackett, that he needed to start acting like a backup.
... He gets so antsy during games that he has to skate to the
boards during breaks in action. ... He has been credited with
getting his team to this series.
</P>
<P>
   If Roy, the one with the rings, and Belfour, the one with the
slash, seem like a matched set, eligible for the two-for-one
discount at an anger management class, that's because they are _
with one major exception.
</P>
<P>
   Roy has a reputation as being a fiery, emotional goalie who wins
Stanley Cups. Belfour has a reputation as being fiery and
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Patrick has his status from winning Stanley Cups
and taking his teams to another level,'' Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor said. ``That's what Eddie is trying to do right now. If you
want to win, you got to beat one of the best and Patrick is one of
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of talk about Patrick, but don't overlook our
goalie. He is playing really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers support Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks second in goals-against averqgN

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ What next?
</P>
<P>
   They've bounced shots off the clubhouse, whiffed putts, smashed
clubs and chased balls into the lake. One year, a young Canadian
held the lead for five days. And lost.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino trudged off the course one hot, windy day and said
he felt as though he'd just escaped from the Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Middlecoff, a former dentist, won the 1951 Colonial
championship with a closing round of 3-over-par 73 and confessed
that he was pondering a return to dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to play this course every day for a living,'' he
sighed, ``I'd go back to pulling teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange things do, in fact, occur at Colonial Country Club. .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real strong run,'' tournament chairman Phil Thomas
said recently as he and committee members plopped down in the
Terrace Room and reminisced about Colonial's half-century on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to beat what we've done. We've got a lot of
champions that any tournament would love to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from Ben Hogan in '46 to Tom Watson in '98, the names on
Colonial's Wall of Champions are magic. They include Heafner,
Snead, Bolt, Boros, Sanders and Arnold Palmer in the first 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then Casper, Crampton, Stockton, Devlin, Dickinson, Blancas,
Littler, Weiskopf, Geiberger, Trevino, Crenshaw and, by 1980,
Lietzke.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: Zoeller, Nicklaus, Jacobsen, Pavin, Wadkins,
Baker-Finch, Price, Lehman, Frost and last year's unlikely but
incredibly popular champion, Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much has changed since Bantam Ben fired a 5-under-par
65 in the closing round of the first Colonial to nip Dallas rival
Harry Todd and escape with $3,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is the prize money: $504,000 to the 1999
champion.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, this year's winner will earn
$484,000 more than the $20,000 total Hogan got for five Colonial
victories, the last 40 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds strange. Is strange. But strange things happen on the
professional golf circuit, particularly the one known as ``Hogan's
Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Bolt, nicknamed ``Thunder,'' once took a 9 on the par-4
ninth, and a scribe foolishly asked him how. ``I sunk a 14-foot
putt,' he snarled.
</P>
<P>
   Thunder won the Colonial in 1958, the year heavy rains nearly
rendered the course unplayable. Conditions were so awful that Byron
Nelson failed to find words to describe them.
</P>
<P>
   But he tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is too wet to be muddy,'' he said, ``and somehow,
it's the driest wet I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bolt, Watson once made a 9 at nine, and then wound up
trailing the eventual 1977 Colonial champ, Ben Crenshaw, by two
strokes. In a typical touch of Colonial irony, Watson hit the
pivotal shot of the 1998 Colonial from an awkward lie in a bunker
at that same No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed the pond and stopped 10 feet from the pin. The
momentum carried him that Sunday to a two-shot victory over Jim
Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Sam Snead celebrated his 38th birthday at Colonial. On
Saturday, with Snead ahead by five shots, Jimmy Demaret led the
crowd around the 18th green in singing ``Happy Birthday''.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Demaret, aglow with Colonial cheer, serenaded the
newly c-;ned champion again, this time with ``Some Enchanted
Evening''.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Johnny Palmer won with a 72-hole total of 280, even
par. Ten years later, he set a scoring record unmatched even today.
His 87-81-82-79_331 was 51 over par.
</P>
<P>
   With Hogan unable to play in the 1949 Colonial because of his
near-fatal car-bus collision, God intervened. So sayeth golf
historian Dennis Roberson and tournament MB;Br.
</P>
<P>
   ``God washed out the tournament with a flood,'' Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that ironic or not? IfYU7g don$,Y6W$ZV,]YKH+W. H[kkR, H]ZQ

CARDS RE PEAT DESIRE TO REMAIN IN VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 and LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Gallardo Bros. movers showed up at the Cardinals'
Tempe training facility early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't there to move the team out of town. They were there
to return election paraphernalia from Tuesday night's Rio Salado
Crossing project party.
</P>
<P>
   There was no panic from the Cardinals a day after a lopsided
loss in their bid for a new stadium. Owner Bill Bidwill reaffirmed
his desire to get a new facility in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Valley was where he wanted to be, Bidwill
said, ``It always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill, team vice president who spearheaded the stadium
drive, didn't spend Wednesday calling on cities that might be
interested in courting the Cardinals. He joked that he was trying
to get tickets for the new ``Star'' ``Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston businessman immediately expressed interested in having
the Cardinals relocate there, but team officials dismissed the idea
just as quickly. Businessman Bob McNair told a Houston TV station
that he would like to talk with the Bidwills but added that he
wanted to have ownership in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill said again Wednesday that he has no plans to sell
the team, which has been in his family since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL spokesman told ``The Arizona Republic'' that ``no one in
the league is talking about moving the Cardinals, starting with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill said the Cardinals ``are all ears'' to stadium
possibilities in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also might get assistance from a change in NFL
policy (Resolution G-3) that could allow the league to contribute
as much as 50 percent of the private money for new stadium
projects. The league's contribution would be a loan to be repaid
from visiting teams' shares of club seat premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials are using that to build a $225 million
stadium for the New England Patriots in Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano already has suggested finding a way to
renovate Sun Devil Stadium, where the Cardinals have played since
moving to the Valley in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the team doesn't seem interested in remaining the only pro
team playing in a college stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals still need a facility that is comfortable for
the fans and that allows us the ability to remain competitive,''
Michael Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John F. Long, the West Valley developer who donated
the land for the Maryvale baseball complex used as a spring
training home for the Milwaukee Brewers, said he again would
entertain the prospect of offering the Cardinals free land for a
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he offered the team a parcel just north of
Interstate 10 between 79th and 77th avenues, near Blockbuster
Desert Sky Pavilion. But the deal went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't thought much about it, but I guess we would
be willing to listen if they had something,'' Long said. ``We're
always interested in any and everything that helps the west side.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Valley leaders have said they won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's results, House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa,
pledged to work on a revised Rio Salado Crossing plan.
</P>
<P>
   And Kerry Dunne, executive director of the East Valley
Partnership, said he would be willing to go through the wars again
if a project to benefit the East Valley could be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Cardinals spoke to members of three
Indian communities _ the Gila River, Salt River-Pima Maricopa and
Fort McDowell _ about building a stadium on reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   Several league owners said at the time that they had a problem
with placing a stadium on a site that allows casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of initial conversations,'' Michael Bidwill
said. ``We never got to the point where we had the interest of the
East Valley Partnership, and those conversations are all dormant
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cardinals don't appear to be going anywhere soon, it's
time for a cooling-off period, a key Valley sports official says.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sculley, executive director of the Maricopa County Sports
Commission, hopes to bring all the parties together after a few
months to come up with a viable plan for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to let cooler heads prevail,'' Sculley said. ``After
a while, we will make an attempt to get all the parties together.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties include the Cardinals, Arizona State University, the
Fiesta Bowl and a potential Major League Soccer franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley says if the parties could find consensus on a new
approach toward solving the Valley's stadium problem, something
good would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not out of the realm of possibility that we could come up
with a plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley said any plan would need unified support from the state,
county and Valley cities, and that it would not be successful if it
involved a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates a simpler stadium plan than the massive, $1.8
billion Rio Salado Crossing stadium and convention center proposal
that went down to defeat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was just overwhelming to the general public,'' he
said. ``We need something that is not so grandiose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sculley hopes to put the issue on all key parties' radar screens
by the time football season rolls around and the bitter taste of
election defeat goes away.
</P>
<P>
   There's just too much at stake, he said, citing NFL football,
the Super Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl and a better facility for Sun
Devils football.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's loss of the Rio Salado Crossing project by a 3-2
margin, the NFL won't be following through on its pledge to bring a
Super Bowl in 2004, 2005 or 2006 to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was contingent on a new stadium,'' NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city of Phoenix, home to Bank One Ballpark and
America West Arena, hasn't thought about getting into the stadium
game again. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even on the radar screen,'' Councilman Sal DiCiccio
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, McNair has the rights to an exclusive deal with the
Harris County (Texas) Sports Authority to build a $310 million,
retractable-roof stadium adjacent to the Astrodome. His exclusivity
runs until Jan. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Namias, a spokesman for McNair, said McNair sympathizes
with the Cardinals because ``they worked so hard and it was very
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNair told Houston station KRIV-TV that he wanted to reopen
talks with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a way we could participate with them, either buying
it or being partners with them and moving to Houston, yes, we would
have a definite interest in that,'' McNair said. ``But it's
important to us that we have Houstonians owning the Houston team.''
</P>
<P>
   Namias said that even if McNair were a minority owner of the
team, he would want control of the club.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio has sought an NFL team for the Alamodome. But an NFL
observer close to the San Antonio situation said Red McCombs, the
San Antonio native who owns the Minnesota Vikings, wants to protect
the San Antonio market as leverage in case he doesn't get a new
stadium in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cities that have been mentioned for possible NFL teams
are Hartford, Conn., and Toronto. But league owners likely wouldn't
vote to move teams there because of Hartford being in the Patriots
market area and Toronto's proximity to Buffalo. &QL;

WHO IS THAT RIDING TO RESCUE? IT'S TEMPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This was not the end. This was an overweight trial
balloon exploding on takeoff. A hopeless referendum bellying up.
</P>
<P>
   Proposing a tax to the voters of Mesa is like bringing the hen
house to a fox. Like trying to sell air conditioners in Alaska. And
if this was the Cardinals' best shot, well, they're dumber than
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was not the end. Only the prelude to an end.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano re-emerged as a
popular man. A man whose city once again holds a big hand in the
Cardinals' future. And the first offer is what you might expect, an
invitation to participate in a vague project, the sketchy $200
million renovation of Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're filling the lake on June 2,'' Giuliano said. ``The best
location is Sun Devil Stadium. If the Cardinals want to come in and
explore what renovations would be necessary to accommodate their
needs, I'm sure the university would be open to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the Cardinals have other plans. And while a move to
Houston is certainly a clear and present danger, Giuliano's offer
is just another trial balloon, the start of what could be the final
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano is desperately trying to save the Fiesta Bowl. The
Bidwill family would very much like to settle down and retire the
vagabond image. These are the bookends of compromise, and with the
Super Bowl and the Bowl Championship Series and the lure of the
Final Four, there is too much at stake for everything to die in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many heavyweights with too much to lose, and too
much money left on the table for someone else to seize.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not the end.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's referendum really had been the last stand, you
would have witnessed an all-out barrage. NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue would have been front and center, exerting a league
provision to float huge loans in the name of private capital. Bill
Bidwill Jr. wouldn't have infuriated his family by refusing to show
up at election headquarters on Tuesday. The old man would have left
his fishing jacket in the closet and dressed for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue knows all about the stubborn mule that is the Arizona
voter, but for the past few weeks, he has been conspicuously
silent. And in his concession speech, Bill Bidwill looked very
content, describing the process as a ``tremendous experience.''
</P>
<P>
   They must be saving their bullets for another battle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the one that's just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 60-40 loss in Mesa tells me you don't go back to Mesa, no
matter what,'' Giuliano said. ``A 60-40 loss is not something you
can attribute to strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tempe bailed on the Rio Salado Crossing, there were
questions about Cardinals greed. Why would they reap master
development rights on property surrounding the stadium? Why would
they receive non-game day parking revenue? And why the mad rush for
a spot on the November ballot?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when Tempe bailed, it was over. And now it's
coming full circle, to where the answer must rest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the lingering notion of a peace-pipe
conclusion. The Cardinals simply turn in the rain check, grab the
free land and build a stadium on an Indian reservation. The NFL
wears a public frown when it comes to casino gambling, but the
league is careful not to look like complete hypocrites. After all,
football is gambling, a fact the NFL will neither confirm nor deny.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it could happen. And if done tastefully, it could be
a shrine to the American Indian, a romantic stadium true to its
historic roots.
</P>
<P>
   But that would kill the dream of a Final Four and do nothing to
solve the growing dilemma over the Fiesta Bowl. So the Cardinals
and the city of Tempe once again cross paths, and surely, there is
a plan. A way to scale down Rio and make it work. For everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their stadium district dissolves after 30 days, and then, it's
a clean slate,'' Giuliano said. ``There are a lot of different
scenarios floating around. And we're willing to talk to them about
it.'' &QL;

GONZALEZ HITS WALL 
 GOES 0-4, SEES STRING END AT 30 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pride, a return to first place and even a bit of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   That's what San Francisco Giants left-hander Alan Embree was
pitching for when he faced Diamondbacks left fielder Luis Gonzalez
on Wednesday at 3Com Park with what appeared to be one last chance
to extend his hitting streak to 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the top of the eighth inning, Embree fed the
left-handed-hitting Gonzalez a steady diet of off-speed pitches,
getting him to swing at a slider down and away in the dirt, and it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was the Diamondbacks' one-day stay by themselves atop
the National League West, as the Giants used home runs by Jeff Kent
and Rich Aurilia and 10 walks to record an 8-3 victory and pull
even with Arizona at 23-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had pitched him (Gonzalez) well all day, and I didn't want
to be the one to give it up,'' said Embree, who was followed to the
mound by ace closer Robb Nen in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't want to give it up, especially when it was one of his
former teams. Embree was acquired by the Giants Nov. 10 in a trade
that sent outfielder Dante Powell to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's satisfying to do it against the team that traded
you,'' Embree said. ``We needed a shot in the arm, to get back into
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Embree had faced Gonzalez before in 1997 when Embree was with
the Atlanta Braves and Gonzalez with the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a little bit about him, and it was my goal to try to
get him to chase something,'' Embree said. ``Yeah, I knew what was
going on. I knew he had an 0-for and knew he was coming up when the
crowd got louder.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their bluster normally directed at opponents, the 3Com
fans gave Gonzalez a nice, loud ovation when he returned to left
field in the bottom of the eighth. He tugged on the bill of his cap
in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed at all,'' Gonzalez said of the streak's
demise. ``I got a lot of support from my teammates and fans in
Phoenix and around the country. I got to 30 games, and that is
quite an accomplishment, being with an elite group of
ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter: ``The most rewarding
thing about the streak was how it was directly connected to us
playing good baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city where legend Joe DiMaggio was born, Gonzalez found
it difficult to believe that the 56-game hitting streak that came
in 1941 will be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different pitchers and match-ups, it will be
tough to do,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of the streak will not be the beginning of a
tailspin, predicted Diamondbacks hitting coach Jim Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got too good of a flat swing, right through the (strike)
zone to let that happen,'' Presley said. ``He knows what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most amazing thing about it was how hard he hit the ball,
night after night. You never know how long these things are going
to last, so we were pretty quiet even into the 20s. But once it got
to 25, 26, we all got louder, had more fun with it. It was a great
run and it couldn't happen to a better guy. I know he doesn't
really like the limelight all that much. He'll just go out (today)
and try to get it going again.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks right-hander Andy Benes couldn't get it going and
fell to 2-5, giving up five runs (three earned), while walking six
and striking out four in six innings. Right-hander Amaury Telemaco
didn't fare better in his wake, giving up three runs (all earned)
and three hits while walking four in 1 innings
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we were wild, but we missed, and you can't
afford to give up 10 walks in any game, period. You won't win very
often that way,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to be as tough during a four-game series against
the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field that begins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The only Diamondback to get anything going with the bat was
catcher Damian Miller, who hit a two-run homer off left-hander Kirk
Rueter that gave Arizona the lead in the second and an RBI double
off Rueter in the seventh. &QL;

STREAK OVER BUT THRILL WILL LINGER FOR A WHILE

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO - After he swung and missed for strike one, he
backed out of the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't feel comfortable at the plate and hadn't all day.
</P>
<P>
   Now something told him this could be it. He sensed the end was
near.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered himself. Looked around. Reflected. ``You never know
if you'll ever get here again,'' he said. ``I kinda took in the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez knew his streak would end, probably sooner than
later. After hitting safely in his 28th consecutive game, he
thought of Joe DiMaggio and the record, the noblest record in
baseball. Gonzo was impressed not by how far he had come but by how
far he had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got halfway,'' Gonzalez said, a grin lighting his long
narrow face, ``I thought 'There's no way in ``hell'' I'll get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez stepped back in. He pawed at the dirt. Tapped the
inside edge of the plate once with his bat as he does before each
pitch. Feet spread wide, back straight, he watched a fastball.
Strike two. I ; Is anything in baseball more exciting than a player
who starts hitting and keeps on hitting game after game after game?
We are fascinated with those who beat the odds and tempt fate.
Following Gonzalez as he climbed up the hit chart was like watching
a high roller at Las Vegas riding a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble excites us. The longer he rolls the dice, the higher
the stakes, the bigger the thrill. The crowd around the table
grows.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's 56-game streak is to baseball what ``Rock of Ages''
is to the Baptist Hymnal. En

   The bowl now has no alternative to playing in Sun Devil Stadium,
which bowl officials think could be inadequate in a few years. And
in endorsing the Cardinals' plan for a new stadium, they irritated
Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano and didn't deepen any friendships at
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   But at least, Junker said, Valley residents now know the bowl
will struggle to remain among the nation's elite if it stays in an
unrenovated Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the other position _ `gee, you should have been quiet
and not said anything' _ I think creates a big credibility
problem,'' Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   Junker and other bowl officials spent part of last weekend
campaigning for the Rio Salado Crossing project. They believed in
the project, Junker said, because it offered a concrete solution to
the bowl's facility problems, while the Sun Devil Stadium
reno6Be% &QC; 9 is
just a proposal, without a firm financing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl officials think the Fiesta's long-term future could be
threatened if competing bowls have better stadium situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta is one of four bowls in the Bowl Championship Series,
which is designed to match the nation's two top teams at the end of
the season. The bowls rotate hosting the game.
</P>
<P>
   Three years remain in the basic BCS agreement, but officials are
expected to begin discussing a new contract within the next two
years. By then, the Fiesta Bowl could be facing competition from
bowls that play in newer stadiums, Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will begin to play an increasing, concerning role,'' Junker
said. ``We thought it was important to let the public know what
we're going to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadium revenue and the quality of a facility are important to
the bowl's success, Junker said, and the bowl likely will be a
player in future stadium developments.

KOSOVAR REFUGEES EN ROUTE TO HAVENS IN L.A. AREA HOMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in story refers to Thursday.) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first ethnic Albanian Muslims from war-torn
Kosovo to seek refuge in Los Angeles are expected today and will
begin settling in host homes across the west San Fernando Valley
and the Conejo Valley, resettlement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hajrush and Renee Vlashi of suburban West Hills have been
scrambling with help from the Jewish Federation/Valley Alliance to
find the six families who agreed to house his 32 relatives for
their first weeks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They are due today at Los Angeles International Airport, joining
the recent wave of refugees from Macedonia. An additional 29 are
expected to soon join two other ethnic Albanian families, in
suburban Sherman Oaks and Altadena, north of L.A., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see my family for eight years and finally, through
the Jewish Federation, they're all going to be here,'' said Hajrush
Vlashi, waiter in suburban Studio City. ``I'm overwhelmed with how
people have helped and cared. In such a short time, it's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Vlashi, a professional puppeteer who is Jewish, turned to
the federation in West Hills after the Clinton administration
announced April 21 that it will bring 20,000 ethnic Albanian
Muslims to the United States to live with relatives and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The federation, through its Jewish Family Services agency, is
one of the main refugee resettlement groups in Los Angeles. The
ethnic Albanian Muslims follow the Vietnamese, Iranian and Russian
Jews the group has helped settle in the region since the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what we're in for. As a matter of fact, we
didn't expect this,'' said Miriam Prum Hess, who oversees the
federation's resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Michael Edelstein don't know what to expect as hosts,
so they are preparing their home in Westlake Village northwest of
downtown as much as possible for one family of Vlashi's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they have, but I wanted to have something to
make them feel welcome. We have a wonderful home and are happy to
share it,'' said Julie Edelstein, taking a break Wednesday from
preparing three bedrooms and packing groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein has spent time on the Internet learning Albanian
phrases, such as ``how are you'' and ``this is my dog,'' and
learning a little about their culture, including foods, and their
history.
</P>
<P>
   She also is preparing toilet kits and a few personal touches.
There are the L.A.-theme T-shirts and a computer-generated
``welcome'' sign in the Albanian language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having little time to prepare, only learning of the need
for host families during a meeting Tuesday at the Jewish
Federation, the couple didn't hesitate. They were moved by the
``ethnic cleansing'' campaign of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have everything. I have my health, I have my home, I have my
family and I just can't imagine walking away and leaving that all
behind,'' Julie Edelstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will welcome their freedom in the United States
from the suffering they have experienced in their homeland, said
Hajrush Vlashi. They have been living with relatives and friends in
Macedonia since fleeing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the country I served (in the army) and grew
up in could do this to its own people,'' he said. ``I grew up with
Serbs, they were my neighbors. My generation never dreamed this
could happen to us or to anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, mostly Orthodox Christians, maintain that Kosovo is
the birthplace of their religious and national identity.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the Serbian army to forcibly remove ethnic Albanian
Muslims from Kosovo reminds many Jews of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a crisis, the Jewish community has always been
there. The whole situation in Kosovo is very close to home,'' said
Barbara Creme, the federation's Jewish community relations
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little crazy, but it's very exciting and it's wonderful
to see such a positive response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federation provides signed assurances to the federal
government that the agency will resettle the families, who are
recognized as refugees by the U.S. Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees receive one month of cash assistance, which
averages about $300 a person, and three months of services.
</P>
<P>
   The federation provides a caseworker to work with host families.
They learn how to recognize post-traumatic stress, for instance,
given the ravages of war the refugees likely faced, and what is
expected in terms of housing and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   A second caseworker helps the families settle. There are Social
Security cards to obtain, health screenings provided by Los Angeles
County, English-language classes, children to enroll in school, and
job assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO goal is to return the refugees to their Kosovo
homes under the protection of an international security force, they
are eligible to remain here as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts have been asked to house families for as long as two
weeks. In the meantime, the federation will seek rental housing and
provide limited financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Jewish temples in the area also are seeking financial
help, transportation and other forms of assistance from their
congregations.

SURPRISE WITNESS SAYS OFFICER BRAGGED OF TORTURING A SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new material in 25th-27th grafs about Sergeant Wernick) (sw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In surprise testimony, a police sergeant said on
Wednesday that the officer accused of torturing Abner Louima
boasted to him of carrying out the attack shortly after prosecutors
said it took place in the restroom of a Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, Kenneth Wernick, said that Officer Justin A.
Volpe, using coarse language, told him in detail how he had rammed
a stick into Louima's rectum during the attack in the restroom of
the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he took a stick and put it five or six inches'' into
Louima's rectum, Wernick testified, ``and took it out and put it by
his mouth and teeth area, kind of like he was showing it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Louima's own account, Wernick's testimony, his first
public account of the events, was the most direct testimony yet
linking Volpe to a reported act of police torture that shocked the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking rapidly in loud tones in Federal District Court in
Brooklyn, Wernick told of a conversation with Volpe that took place
after dawn on Aug. 9, 1997, shortly after prosecutors say Louima
was attacked with the stick by Volpe while another officer on
trial, Charles Schwarz, held him down.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, had been arrested in a
street melee outside a nightclub in the Flatbush section of
Brooklyn, and prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima had
punched him in the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick, who held the rank of officer at the time and is now
assigned to the Fifth Precinct in Manhattan, said the conversation
started with Volpe's telling him, ``I took a man down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then told him about using the stick against
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Volpe continued his account by saying that he
had hit Louima on the genitals and that he had ``held his hand over
his mouth and told him if he told anybody, he'd kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You want to go into the bathroom and see the
stick?''' the sergeant testified as Volpe, at the defense table,
alternated between watching him without expression, shaking his
head and writing in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then took him into the station house restroom
to show him the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in another area of the station house, Wernick said, he
watched as Volpe pointed the stick at another officer's face and
said, ``Smell this. Smell this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then pointed the stick at him and demanded to
know if he could see feces on it. The sergeant testified that he
saw nothing on the stick, which he said was two to three feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said he last saw Volpe holding the stick outside the
station house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked outside by a large Dumpster and he held up the
stick,'' said Wernick, a burly, gray-haired man, holding up his
left arm to show how Volpe was holding the stick, as he sat on the
witness stand next to Judge Eugene H. Nickerson's bench.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what Volpe did at that point with the stick,
which has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked away,'' the sergeant continued. ``I didn't want to be
involved at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in his account, when Alan Vinegrad, an assistant
U.S. attorney, asked the sergeant whether he had believed that
Volpe had committed the torture, the sergeant said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, because I didn't think anybody would do it,''
Wernick replied. ``And if they did it, they wouldn't talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said that Volpe, 27, also gave him a report on the
street fight that had led to the arrest of Louima and a second
Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was a big fight outside some club, they were
acting like animals,'' the sergeant said Volpe had told him.
</P>
<P>
   He said Volpe reported that ``he got punched in the face, chased
a couple of people and caught somebody, but wasn't sure if it was
the guy'' who punched him.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is also charged with beating Antoine, who had not been in
the melee, as he walked on a street near the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick was on the list of witnesses scheduled to testify, but
there had been no previous indication that he would offer such a
detailed account.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he refused to discuss the case with a
reporter who went to his home on Staten Island. ``I don't want to
talk,'' he said. ``I don't think I'll ever want to talk. You can
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, is to begin cross-examining
Wernick on Thursday. He is expected, among other things, to
highlight admissions the sergeant made under questioning by
Vinegrad that he had been disciplined eight times in his career, in
one case for using excessive force against somone who he thought
was about to commit a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wernick took the stand, Antoine testified, and in
addition to giving his version of his encounter with Volpe, he told
the jury about statements the officer had made to him as he took
him to the same station house restroom where prosecutors say Louima
had been attacked shortly before.
</P>
<P>
   The statements, as recounted by Antoine _ who testified in
Creole through an interpreter, though he said he understands
English _ included an apology to Antoine for having beaten him in
the street and an admission by Volpe that he had acted
irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me why was I following this guy,'' Antoine said,
apparently referring to someone else Volpe and other officers had
been chasing near the disturbance when Antoine walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I did not know what he was talking about, that I
was just going home and that he beat me,'' Antoine continued,
adding that Volpe then ``said he's sorry, he was feeling crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Antoine testified, the officer ``told me he
was like somebody who was going crazy'' and that ``when somebody
hits him, he hits the person back.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that after Louima was arrested, Volpe and
Schwarz and the two other officers on trial, Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder, beat him in a police car before Volpe and Schwarz
attacked him with the stick in the restroom at the police station.
</P>
<P>
   All four are charged with violating Louima's civil rights. A
fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying to
cover up the reported beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg suggested in questioning Antoine that he had
misunderstood the officers' words during the conversation in
English. The lawyer also got Antoine to acknowledge that even
though he identified Volpe in court as the one who he said had
beaten him in the street, he had not had time to get a good look at
that officer.

OUT WITH THE JAZZ, IN WITH THE KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Something must be done about the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The old school pick 'n' rollers with a penchant for flopping and
arm-grabbing are disrupting the youthful, upstart spirit of these
NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson and Philly. Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Kobe and
Shaq with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   If only the basketball gods could bring back Jason Williams,
please.
</P>
<P>
   And while I never thought I'd say it, bring back Chris Webber
and Vernon Maxwell, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Corliss Williamson and Vlade Divac, because maybe if
the Kings got a third chance to beat the Jazz, they might finally
get it done. We could all use another round of TBS and TNT
announcers gushing and chuckling over the no-look passes and
breakneck crossover dribbles of Pistol Pete Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was the funnest team in the postseason. They were the
life of the party, the way Williams played with John Stockton's
mind and Webber body-slammed home a few messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, all the pressure of knocking off the Jazz is on the
Blazers, another upstart team. Judging from Game 1 of that Western
Conference semifinal, though, Utah seems doggedly inspired to prove
that in playoff crunch time experience and $10,000 high-flying
elbows are nine-tenths of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers did get rattled. As Cheryl Miller pointed out during
her sideline report Tuesday at the Delta Center, if former Running
Rebels Greg Anthony and Stacey Augmon are the two most rational,
level-headed veterans on Portland's bench, you understand why the
Blazers lack the maturity to hang with the steady-as-a-jackhammer
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a youth-movement NBA postseason. We're going to
stand by Rasheed Wallace and see if the Blazers can keep their cool
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on our wish list is to see Paul Allen leading the wave in
the Rose Garden this weekend, though Allen must take care not to
rip the underarms of those expensive suit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Is it heresy to take up the Blazers' cause, the same way we were
sucked into the spunk and spirit of the Kings?
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, there is a special feeling of kinship with the
dearly departed Kings. After all, the Sonics picked up two-fifths
of the old Sacramento starting lineup in Billy Owens and Olden
Polynice. We all know how far that got us.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for adopting the Kings' used parts, Seattle can
take credit for clearing the Kings' roster and opening the curtain
on a new era in NBA basketball. The Sonics' loss was Sacramento's
gain, which delighted hoop fans across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the absence of Michael Jordan was assumed to be the death
knell for the league, these Air-less playoffs have opened our eyes
to the entertaining youthful alternatives who, with no Jordan
around to draw impossible comparisons, have demonstrated they
possess the game, star power and competitive will to make May
madness must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bully to you, Mr. Stern. The kids are all right, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with Iverson securing his first NBA scoring title and
leading the Sixers in a decisive run over Penny Hardaway (the
second coming of Jordan once, no?), the NBA has officially unveiled
its new crop of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's 33-point, 10-steal, 5-assist wizardry in Game 3
against Orlando was a defining moment for the controversial
third-year player. One game after Iverson had been the victim of
Orlando coach Chuck Daly's ``Iverson Rules'' _ when the Magic
rewrote the ``Jordan Rules'' for Iverson and knocked the
waterbug-quick guard on his butt all night long _ Iverson soared.
</P>
<P>
   For Iverson to come back from Game 2's smash-mouth Orlando
defense and take charge of Game 3 and the series proves that,
beyond his penchant for hoisting up shots, there lurks an
unconsciously talented ballplayer on whom NBC can hang its Big Bang
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we'll admit it. We want Iverson to take down Indiana, just
as it seems fitting to hope the Blazers dispense with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jordan's retirement package should have been that
Stockton, Karl Malone, Bryon Russell and Shandon Anderson could not
assume the first No-Air NBA title was theirs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when Jordan pushed Russell out of the way in Game 6
for that '98 championship-winning jumper in Salt Lake City, it was
a signal:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took what was rightfully his. With that shove, Jordan hit
his final shot, won the final game and all but declared that since
the Jazz could not beat the Bulls during Jordan's reign, then Utah
should take its cue and understand its place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz's shining moment was to serve as Jordan's final foil.
They were a vaguely sympathetic lot back then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it is a new era. It's not that the Jazz deserve
disdain, but if we can't have the perfection of Jordan whipping the
venerable pros of Utah, we are surprisingly eager to root for the
wildness and audacity of youth.

EL PASO INFIELDER BECOMES BIG HIT  
 DURAZO MAKES GAINS AT PLATE, WITH HIS GLOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Erubiel Durazo has had to adjust most of his life, moving from
Mexico to Tucson, learning English, fitting in, finding acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been easier on the baseball field, where he's made a
smooth transition from the Mexican League to the Texas League,
showing the Diamondbacks there is another young, left-handed first
baseman with potential.
</P>
<P>
   What he's done so far in Double-A El Paso has been an eye
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who graduated from Tucson Amphitheater High in '93,
entered Wednesday running away with the league batting title with a
.431 average (53 for 123). The next-closest player is 50 points
behind. Durazo had a 14-game hitting streak, during which he hit
.537 with seven homers and 21 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he could hit, but I think he's played beyond our
expectations at this point,'' said  &UR; Tommy Jones, Arizona director
of minor leagues. ``He's hitting the ball to all fields. He's
played a solid first. He's showing a lot of ability.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although a magnetic resonance imaging test on
his right shoulder proved inconclusive Wednesday, Diamondbacks
pitcher
 &UR; Todd Stottlemyre will miss his next scheduled start Saturday
against the Colorado Rockies at Denver's Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who left Monday night's game against the San
Francisco Giants after having pain and stiffness while warming up
for the fifth inning, was scheduled to have a second, more detailed
MRI later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also was examined by  &UR; David Zeman, the team's orthopedic
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no damage is found, Stottlemyre will miss at least this
start because of the dye that is injected into the system as part
of the MRI procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation will be altered as a result. Left-hander  &UR; Omar Daal
will have his next start pushed back from Friday night into
Stottlemyre's spot Saturday. Taking the mound Friday night will be
left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson, who will be recalled from Triple-A
Tucson earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who started 32 games for Arizona in 1998 and finished
12-13, was 0-1 with a 9.58 ERA and one save in eight relief
appearances for the Diamondbacks this season before being optioned.
He started two games for Tucson in an attempt to get his arm used
to a longer period of work.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Stottlemyre were not injured, Anderson likely would have
been recalled because of the rapid rate at which pitchers
extinguish themselves at hitter-friendly Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the Diamondbacks 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said everyone in the
bullpen will be available tonight, although he hopes he won't have
to use anyone with left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson on the mound. &QL; 
Connor, umpire ailing &QL; 
The Diamondbacks on Wednesday were without the services of pitching
coach  &UR; Mark Connor, who was taken to a Bay area hospital after
experiencing severe pain as the result of what appeared to be
kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
   Connor likely will return to Phoenix for a few days of rest,
General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr said. &UR; Connor's role with the big
club will be temporarily taken by  &UR; Gil Patterson, a roving pitching
instructor in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Also,  &UR; Angel Hernandez, the second base umpire, left the field
because of pain in his lower back early in Wednesday's game, but he
returned. &QL; 
Time change &QL; 
The game next Wednesday between the Diamondbacks and the San Diego
Padres at Bank One Ballpark has been moved from 7:05 p.m. to 7:35
to accommodate a national cable telecast on ESPN. &QL;

COYOTES PRICES STAY SAME  
 SEASON TICKET COSTS FROZEN FOR 3RD STRAIGHT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Seizing an opportunity to further cash in
with their fans a day after voters approved the first step for a
new arena, the Coyotes on Wednesday announced plans to freeze
season ticket prices for next season.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third straight year in which the Coyotes have kept
prices in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans have been incredibly supportive during our first
three seasons and this is our way of showing our appreciation,''
said Brenda Tinnen, Coyotes senior vice president of marketing and
sales.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a modest increase in the price of single-game
tickets for next season, but the continuing price freeze for season
ticket holders is unusual. The Coyotes claim they have lost up to
$15 million since 1996-97, due in part to 4,200 sight-obstructed
seats at America West Arena, which sits 16,210 for hockey.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the ``Team Marketing Report,'' which does
ticket price analysis, recently said teams in the four major sports
usually raise prices by 7 percent annually. And if they skip a
year, they may make a jump of 12 percent to 14 percent, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's a good business decision by them,'' said Pat
Steinberg of Scottsdale, who said she has been a season-ticket
holder since the Coyotes' first season in the Valley. ``I don't
feel they had any choice, though. They would lose season ticket
holders if they raised ticket prices, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``{I'd go watch them play anywhere, but America West Arena is an
uncomfortable arena. Not only are there a lot of bad seats, but
more and more women are attending hockey game, and the
accommodations for women just aren't good there at all. It takes a
whole period to stand in line just to use the restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they froze their prices. They needed to. Once we get
into that new building in Scottsdale, it will be a whole different
story. But as far as I'm concerned, it couldn't be better. We need
a new arena. It's a good thing for the team and the fans, and it's
a good thing for Scottsdale.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Scottsdale voters overwhelmingly approved the
formation of a stadium district to proceed with plans for a
proposed $624 million sports-entertainment complex on the site of
Los Arcos Mall to be anchored by an 18,000-seat hockey arena.
</P>
<P>
   Tinnen said Wednesday's announcement regarding the freeze in
season ticket prices would have been made regardless of Tuesday's
election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been in the works for a while,'' Tinnen said. ``We've
been analyzing it for the past month. This would have been the
prices, win or lose on Tuesday's vote, win or lose in the playoffs.
We just want to make it as easy as possible to be a season ticket
holder and to grow our fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGinley, a season ticket holder who sits in Section 111,
where many of the fans, including himself, dress up in hockey
helmets and thick, black glasses, applauded the team's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful. I think it's a great move,'' he said. ``It's a
way of showing they care about the fans. They get plenty of my
support anyway, but I'll look at them a lot differently now. It
also may change the way I spend my sports dollar on other teams in
the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinley also has season tickets for the Cardinals, Arizona
State football and the Diamondbacks, but he said he considered
canceling after the baseball team announced ticket prices increases
during Fan Appreciation Weekend late last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who have a season ticket base of about 10,000, also
announced they will continue to offer an automatic monthly payment
plan, which allows season ticket holders to pay for their seats
during the course of the season through automatic withdrawals from
their checking or savings accounts. Other professional teams that
have used the plan include the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and Colorado
Avalanche and the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique system that lets you pay over five or six months
without maxing your credit card and having to pay additional
fees,'' Tinnen said. &QL;

KIDD WON'T ATTEND DRAFT LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Suns have changed their plans for Saturday's NBA draft
lottery, which will be televised by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The club had planned to have  &UR; Jason Kidd at the lottery to
represent the Suns. But Kidd will be attending the funeral of his
father,  &UR; Steve, in Oakland, as will Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge. General
Manager &UR; Bryan Colangelo will represent the club instead.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery order is determined using 14 pingpong balls,
numbered 1-14. There are 1,000 possible four-number combinations
that can be drawn, and the Suns will be assigned 36 of those
possible combinations.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the 36 Phoenix combinations come up first, second, or
third, the Suns would have the first, second or third pick in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that do not land among the top three will be arranged in
inverse order of their record. The bottom line: The Suns cannot
pick lower than 11th. They have a 3.6 percent chance of landing the
top pick, a 4.17 percent chance of getting the No. 2 pick and a
4.93 percent chance of being awarded the third choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are in the lottery because of Dallas' first-round pick,
which the Mavericks traded to Phoenix as part of a deal for  &UR; Steve
 &UR; Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have not participated in the lottery since 1988, when
the club picked Temple's  &UR; Tim Perry with the seventh choice in the
first round. &QL; 
Kidd's the Man
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is honored in the current issue of`` Basketball News''
magazine as that publication's choice for Player of the Year. Kidd
joins San Antonio's &UR; Tim Duncan, Utah's  &UR; Karl Malone, Miami's &UR; Alonzo
Mourning and Philadelphia's  &UR; Allen Iverson on the magazine's
All-NBA first team.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix forward &UR; Clifford Robinson, who was not included among
the two NBA all-defensive squads picked by coaches this season, is
on ``Basketball New''s' second-team all-defensive unit. &QL; 
Visits begin
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will begin bringing top draft prospects to the Valley
next week for interviews and workouts leading up to the June 30
draft, to be held at the MCI Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have some players in next week and the week following
that,'' Colangelo said. ``There are some complications because
number of the players who are underclassmen don't have agents yet.
Several also have decided to await the results of the lottery order
before they commit to visits.''

OUT WITH THE JAZZ, IN WITH THE KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Something must be done about the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The old school pick 'n' rollers with a penchant for flopping and
arm-grabbing are disrupting the youthful, upstart spirit of these
NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson and Philly. Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Kobe and
Shaq with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   If only the basketball gods could bring back Jason Williams,
please.
</P>
<P>
   And while I never thought I'd say it, bring back Chris Webber
and Vernon Maxwell, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Corliss Williamson and Vlade Divac, because maybe if
the Kings got a third chance to beat the Jazz, they might finally
get it done. We could all use another round of TBS and TNT
announcers gushing and chuckling over the no-look passes and
breakneck crossover dribbles of Pistol Pete Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was the funnest team in the postseason. They were the
life of the party, the way Williams played with John Stockton's
mind and Webber body-slammed home a few messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, all the pressure of knocking off the Jazz is on the
Blazers, another upstart team. Judging from Game 1 of that Western
Conference semifinal, though, Utah seems doggedly inspired to prove
that in playoff crunch time experience and $10,000 high-flying
elbows are nine-tenths of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers did get rattled. As Cheryl Miller pointed out during
her sideline report Tuesday at the Delta Center, if former Running
Rebels Greg Anthony and Stacey Augmon are the two most rational,
level-headed veterans on Portland's bench, you understand why the
Blazers lack the maturity to hang with the steady-as-a-jackhammer
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a youth-movement NBA postseason. We're going to
stand by Rasheed Wallace and see if the Blazers can keep their cool
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on our wish list is to see Paul Allen leading the wave in
the Rose Garden this weekend, though Allen must take care not to
rip the underarms of those expensive suit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Is it heresy to take up the Blazers' cause, the same way we were
sucked into the spunk and spirit of the Kings?
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, there is a special feeling of kinship with the
dearly departed Kings. After all, the Sonics picked up two-fifths
of the old Sacramento starting lineup in Billy Owens and Olden
Polynice. We all know how far that got us.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for adopting the Kings' used parts, Seattle can
take credit for clearing the Kings' roster and opening the curtain
on a new era in NBA basketball. The Sonics' loss was Sacramento's
gain, which delighted hoop fans across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the absence of Michael Jordan was assumed to be the death
knell for the league, these Air-less playoffs have opened our eyes
to the entertaining youthful alternatives who, with no Jordan
around to draw impossible comparisons, have demonstrated they
possess the game, star power and competitive will to make May
madness must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bully to you, Mr. Stern. The kids are all right, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with Iverson securing his first NBA scoring title and
leading the Sixers in a decisive run over Penny Hardaway (the
second coming of Jordan once, no?), the NBA has officially unveiled
its new crop of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's 33-point, 10-steal, 5-assist wizardry in Game 3
against Orlando was a defining moment for the controversial
third-year player. One game after Iverson had been the victim of
Orlando coach Chuck Daly's ``Iverson Rules'' _ when the Magic
rewrote the ``Jordan Rules'' for Iverson and knocked the
waterbug-quick guard on his butt all night long _ Iverson soared.
</P>
<P>
   For Iverson to come back from Game 2's smash-mouth Orlando
defense and take charge of Game 3 and the series proves that,
beyond his penchant for hoisting up shots, there lurks an
unconsciously talented ballplayer on whom NBC can hang its Big Bang
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we'll admit it. We want Iverson to take down Indiana, just
as it seems fitting to hope the Blazers dispense with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jordan's retirement package should have been that
Stockton, Karl Malone, Bryon Russell and Shandon Anderson could not
assume the first No-Air NBA title was theirs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when Jordan pushed Russell out of the way in Game 6
for that '98 championship-winning jumper in Salt Lake City, it was
a signal:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took what was rightfully his. With that shove, Jordan hit
his final shot, won the final game and all but declared that since
the Jazz could not beat the Bulls during Jordan's reign, then Utah
should take its cue and understand its place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz's shining moment was to serve as Jordan's final foil.
They were a vaguely sympathetic lot back then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it is a new era. It's not that the Jazz deserve
disdain, but if we can't have the perfection of Jordan whipping the
venerable pros of Utah, we are surprisingly eager to root for the
wildness and audacity of youth.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Star Wars'' fans ditched classes, skipped
college lectures, put meetings on hold and mustered a myriad of
excuses to catch the newest installment on the first day of its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything for `Star Wars,' '' said Barbara Bonds, 30, in line
for the 11 a.m. showing at General Cinema's Sherman Oaks theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told a customer that I had an appointment but didn't quite
tell them I was going to the movies,'' said Bonds, who runs a
concierge service for people who don't have time to run errands.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same across L.A.'s San Fernando Valley and the nation
as millions of people put their daily grind on hold Wednesday to
lose themselves in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley schools didn't notice an abnormally high
absentee rate, but the smattering of young faces in line suggested
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Olsen, 14, and three fellow ninth-graders from Campbell
Hall School in North Hollywood carefully executed a plan to skip
the second half of the school day. They were still in the school
uniform of white polo shirt and tan slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just finals,'' Trent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked our butts off all year. We deserve a break,'' added
friend Michael Quiroz, 15, of North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Script developer Louis Farber and his boss, Peggy Howard Chane,
didn't drop their work completely. They brought along scripts to
read while waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided why would we want to be in the office while we
could be out watching `Star Wars,' '' said Chane, a director and
producer for CPC Entertainment in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce College student Steve Sommers, 25, of Van Nuys said he
waited several years to see the new movie and was not about to let
English class delay him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love `Star Wars.' It's basically the reason I came out to
Los Angeles to get into the film industry,'' said Sommers, who
arrived from Milwaukee three years ago and is now studying film
production. ``This is a special day.''
</P>
<P>
   With her parents' encouragement, 6-year-old Heather Goldfarb
took the day off from Woodland Hills Elementary School. She and her
parents, Dan and Barbara Goldfarb, studied the ``Star Wars'' series
by watching the first three movies in succession.
</P>
<P>
   She found it frightening at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the whole movie,'' Heather said. ``It was a bit scary
in the first place but then I got used to it and remembered what my
dad and mom talked about _ that the blood was only ketchup, red
paint or dye.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Goldfarb said she had no qualms about keeping her child
out of school for a day to catch the movie: ``It's an occasion
she'll remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Menendez, 29, a Studio City resident who works on the
Spanish-language police show ``Placas,'' said he indulged his inner
teen-ager when he saw the movie for the first time at midnight
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to let the 13-year-old in you come out or else you
might find some parts are a little too geared to kids,'' he said
while lining up to see the movie again, this time to study the
craft and take in more of the details he missed in the first
viewing.

WITHOUT PECAN TREE, 18TH HOLE AT COLONIAL WON'T BE SAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The closing stretch of this week's
MasterCard Colonial will be unlike any other in the tournament's
53-year history.
</P>
<P>
   That much became clear in October, when a signature pecan tree
guarding the left-hand side of the 18th fairway toppled after heavy
rains. Since the course's inception, gnarled branches from that
tree had overhung the fairway, stretching toward the ground and
impacting the approach shots of golfers who hooked drives into the
left rough.
</P>
<P>
   The tree's presence, said Harrison Frazar, altered strategy for
many players.
</P>
<P>
   ``With it sitting there, most guys just tried to hit a 3-wood
down the right side and draw it back to the middle,'' said Frazar,
one of 112 competitors scheduled to tee off in today's opening
round at Colonial Country Club. ``Now, you may see more guys hit
driver down the middle and take their chances. That's going to
alter the hole a bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazar and tournament officials envision the possibility of more
birdies this year on Colonial's closing hole. Other competitors
disagree, saying most players hit past the tree on their drives and
that replacement trees planted last fall at No. 18 serve as a
similar, but less daunting, deterrent for the pull-hooked tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you never knew it was there, you'd never miss it,'' David
Ogrin said. ``I don't think it will make that much difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof will be found in the scoring average, which shows that
No. 18 traditionally ranks ninth among the course's holes in
difficulty. The 427-yard par-4 hole played to a scoring average of
3.902 in last year's tournament, its lowest mark over the past
eight years. In 1994, players needed 4.154 strokes per trip at No.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Russell, the PGA Tour tournament official in charge of
setting up the Colonial layout, sides with the group anticipating a
birdie bonanza. Without the tall tree, players won't be forced to
hit low, punch shots from the left rough. Recoveries from bad
drives will be easier and birdies, in all likelihood, will be more
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely missed,'' Russell said of the fallen tree.
``You can't replace something like that. It's just a shame. I think
it'll be a big factor in scoring this week. Before, the players
were very concerned about hitting the ball over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, said Davis Love III, there is more room for
error off the 18th tee this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if you really killed one off the tee and tried to
cut the corner, you'd still get tangled up,'' Love said. ``You
might get away with one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hulbert, playing in his 14th Colonial, said: ``There's more
potential to make birdie from the rough now. In the past, you were
scrambling just to make par.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk, runner-up to Watson at last year's Colonial, said he
doesn't anticipate a dramatic change in scoring at No. 18. But he
can envision a situation where ``a few guys slide by \Rafter bad
drives\S that couldn't before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone hits it down the left side and makes birdie, then
you've got something,'' Furyk said. ``I guess that could happen,
but it's still not likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard and Tom Watson, the defending Colonial champ,
joined Ogrin in predicting a minimal change, at most, in scoring
conditions at No. 18. Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain who
is playing in his 29th consecutive Colonial, said the hole provides
a visual jolt to longtime visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look different. I remember that tree so well and it
did play havoc with shots,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think everyone
who's played here has been under that tree at some point. It's sad
to see it gone. But you can still find trouble on that hole, the
way they have it set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not as much trouble as in years past. That's why Omar
Uresti said he wouldn't be surprised to see the 1999 Colonial
decided by a birdie on the 72nd hole _ a rarity in Colonial annals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as intimidating sitting back there on the tee box as
it used to be,'' Uresti said. ``More guys will be willing to try
and take it down the left side. I'll probably hit driver down the
middle and take my chances. If you hook it, it's not as big a
concern. I think you'll definitely see more birdies and pars down
the stretch.''

RANGERS APPLY TRUSTY TOURNIQUET IN RELIEVER ZIMMERMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One of Jeff Zimmerman's assets, in addition
to a 90-plus mph fastball and a devastating slider, is a large dose
of humility.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest to the rookie right-hander that he is the Rangers most
valuable player for the first seven weeks of the season, and he's
quick to go into denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all, not with the way Palmeiro's been swinging the
bat,'' Zimmerman said. ``Us guys in the bullpen are kind of the
bottom feeders of the baseball world.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Rafael Palmeiro is not a bad choice. The Rangers'
designated hitter has a .377 average with 11 homers and 36 runs
batted in, and played a big role in the team's 7-6 victory against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays yesterday at The Ballpark in Arlington
with two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But without Zimmerman, the Rangers probably don't beat Tampa
Bay, and they're probably not in first place in the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   The game resembled an episode of ``Home Run Derby,'' with the
two teams combining to smash seven balls out, before Zimmerman
entered and seized control.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied, 6-6, when he came in with two runners on and
two outs in the sixth inning. He struck out dangerous slugger Jose
Canseco to end the uprising, then pitched two more perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored in the eighth, when Tom Goodwin singled home
Roberto Kelly, to give Zimmerman his third victory in as many
decisions. John Wetteland finished for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' manager JohDNy &LR; Qes said. ``He's
using the same scouting report as everybody else, believe it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' starters aren't doing much with those scouting
reports. Mark Clark pitched 5 2/3 ineffective innings, surrendering
six runs (five earned) on nine hits, including a mammoth, 491-foot
shot by Paul Sorrento and two-run shots by Canseco and Fred
McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's earned-run average rose only slightly, from 7.53 to
7.58, and the starters' ERA as a group hovers just below 7.00.
</P>
<P>
   When the rotation is going that badly, a club needs a strong
bullpen to bail it out.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   His ERA fell to 0.61, lowest among all big-league relievers. He
has retired 23 consecutive batters, tying the club record for a
reliever set by Gary Mielke in 1990. The Rangers are 13-3 when he
pitches, and he has appeared in eight of their past 10 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Although Palmeiro batted .500 with five homers and 13 RBI on the
seven-game homestand, those pitching stats seem to be team MVP
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't supposed to be this easy,'' Oates said. ``It's been a
long time since I've seen someone, every time out, be in command
like he is. His numbers speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The game did not look like one that would be decided by pitching
for the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored its first five runs on Sorrento's monster
homer, which landed at the very top of the grass berm in dead
center and was the longest ever hit at The Ballpark, Canseco's
two-run shot, which was prevented from being a tape-measure shot
only because it hit the left-field foul pole, and McGriff's
409-foot blast, also with a man aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers outslugged the visitors with four homers, all off
former Texas starter Bobby Witt. Palmeiro hit one with Luis Alicea
aboard in the third and, after Rusty Greer doubled, Ivan Rodriguez,
Palmeiro and Todd Zeile went deep on consecutive at-bats in the
fifth for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay tied it in the sixth when Mike Difelice scored on an
infield single by Dave Martinez off Mike Venafro. That's when
Zimmerman did his imitation of a tourniquet, striking out Canseco
and breezing through the next two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredible,'' Palmeiro said. ``He's been our savior all
year. Every game that he has been in has been a crucial situation
and he's come through.''
</P>
<P>
   So, where would the Rangers be without him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to think about it,'' Oates said. ``Wow.''

WORLD'S SECOND-RANKED PLAYER BATTLES ACHING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A month away from the PGA Tour wasn't enough
to get Davis Love III's ailing back feeling 100 percent again.
</P>
<P>
   The pain he experiences while playing, however, wasn't enough to
keep him away from the MasterCard Colonial again.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who moved up to No. 2 in the world rankings on Monday,
missed the Colonial last year because of a bad back _ the first
time he failed to play in the event since he first entered it in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   His disc problems began flaring again a month ago, forcing him
to withdraw from the MCI Classic before the final round. He also
backed out on commitments in Japan and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But for one of the Tour's biggest students of golf history,
Colonial was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to miss Colonial,'' Love said. ``This is
one of my favorite tournaments. I missed it last year for the same
reason. I didn't want to miss it twice.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Colonial officials didn't want Love to be absent from
their event again, either. His presence means Colonial's field not
only has one of the Tour's most popular players, but also includes
two of the top five players in the world rankings (Vijay Singh is
No. 5).
</P>
<P>
   Yet getting here wasn't easy for Love. After missing the final
round of the MCI on April 18, Love put his clubs away until last
Tuesday. He spent his time at home in Georgia, catching up on some
golf-course design, fishing and attending a horse show with
10-year-old daughter Alexia.
</P>
<P>
   He said his back began to feel better _ at least until the past
two days, when he played in the Colonial Shootout, followed by
yesterday's pro-am. That's when the pain returned and Love realized
he'll need a different approach this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not going to be 100 percent,'' Love said. ``I
would be happy if I was 75 \Rpercent\S or 80 percent. I'm not going
to be bombing it over the corner at 3 and 5. I'll be easing it
around there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Love will take a slightly more conservative approach _
something he said he's going to start doing with his entire career.
His return this week is part of preparation for the U.S. Open,
which is a month away. After the Open, he plans to give his back
more rest than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at all the stuff I've done leading up to
having a bad back _ playing five events in a row, 26 or 27 events a
year _ that contributes to getting worn down early,'' Love said.
``You don't want to slow down, but I have to learn to pace myself
and realize it's better not to play five in a row.''

SPURS NO LONGER PLAYOFF SOFTIES
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to sacrificial bangers Will Perdue and Malik Rose and the
commitment by Tim Duncan and David Robinson to shed their ``soft''
image, the San Antonio Spurs are no longer the NBA's phantom
menace.
</P>
<P>
   Their physical defense is suddenly real and real hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming at me pretty tough, and not within the rules,''
said Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal. ``But nobody's going to break
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 of the second round of the Western Conference playoffs
Monday, the Spurs took turns hammering O'Neal in the paint. While
some teams concede O'Neal his 28 points per game, San Antonio
remarkably held him without a single dunk and sent him to the
free-throw line 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   For an interior long considered finesse and at the beginning of
the season even criticized by teammate Mario Elie, the Spurs'
frontcourt is taking a major step in the macho direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't let guys go the basket unobstructed,'' Robinson
said. ``This is playoff basketball and we've got to protect our
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark it down: If the Spurs keep hacking Shaq, there will be a
brawl. More importantly, San Antonio will also win the series.
PACERS VS. SIXERS As good as Allen Iverson is, point guard Eric
Snow is as bad. Reluctant to shoot and inconsistent when he does,
the Sixers can't beat the Pacers with Snow running the show. ...
Entering last night's Game 2, Indiana's Travis Best had nine points
and 19 fouls in the playoffs. HAWKS VS. KNICKS The most ridiculous
coach in the playoffs is the Knicks' Jeff Van `Grumpy.' After his
team got a lucky bounce to upset the Heat and likely save his job
in Game 5, he left the court hurling expletives at referee Hue
Hollins because Terry Porter's final shot would have counted. ...
As predicted, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell of the Knicks are
too athletic for Atlanta's grind-it-out defense. The Hawks will get
swept if forwards Grant Long and Tyrone Corbin don't do better than
their two points on 1-of-12 shooting Tuesday in the opener of their
second-round Eastern Conference playoff series. JAZZ VS. BLAZERS
Temperament beat talent again Tuesday in Game 1 of their
second-round series, triggered by Rasheed Wallace's violent foul
and silly reaction early in the fourth quarter. The Blazers led by
four when Wallace slung Bryon Russell to the court and picked up a
technical for objecting to the obvious call, but were outscored
15-5 the rest of the quarter. NUMBERS GAME 1: Member of the Bulls'
dynasty still alive in the playoffs, another example that Jordan
was pretty good. Spurs backup guard Steve Kerr went 0-of-7 in the
first round and didn't play in Game 1 against the Lakers, but he's
faring far better than former Chicago teammates like Detroit's Jud
Buechler (3-of-15 vs. Hawks), Phoenix's Joe Kleine (only five
minutes vs. Blazers) and Luc Longley (2-of-12), Houston's Scottie
Pippen (32 percent shooting vs. Lakers) or nobody's Dennis Rodman.
Said Kerr, ``At least I know how to pick my bandwagons.'' CRYSTAL
ROUNDBALL The Grizzlies have the best shot at landing the No. 1
pick in Saturday's lottery, which won't include the Mavericks,
thanks to their trade for Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The draft's likely top 10 picks: Rhode Island forward Lamar
Odom, Maryland guard Steve Francis, Duke center Elton Brand,
Connecticut guard/forward Richard Hamilton, UCLA guard Baron Davis,
Duke forward Corey Maggette, Miami-Ohio forward Wally Szczerbiak,
Georgia forward Jumaine Jones, Utah guard Andre Miller and Arizona
guard Jason Terry. 24 SECONDS Maybe Kings rookie Jason Williams was
the last to know that Utah's John Stockton always shoots the jumper
off the pick-and-roll in crunch time. Remember his Game 6 winner
against the Rockets in '97? His Game-6 miss against the Bulls in
'98? And now _ because Williams went under the screen and allowed
Stockton a clean look that saved the Jazz _ remember his 23-foot
buzzer-beater in Game 4 against the Kings? ... The winner of Game 1
in the second round has won the series 85 percent of the time this
decade. ... Most irritating ritual: teammates slapping hands with a
free-throw shooter after a miss. ... Where are they now? Must-have
free agents last February, Pippen, Ike Austin, Tom Gugliotta and
Antonio McDyess are now innocent bystanders. nn

RYAN STILL NOT RETURNING, SO RANGERS KEEP LOOKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It's a daily pursuit. Doug Melvin works the
phones frequently. Urgency prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching help is needed now.
</P>
<P>
   What Melvin received Wednesday, however, was a message from a
pitcher offering lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan said he would be buying. Actually, it was the
highlight of Melvin's day, week, month and season. Maybe you
noticed _ major-league baseball has a drastic shortage of competent
pitchers. The Front Row Sports Grill never has a shortage of
cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who was in town for several days, mentioned nothing to
Melvin about making a comeback. Lunch was his best offer. Paul
Sorrento can relate.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Rangers right-hander Mark Clark also served a
fat cheeseburger to Tampa Bay's Mr. Sorrento, a noted
Ranger-killer. Clark ``missed'' on a 2-1 count to Sorrento. History
was made at The Ballpark in Arlington. Sorrento took an
all-you-can-eat swing and his blast measured 491 feet to dead
center field, the longest home run ever in this yard.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Jose Canseco might have had more footage than
Sorrento, except this missile rattled the top of the left-field
foul pole. Two innings later, Fred McGriff drilled a 400-foot plus
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, John Burkett didn't seem so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came roaring back with their own long-ball arsenal
off old friend Bobby Witt. Rafael Palmeiro, who has gone nuts, hit
two more homers. Witt gave up four in less than five innings,
including three straight (Pudge Rodriguez, Rafael, and Todd Zeile)
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Mark Clark was outscored by his own team. Rangers
win, 7-6, surviving a John Wetteland scare in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But pitching-wise, it has been the longest first seven weeks in
Rangers history. In late April, there was a prominent theory that
the starting rotation could not be as bad as it had performed.
Wrong. It's even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, another homestand ended in a another disaster
Wednesday. The Rangers won only four of seven from the Orioles and
Devil Rays, while the rotation reached new depths. There have been
three homestands, and the overall record is a game under .500.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation is needed for this failure at home cooking. The
pitching staff's earned-run average in Arlington is a massive 6.70,
nearly two runs a game more than the road ERA.
</P>
<P>
   (OK, Juan. Both of us were apparently wrong in suggesting the
ballpark left-field fence should be moved closer.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Melvin keeps looking for arms, but expects to find
nothing. ``Not now anyway,'' he said. ``What I'm basically doing is
contacting clubs who at some point might want to trade pitching.
There are none at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for help is as aggravating as watching the current
rotation. Clark has been a total failure as a free-agent signee
from last winter. Aaron Sele is doing everything to prove his 19
wins last season were a fluke. Mike Morgan, at age 39, at least has
a clue, while Rick Helling shows signs of coming around. Burkett
was yanked out of the rotation this week, replaced by rookie Ryan
Glynn, just in from Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we have a lot of options, but bringing in our own
people \Rminor-leaguers\S has been a high point thus far,'' said
Melvin, meaning the work of Jeff Zimmerman and Mike Venafro in the
bullpen. Zimmerman has actually been too good, causing a concern
that Johnny Oates is overworking him.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Glynn last weekend also broke policy, at least
where Melvin's adamant stand against promoting center fielder Ruben
Mateo is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, like Mateo, is in his first Triple-A season. Glynn, like
Mateo, was also showing great promise. But Glynn was rushed to the
majors while Melvin hopes Mateo will have a full season of Triple-A
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is the immediate need for pitching help,'' said
Melvin, and Clark's bombing would add an exclamation point to his
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an injury put us in a position to bring up Ruben, he would
be here,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   With baseball in a heavy seller's market for pitching, any trade
for the Rangers will come at a steep price. And Melvin concedes an
eventual trade might prove impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can't do, however, is say pitching is bad all over,
and then fall into a trap of thinking nothing can be done,'' he
added. ``You keep working at it, and hope something turns up, or
hope our rotation turns around.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, keep hitting home runs while Nolan Ryan
buys lunch. / nn

BROWN JUST WHAT DODGERS ORDERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown demonstrated why he is Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers needed innings. He provided them. They
needed a stabilizing force. He provided that.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, the Dodgers needed a win to avoid their
longest losing streak of the season. Brown also delivered that.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed four hits and struck out eight in eight innings as
the Dodgers beat the Houston Astros 5-2 Wednesday at Dodger Stadium
to end a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros ended a
four-week home run drought with a two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Jeff Bagwell hit two solo homers for the Astros, but
it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Brown won his third straight and improved his record to 5-2.
Since getting battered for five runs on opening day, Brown has
allowed 13 earned runs in his past 58 innings, a 2.02 ERA. The
right-hander has been even better at home. Since yielding those
five runs to Arizona to begin the season, Brown has allowed two
earned runs in his past 32 innings at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (21-18) are 6-3 in games Brown starts, and Brown is
3-0 following a Dodgers loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Brown allowed to the Astros came via the home run.
Bagwell hit a solo shot to right field with one out in the fourth.
It was his second homer of the series and the seventh one Brown
surrendered this season after allowing eight homers with the Padres
last season.
</P>
<P>
   With the way the Dodgers' starters not named Brown have
struggled this season, Brown's outing was not only welcomed, but
anticipated. While the rest of the Dodgers battled to pitch into
the seventh inning, Brown's completed at least seven innings in his
last three starts. He's allowed one run in each of those outings.
</P>
<P>
   He was also aided by a couple of early runs from the offense as
the Dodgers took a 1-0 lead on Gary Sheffield's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers increased their lead to 2-0 in the second inning.
Karros (3 for 4) singled with one out, moved to second on a
ground-out and scored on Mark Grudzielanek's sharp single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't allow a hit and struck out five through three
innings, made one of his only mistakes to Bagwell with one out in
the fourth. Bagwell hit Brown's first pitch out to right field to
pull the Astros within 2-1. That was all Houston would get against
Brown, as he improved to 2-2 with a 1.60 ERA in six career starters
against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers responded immediately off Houston starter and loser
Shane Reynolds, who dropped to 6-3 after allowing four runs in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley singled to center with one out in the fourth to set
up Karros' first homer in 77 at-bats. Karros hit a 1-0 pitch into
the Dodgers' bullpen to give them a 4-1 advantage. It was Karros'
fifth homer of the season and first since April 24 against St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tried to chip away at Brown late in the game without
success. Reynolds led off the sixth with a single but was erased on
a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell began the seventh by drawing his second walk _ the only
two Brown issued _ and stole second with one out. But Brown got
Carl Everett to fly to right and Bill Spiers to ground to second to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros again threatened in the eighth, the only inning in
which they had more than one runner on base against Brown. Tim
Bogar singled with one out, moved to second on a groundout and went
to third on Craig Biggio's infield single. But Brown stranded the
runners when he got Derek Bell to hit into a fielder's choice.

PRINCIPAL ACCUSED OF FAILING TO ACT ON MOLEST REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A Phoenix elementary school principal has been
indicted for failing to heed repeated warnings about a counselor
who is charged with molesting nine boys.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the indictment Wednesday against Joanne Talazus,
50, Maricopa County Attorney Richard Romley called her reputed
inaction ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It boggles the mind why she wouldn't take reasonable steps''
to protect the chidren from Ronald Maldonado Ruelas, Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, a Longview Elementary School counselor, was indicted in
February on 23 counts involving nine victims, including a relative.
Charges included child molestation, indecent exposure and sexual
abuse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, 31, was accused of fondling boys on the playground,
furnishing them with pornographic materials and exposing himself to
them. All but two of the boys were under 15 years old, the
indictment said. He groomed one boy for three years before sexually
molesting him, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's grand jury indictment says Talazus was repeatedly
apprised of the abuse over a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time after time after time'' Talazus heard allegations against
Ruelas' misconduct, Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Arizona law is clear,'' about the obligation of
school teachers and administrators to report child abuse to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals in positions of responsibility for the care of
children should be held accountable when they shirk that
responsibility,'' Romley said. ``This is a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Talazus will be arraigned June 1 in a Maricopa County Superior
Court. She did not respond to repeated attempts to contact her
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said Talazus will go through a booking process, but will
not be jailed. He said she is not considered a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Haws, an attorney for the Osborn School District said, ``We
are taking the allegations very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say what will happen other then we are
reviewing the information that we got today. We hope it is clear
that Ms. Talazus is not accused of abusing children herself.''
</P>
<P>
   School district board members voted unanimously to terminate
Ruelas, who now is being held at Madison Street Jail in lieu of
$500,000 bail. His trial is set for Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of seven reputed molestation victims on April 12
took the first step in filing a $65 million lawsuit against Osborn
School District officials by claiming the district knew of prior
complaints against Ruelas but took no action to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are supposed to be sanctuary for protecting kids, not
a playgound for perverts, and this administration did nothing to
prevent that,'' said Michael Vaughn, who is representing the
children.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the claim alleges, one teacher was fired after she came
forward with accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the families say that Talazus and Osborn
Superintendent Wilma Basnett knew about the allegations as far back
as 1994 from complaints made by students, parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Romley, however, said that evidence he has seen did not give
cause to investigate Basnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not part of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indictment says that beginning in January 1994,
Talazus was informed of the reputed molestation of Longview
students. The reports allegedly continued to the end of December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says Talazus ``failed to immediately report or
cause reports to be made of such information to a municipal or
county peace officer or to the protective services of the state
department of economic security, in violation of (Arizona law).''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says Talazus ``knowingly caused or permitted
(a child's) health to be injured or to be placed in a situation
where his health was endangered, in violation of (Arizona law).''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who complained about what they believed Ruelas was doing
received short shrift, according to a notice of claims filed
against the district last month by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joanne Talazus made it clear that not only would any
complaints against Ron Ruelas be dismissed as false, but those
making such complaints would suffer the consequence,'' the claims
said. ``When a member of her faculty, Maxine Hotchkiss, complained
in writing about Ron Ruelas, she was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotchkiss said in an April interview that the teachers at
Longview were terrified of Talazus, and she protected Ruelas
because he acted as her ``snitch'' against other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do think she was trying to cover up for Ron,''
Hotchkiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The claim asserts that Talazus gave an alleged ``child molester
free rein of her campus and created an atmosphere where even
dedicated teachers were afraid to complain about Ruelas.''
</P>
<P>
   The notice of claims demand was a precursor to filing a
class-action lawsuit. Because the school is a government entity,
the plaintiffs must first file an administrative demand in which
the defendants have 90 days to respond, Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   The district now must decide whether to pay the demand, deny the
claim or do nothing until the 90 days expire. After that, Vaughn
said, the families can file a lawsuit. As of Wednesday, the
district has not responded to the claim, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the claims, Ruelas worked closely with students,
involving himself in both their school and home lives, helping with
homework, running after-school programs, and playing after-school
sports.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ruelas reportedly focused his attention primarily on
boys: ``As early as 1994, Longview Elementary staff observed that
`if it was a girl, forget it, that child would never get
counseled,' '' the claim stated.
</P>
<P>
   One student who alleges Ruelas molested him in 1994 told his
mother about his relationship with the counselor. His mother
immediately contacted the school.
</P>
<P>
   When Ruelas and Talazus confronted the student during a meeting,
the claim says, ``(the victim) was confronted with the allegations
and dismissed as someone who exaggerates things.''
</P>
<P>
   When the student approached teacher's aide Hotchkiss, she wrote
a two-page letter of complaint against Ruelas, which also was
ignored, Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Talazus) chose to ignore that warning and chose not to report
this complaint to (Child Protective Services) as required by law,''
Vaughn said. ``By doing that, it's our contention that she allowed
this guy to run rampant _ and now we have eight or nine victims.''
</P>
<P>
   In a police interview, Talazus admitted she was aware of a prior
allegations against Ruelas by two students, but that the situations
were resolved with the boys' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said he knew of no other situation where a school
official has been prosecuted for failing to take action when he or
she has knowledge of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have an outrageous situation, we are going to pursue
it in court,'' Romley said. &QL;

LAKERS FALL SHORT AGAINST SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO  &UR; _  &LR; New night, new plan.
</P>
<P>
   And how about this bit of unorthodox Los Angeles Lakers
strategy: Forget Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, swarmed into submission in Game 1, struggled
again Wednesday, but the Lakers found other means for beating the
San Antonio Spurs. The recipe was a little Rick Fox defense, a
little Glen Rice and a whole lot of Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   It worked just well enough to win. And fell just short enough to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were within one inbounds play of a victory, but a
bounced ball off Derek Fisher's head and a Tim Duncan turnaround
jumper in the waning seconds sent the Lakers to a 79-76 loss at the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   Down 0-2 in the best-of-seven series, the Lakers will try to
recover in the comfort of Los Angeles. Games 3 and 4 are at the
Forum this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat ourselves. A lot of mistakes at the end,'' O'Neal said
after scoring a postseason-low 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   But with a game-high 28 points from Bryant, 16 points from Rice
and stellar defense of Duncan by Fox, the Lakers were within
seconds of stealing a victory and negating the homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led by two when Bryant hit a 3-pointer to give the
Lakers a 76-75 lead with 34.2 seconds left. When Sean Elliott
airballed a 3-pointer at the other end, the Lakers appeared on the
verge of an upset. Then came the miscues, both strange and
unlikely:
</P>
<P>
   _Bryant, a 91-percent foul shooter in this postseason, missed
two free throws with 18.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   _With a foul to give, the Lakers failed to hit Duncan, who hit a
turnaround 9-footer for a 77-76 Spurs lead.
</P>
<P>
   _And then, the most bizarre play of all. Bryant, with 8.4
seconds left, inbounded the ball to Fisher in the frontcourt. But
the hard pass sailed through Fisher's hands, off his face and into
the hands of the Spurs' Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott hit two free throws to make it a three-point game,
and Bryant missed a desperation 30-foot shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the play just broke down,'' Bryant said of the
inbounds pass, which was not intended to go to Fisher initially and
was supposed to lead to a play for Bryant. Fisher, looking a little
dazed, wasn't sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I popped up to catch it. I don't know if he (Johnson) hit my
arm or I just took my eye off the ball. The ball bounced off my
face,'' he said. ``I take full responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started the fourth quarter on the bench as the Lakers
opened with a 10-2 run and took their biggest lead of the night,
69-63. But the Spurs answered quickly, scoring eight straight
points, capped by a Robinson jam.
</P>
<P>
   After making just one field goal in the first half, O'Neal
scored 10 points in the third quarter, but the Lakers never led by
more than a point and headed into the fourth down 61-59.
</P>
<P>
   In foul trouble and generally denied access to the paint, O'Neal
scored a hard-to-believe two points in the first half, while the
Spurs took as much as a 14-point lead. But the Lakers, behind 15
points from Bryant and 12 from Rice, retook the lead late in the
second quarter before settling for a 44-41 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a stroke of strategic genius or sheer desperation, the
Lakers climbed back with an unconventional lineup. Fox started the
second half at small forward, then shifted to power forward,
replacing Robert Horry, in a lineup with O'Neal, Rice, Bryant and
Fisher. That left the 6-foot-7 Fox guarding the 7-foot Duncan.
Somehow, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 12 points early in the second quarter, that unit put
together a 15-2 run behind five points from Rice and four straight
from Bryant to take go ahead 35-34 _ the Lakers' first lead of the
game. That stretch offered glimpses of the Lakers at their
defensive best. O'Neal blocking Duncan. Fisher pickpocketing Will
Perdue. A steal by Fox. And just one field goal by Duncan in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's second 3-pointer in three minutes put the Lakers up
38-36. But Malik Rose scored a quick six points and the Spurs
outscored the Lakers 8-3 to close out the half.
</P>
<P>
   The game opened Z_,Z ahe:

as it looks now, and as it looked when Tony Hiss's father, Alger
Hiss, occupied a cell there, convicted of perjury back in the 1950s
for saying he didn't pass secrets to Whittaker Chambers, an
admitted Communist spy. The plaque is the newest memento in the
Hiss apartment, the same two-bedroom flat on East Eighth Street
that Alger and Prossy Hiss rented in 1947, when they moved up from
Washington; the apartment where Tony Hiss grew up; the apartment
that Hiss, now 57, shares with his own son, Jacob, 7, and his wife,
Lois Metzger, who writes sophisticated novels for teen-agers. By

   POP-RESTAURANT (New York) _ Pop, which opened in April, is much
more than just a deafeningly hot eatery with no sign in front. Read
the menu. Not the entrees or appetizers: a page at the back, titled
``About Pop.'' It's a mouthful: ``Pop is based on the post-war
social idealism and trust in technological innovation, mass
production and pre-fabrication. While it resonates with this
mid-century American dream, Pop has been realized with
end-of-the-century means....'' The author is Ali Tayar, the
architect who conceived this 2,500-square-foot temple of
retro-contempo chic. By Rick Marin.

</P>
<P>
   HORSE-CHESTNUT (New York) _ I was in one of those
down-at-the-mouth moods one morning last week as my cab tore down
Fifth Avenue, when a horse-chestnut tree hailed me from Central
Park. Its pyramidal white blooms _ like giant vanilla cones _ rose
high above the other trees, and I could swear some kind of cosmic
wink passed between us. If you have ever seen a horse chestnut in
bloom you know how impossible it is to ignore. It stands on the
greensward like some king in full regalia: velvet, satin, jewels,
scepter, the tall, magnificent bearing. By Ann Raver.

ZEDILLO HAILS NEW ERA IN L.A. VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mexico's President Ernest Zedillo, in a
historic-three day visit to California, has offered praise for the
new relationship between his country and the state and a pledge to
work with Gov. Gray Davis to create ``a North American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have far to go,'' Zedillo said in a speech Wednesday to
Town Hall of Los Angeles. ``We now have a great friend here in
California (in Davis) who has made human relations a priority and
has declared Mexico the most important country for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``And California is important to Mexico. What happens in
California affects Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and Gov. Gray Davis came from Sacramento to Los Angeles
by train and were greeted at Union Station by Mayor Richard Riordan
and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan offered praise for both Davis and Zedillo in seeking a
harmonious relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Zedillo) recognizes, as we do, that we cannot prosper as
independent communities if we do not prosper in partnership,''
Riordan said. ``As we celebrate our history, we also embrace the
dawn of a new century and the hope for a new generation where our
people can share in the bounty of opportunity, prosperity and
partnership,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Davis and Riordan attempted frequent words and phrases in
Spanish, with the governor often referring to ``mi amigo.'' Riordan
said to Zedillo at one point, ``Nuestra casa es su casa.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who visited Zedillo on an official trip one month after
taking office, said his vision is to see California and Mexico
re-create the American dream as the North American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came to America for liberty, opportunity, prosperity,''
Davis said. ``We want to see equal access to education, health care
and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo credited Davis for the change in attitudes between the
two countries since his election and the retirement of Republican
Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   It was Proposition 187 banning many benefits to illegal
immigrants and Wilson's support for it that led to a chill in
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The voter-approved ballot measure has been blocked by the courts
from taking effect and Davis is seeking mediation on the matter,
which has angered many Latino officials. Zedillo, however, backed
the governor and said relations between California and Mexico have
never been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now your No.1 trading partner,'' Zedillo said.
``Just think how much better it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Davis and Zedillo agreed to create a computer hookup
between universities in California and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they announced California would create 15 trade
centers to work with companies to increase trade with Mexico. They
also announced plans by Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission and
America's Sempra Energy International to construct a 23-mile gas
pipeline, from the border to Rosarito to provide energy. Davis said
the project will include 500 jobs in California.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the U.S. Department of Transportation has approved a
$160,000 grant to study infrastructure needs along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also called for California authorities to work to
protect the human rights of all people, saying there had been some
problems with the treatment of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the day was spent in saluting one another.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo took note of the number of Mexican descendants living in
Los Angeles _ more than anywhere else in the world outside of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work hard and proud as (U.S.) citizens, but they do not
forget their heritage,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also talked of political reform that he is pushing on
his country, where his party will allow open primaries for the
first time in its 70-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer will an official be elected only because he is from
one party,'' Zedillo said. ``We are moving toward more democracy.
We find that nearly all the time, the people are right.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ They're just kids. NBA infants, really.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan have it all in front of them, all
right.
</P>
<P>
   But after a heart-stopping 79-76 San Antonio Spurs win that shed
so much light on the future _ and the present _ of these two
remarkable players, clearly Bryant has further to go.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan already has arrived. If he wasn't the heart and future of
the Spurs before, he certainly got there Wednesday night in a
dramatic, enlightening way.
</P>
<P>
   He did Most Valuable Player-type things, like he did all season.
He did what neither David Robinson nor anyone else in this
franchise's frustrating playoff history did much of before.
</P>
<P>
   With his father in town and watching from the Alamodome
grandstand, Duncan grabbed the ball on the low post, faked one way,
spun around poor Lakers defender J.R. Reid and softly and
confidently lofted the biggest hook shot of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most awesome feeling in the world,'' Duncan said.
``To have my dad here and hit that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan couldn't say much more. But he didn't have to. He showed
why he is the soul of a Spurs playoff drive that looks legitimately
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took Duncan to lift the Spurs upon his shoulders
and carry them to a 2-0 Western Conference semifinal playoff series
edge over the Los Angeles Lakers, he showed 33,293 fans and anyone
else who watched this thriller that he's not just ready to step up.
He already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim was huge,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``Like
always. Tim likes to take shots. We just looked at the matchup and
decided what fit this situation. He's not the kind of guy to get
flustered.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bryant tripped and fell face-first in this memorable
game, just when it seemed he was going to do Jordanesque things.
Just when Shaquille O'Neal was becoming the second option and
Bryant was spinning and elevating practically to the Alamodome
rafters, he flopped and then kicked the ground in frustration. Just
like a kid would do.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 28 points, grabbed eight rebounds, passed the ball
like a whiz and confounded the Spurs on virtually every possession.
He was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal yet again fought off wave after wave of big men
hacking at him inside, finishing with 16 points and eight rebounds,
Bryant flew everywhere. While O'Neal never was the first option in
the final critical seconds, Bryant stepped behind the 3-point line
and nailed a fadeaway go-ahead 3-pointer with less than a minute
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bryant crashed back down to earth. He showed that he
remains a work in progress. He showed that he's just a kid who can
make you laugh and make the Lakers cry.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took Bryant to clang a pair of potential
game-clinching free throws with 18 seconds remaining, that much
became so clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant stepped up to the line and talked a little garbage to the
Spurs' Mario Elie as the crowd begged for a miss. With the Lakers
up by one point and the Spurs looking for an answer offensively,
Bryant tossed the first free throw up, and when it bounced off, he
merely shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his eyebrows as if to say, ``Oh, well.'' But the next
one wasn't even close _ bouncing long and hard off the rim as if it
were O'Neal who shot it. Duncan grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the other end, there was Duncan again, showing all the
poise of a young player who might be 23 years old to Bryant's 20
but throughout the first two games of this tough, bitter series has
been decades more mature.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's eight-foot half-hook hit nothing but net. He pointed to
the crowd and showed some emotion. The only problem was DulCB9

   SEATTLE _ Both sides in the debate over agricultural
biotechnology say Americans likely and perhaps unwittingly eat more
genetically engineered food daily than consumers of any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of genetically modified foods say that's because the
public is not adequately informed. The United States, unlike other
nations, doesn't require labels that identify foods that have been
genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of agricultural biotechnology say such labeling is
unnecessary because U.S. consumers have faith in their system of
food safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has successfully fought labeling of genetically
engineered foods in this country,'' said Bill Aal, member of a
consumer advocacy group called Washington Biotechnology Action
Council. ``That's because they know consumers wouldn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bergau, a spokesman for agri-chemical giant Monsanto Co,
agreed that most people eat genetically modified food every day.
Bergau said his company has opposed labeling such food because of
the implicit message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labeling genetically modified food could mislead consumers by
implying that such foods are different or not safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires labels if any
alterations compromise safety or change the nutritional
characteristics of the food, Bergau said. A label that simply
states the food was genetically altered in some way isn't
reasonable or fair and ``implies something's wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics such as Aal contend that something is wrong if the
industry in the United States prevails in not informing consumers
about what they're eating.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling was one of the main topics of discussion Wednesday in
the first day of a two-day conference called Biodevastation 3. It
is being held in Seattle as a counterpoint to Bio '99, the annual
meeting of the international Biotechnology Industry Organization.

progress of biotechnology have been meeting all week at the

KATZENBERG WINS BIG ROUND IN BATTLE WITH DISNEY HEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once scorned in testimony as ``the little
midget,'' Jeffrey Katzenberg won a measure of revenge Wednesday
against Walt Disney Co. head Michael Eisner when a court referee
said Disney breached its fiduciary duty and owes him interest worth
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by retired Judge Paul Breckenridge does not specify
how much Katzenberg will receive, but the former studio chief
claims he is owed more than $250 million from a profits-based bonus
of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount will be decided in the trial's next phase, set
to begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just thrilled with the decision,'' said Katzenberg
lawyer Bonnie Eskenazi, declining to elaborate until the end of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's lawyers referred comment to a company spokesman who did
not return phone calls late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The company that Mickey Mouse built was victorious in at least
one regard. Breckenridge dismissed Katzenberg's fraud claim against
the company, calling it irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-page ruling, however, Breckenridge said Disney failed
in its fiduciary duty to treat Katzenberg fairly in business
matters, and the judge ordered the company to pay interest on the
yet-to-be-determined bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Because of past relationships with Eisner and former Disney
President Frank Wells, Katzenberg ``to some extent reposed trust
and confidence in Disney,'' Breckenridge wrote, and he said the
studio was required to account to him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found Disney owed Katzenberg the bonus on or about
Oct. 1, 1994, but broke its contract by not paying. No decision was
made about when the interest would start to accrue.
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge also ruled that the studio owes Katzenberg a share
of profits for merchandise it sells in its theme parks, retail
stores and other ``self-sourced'' outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said other issues will be determined later in the
trial, including an added payout to account for inflation and
whether Katzenberg will get a share of revenues from the upcoming
``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was little emotion in his writing, Breckenridge for
the most part backed Katzenberg in the ruling, coming to what he
called the inescapable conclusion that the former studio chief was
entitled to his bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The dry wording contrasted with what at times was emotional,
dramatic testimony from two of the most powerful men in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said during the trial that he brought the studio
``from worst to first'' during his reign from 1984 to 1994,
cranking out hits like ``The Lion King'' and ``Sister Act.''
</P>
<P>
   He sued in 1996 after Disney declined to pay his 2 percent bonus
on the profits of those hits, claiming he forfeited the bonus when
he quit two years before the end of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 settlement, Disney agreed to pay Katzenberg an
undisclosed sum, but several issues remained unresolved and the
court referee was called in to determine the final payout.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand earlier this month, Eisner said Katzenberg
had his moments of poor performance, too, and stuck to his
assertion that he forfeited the bonus when he left early.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not mention the soured relationship, as evidenced
in testimony from Eisner and Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Katzenberg's lawyer Bert Fields, Eisner admitted
he may have said ``I think I hate the little midget'' to a writer
who was taking notes for his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, who is at least a half-foot shorter than Eisner,
went on to form DreamWorks SKG with partners Steven Spielberg and
David Geffen.

<P>
   Bergau and thousands of others who celebrate the power and
progress of biotechnology have been meeting all week at the
Washington State Trade and Convention Center. Bio '99 closes on
Thursday as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so people gathered for the Biodevastation 3 meeting
were outnumbered, but most of the speakers said they believed U.S.
consumers were finally awakening to an issue being debated in
Europe and in industrialized countries elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crossroads,'' said Ronnie Cummins, director of the
Minnesota-based non-profit Campaign for Food Safety. The
biotechnology industry has promised to provide consumers with
better drugs, seeds and food, Cummins said, but many people are
recognizing those as empty promises.
</P>
<P>
   The use of bovine growth hormone, he said, was rejected by the
public despite Monsanto's massive public relations and lobbying
campaign. Consumers in Europe and Britain have demanded labeling
and are forcing supermarkets to offer foods guaranteed free of
genetically engineered products, Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Margulis, a member of Greenpeace, said the biotechnology
industry assures the public that genetic engineering is no
different from selective breeding. But the scientific community
isn't so assured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday, Margulis cited a report issued Monday by the
British Medical Association _ the U.K.'s equivalent of the American
Medical Association _ that urged caution and more study of
genetically modified food:
</P>
<P>
   ``The British Medical Association believes that any conclusion
upon the safety of introducing genetically modified materials into
the U.K. is premature as there is insufficient evidence to inform
the decision-making process at present,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Margulis said that while some genetically engineered foods are
allowed for distribution in the European Union, they are not
allowed to be grown as crops anywhere in Europe. Many Europeans, he
said, view the environmental risk from genetic engineering of crops
as akin to chemical pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're facing now is biological pollution,'' Margulis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergau and Libby Mikesell, spokeswoman for Bio '99, said
Britain's negative reaction to genetically engineered foods comes
from broader concerns and lack of confidence in food safety
following the so-called ``mad cow disease'' episode in which people
were sickened by tainted meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of debate in Europe now about the safety of
biotechnology,'' Mikesell said. ``Americans are more trusting of
their regulatory system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Welters, chief executive officer of an agricultural
biotechnology company called Phytowelt, thinks the lack of debate
over agricultural biotechnology in the United States is simply the
result of ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, Germany especially, we've been debating this for
more than 10 years,'' said Welters, who is a German citizen and was
one of the speakers and exhibitors at Bio '99. ``People are very
informed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welters said he finds the U.S. biotech industry's opposition to
labeling curious and perhaps counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's nothing to fear from genetic engineering, why do
they fear labeling their products?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Welters noted that the Germans do label genetically engineered
foods, and consumers don't appear too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany, I think many people are tired of hearing about the
threat of biotechnology,'' he said.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Wow.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Spurs' Avery Johnson summed up San Antonio's
79-76 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 of the Western
Conference semifinals Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, for Tim Duncan's game-winning shot with 8.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, for the Lakers' horrid execution down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And wow, for the Spurs' finally being able to win a big game in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs made all the big plays down the stretch before 33,293
at the Alamodome to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series,
which resumes Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a heck of a game,'' said San Antonio coach Gregg
Popovich. ``It was a great game for the fans, competitive from
beginning to end. We got after each other, and we were fortunate
enough to hit a shot down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   That shot came courtesy of Duncan, who dropped in a jumper over
the Lakers' J.R. Reid, giving the Spurs a one-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had the added inspiration of having his father, William,
in from the Virgin Islands to see his son hit the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome, just awesome, to have him here all the way
from St. Croix,'' Duncan said. ``To come in today and watch such a
great game, and to have an outcome like this, it's just really
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Which pretty much summed up the game _ exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were so overheated from the excitement that they
forgot they had a foul to give when Duncan was lining up his
game-winner. Instead of hacking away and making the Spurs take the
ball out of bounds, the Lakers stood by and watched the ball leave
Duncan's hands and settle into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to blade him (Duncan),'' said
Johnson, referring to a hard foul. ``I don't know what happened. I
thought they were going to foul Mario (Elie, as he maneuvered the
ball upcourt), and I thought, `Wow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Tim got the ball and they didn't foul, so I was like,
`Wow! Wow!' I was glad they didn't foul because that would have
disrupted our whole offense.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no wows associated with either the Lakers' ``Man of
Steel,'' Shaquille O'Neal, or their ``Boy Wonder,'' 20-year-old
Kobe Bryant, neither of whom could deliver the win for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   It was more like bow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that the hype over Bryant being the next
Michael Jordan is starting to cool off, kind of like Bryant down
the stretch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had cranked up the hype machine when he drilled a
fadeaway 3-pointer with 36.8 seconds left that gave the Lakers a
brief one-point lead, but he did nothing but trip, stumble and fall
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   First, he missed two free throws with 18.1 seconds to play that
would have given the Lakers a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Bryant, who finished with a game-high
28 points. ``Some strange stuff happens sometimes. I missed them
because my release was horrible. It was odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like the rest of the fourth quarter. Bryant then turned
the ball over on the inbounds play with 6.8 seconds left, ignoring
a wide-open Rick Fox and trying to zing the ball to Derek Fisher
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott finally capped a 19-point night by draining two
free throws that put the Spurs up 79-76 with just 5.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant then misfired on a potential game-tying 3-point attempt
as time expired, closing out a thoroughly frustrating final period.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly Jordanesque by any stretch of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal, who vowed revenge after a less-than-stellar effort
in Game 1 of the series, suffered through a foul-plagued 16-point
night, making just two of his 10 free throws and turning the ball
over four times.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more amazing than the finish was how different this game
turned out than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The way everyone was talking, this was supposed to be a slugfest
of epic proportions. It was supposed to be so gory that TV
executives were salivating at the chance to turn it into one of
those real-life, caught-on-camera shows, something like World's
Scariest Basketball Videos.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be the revenge of O'Neal, who had been
manhandled by the Spurs and ignored by the referees in Game 1, then
fined by the NBA when he complained about it.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was rough, as the combined total of 51 personal fouls
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hardly the melee most everyone anticipated after the
physical first game of the series. What it turned out to be was a
hard-fought, grind-it-out victory for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   A victory with an exciting finish, courtesy of Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Duncan likes to take that shot,'' said Popovich of the
game-winner. ``David Robinson likes to take that shot, but we
looked at the matchups out there and figured that in this
particular situation, Tim was the guy to go to. It worked out for
us. He's not going to be flustered by what happens in a game, good
or bad. He just competes, and he goes home.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ The Astros have been like a gang of Supermen with
bats, doing more damage than a team of locomotives and leaping all
over some unsuspecting pitcher on a nightly basis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the mere sight of Kevin Brown standing on a pitcher's mound
has the effect of kryptonite on the National League's most potent
offense. As he has done so many times before, Brown on Wednesday
night zapped the life out of the Astros with a dominant pitching
performance that doomed them long before the outcome was decided.
</P>
<P>
   Brown held the Astros to four hits in eight innings to key the
Los Angeles Dodgers' 5-2 victory, which snapped the Astros'
three-game road winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said in
reference to being on the wrong side of Brown's mastery. ``Same
stuff, different venue. Brown was dominant as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds pitched effectively for seven innings, but it
would have taken a near-perfect effort to beat Brown, whose only
mistake turned into a solo homer for Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw replaced Brown (5-2) in the ninth, and
Bagwell belted his first pitch into the left-center-field pavilion
for the 16th multiple-homer game of his career. But any hopes of an
Astros comeback quickly faded as Shaw retired the next three
batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the offense we have, we normally have about a 50-50
chance to get back into almost any game,'' Dierker said. ``But when
you're going against the cream of the crop, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bagwell's homer, Brown allowed singles to
Reynolds, Tim Bogar and Craig Biggio, and that was the extent of
the Astros' offense against their longtime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros matched their lowest hit total (five) of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is the toughest pitcher to hit in the National
League,'' said Bagwell, who has 13 homers this season. ``It's
always a battle against him. He's tough. Against him, you have to
capitalize when you have opportunities, and we haven't had very
many opportunities against him. Some of the stuff he was throwing
was just filthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense was red-hot before Wednesday, but no one
cools them off like Brown, who lowered his career ERA against
Houston to 1.60. The Astros have scored only eight runs in six
career games against the Dodgers' $105 million man.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, the Astros had outscored their opponents 63-27
in their last seven games _ a stretch during which they hit .340
and won six times. Only four of their 23 wins have come when they
scored four or fewer runs, and they have yet to win a game with a
run total lower than three.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wednesday's game) didn't surprise me,'' said Astros center
fielder Carl Everett, who was 0-for-4 and one of Brown's eight
strikeout victims. ``He left pitches over the dish. Everyone had
pitches to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for pitches that he doesn't even throw.
Everyone was talking about sliders and cutters; he threw an
occasional splitter, but it was basically his fastball, and we're a
good fastball-hitting team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers second baseman Eric Young missed Tuesday's game because
of leg soreness, but his wheels were turning just fine on his
leadoff double in the first inning. He moved to third on a wild
pitch and scored on Gary Sheffield's sacrifice fly to right field.
The Dodgers pushed their lead to 2-0 in the second when Mark
Grudzielanek's two-out single chased home Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch a very smart game,'' Reynolds said. ``The pitch
to Karros, I hung it. Brown always keeps his team in the game, and
those runs I gave up early cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros were being pistol-whipped by Brown, who
retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced and didn't allow a
run until Bagwell's opposite-field solo home run in the fourth.
Bagwell joined Jack Howell and Bill Spiers as the only players on
the Astros' roster to have homered against Brown in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' two-run homer off Reynolds (6-3) gave the Dodgers a
three-run lead in the bottom of the fourth. It was the fourth homer
Reynolds has allowed this season. But Reynolds, who is 1-2 with a
7.88 ERA in his last three starts, settled down and retired seven
of the 10 batters he faced after Karros' home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't been hitting my spots or making pitches in my
last few starts,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added an insurance run in the eighth on Todd
Hundley's RBI single off Jay Powell.

   SAN ANTONIO  &UR; _  &LR; Somewhere between their airport hotel and the
Alamodome, the Los Angeles Lakers team bus took a wrong turn
Wednesday and ended up in the Bizarro World.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain Shaquille O'Neal, the 16-point scoring

</P>

<P>

   The 79-76 defeat left the Lakers down 0-2 in the best-of-seven
conference semifinal series as they return home. And dazed by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball takes weird bounces for you sometimes,'' said 16-year
veteran Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Never more so than in the final minute of Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were up by two when Bryant hit a 3-pointer to give the
Lakers a 76-75 lead with 34.2 seconds left. When Sean Elliott
airballed a 3-pointer at the other end, the Lakers seemed on the
verge of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the unlikely miscues:
</P>
<P>
   _Bryant, a 91-percent foul shooter in this postseason, missed
two free throws with 18.9 seconds left, squandering the chance to
extend the lead to three.
</P>
<P>
   _With a foul to give, the Lakers failed to hit Tim Duncan, who
hit a turnaround 9-footer with 8.9 seconds left for a 77-76 Spurs
lead.
</P>
<P>
   _And then, the most bizarre play of all. With 8.4 seconds on the
clock, Bryant inbounded the ball to Fisher in the frontcourt. But
the hard pass sailed through Fisher's hands and off his face, then
into the hands of the Spurs' Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott hit two free throws to make it a three-point game, and
Bryant missed a desperation 30-foot shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for Bryant, the Lakers' best clutch player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange stuff happened,'' he said. And the missed free throws
with the game on the line? ``The last time that happened, I think I
was in eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   But the game was unorthodox from the start.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal again struggling under the weight of the
Spurs' swarming defense, the Lakers made O'Neal bait for extra
defenders, letting him set up plays for Bryant (game-high 28
points) and Glen Rice (16 points).
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers found a new answer to the multitalented Duncan.
They threw 6-foot-7 Rick Fox at the 7-footer. It worked just well
enough, as Duncan missed 11 of 19 shots and settled for 21 points.
It's just those two last ones that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat ourselves. A lot of mistakes at the end,'' O'Neal said
after scoring a postseason-low 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was the inbounds pass from Bryant to Fisher. The play
was supposed to go elsewhere, and eventually back to Bryant for a
drive to the hoop. But Fisher was the first to break free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the play just broke down,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wasn't sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I popped up to catch it. I don't know if he (Johnson) hit my
arm or I just took my eye off the ball. The ball bounced off my
face,'' he said. ``I take full responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started the fourth quarter on the bench as the Lakers
opened with a 10-2 run and took their biggest lead of the night,
69-63. But the Spurs answered quickly, scoring eight straight
points, capped by a David Robinson jam, to retake the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more weirdness. Down 73-71, O'Neal scored an apparent
basket with 1:37 left but was called for an offensive foul. Duncan
was called for an offensive foul at the other end in an apparent
make-up call. Then O'Neal got a break in his favor, putting down a
Fox miss and avoiding a goaltending call to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another long night for O'Neal, who picked up two
fouls in the first quarter and scored just two points in the first
half. Still, the Lakers were within millimeters of a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances again, is all I can say,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance: a pair of free throws from Bryant. After all
the games he's won in the fourth quarter this year, the misses were
the most shocking thing of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe is clutch, man. He's a clutch guy,'' Harper said. ``It's
a credit to him that guys are shocked when he misses, and I think
everybody was surprised. I called them good right off the bat. I
was happy that it was him going to the line, because I've seen him
step up and knock them down. Unfortunately, he couldn't this
time.''

BROWN IS JUST WHAT DODGERS ORDERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers needed innings. Kevin
Brown provided them. They needed a stabilizing force. Brown, for a
night, provided that.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, the Dodgers needed a win to avoid their
longest losing streak of the season. Brown delivered that, too.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Kevin Brown demonstrated why he is Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed four hits and struck out eight in eight innings as
the Dodgers beat the Houston Astros 5-2 Wednesday at Dodger Stadium
to end a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's third straight win. Since getting battered for
five runs on opening day, Brown (5-2) has allowed 13 earned runs in
his past 58 innings, a 2.02 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best pitcher in the game,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said.
``Every time out he comes up with something new. It killed me in
the first inning with (Craig) Biggio. We go slider and he goes hard
cutter. You have to be on your toes with him because he'll make up
arm angles every night.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hundley tries to block balls zipping from every angle
around the plate, batters try to solve Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Since yielding those five runs to Arizona to begin the season,
opponents haven't had much success. Brown has allowed two earned
runs in his last 32 innings at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers (21-18)
are 6-3 in games Brown starts, and Brown is 3-0 following a Dodgers
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get comfortable,'' Brown said. ``There's
always room for improvement. I'll take eight innings with one run
any time as far as the results go.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown admitted the job is easier with an early lead. Gary
Sheffield's first-inning sacrifice fly and Mark Grudzielanek's
run-scoring single in the second gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros ended a four-week home run drought
with a two-run shot in the fourth to give the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.
It was Karros' first homer in 77 at-bats dating back to April 24
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this will allow us to be considered a decent team for
another day,'' said Karros, who was 3 for 4. ``You don't have to
tell me how long it's been since the last (homer). It's no secret I
haven't been swinging the bat well, but it's not going to last all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The only run Brown allowed to the Astros came via the long ball.
Houston's Jeff Bagwell hit a solo homer to right field with one out
in the fourth. After giving up eight homers last season with San
Diego, Brown's allowed seven this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall play of the Dodgers is more pressing to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get consistent and start playing solid ball,''
Brown said. ``I don't think we played up to our potential to this
point. Hopefully, we'll get our stride here and start rolling some
off.''
</P>
<P>
   With the way the Dodgers' starters not named Brown have
struggled to provide innings, Brown's outing was not only welcomed,
but anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the Dodgers battled to pitch into the seventh
inning, Brown's completed at least seven innings in his past three
starts. He's allowed one run in each of those outings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' next hope is that it rubs off on the rest of the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mostly hard, right at guys,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Chan Ho (Park) and (Ismael) Valdes, they're capable
of doing it, (but) maybe not as consistently as Brown''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't allow a hit and struck out five through three
innings. His only mistake came on his first pitch to Bagwell with
one out in the fourth but that was all Houston would get as Brown
improved to 2-2 with a 1.60 ERA in six career starters against the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) doesn't get himself into trouble,'' Karros said.
``It's why it wasn't a struggle to get five innings from him.
That's why he's here.''

TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easiest job in the city?
</P>
<P>
   No, not mine. I mean easiest official city job.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be Cable-Car Push Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Because the three cable car turntables are creaky and balky
(which, coincidentally, is the name of MUNI's law firm), many
gripmen and conductors have suffered injuries pushing the cars
around on the tables, leading to missed days and many lawsuits. As
a stop-gap, MUNI hired  &LR; il,6l,6p6  &LR; five young men to help push.
</P>
<P>
   These ``Public Service Aides'' ($8.65 per hour) give a car a
nudge on the table every 15 minutes or so, then go rest.
</P>
<P>
   The gripman/conductor teams tell me they appreciate the
third-man assist, except that too few of those shifts get filled.
Implementation of the third-man plan, one grip tells me, ``is up to
MUNI standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the funky-clunky tables are costing the city millions
in lost worker time and lawsuits and now extra salaries (and maybe
injuries to come) for the pushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started (on the cable cars) in '67,'' conductor Gary Ryan
tells me at the Powell-Market turnaround, ``and back then, you
could load the car on the table and turn it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pantomimes a soft push with his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's no car on the table, but I lean against the push-rail.
Nothing. I lean harder. The table creaks slowly and lurches slowly
around. And I'm one powerful mutha.
</P>
<P>
   It's like pushing a stalled car out of an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   MUNI plans a two-phase fix. First a tune-up, jack up the tables
and see what they can straighten and tweak without much trouble.
Then a major overhaul of all three turntables, which could take at
least 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm suing MUNI for a blown-out back.
</P>
<P>
   OY DANNY BOY: Dan Quayle's speech Wednesday at the Commonwealth
Club was billed, even by Dan, as a punchy sequel to his famous '92
``Murphy Brown'' family-values speech, same club, same town.
</P>
<P>
   Did Son of Murphy surpass the original? The artistic equivalent
would be George Lucas' next ``Star Wars'' movie featuring the
special effects of ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Dull? Dan is the Muzak Man.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, I attended the speech hoping to find a reason to praise
Quayle. He thought enough of our city to deliver a key speech here.
Besides, the old Quayle spelling jokes are getting stale. A new
millennium is coming _ let's give him a new chance.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for me to swim against the Quayle-bashing tide: A
brand new Chronicle TV commercial. The premise: Columnist's career
revitalized by Quayle's entry into presidential race, guaranteeing
ample cheap-shot-joke fodder. Footnote: Columnist happens to be me.
</P>
<P>
   Cute ad, but why not fool 'em in real life by praising Danny?
Maybe next time.
</P>
<P>
   CHEAP PUBLICITY STUNT? That's what it looked like when ``Rent''
hit town in February and staged an all-comers cast tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Cute gimmick: Play about starving artists lures hundreds of the
real thing to a mass audition, thus hyping the product. Like they
were really going to pluck a kid off our streets and make him or
her a star.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they did pluck one lucky pluckee.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Manabat, graduate of Lowell High and Cal-Berkeley, was
working the phones for an S.F. mortgage house _ and doing some
moonlight local amateur theater work _ when the ``Rent'' auditions
were announced.
</P>
<P>
   He sang ``Runaround Sue,'' knocked out the producers, and now
he's rehearsing for the role of Steve in one of the two ``Rent''
road companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jake quit his day job.
</P>
<P>
   SLAM THIS: It was impressive when 16-year-old Biko Eisen-Martin,
a junior at Branson School, won a national poetry slam last month.
But Tuesday night Biko moved up a level, competing against 11 local
adult poets.
</P>
<P>
   A slam, by the way, isn't a roses-are-red recital. It's part
poetry, part rap, part power-performance. Biko's poem is about the
New York incident where several cops gunned down an unarmed
immigrant. Biko's slam blew away the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step up here and accept your first prize, Biko,'' said the
emcee. ``Biko? Anyone seen Biko?''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, Biko's pal: ``He left. He had to go
do his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   IT TAKES A VILLAGE: Car parked on Mason near the cable car barn
Wednesday, parking patrol officer notices car has unauthorized
resident sticker. Tow time.
</P>
<P>
   But the car is wedged into a tight space, so it takes one hour,
seven parking patrol officers and three cops to do the deed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three local banks were robbed. Just kidding!
</P>
<P>
   YO DANNY BOY: It's not hopeless. All you need is a little
charisma and fire to balance the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Julia Child. In a recent Biography magazine profile, notes
Alvin Guthertz, Child says for ``comfort food,'' she prefers raw
meat and gin.
</P>
<P>
   Or for a family-values veep, someone who has played a strong
role in a solid nuclear family, the antithesis of Murphy Brown _
how about Bart Simpson?  &LR;

 MONSTER STORMS BLOW ACROSS THE RED PLANET  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers capturing images from the Hubble Space telescope
have detected a monstrous cyclone raging over a vast area of Mars,
and they predicted &LR;  that more storms are likely to develop now that
Martian summertime is warming the planet's northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system near the North Pole of Mars covered an area
four times larger than the state of Texas, the astronomers said _
but because the upper atmosphere of Mars is so thin, it apparently
kicked up little, if any, dust from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce storm was first detected April 27 and continued to
blow for at least three days, said Jim Bell, the Cornell University
astronomer who led the team that tracked it. Bell observed it again
six hours after the telescope transmitted the first sign of the
storm, and it seemed to be already dissipating, he said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble telescope flies in Earth orbit at an altitude of 300
miles, but despite its superb ability to observe planets, stars and
galaxies at high resolution, it cannot determine the speed of a
windstorm. Bell estimated that at its height, the cyclone's winds
must have been swirling at 200 miles an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the storm cloud's spectrum indicated that the winds
were composed of clouds of water ice like similar storm systems on
Earth. The water originated in the ice cap of the North Pole, and
apparently rose after the frozen carbon dioxide that makes up most
of the cap had dissipated as the planet warmed under the summer
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Warming is only relative, however, because the surface
temperature of the polar cap is now roughly a frigid 9 degrees
Fahrenheit, although the temperature of the upper atmosphere where
the storm winds blow is a far colder 100 degrees below zero, Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The large difference in temperature between the polar cap and
the planet's summertime upper atmosphere is what probably created a
low-pressure vortex, with rising air causing clouds to form _ a
phenomenon similar to hurricanes on Earth, the Hubble scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge cyclone, they noted, was very different from the dust
storms that frequently rage over the surface of Mars. Dust storms
were first observed by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 when one
violent cloud of sandy dust obscured the view from the orbiting
spacecraft's cameras and took more than three weeks to settle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the Pathfinder spacecraft on Mars also encountered
brief sandstorms, but weather instruments atop its slender mast
clocked the surface winds at only 20 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Viking orbiter spacecraft of 1976, which maintained contact
with two Mars landers on the surface in a vain search for evidence
of living organisms, also detected three cyclonic windstorms in the
Martian atmosphere, but the recent huge windstorm that Bell and his
team discovered was at least three times larger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cyclone's ``eye'' was nearly 200 miles in diameter.
The entire storm covered an area nearly 1,100 miles across and 900
miles long _ larger than the entire North polar ice cap itself,
Bell said. The planet should see more similar storms over the next
few months during the Martian summer, he said. &LR;

 ZEDILLO'S PLEA TO CALIFORNIA'S MEXICANS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico came to the
heart of Mexican America Wednesday to tell his former countrymen he
is doing all he can to end the ``severe poverty and injustice''
that forced them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   During a busy day of speeches, Zedillo tailored his message to
Los Angeles' more than 3 million residents of Mexican descent in
what seemed like a plea for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   A town hall meeting, hosted by Spanish-language KMEX-TV,
presented Zedillo with a challenging format _ a series of
hard-hitting pre-filmed vignettes about the Mexican population
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a Mexican migrant worker froze to death crossing the
desert border near the Imperial Valley. In another, a Central
Valley farmworker said he could not return to his home in Mexico
because there is no work there.
</P>
<P>
   When Zedillo was asked by the show's moderator what he was doing
to prevent these tragedies, the president squirmed in his seat, but
answered gamely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting the severe poverty and sometimes dramatic
inequality that still exist in Mexico,'' he said. ``These problems
are not going to be resolved quickly, and they will require many
years of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo faced a tough sell. His audience seemed to appreciate
his coming to California and speaking about his country's problems.
But many did not accept his message. Traditionally, many Mexican
immigrants have opposed Zedillo's PRI party, which has held power
for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's working to make things better, but I don't see it
having much results,'' said audience member Sergio Rubalcava, an
office worker with the city's Metropolitan Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   His fiancee, Isabel Martinez del Campo, a school teacher, seemed
to lump all politicians together, blaming all sides for the demise
of bilingual education, a result of Proposition 227 in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything starts with the children, and many times I get
children who can't understand English, but I can't help them,'' she
said. ``What is going to change? I don't see anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   Approved by voters last June, Proposition 227 called for
dismantling the state's bilingual education program in favor of a
one-year immersion course in English.
</P>
<P>
   The TV session was broadcast live on KMEX and other affiliates
of the Univision network, across California and Mexico, to an
audience of tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said he has increased social spending from 5.5 percent
of gross domestic product to 9 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
   But another audience member, Noel Garcia, who is teaching in Los
Angeles on a government teacher exchange program with Mexico and
who was profiled in one of the show's vignettes, said Zedillo was
full of bunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's working to fight poverty, but his economic
programs are worsening it,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo made a broad appeal to his Los Angeles audience, a huge
group that calls both countries home. ``Work hard to be good
citizens of this country, winning respect by working hard to
fulfill your objectives,'' he told his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't forget your roots or that you are the descendants of
a reality, a culture that began 30 centuries ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has the second-largest Mexican population of any
city, trailing only Mexico City. In addition to the giant audience
of KMEX, the largest television station in Los Angeles, the city's
top two radio stations are Spanish-language.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's visit is having a big effect on the Mexican American
population throughout California, said Marcela Medina, vice
president and general manager of Univision affiliate KDTV, Channel
14 in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo ``is raising awareness about what's happening in
Mexico,'' she said. ``People are watching very closely. I'm amazed
at how aware people are about political issues in Mexico, even
though they work here and live here.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began the second day of his three-day trip in San
Francisco, where he met with business leaders and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While Gov. Gray Davis and California politicians view the visit
as a way to bolster their image among the state's Hispanic voters,
Zedillo has other agenda items, including promoting foreign
investment in his nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has already become a major trading partner despite a
political chill since 1994, when voters passed Proposition 187, the
anti-illegal immigrant measure championed by former Governor Pete
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a result of this chill, Texas exported nearly twice
the value of goods to Mexico in 1998 as California did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of a more propitious political environment,
growth in investment and trade might have been more dynamic,''
Zedillo said Wednesday of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is enormous. We can do better,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's aides put it more bluntly. Trade expansion during the
Wilson years was only the ``natural growth related to NAFTA,'' the
North American Free Trade Agreement, his spokesman, David Najera,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``California was clearly looking to Asia,'' he said. ``The
political ambience in Sacramento didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Zedillo ends his stay in Los Angeles by joining Davis
in reading to pupils at Breed Elementary School, which has a
largely Latino student body. He will then travel to San Diego.

 IN LATEST S.F. SPEECH, QUAYLE BLAMES THE LAWYERS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Attempting to reclaim the family values issue
that made him the focus of a national debate seven years ago, GOP
presidential hopeful Dan Quayle lambasted America's ``legal
aristocracy'' Wednesday for weakening parental control and
launching ``a crusade against basic moral principles in the
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spoke before an audience of 200 at the Commonwealth Club
of California in San Francisco in what his campaign touted as a
major address to mark the anniversary of his now-famous 1992
``Murphy Brown'' speech lamenting the decline in American family
values.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the former vice president warned that America cannot
expect a ``quick fix'' to the problems that led to the massacre in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' he said. ``It is not just gun control, it's
self-control.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle then accused lawsuit-happy attorneys and children's
rights advocates of turning schools into a ``value-free zone'' that
undermines culture, religious values and parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allowed our legal system to distort and deny the role
of faith in American life,'' said Quayle. ``This puts our children
in charge, when the parents should be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   But his ``Values Matter Most'' address appeared to lack the fire
of the now-famous speech that blasted Murphy Brown, the popular TV
single mom, for ``mocking the importance of fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made no reference to any of today's popular TV and film
characters. Indeed, in an interview with The Chronicle later,
Quayle appeared entirely unconcerned with two of the nation's
current cultural obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   On TV's ``Ally McBeal,'' the randy single attorney who has
lusted after her married colleague, Quayle said only, ``I'm vaguely
familiar with that'' and admitted he's never seen the show.
</P>
<P>
   And asked for comment on the national mania surrounding the
opening of the new ``Star Wars'' episode, Quayle said, ``I guess
it's starting today in San Francisco?''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle had few words about the movie's emphasis on a supreme
``force'' watching over all or the intergallactic battles it
highlights. ``The violence in this movie is a force of good over
evil. ... It's not the kind of violence people are criticizing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Quayle took the podium, one of his GOP rivals
accused him of recycling an old theme.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, in an interview
with The Chronicle, argued that Quayle was echoing Bauer's
long-running calls to stop the ``judicial elites'' who would remove
education and religious values from daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I welcome him
aboard,'' said Bauer. The Christian commentator charged that Quayle
may even share blame for the appointment of judges who have
weakened parents' rights and religious values because ``many of
them (were) appointed by the Bush administration,'' in which Quayle
was the No. 2 man. But Quayle Wednesday laid the blame for the
nation's ``cultural decline'' on the legal system _ specifically,
the ``aristocracy'' of lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of QUAYLE20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  And the ``legal aristocracy has not worked alone,'' he said.
``It's been aided by a compliant news media and an entertainment
community that transmits counterculture values.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``self-appointed, powerful group (lives) in gated
communities and sends their children to expensive private schools.
This is their world. But, folks, it is not the real world,'' Quayle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help when O.J. Simpson can get away with double
murder, and a president like Bill Clinton gets away with perjury
and obstruction of justice,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   There were mixed reactions in the San Francisco audience, which
applauded politely but was hardly fired up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be interesting to hear what he has to
say,'' said Democratic San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki, a
Commonwealth Club member. ``It's the curiosity of watching the
captain of the Titanic playing himself out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in him,'' said Carmen Donlon, of San Francisco. ``I
really pray he'll have an opportunity to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle's biggest responses came not during his speech but
when he had a chance to take audience questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's true I did not invent the Internet,'' said Quayle,
in a dig at Vice President Al Gore, who recently made the claim
after he was asked about technology. ``But I did invent
spellcheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about Texas Governor George W. Bush _ the son
of his former boss _ running for president, Quayle said Bush should
be asked, ``How does it feel to be running against your father's
handpicked vice president?''
</P>
<P>
   After Quayle suggested that the Ten Commandments be posted on
classroom walls, he was asked about citizens with other than
Judeo-Christian origins. There is no harm in allowing them to post
a statement of ``their moral values,'' he replied, if ``we
essentially agree with what is right and what is wrong. So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his message would turn off moderates, Quayle launched
into a defense of conservative values, saying Middle America would
understand his calls for reform _ and stand with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not leading the GOP over the cliff; we're going to
lead the GOP on to victory,'' he said. ``A party that does not have
the courage of its convictions is a party that will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle added that the GOP ``failed in these last two elections
because we did not have a bold, forthright agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But left unsaid was the reminder that the 1992 GOP presidential
ticket, one of those to which he referred, consisted of President
George Bush _ and Vice President Dan Quayle.

 A KNIGHT TO REMEMBER: LIAM NEESON IN `STAR WARS'

 Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Liam Neeson
in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some days Liam Neeson spends his time working with Oscar-winning
actors like Ben Kingsley, Meryl Streep and Debra Winger.
 &HT;    Other days, he's playing opposite Jar-Jar Binks.
 &HT;    Actually, Neeson says, the challenge of playing a character like
his Oscar-nominated role in Steven Spielberg's acclaimed 1993 drama
``Schindler's List'' isn't that different from playing Jedi knight
Qui-Gon Jinn opposite the computer-generated Jar-Jar in ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day, you still have to act,'' Neeson says.
``There's still something you have to convey and share, be it
`Where's the nearest spacecraft? Let's get out of here' or whatever
other line you can think of.
 &HT;    ``You can't take it lightly or try to overplay it.''
 &HT;    Neeson brings genuine warmth and humanity to his ``Phantom
Menace'' role as mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and
protector to young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). But he says he
signed on not for the chance to wield a lightsaber or intone ``May
the Force be with you'' _ though he admits that that was ``cool'' _
but to work with the franchise's very own Yoda, writer/director
George Lucas.
 &HT;    ``George is the ultimate Jedi master,'' Neeson says during a
conversation at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan. ``You know that his
knowledge of cameras and his competency at making movies and
telling stories on celluloid is extraordinary, but he never forces
that on you _ it's just a given.
 &HT;    ``His direction was just perfect for what we were doing,'' the
actor says. ``Eight times out of 10 his direction would be, `Speak
a little faster on that line' or `When you turn, pick him up with
your right hand instead of your left.'
 &HT;    ``What he does is employ you because you're a good carpenter,
because you're a good actor, because you're a good scenic
designer,'' Neeson concludes. ``And then he lets you get on with
it.''
 &HT;    His performance as Qui-Gon, the Irishman reveals, combined
elements of Lucas and of Alan Ladd as the lone gunslinger in the
classic 1953 Western ``Shane,'' with a bit of Alec Guinness's regal
turn as a Jedi elder in ``Star Wars'' thrown in for continuity's
sake.
 &HT;    As for the lightsaber duels with the lethal Darth Maul (Ray
Park), Neeson benefited from the training he received years ago as
a top-ranked amateur boxer. The broadsword style he learned for the
1995 period epic ``Rob Roy'' didn't hurt, either.
 &HT;    Neeson spent much of the shoot acting in front of blue screens
and ``reacting'' to special effects and computer-generated
characters that would be added long afterward. Many actors are
thrown by this sort of thing, but Neeson says it doesn't make that
big a difference.
 &HT;    ``Acting is a leap of the imagination,'' he says. ``It's
`Imagine you're a king' or `Imagine you're a fairy.'
 &HT;    ``As wonderful as the technology _ the hovercrafts and the
machines _ was on `Star Wars,' it was the actors who sold it with
their nonchalance,'' he adds. ``To them, it was everyday stuff.
Mark Hamill jumps into his speedster and _ phooooph! _ he's off.
 &HT;    ``He sold it as much as the magicians did afterwards, and I
tried to do the same.''
 &HT;    While the faithful revel in ``Star Wars'' mania, slurping soda
from Qui-Gon cans, stockpiling Queen Amidala action figures and
seeking to find deep meaning in the apparently immaculate
conception of Anakin, Neeson is still pondering the whole
phenomenon.
 &HT;    ``It is just a film, but maybe for some little 9-or-10-year-old
boy it's something else,'' he says thoughtfully.
 &HT;    ``The whole culture around `Star Wars' is fascinating and kind
of strange to me,'' the actor says. ``It has something to do with
the psyche of all of us as human beings that we recognize these
incredible mythological stories, these fairy tales. Fairy tales
exist to bring a very complex world into an understandable form
that helps us through life.''
 &HT;    Neeson's next role is as a ghostbuster in Jan De Bont's horror
movie ``The Haunting,'' opening on July 23. Then he'll play a
neurotic spy opposite Sandra Bullock in ``Gun Shy'' and, he hopes,
star in an adaptation of ``Asylum'' with Natasha Richardson, his
wife and the mother of their two young sons.
 &HT;    And who knows, you may spot him at your neighborhood multiplex,
taking in ``The Phantom Menace.'' He does plan to catch it again,
he says.
 &HT;    ``I've seen it once,'' he says. ``It was like being very hungry
and having somebody bring in a tray of all your favorite foods _
but you only have time to grab the French fries before the tray is
taken away.''
 &HT;    Neeson laughs.
 &HT;    ``So I need to see it a few more times just to digest it all.''

 &HT;    Six injured in school shooting
 &HT;    By Mike Morris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Six students at a suburban Atlanta high school
were injured today in a shooting and authorities had a suspect in
custody, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injuries was believed to be life-threatening, said
Bonnie Knight, a spokeswoman for Rockdale County schools.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage High School officials said the person who fired the
shots was arrested shortly after the shooting, which occurred about
8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came exactly a month after the April 20 slaughter
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where two students
killed 13 people before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Today's shooting occurred on the final day of classes for
Heritage seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale Hospital was preparing its emergency room to treat the
victims, but none had arrived by 8:45 a.m., said spokeswoman Susan
Esslinger. Later, Rockdale sheriff's officials said five people
were sent to that hospital and a sixth to another unidentified
hospital. School and sheriff's officials held a news conference at
9:45 a.m. on the school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Parents rushed to the school after radio and television reports
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody at work heard it on the radio,'' said Darlene Gomez,
29, who was rushing up Ga. Highway 138 past a long line of school
buses that were sent to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to call the school,'' Gomez said. ``I tried to page my
daughter. I'm a nervous wreck. I've got three kids up there.''
Students at the school were milling about the school's athletic
fields an hour after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Student Brittany Bennett, speaking from her home to WAGA-TV,
said concerned parents were arriving at the school before emergency
workers did.
</P>
<P>
   Other students were being bused home shortly after 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One victim had what appeared to be a serious foot injury,
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Chris Heck, said the suspect is a 15-year-old
sophomore at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this person. I've had classes with him and all that,''
Heck told WAGA. ``He wasn't like anybody who would do something
like that,'' Heck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him on a first-name basis,'' said another student
interviewed by WAGA. ``I guess he just broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, the shots were fired at approximately
8:03 a.m. By 8:07, officers from the Rockdale County Sheriff's and
Conyers Police departments arrived and the suspect was arrested at
8:12.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place at a common area of the school, near the
cafeteria, where many students gather for breakfast and to
socialize before the 8:15 a.m. opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bennett, after the gunfire ended the suspect ran
back down the hallway. She said several teachers and school
administrators immediately ran after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was just screaming and crying,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Whiting, a junior at Heritage, said she arrived just after
the shots were fired. As she drove up, other students warned her
away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, ``Leave, get out, somebody has a gun and they're
shooting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Heritage High School has more than 1,300 students, with 88
teachers, and is 25 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Its students
have traditionally done well _ last year, its students earned an
American College Testing program composite score of 22.7 out of a
possible 36 points. That is 0.7 above the county average, and 1.7
above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The school's average Scholastic Assessment Test score for 1998
was 1014 _ 509 verbal, 505 math _ with 74 percent of students
taking the exam. That score was 46 points above the state average.
</P>
<P>
   Last month assistant principal Greg Fowler said school
administrators had been contacted by the CBS broadcast news
magazine ``48 Hours'' about doing a potential segment on successful
traditional education, showing that what worked 20 years ago still
works today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think that you can do it the traditional way, and do
it well,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Principal Lowell Biddy said that, while the school
adheres to tradition, it does keep up with the times and is open to
reassessing how well teachers are teaching students. It is
interested in encouraging students who will not go on to college as
well as those who will, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Fowler said, the school planned to resurrect a
horticulture program, which has been absent for four years because
the school could not find a teacher, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to attract students to different things,'' Fowler
said last month. ``Not all of them are going to the University of
Georgia. Some of them have different ideas about their futures.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE KOSOVO DISCONNECT
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an earlier era, pundit Walter Lippmann wrote
that modern wars have become ``hyperbolic.'' Democratic peoples
will ultimately demand total victory as the price for spilling
blood and treasure, Lippmann argued. And such demands, in time, sow
the seeds of the next conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo seemingly belies Lippmann's analysis. Nowadays, when
viewers watch television news, they're likely to learn more about
the new ``Star Wars'' movie than the war starring NATO air forces
over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of displaced Kosovars, having lost their power to
shock, have been mulched into stock network file footage. Declining
public concern suits President Clinton, whose Balkan policy is
buried under deep layers of ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prefers ``adversary'' to ``enemy'' and just about any
word to ``war.'' Fighting a real war to achieve our objectives
could rile people and spin the situation, as Lippmann once augured,
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   So while Clinton &AMP; Co. find it useful to demonize Slobodan
Milosevic as a Hitlerite, they stop short of equating Serbian
barbarism with the murderous tide of Nazi expansion that befell
Europe in World War II. Their Kosovo War is being distilled, drop
by drop, as if it were being fought in a germ-free lab.
</P>
<P>
   Altruistic moral goals take center stage even as death and
destruction are played down. Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright reach back eight decades to evoke the spirit
Woodrow Wilson fostered when he went to Versailles to ``make the
world safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   World War I, the ``war to end all wars,'' began in Serbia. It
cost at least 10 million lives, including 117,000 Americans. It
also convinced Lippmann, who had gone to France as a Wilson
adviser, that weak governments are unable to impose their strategic
goals.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, in the words of author David
Kennedy, Americans enshrined another war ``in the mysterious zone
where history mixes with memory to breed national myths.'' Alone
among warring peoples, the nation prospered during World War II,
emerging unscathed on home front even as 406,000 of its fathers and
sons died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Wilson's and Franklin Roosevelt's soaring wartime
rhetoric, Clinton's current exhortations come across as mush. His
vision of a Balkan future features ``votes and arguments and
disagreements and demonstrations and religious differences and
ethnic differences, but (recognizes) that is better to work
together for a brighter tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   It's goofy to believe that such lofty if ill-stated goals could
be realized by the narrow military campaign that has been waged by
Clinton and his NATO partners.
</P>
<P>
   They remain unwilling to put combat troops at risk to achieve
their strategic objectives. They lament that Milosevic ``controls
the pictures.'' But they gloss over Belgrade's own limited response
to the air attacks. (Serbia has so far refrained from striking back
beyond its own borders, even keeping open its frontier with
Hungary, an ostensible NATO foe.)
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the ``Today'' show isn't buying. It doesn't take a

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No ne really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with

in the first place.

   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have

than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the

</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.

<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use

   THE BEACH _ Each morning, I go out onto the deck overlooking the
beach. I sit and drink a good hot cup of coffee, smoke a big cigar
and watch the sunrise change the colors of the sea and sky.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening, I go out onto the deck overlooking the beach. I
sit and drink a good cold drink, smoke a big cigar and watch the
sunset change the colors of the sea and sky.
</P>
<P>
   In between, I try to relax.
</P>
<P>
   It's lonely work but someone has to do it. Everybody else is too
busy.
</P>
<P>
   If they aren't jogging, they're swimming. If not swimming,
they're playing volleyball. If not playing volleyball, they're
sunbathing. If not sunbathing, they're dancing and drinking beer
and trying to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   For crying out loud, it's spring break. Take a break.
</P>
<P>
   But what can you expect? Most of these people are too young to
know that there's more to having a good time than dancing, drinking
beer and trying to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't jog at the beach. Beaches are too sandy and too uneven
for jogging. You want to jog, better you should spend spring break
at the school track.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't swim at the beach. The water is too cold for swimming
this time of year. You want to swim, better you should spend spring
break at an indoor pool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't play volleyball at the beach. You fall down and you get
up with a mouth full of sand. You want to play volleyball, better
you should spend spring break at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't sunbathe at the beach. You go back home looking like
broiled lobster. Ten years from now you look like fried chicken. If
that's what you want, better you should spend spring break in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't dance and drink beer, trying to have a good time at the
beach. All that jumping around, you're spilling your beer, you're
falling into the surf, you're getting clothes-lined by the
volleyball net, you're tripping over the sunbathers. You want to
have a good time, better you should sit with me.
</P>
<P>
   Look at that sunset. Somebody's been painting the clouds with
orange finger paint.
</P>
<P>
   Look at those sandpipers at the water's edge, how they scurry
along, as if on fast-forward, as if you could punch reverse on the
remote control and they'd all freeze and then take off backwards.
</P>
<P>
   Look at that ocean, the way the light plays across the waves.
Emerald sparkling with diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Look down the beach. Diana built an autographed sand castle.
``Diana Was Here,'' says the foot-tall scrawl in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Take time to take it all in. Take time to see the sunrise and
sip the coffee. Take time to smell the cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the tide is coming in. ``Diana Was Here'' won't be here
for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will we. Sea changes, don't you know?

 &HT;    The Cornyn-Morales tale needs to be told
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A fellow who knows both John Cornyn and Dan
Morales was perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to raise money for Cornyn's successful bid for
attorney general. He served on a board with Morales. He knows both
to be solid and trustworthy, so the accusations of civil fraud
hurled at the former attorney general by the current one are
vexing.
</P>
<P>
   It will likely be a long time before Texans are treated to a
battle of the political Boy Scouts that both Morales and Cornyn are
thought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are serious and the implications are huge. In
effect, Cornyn is accusing Morales of cutting a friend in for a
share of the legal fees in the tobacco case that yielded $17
billion for the state. One byproduct of the settlement was a lot of
yelling and screaming about attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recall that Morales, who was attorney general when the
case was settled, hired private attorneys who agreed to take 15
percent of whatever they could shake out of the tobacco companies.
When the settlement was a lot bigger than anyone imagined, the
outcry over the huge payday for the lawyers was long and loud.
Incidentally, the attorney's fees were not part of the $17 billion
that the state received, but came out of a separate pile.
</P>
<P>
   Into this walks Marc Murr, a Houston lawyer and friend of
Morales, who at first claimed hundreds of millions of dollars, but
has said lately that he'll settle for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who has a reputation for being extremely careful,
maintains that documents relating to Murr's involvement in the case
were manipulated. Morales has stoutly denied any wrongdoing but
isn't saying much beyond that for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn is a Republican, Morales is a Democrat. Both are thought
to have bright political futures, if they want them. Obviously,
this unfolding saga will alter those prospects for one or perhaps
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is said to be investigating, but the G-Men aren't
talking about whether they are or not. If they are not
investigating _ as some suggest _ then it would be prudent to air
the allegations somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations warrant a separate, independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But where and by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans don't trust Travis County District Attorney Ronnie
Earle, who is responsible for prosecuting white-collar crime. An
investigation by the Legislature would be vulnerable to charges of
political partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   A court of inquiry may be the answer. State district judges are
empowered to convene them, but rarely do. The logistics could be
tricky because of the politics.
</P>
<P>
   Political implications aside, Texans deserve to know the full
and unvarnished truth about the way the tobacco case was handled.
</P>
<P>
   That old saying about how you don't want to see laws or sausages
made also applies to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to have to stand the sight of this one, though.

 &HT;    Partisan fight over hate-crimes bill uncharacteristic
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Democratic and Republican senators were talking
amicably again this week, but the partisan jousting over the
hate-crimes bill in the Texas Senate exposed some division lines
seldom present on anything short of redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after a string of personal-privilege speeches by
Democratic senators forecast a tag-team filibuster unless something
were done, Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry had the Senate stand at
ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate split into Republican and Democratic caucuses,
meeting in rooms off each end of the Senate chamber. But the
bargaining impasse stretched from before noon well into the
evening, until the Democratic senators acknowledged defeat on the
bill and hurriedly released some other bills from committees.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was unique in recent memory, because few issues
besides redistricting generate such partisan lockstep.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the one-party Democratic days, there were huge battles
between liberals and conservatives. But partisanship as such had
little impact in the Senate until the Republicans accounted for
more than a third of the membership, in 1993. They now number more
than half _ 16 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock papered over the growing
Republican numbers with his stern grip on legislators of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But since Bullock left and Perry took over, party division has
grown. Democrats are trying to differentiate themselves on issues
from the Republicans in a way they thought was not done well in the
1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes bill, which had already passed the House, was
one on which all 15 Senate Democrats agreed. The presidential
spotlight on Republican Gov. George W. Bush, and his refusal to
take a position on the proposed bill, served to illuminate it more
brightly.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans insisted their opposition wasn't about gays.
But others acknowledged it was about gays, about concern that
enhancing the punishment of a crime committed because of hate
toward a gay person could be seen as endorsing homosexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats saw the Republicans as locked down on the issue,
particularly after compromise language carried back by negotiators
to the Republican Caucus was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said Bush's run for the White House wasn't a
factor. But many Democrats thought it had a huge impact on
Republican reluctance to vote on the bill _ even as the Democrats
insisted their push for the bill wasn't done to punish Bush, whom
many of them like personally.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush's effort to lead the nation wasn't a factor in
criticism of his failure to lead on the hate-crimes bill, it
certainly was an elephant in the room. And the Democrats seemed
determined not to let Bush continue to claim inclusion as a
trademark of his political career without proving he really means
it.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Bush would have been better off, once the bill got
to the impasse stage, to just come out for it. That dramatic step,
in the name of a black man dragged to death in East Texas, could
have let Bush show he cares more about inclusion than catering to
those Republican primary voters who consider homosexuality itself a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Not doing so allowed the Texas Democrats to hold onto their
rallying point. Whether that has any lasting impact, and whether
the Senate will be increasingly divided along partisan lines,
remains to be seen.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ THE BEACH _ Each morning, I go out onto the
deck overlooking the beach. I sit and drink a good hot cup of
coffee, smoke a big cigar and watch the sunrise change the colors
of the sea and sky. Each evening, I go out onto the deck
overlooking the beach. I sit and drink a good cold drink, smoke a

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I took three days of
vacation last week to start building a wooden privacy fence in our
backyard. I've never built a fence before, but after pricing what
it would cost to hire someone who actually knows how to build one,
I elected to buy a how-to book and do it myself. I will save about
$1,500 by doing so, though the stress and physical exertion likely
will take at least a month off my life. (Gary Borders is editor and

taught with innovative methods. At this point, the major innovation
(no doubt Austin is studying closely) appears to be how to get
teachers to teach without pay. (John Young is opinion page editor

Off My Spouse?'') and role playing (''I'm Not You and I Never Will
Be _ Thank God!'') We talk to Stiller and Garofolo. (Vejnoska,

 &HT;    Texas gave charter just enough money to get into trouble
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Emma L. Harrison Charter School is $277,000 in
debt, give or take thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Workforce Commission stopped all state funds going its
way because of missed payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Teacher Retirement System also put a hold on state payments
alleging the school failed to make payroll deductions required by
law.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of creditors around town told the Waco
Tribune-Herald in March they were waiting for payments on a host of
services ranging from electrical installation to bathroom fixtures
to a 12-foot-long, double-sided, $3,000 custom sign, which was made
but not delivered for lack of payment.
</P>
<P>
   A state-assigned educational master has urged that the school be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Texas Education Agency holds a hearing here on
whether to revoke Harrison's charter. This should be the easiest
call since the official designation of day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Talk in Waco isn't about Kosovo or Netanyahu or China spying.
It's about where all the money went at the Harrison Charter. The
State of Texas has committed $750,000 to this endeavor, assuming
children would get taught with innovative methods. At this point,
the major innovation (no doubt Austin is studying closely) appears
to be how to get teachers to teach without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Within this mighty laboratory for change _ charter schools _ it
appears Texas thinks it has fulfilled its duty by giving the
Harrison entrepreneurs just enough change to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship'' _ that's the language used at the Texas
Education Agency charter division, language that implies taking
risks with capital. Texans appreciate things entrepreneurial, but
they are less appreciative when children's schooling is put at
risk, and when educators are denied paychecks, and when local
businesses are hung out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Charter holders receive a set sum per
student. The money, averaging about $4,000 a year per child
statewide, or $22 a day for 180 school days, is for educating
alone.
</P>
<P>
   What about toilets? What about signs? What about electrical
wiring? What about the van Harrison bought? How to pay for all
that?
</P>
<P>
   As the folks at the education agency explain it, the rest must
come down to belt-tightening and rustling up donations and grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No start-up or facilities capital'' from this per-student
allotment, is the word from TEA.
</P>
<P>
   What about capital needs? All school districts borrow to pay for
those. That's a good question the state doesn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harrison's problems is a dilapidated building. The former
R.L. Smith Elementary needs lots of repairs. It has been the East
Waco Community Center for a few years, managed by Harrison CEO Ida
Pinkard. It would appear that the killing of two birds with one
stone _ establishment of a charter school and refurbishment of the
community center _ could have been seen as the opportunity that
came with that $4,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   Who sees that these dollars are better spent? The state charter
division is a skeleton crew: two people and a receptionist. This
year, leading ``entrepreneurs'' in the Legislature leaned on the
state school board to add 80 charter schools to the current 88.
Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   State charter officials assert that the risk-taking is paying
off at such venues as the Waco Charter School and the newly renamed
Audre and Bernard Rapoport Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Texans still should wonder who is standing in line to play
charter dollars like scratch-off winnings at the gas station.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $3,000 sign that was never delivered to the Harrison
school, and likely never will be, there still can be a use for it.
Texas policy makers should install it on the Capitol grounds to
beam day and night, a reminder of risk-taking with public dollars.

 &HT;    Controversial priest pushes new view of Christianity in book
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In his 20-year career as an Episcopal bishop,
John Spong has called for the ordination of gay priests and church
blessings on the commitments gay couples make to each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 books he has authored, he raises such provocative
possibilities as Jesus' illegitimate birth, his marriage to Mary
Magdalene and the homosexuality of St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest book, ``Why Christianity Must Change or Die,''
Spong supports the contention that ``any god who can be killed
ought to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that ``controversial'' is one of the more
moderate labels he's been stuck with. (Among the more extreme, in a
book review, is ``the right reverend goofball.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in some ways, the mantle of controversy has served him
well. ``It makes it sometimes personally difficult, but certainly
it opens some doorways. I'm not trying to reach traditional
religious people. I'm trying to get to people who have given up on
the church.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's an audience out there for this kind of talk. He
has received about 100 letters a week since his latest book came
out a little more than a year ago _ more reader response than from
any book he has ever written. ``The letters are 3-to-1 positive,''
he says. ``They are from people who have dropped out. They talk
about how they've been hurt or violated by church life, how they
have not been allowed to ask any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``post-Copernican'' world, the Virgin Birth, the
Resurrection, and a three-tiered universe of heaven, earth and hell
simply make no literal sense to people, Spong says. ``And the heart
will never worship what the mind rejects.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference between the experience of God and the
explanation of that experience, which is tethered to a particular
time. Although he recites ``The Apostles' Creed'' every Sunday, ``I
don't literalize it. 'He ascended into heaven and is seated at the
right hand of the father' _ what does that really mean? The creed
is symbolic. It describes an experience from antiquity. And I
respect it for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Spong says he is a more deeply committed Christian now
than he has ever been in his life. But he does not see in
Christianity a call to rescue fallen sinners. ``The Jesus story is
a magnificent portrait. It is the impact of the love of God upon
this evolving creature. It is about breaking down barriers between
people: Jew vs. gentile, man vs. woman, rich vs. poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian experience is real. We just have to crack it
open and find new ways to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has to happen soon, because Spong believes we are losing
an entire generation of young people ``who have a vacuum in their
hearts where God used to be.'' In the aftermath of the Littleton,
Colo., shootings, people have called for everything from stricter
gun laws to the reinstatement of prayer in schools. Spong doesn't
believe in any cure that simple. ``We can't put back in the God
that used to be. That is a dying God.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes have to come from within the established church,
he says. Historically, attempts to break out and begin new churches
have failed. ``We need to reform the ongoing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know that the Jerry Falwells and the Cardinal
O'Connors are not the only voices for Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Church prophets _ and he counts himself among them _ are rarely
taken seriously at first. ``We are the disturbers of the waters.''

 &HT;    Triple threatens friendship
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Owner Bob Lewis and trainer Bob Baffert
bicker about whose horse is better (sort of).
</P>
<P>
   Put your money where your mouth is, Bob Lewis told Bob Baffert
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has a big mouth. Lewis has a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   The best intentions get caught in the squeeze when top horses
are about to be sent into big races. Friendships last through these
things, but they are tested.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Baffert are being tested right now.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 75, courtly and generous, made barrels of money as the
owner of Southern California's two biggest Budweiser
distributorships. Baffert, 43, is brash, boastful and boyish. But
they get along well together. ``Bob is like my son,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert trained the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner owned by Lewis,
Silver Charm. Baffert still trains 20 horses owned by Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the quality of the horses they are involved with took
Lewis and Baffert in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis owns Charismatic, first in the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, trained by Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert trains Silverbulletday, undefeated in five races against
fillies this year, owned by Mike Pegram.
</P>
<P>
   If Charismatic wins the Belmont Stakes on June 5, he will be the
first Triple Crown champion since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has tried to handle this situation with tenderness. At
the Preakness, he said he found himself pulling for Charismatic
despite his rivalry with Lukas. He wanted Charismatic to win
because of his feeling for Lewis, said Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten in the Derby and Preakness, Baffert said Sunday, ``This
is not my year for the classics. I'm getting off at this bus
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, the trainer realized his name was out
of the publicity shuffle, with no horses in the Belmont. A few
timely pronouncements changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the best 3-year-old (Silverbulletday) in the
land,'' Baffert was quoted. ``If I am going to prove that, I have
to run her in the Belmont,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, if Charismatic wins the Triple Crown, he would win
Horse of the Year and that would knock my horses out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that would involve trying to beat Lewis, one of his
biggest clients, Baffert added, ``That makes it tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is in Kentucky. Lewis, famous for rarely getting
ruffled, is in California. When the Baffert quotes reached the
owner of Charismatic, Lewis was steamed.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like Baffert saying that Silverbulletday was best,
after having at least three chances to run against Charismatic
(Santa Anita Derby, Kentucky Derby, Preakness) and taking a pass on
all three races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make Bob a little challenge,'' Lewis said. ``My $100,000
against his $100,000 as a side bet in the Belmont. Head-to-head,
whoever comes in first gets the money. Winner take all. If your
horse doesn't run, you lose. Then the winner will give the $200,000
to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, Baffert responded. ``I never said Silverbulletday was the
best horse,'' Baffert declared. ``I said I thought Silverbulletday
was the best 3-year-old filly in the country. I was misquoted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the offer still goes,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to leave that $100,000 on the table until my horse
gets the respect he deserves,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob doesn't need to worry about any association that he and I

   The New York Times has two staff writers, Kevin Sack and David
Firestone, covering the school shooting in George. Here is a
preliminary lineup of stories:
</P>
<P>
   GA-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Conyers, Ga.) _ A student opened fire at a
suburban Atlanta high school early Thursday, injuring six other
students a month to the day after the Colorado school massacre,
police said. The police said none of the injuries were
life-threatening and the shooter had been taken into custody.
Identified as a sophomore boy at Heritage High School here, the
shooter was taken into custody within 10 minutes, police said.
Witnesses said he carried at least two weapons, a pump-style
shotgun and a revolver. Some reports said he tried to put the
revolver in his mouth before authorities captured him.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ehud Barak's dilemma
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Israeli elections produced a strong personal mandate for
Ehud Barak as prime minister _ and a stinging rejection of the
policies and machinations of Benjamin Netanyahu _ but they settled
none of the divisions in Israeli society and may even have
exacerbated a few.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has no easy tasks ahead of him either in working up the
unity he wishes for within Israel or in carrying out what he hopes
will be the end game in the Middle East peace process. There are
forces within and outside the country committed to make each
challenge difficult, and impossible if they can.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's strong personal showing did not translate in a
comparable mandate for his Labor Party or its close allies in the
Knesset. There, Barak will have to cobble together a working
coalition from fractious smaller parties, some of them at such
cultural and political odds they would refuse to share power with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Can Barak have his unity without the participation of Shas? The
election made the Orthodox religious party, with its strongly
Sephardic constituency, Israel's third largest, but Barak's own
emphatically secular constituency wants to end the religious
privileges of the Orthodox that Shas means to entrench.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of convenience, then, with Netanyahu's Likud? That
would surely slow the peace process that Barak means to
reinvigorate and might leave any final settlement vulnerable to
veto by a party that, like its recently unhorsed leader, has never
seemed to want more from peace than a wary and truculent absence of
war. Shas is less peace-averse.
</P>
<P>
   At the fringes, Barak can expect the settler movement to attempt
pre-emptive poaching on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem and
dare him to balk them. Indeed, some moves may come before he can
form a government.
</P>
<P>
   The more ideologically coherent the coalition Barak can form,
the faster he can move both on domestic issues (education reform,
economic development) and in negotiations with Palestinians. But
the broader the coalition _ if it holds _ the more solid the
support for the results. A dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the Palestinian Authority or its rivals to make any
of this easy for the new government. Hezbollah cheered the election
of a peace-minded candidate by shelling northern Israel. The next
day an anti-Arafat faction assassinated an Arafat ally in Lebanon.
And the authority itself has lately tried, crazily, to revive the
long-since mooted U.N. Resolution 181 of 1947, which effectively
would dismantle the current Israel. Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Barak can brighten the peace atmosphere quickly with a few
gestures _ restraining West Bank settlement, letting the
development of a Gaza port resume, clearing the way for Palestinian
telecom installations and carrying through the Wye River
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hurrahing over Barak's election fades, it is clear
that the optimism it legitimately excited has very difficult
political and policy issues to work through on the way to the
peaceable long-range outcomes, domestically and regionally, that
most Israeli voters appear to want.

By  Glenn Whipp, Daily News Film Critic 
 
 
Spare, beautiful and achingly tender, ``Besieged'' finds filmmaker
Bernardo Bertolucci returning to the art of personal storytelling
with a powerful tale of love and self-sacrifice. This exquisite
love story echoes Bertolucci's ``Last Tango in Paris'' in its
economy of characters _ there are only three _ but departs from
that film in the way its sensuality builds slowly instead of
immediately erupting. The results, however, are no less erotic or
memorable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' tells the story of two expatriates living in a
crumbling Roman villa near the city's famous Spanish Steps. A young
African woman named Shandurai (Thandie Newton) lives downstairs,
working as a part-time housekeeper for Mr. Kinsky, a reclusive
British pianist. Shandurai fled her country after her husband was
arrested for opposing a military dictatorship. She now studies
medicine, while Kinsky (when not composing at his piano) studies
her.
</P>
<P>
   The two rarely speak but begin to form a connection. Kinsky
spends his days playing the lush music of Chopin, Mozart and Bach;
Shandurai listens to vibrant African pop to dispel her loneliness.
These disparate musical sounds waft through the villa's striking
spiral staircase and eventually start to seep into its occupants'
thoughts and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The home's living quarters are connected by the central
staircase and a dumbwaiter, which Kinsky uses to send Shandurai
cryptic messages and gifts. There's a composition sheet with a
question mark, a flower and later a piece of antique jewelry. When
Shandurai protests the extravagance of the present, Kinsky blurts
out his deep feelings for her. He is enraptured; she, in turn, is
bewildered by his advances. If he really loves her, she screams,
``Get my husband out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsky never again speaks of his passion for her. But he seems
changed by the encounter. His home, before dark and musty, now is
brilliantly lit, its windows open to reveal the splendor of its
surroundings. All this natural light also illuminates a puzzling
mystery. Piece by piece, Shandurai notices, the villa's furnishings
begin to disappear _ tapestries, bookcases, paintings, sculptures.
And Kinsky seems to have traded his aristocratic awkwardness for a
genuine sense of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who tries to save his life will lose it,'' a priest tells
Kinsky. ``He who gives it away will be saved.'' Kinsky appears to
have taken these words to heart in a way that O. Henry most
certainly would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting such an intimate film, Bertolucci (working from a
screenplay he wrote with his wife Clare Peploe) has discarded the
sweeping canvases of ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Stealing Beauty''
for hand-held cameras and a tighter visual field. The film's
composition is masterful and nothing short of amazing. Almost every
feeling and emotion in ``Besieged'' is communicated visually, and
although Shandurai and Kinsky rarely occupy the same space, we see
that they are always looking for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Newton radiates Shandurai's shining intelligence and aching
loneliness with supreme conviction, and Thewlis fills the
mysterious and mournful Kinsky with all the kinds of English
eccentricities you expect from the Mike Leigh veteran. That said,
he has rarely been this good.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Bertolucci. &QL;

A VOICE OF KINDNESS IN THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Almost 10:30, and here I was shoving a frozen
pizza into the toaster oven for a late-late dinner. Messages
blinked from the answering machine; unopened mail lay in a
formidable stack, and _ damn _ I still had to haul the garbage can
and recycling bin to the curb for the next morning's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to live.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the sidewalk I heard him long before I saw him coming up
the street in the cold, wind-swept darkness; the empty bottles he'd
collected clinked against the sides of his supermarket shopping
cart.
</P>
<P>
   My blue plastic recycling bin would barely hit the concrete
before this man swept by and pulled out the aluminum cans, glass
bottles and clear plastic containers. After him, one or two others
would roll through in the wee hours, salvaging the super-late
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn, well before official recyclers drove by, nothing would
be left in the bins for blocks but bundled newspapers and cardboard
_ recyclables not worth the weight and precious cart space for an
independent ``canner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinking and rattling up the steep street, the man finally came
into view a few houses away. He had two shopping carts tethered
together and managed to steer the unwieldy pair with one hand. Each
time he stopped to sort through a bin, he miraculously got the
carts to pause _ and stay _ on the precarious slope.
</P>
<P>
   He was taller than most canners I see and uncharacteristically
erect. So many of them seem bent and shrunken _ as much, I suspect,
from the cold, wind and rain as from the wearing nature of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Part of me (I blame it on a late-night mugging many years ago)
was afraid of him. He wore a dark, hooded sweatshirt and dark
pants. His face, beard and eyes were as dark as the moonless night.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's pushing a load of empty bottles and cans up a steep
grade at 10:30,'' I reminded myself. The fear dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   As he came closer, he hesitated. Instinct told me he was waiting
for me to go back inside my house. He is probably accustomed to his
mere existence scaring people.
</P>
<P>
   I walked up my front steps through a bright pool of porch light.
As I opened the door I turned back around.
</P>
<P>
   He was headed toward my recycling bin. Seeing me, he paused
again, then continued. Then his voice _ so sweet and with such
melody, I thought for a moment he was a 6-foot-tall child _ said,
``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   My heart just broke.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, lady, for letting me take your empty wine and mineral
water bottles. Thank you for the handful of empty aluminum cans.
Thank you for not yelling at me because I'm shuffling along your
street with a couple of stolen shopping carts the night before the
recycling truck comes so I can drag all this crap to some guy
who'll pay me 2 1/2 cents for some of the small bottles and cans
and 5 cents for containers larger than 2 liters.
</P>
<P>
   With a forced lightness I said, ``Don't work too hard,'' and
shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the dumbest, most inappropriate things I've ever
uttered. Dumb, dumb, dumb. So I opened the door and stepped back
out on my porch. The canner was on his way back to his carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I said. ``That was a really stupid thing I just said.
What I meant was, hang in there, and good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   From the street came the sound of the carts moving again up the
steep hill. The tall man's voice called through the night: ``God

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of George C. Scott
with Jack Lemmon in ``Inherit the Wind.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's one of those roles by which actors are measured.
 &HT;    When you think of ``Inherit the Wind,'' the classic Jerome
Lawrence/Robert E. Lee courtroom drama that just barely
fictionalizes the so-called ``Scopes monkey trial,'' great actors
come quickly to mind.
 &HT;    Most notable are the stars of Stanley Kramer's 1960 film
version, which featured Spencer Tracy as defense attorney Henry
Drummond _ closely modeled on the real-life Clarence Darrow _ and
Fredric March as Matthew Harrison Brady, based on William Jennings
Bryan, who prosecuted a Tennessee schoolteacher for instructing his
students on Darwin's theory of evolution.
 &HT;    But when director Daniel Petrie decided to mount a television
version of the play, which will air May 29 on Showtime, he had a
couple of aces up his sleeve: George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon.
 &HT;    Scott had already drawn raves as Drummond, playing opposite
Charles Durning's Brady in a recent Broadway revival. This time,
however, he'd tackle Brady, leaving the heroic Drummond to his
longtime friend, Lemmon.
 &HT;    ``They wanted Jack to play Drummond because of the physical
nature of the two men,'' Scott explains, relaxing between takes on
the set in California's sunny Santa Clarita Valley, where a
1925-vintage courtroom has been meticulously recreated. ``Brady's
bigger, chestier, paunchier _ Jack would not have been physically
suitable for that. So I said, `OK, what the hell, I'll try it.' And
it's been fun.''
 &HT;    A little while later, Lemmon also seems to be having fun, as he
confronts the judge head-on while sweat-soaked spectators fan
themselves vigorously and reporters file their stories from the
courtroom press table.
 &HT;    ``Ignorance and fanaticism is forever busy and it needs
feeding,'' Lemmon booms. ``So, your honor, with banners flying and
drums beating we will be marching backwards to the glorious 16th
century, when bigots condemned Galileo for daring to bring
intelligence and enlightenment to the human mind.''
 &HT;    He would have preferred to play Drummond, Scott admits, but he
didn't mind making the switch. After all, it was Lemmon who was
responsible for getting the play on the screen again. He had so
enjoyed working with Scott in Showtime's remake of ``12 Angry Men''
(1997) _ the first time the two men had acted together, though they
had been friends and Malibu neighbors for years _ that he went
looking for other roles they might play.
 &HT;    ``We used to walk our dogs together and play an occasional golf
game,'' Scott says. ``I don't do that any more.''
 &HT;    Later in the afternoon the two veterans shape one of the play's
signature scenes, where the two old foes sit down together on an
old-fashioned hotel porch and let down their hair a bit.
 &HT;    ``We're not the two men we used to be,'' Brady says. ``We used
to have a mutual understanding and cooperation. Why have you moved
so far away?''
 &HT;    ``It's you who have changed,'' Drummond responds, ``you who are
stealing hope.''
 &HT;    As the ``villain'' of the piece, Scott says, it was a challenge
for him to find something sympathetic in Brady, something to make
him human and not merely a bigot, especially in the final tender
scenes pairing an ailing Brady and his devoted wife Sarah (Piper
Laurie).
 &HT;    Still, the heart of the role lies in the courtroom scenes in
which the fanatical, fundamentalist orator lets loose the full
power of his voice. The 71-year-old Scott, who won a Best Actor
Oscar for the title role in ``Patton'' (1970), has a reverberant
voice which he can turn in a flash into an instrument of
intimidation, completely dominating stage or screen.
 &HT;    That power is still there, although these days the actor is
physically frail, suffering from debilitating arthritis in his
knees.
 &HT;    ``He's being very brave,'' Petrie says, ``It's very, very tough
on him. It's very hard for him to stand up _ he has to grab onto
something to push himself onto his feet. And the walk, which is now
a kind of mincing, almost a shuffle, indicates that. You'd think it
would be impossible for him, but when you look at the performance,
the concentration is there so strongly, you forget about it.''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Scott admits, ``my physicality hasn't been so great the
last few years. But I'm hanging in there.''
 &HT;    For Petrie and Scott, the film is a reunion of sorts. They last
worked together more than 35 years ago, on the l963 television
series ``East Side, West Side.''
 &HT;    In those days, Petrie recalls, working with Scott was a trial by
fire for any director.
 &HT;    ``I used to get psychosomatically ill driving to work knowing
I'd have to deal with George,'' he recalls. ``I was scared to death
of him, he was so volatile. If you got in the way of his wrath,
watch out. But he was always respectful and we got along great.
 &HT;    ``Now I find myself speaking his language and he's speaking
mine,'' the director says. ``We've both had a lot of experience,
and a shorthand exists between us _ more even than with Jack, with
whom I have to have more direct communication.''
 &HT;    At 71, Scott continues to give powerful performances in films
and on television. Earlier in May he popped up as Rocky Marciano's
feisty father in Showtime's biography of the former heavyweight
champion.
 &HT;    Next up for him may be a television film with Bill Cosby.
 &HT;    ``It's just the two of us,'' he says, ``and I hope it comes
through _ it's a very sweet piece called `Going Gently.' I'd love
to do it with Cos, because I've known him for years and never
worked with him.
 &HT;    ``Also Marty Sheen, who's another old friend of mine, is going
to do a one-man show on Red Barber, the great sportscaster,'' he
adds. ``He's taking it on tour and he wants me to direct it, and I
very well may do that.''
 &HT;    It sounds like a pretty full dance card for an actor who insists
that he'd love to retire.
 &HT;    Scott smiles.
 &HT;    ``My wife says I'll never quit,'' he says, ``and I just seem to
keep at it.''

THE FORCE BEHIND `STAR WARS': FUN AND VISUAL EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' movies have never been known for razor-sharp
dialogue or Olivier acting skills (Mark Hamill, anyone?). They've
never been subtle, unless you regard Good vs. Evil as a nuanced
tete-a-tete. And they've never been hugely popular with critics,
although a few of them, this one included, might openly confess to
seeing the first three films multiple times.
</P>
<P>
   So along comes ``Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace,'' and
wouldn't you know, its dialogue is flabby and its acting makes like
a two-by-four. Big surprise. But say this for ``Star Wars,'' it
always has been fun hair-raising, noodle-headed, morally simplistic
fun and it always has been more about innocence and archetypes than
irony and art.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ever expected otherwise should be banished forever to
an endless loop of Andy Warhol movies. And anyone in search of
frothy, uncomplicated entertainment should get a neat kick out of
this much-ballyhooed prequel, which boasts that same goofy mix of
derring-do and Jedi mumbo-jumbo. It also boasts a string of
breathtaking visual effects, including vast armies of android
soldiers and a computer-generated comic sidekick named Jar Jar
Binks.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter than ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' less ruminative than
``The Return of the Jedi,'' ``Phantom'' is most similar to the
original ``Star Wars,'' which set up the plot and characters and
prefigured the struggles that would define the next two films. The
new installment is set a generation or two before the trilogy
(episodes four through six), in an era before the rise of Darth
Vader and the Galactic Empire. It is the first film directed by
Lucas since ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, the Galactic Republic is in the throes of a
tax struggle with the conniving Trade Federation, led by a
bulb-eyed viceroy with a peculiar French accent. In cahoots with a
nefarious lord and his horned apprentice, Darth Maul, the viceroy's
forces invade the planet Naboo, forcing Naboo's Queen Amidala
(Natalie Portman) to escape with a pair of stout-hearted Jedi
knights: Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, Obi-Wan
Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). Kenobi is, of course, the sagacious geezer
who takes Luke Skywalker under his wing in ``Star Wars'' and dies
in a fight with Vader. Here he's little more than a glowering
Sancho Panza, albeit a Sancho Panza with killer moves; the light
saber duels are spectacular. (He also utters the immortal words:
``I have a bad feeling about this.'')
</P>
<P>
   In search of a safe haven, the Jedis and their companions _ the
queen, our old pal R2-D2 and Jar Jar Binks, a bipedal amphibian in
bell-bottoms _ zoom through the galaxy to the desert planet
Tatooine. Tatooine, you might remember, is Luke Skywalker's home
world.
</P>
<P>
   There Qui-Gon Jinn encounters Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), the
mystical squirt who later becomes Luke's father and, eventually,
Darth Vader. Qui-Gon senses a swelling of the Force in Anakin and
decides to whisk him away, presenting him before the Jedi Council
(Yoda among them, looking cross-eyed) in the hopes he'll be allowed
to train him as a Knight. ``He is the chosen one,'' Qui-Gon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' drops all sorts of tantalizing hints for
hard-core fans (the origins of the Emperor, for instance), most of
them beyond the comprehension of average moviegoers; a lot of this
is inside baseball. And for all its wild plotting and digital
theatrics, the film lacks three things: a villain as compelling as
Vader (Darth Maul notwithstanding); a scoundrel as wry as Han Solo;
and a hero as burdened by fate as Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, McGregor and Portman are fine actors (usually), but
their roles aren't fully formed they're embryonic, as though Lucas
left all major character development for the next two films.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``The Phantom Menace'' is one show-stopper after
another: an underwater city made of luminous orbs, a congested
urban landscape, a slam-bang riff on the ``Ben-Hur'' chariot race.
The Naboo battle scenes, between Jar Jar's amphibian armies and
long lines of robotic troops, are eye-popping and just about
bloodless; even the film's most delirious action sequences are
breezy and benign, safe territory for young viewers despite the
PG-13 rating.
</P>
<P>
   John Williams' familiar brass motifs open the movie, punctuate
the plot and give way, here and there, to a new score that rides
hard on a booming male chorus. It's evocative and sharp, as well it
should be: This is ``Star Wars'' we're talking about, an alternate
universe as vividly imagined as it is cartoonish.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas may not be the greatest director who ever lived _ he may
not know how to write dialogue, how to direct actors or how to cast
parts _ but he knows how to tap into the deep mythic rumblings at
the heart of every story. And he knows how to have fun.

`LOVE LETTER' STARTS CHAIN REACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say what you will about ``The Love Letter,'' it
rates high in the whimsy department. This little romance is set in
a picturesque New England town with the tongue-twisting name of
Loblolly by the Sea, a place where firemen shoo deer from front
parlors and eccentric locals (including a mysterious woman named
Miss Scattergoods) gather in a quaint bookstore to pass the time of
day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's a little too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' primarily deals with the power of
suggestion, showing how a few choice words (contained in the
missive of the film's title) can unleash long-dormant desires and
passions.
</P>
<P>
   The film's charms are modest and often a bit elusive. While the
movie features four generations of women, it is dominated by one
character at the expense of the others. This results in some
head-scratching for the audience, particularly toward the end when
a surprise revelation proves to be a little confusing because we
barely know the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Capshaw stars as Helen, a guarded, divorced mother (we see
her daughter for all of five seconds before she's packed off to
summer camp) who runs a charming seaside bookstore. Friends
describe Helen as ``emotionally celibate'' and ``weird,'' and she
does seem a little forbidding as she jogs around town morning after
morning, alone with her thoughts and regrets.
</P>
<P>
   One day in her bookstore, Helen discovers a passionate love
letter with the day's mail, and it awakens some feelings inside
her. (This, despite the letter's rather stilted prose.)
</P>
<P>
   Helen isn't the only one to see the letter, either. Her friend
and co-worker, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) reads it and thinks it was
meant for her. Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), a college student
working at the bookstore during his summer break, spies it while
having dinner with Helen and infers that she's the author. Funny,
Helen believes Johnny wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely suspect, though, is the town's moony fireman,
George (Tom Selleck), a man who has been infatuated with Helen
since their high school days together. Recently divorced, George
recently has taken to circling Helen, but he doesn't have courage
to move their relationship past the platonic stage. At least, not
in person.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued? Probably not. But ``The Love Letter'' isn't without
its pleasures. Capshaw, remembered mostly for screaming her way
through ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' proves she can do
some decent character work, and DeGeneres reminds the audience that
she's still a nice comic presence with the right material.
</P>
<P>
   Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart also show up, quite briefly, as
Helen's mother and grandmother, respectively. Their appearances are
a little jarring; it's as if they've arrived from some other movie.
With its brief, 88-minute running time, the movie could have used
another few minutes to flesh out some of its supporting characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' is being positioned as the human alternative
to ``Star Wars'' and, certainly, the film will appeal to audiences
who prefer Puccini to Wookies in their fantasy worlds. It's not a
movie that's going to rock anyone's world, but this quiet film is
at least a reminder that words can be a pretty powerful force,
too. &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    LETTER FROM KOSOVO: KLA FIGHTS THE SERBS AND ITS OWN RAGTAG

 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Kosare is midway between

east across the border.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 23 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSARE, Kosovo _ The hard-faced soldiers lining the perimeter of
the guerrilla army base stood at the ready, fingers on the triggers
of their AK-47 assault rifles, prepared to mow down an attacking
Serb force.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate purpose of the Kosovo Liberation Army troops
standing guard in their mountain compound was to serve as targets
for us, a dozen visiting foreign correspondents and cameramen
escorted by the KLA from Albania into the southwestern highlands of
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA wanted us to see their remote base at Kosare (pronounced
ko-SHAR-ah) and talk to their earnest soldiers. They wanted us to
document their military toehold in the face of claims from Belgrade
that the armed resistance movement has been eliminated, along with
the 800,000 refugees who have been pushed out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was plain to see in the dense Kosovo forest,
shadowed by towering, snow-dappled peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a mile inside Kosovo from the Albanian border, the rebels
exist.
</P>
<P>
   They also bleed.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden artillery duel with the Serbs that left three KLA
soldiers seriously wounded wasn't part of the KLA's publicity plan.
But it was all too genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has discovered, as has NATO since it began its daily
bombing campaign on March 24, that conquering Yugoslavia's army and
security forces is not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   A loose collection of clan-led militias before the NATO air war
began, the KLA lacks sufficient training, heavy armament and
vehicles hearty enough to handle the rugged mountain tracks.
Ammunition and other supplies from Albania are often moved on
horseback or tractor cart (the latter was our mode of travel in one
leg of our journey into Kosovo).
</P>
<P>
   But they seem to have plenty of rifles and bullets, light
artillery and mortars captured from the Serbs. They also are armed
with a firm devotion to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid to kill or be killed because we fight for
what we believe in, to free our homeland,'' said 18-year-old Roland
Rama, a student from the Kosovo's provincial capital, Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken young man cradling his rifle to his chest, Rama
has been stationed at the base for a month but has yet to use his
weapon in battle. He peered at the horizon, listening longingly to
the echoes of artillery fire and the pop-pop-pop of automatic
rifles from the forward positions.
</P>
<P>
   While KLA and Serb foot patrols on occasion skirmish in close
proximity, the combat here is primarily limited to artillery and
snipers positioned in opposing mountain ridges. For the past 40
days or so, the result is a standoff that is producing casualties
on both sides
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's 138th brigade, based at Kosare, a former Serb police
barracks, has had three firefights with Serb forces in as many
days. The rebels managed to push another 300 to 500 yards into
Kosovo, only to retreat in the teeth of superior firepower from the
Yugoslav army and police units. The gains and losses are slight
real estate that do not essentially change the equation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an authentic corner of the war over Kosovo, albeit at
the moment an inconsequential one. Nothing the KLA does in the next
few days or week is likely to have a bearing on when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic might capitulate or when NATO will end
its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the KLA is in a race against time to establish itself firmly
as an organized fighting force in Kosovo, and as a real player to
be included in a diplomatic formula for peace. The more land it can
control before a settlement is imposed on Yugoslavia, the more
clout it could bring to the table. (The current diplomatic
framework agreed upon in the U.S.-brokered Rambouillet peace
proposal calls for the KLA to be disarmed.)
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has been using the ramshackle Kosare base, a two-story
brick building pockmarked by holes from shelling and small-arms
fire, as a launch pad for efforts to break open a corridor deeper
into Kosovo. They control the territory that runs about a mile
between the base and the Albania border, providing a supply line of
men and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic aim is to link up with pockets of the KLA who
never left the province, but who retreated deeper into the
mountains and away from the towns and villages being brutally swept
by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   If the guerrilla army at Kosare can break through, it could gain
territory and re-supply ammunition to soldiers already in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striving to further organize our forces and bring
forward more troops to get rid of these Serb positions once and for
all,'' said Xhafer Gashi, the deputy commander in charge of
security and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   During our visit last week(CQ), three KLA fighters were
seriously wounded during artillery exchanges with Serb forces dug
in about a mile away. It is not a convenient place to be injured.
The only exit into Albania runs over deeply rutted dirt roads cut
through the torturously steep mountains. The nearest hospital,
poorly supplied, is hours away.
</P>
<P>
   In tactical terms, NATO provides help in the form of its air
attacks on the Serb positions. It is inadvertent air support for
the KLA ground troops. Despite rumors of cooperation, there seems
to be no coordination between NATO jets and the guerrilla fighters
on the ground other than the fact that they share common targets.
</P>
<P>
   But since the KLA has been always outmanned and outgunned by the
Serbs, NATO has helped to equal the playing field. Yugoslav forces
probably could easily retake the base at Kosare, according to
Western military observers in Albania, but they dare not because if
they moved in mass, they would make their positions known to NATO
warplanes, and be struck.
</P>
<P>
   But from the KLA's perspective, this is a separate war apart
from NATO. The KLA has its own agenda and claims it will not give
up until Kosovo achieves independence from Yugoslavia, something
any diplomatic solution between NATO and Belgrade is not likely to
include.
</P>
<P>
   In the lush woods and blossoming mountain pastures along the
border with Albania, there is no talk of cease-fires or peace
negotiations, only of war and victory.
</P>
<P>
   As we hiked about three miles out of Kosovo to a KLA training
base near the Albanian border town of Papaj, we passed new recruits
going in. Some of them are volunteers from America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Most are young men from Kosovo who were pushed out of the
province by the same cleansing of ethnic Albanians that produced
the masses of refugees in neighboring Albania, Macedonia and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters walked in platoon-sized, single-file columns. They
were dressed in green camouflage uniforms and each with a rifle and
banana-shaped clip of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   They, as we, passed the result of Serb shelling in recent days:
large bomb craters along the road, splintered trees in the hills
and the carcasses of several dead horses. Our KLA guide pointed out
one wide hole in the ground where he said three guerrilla soldiers
died in an artillery barrage a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers walking by appeared excited and scared, like
stereotypes from a B war movie, raw recruits eager to get into the
action and frightened by the prospect of what was just around the
bend. Some flinched as the sound of outgoing artillery from a
nearby KLA position issued a thunderous, bone-rattling roar as a
shell was launched; others just smiled and gave us the thumbs-up
sign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kosare base, the KLA commanders had made a conspicuous
effort to impress upon us that this makeshift army now pursues the
war as a well-oiled military machine.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the young men headed to battle left a sense that the
propaganda may not yet be completely true, but the passion and
sense of purpose are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not like it was before, when we had bad organization and
no vehicles and poor equipment,'' said Nevruz Hasani, a former
schoolteacher from Junik in Kosovo who, at 38, is a veteran among

fight because we feel we are equal with them.''

   LOS ANGELES _ ``The King of Masks'' follows an elderly Chinese
street performer's search, around the gray backwaters of Sichuan
province in the 1930s, for an heir to whom he can teach his
fantastic, quick-change abilities.
</P>
<P>
   His own son dead and his wife long-fled, poor old Bian Lian Wang
(Zhu Xu) floats forlornly along mist-shrouded rivers on his rickety
barge, a trained monkey his only companion. There are lots of
children for sale that he could adopt, but they're all girls, and
tradition dictates the changeling's arts only be passed down from
male to male.
</P>
<P>
   Wang finally lucks out with 7-year-old Doggie (Zhou Ren-Ying), a
skillful and attentive boy who's not only an apt pupil but a good
companion, demonstratively appreciative of the old man's kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Doggie turns out to really be a girl. Not only that,
but a girl who screws up consistently and spectacularly, and almost
destroys Wang in several different, if wholly unintentional, ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' is directed by Wu Tianming, who taught
such younger Chinese auteurs as Zhang Yimou (``Raise the Red
Lantern'') and Chen Kaige (``Farewell My Concubine'') and himself
is best-known for the 1986 feature ``Old Well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu possesses neither the storytelling nor aesthetic rigor his
famous students display, but he nonetheless has created an
atmospheric, generally involving melodrama here. The kid and the
old man are great, even if the plucky, heartwarming characters they
play come straight out of the
foreign-movie-stereotypes-Americans-love punch press. Their
hardships seem extreme, to say the least, but the genuinely tough
love at the core of their relationship pulls the story through even
its most hysterical excesses.
</P>
<P>
   And there's enjoyable Chinese opera, magic acts and cultural
details throughout ``The King of Masks.'' It's too grim to be
called delightful and too broad to achieve the tragic grandeur it
shoots for, but on some middle ground between the two, there's a
touching enough tale of hard-wrought connection. &QL;

BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A BEHEMOTH _ THE F250

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, spring. Warm breezes, quenching mists, a time of flowers,
young buds, tender sprouts, tissue-soft leaves and fecund soil; a
time of renewal, when the fancies of many people turn to . . .
big-honkin' pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we've got garages and cellars to clean; the detritus
of winter to move from our yards; loam and manure and railroad ties
and rocks to haul; lumber to truck in for new decks and docks and
sheds. What more utilitarian vehicle for many of us to own at this
time of year than a pickup truck?
</P>
<P>
   It was just over 50 years ago that Henry Ford himself spotted
this looming need and one of the last projects he oversaw at Ford
Motor Co. was the development of the F-Series pickup trucks,
arguably the most enduring of its ilk in auto history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pickup truck is in constant transition and, to the
surprise of folks at Ford, some of its biggest trucks, developed
with contractors in mind, are now selling to the general public.
And why not? They'll seat six comfortably, have the 4WD panache of
an SUV, and have that pickup truck bed. And in a day when size
matters to many, they are huge.
</P>
<P>
   We're rolling up and out of Boston's North End and onto
Interstate 93 in the 1999 F250 Supercab. It felt big on entry,
since that was a step-to-running-board and then
step-into-cab-from-there affair. It feels even bigger looking out
the driver's side window and down into the lap of someone sitting
in . . . a Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Ease out onto the highway and open up its V-10 Triton engine and
this beast charges down the lane. Gain speed and hold it and some
remarkable traits are noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Given how high it sits off the ground _ creating a potential
wind tunnel underneath _ and the huge mirrors that radiate like
wings from each front doorpost, this is an aerodynamically quiet
vehicle. Even tire noise _ and these are serious, gnarly truck
tires _ is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The engine, 6.8 liters pushing out 275 horses, is noticeable but
not intrusive. It sounds more like a strong and distant wind
blowing somewhere out on the stretching mesa that is the hood than
it does any thumping engine of stressed steel.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that this engine puts out 410 lbs.-ft. of torque and
you are into the diesel league in that category, serious hauling
and towing capacity without the loud and incessant chatter, or the
smell, of diesel.
</P>
<P>
   And in any truck or SUV, with their specific design intent,
torque talks far louder than horsepower. The difference: Consider a
track star and a mountain climber. The track star's horsepower can
send her flying down the track. But strap an 80-pound pack on that
nimble track star and another on the seasoned climber and ask each
to put one leg up on a step at waist level and hoist themselves up
on the power of that leg, and the woman who's climbed mountains
will push up with far more ease. That's torque.
</P>
<P>
   It's what let this F250, its front tires set against an 18-inch
ledge in the woods, push itself up and over from a dead stop.
</P>
<P>
   It's what let it be hooked to a trailer hauling a 22-foot
waterski boat with its own 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, and pull it
with ease. At speed _ 60 m.p.h. and less than 2,000 rpms _ the
presence of the trailer and boat were not even noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   While smooth and relatively quiet on the highway, its stiffness
was noticeable even on small bumps, cracks, or even pressure plates
on the ends of bridges and ramps. One jolt dropped the rearview
mirror from the center of the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is quite a comfortable truck for long trips. Its front
bench seat holds three adults easily. Three could ride in the back
_ accessed with a door on each side _ but it would not be fun on a
long trip. Three kids are OK back there.
</P>
<P>
   If Aretha Franklin sang about this truck, the song would be
``RESPECT'' _ as in that's what you get from drivers who might
otherwise challenge you on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts rotaries, its sheer size imposed what neither
the law, common sense, nor common courtesy has been able to do:
acknowledgement that a vehicle already in the rotary has the right
of way.
</P>
<P>
   But with mass comes responsibility. In traffic, you must drive
this truck far more carefully _ and differently _ than you would
other vehicles. Its rear end sits so high that smaller cars can
virtually disappear behind it. They shouldn't be that close, but
folks do that and you have to be aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its massive wheelbase, turns must be anticipated _
and thus announced _ earlier, and they must be made slightly wider.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a place to park in the city is problematic and some
tight turns into alleys or parking lots are nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Off road, it has plenty of power, of course, and its bite in mud
and muck and water and gravel and sand is phenomenal. The problem
is, the deeper you get into the woods, the narrower the roads
become. If you've done any serious four-wheeling you know that you
sometimes have to squeeze between trees on narrow roads and _ bane
of 4WDers _ sometimes turn around and go back. There are places out
there just too tight for this truck to pass through and places
where you might get stuck and not have the space to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Expect between 10 and 13 miles per gallon from a 38-gallon tank
and expect crowds to gather around it when you park it. In my neck
of New Hampshire it drew them. My pal ``Big Truck'' Mike Delisle
took one look at it down at the local baseball field, forgot all
about his cup of coffee and crawled over, under, around and through
it. He particularly liked the tow package with its grill-mounted
transmission cooler, the separate fuse box for all trailer
electrics, and the myriad tie-in options to those electrics that
come standard on the F250.
</P>
<P>
   And women, who virtually ignored recent past appearances of a
BMW sports car, a turbocharged Volkswagen Beetle, and a $70,000
Mercedes in my little town, were far more interested in this beast.
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of that may be something that Ford Motor Co.
says it has noticed: families looking to get into trucks the
manfacturer thought would sell almost exclusively to industry and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a truck for the city; it is not even a truck you'd
want to use to drop into the city from the suburbs. It is not an
offroad truck in the pure sense. It was not designed to be any of
these things, really. But if you've got hauling to do _ big loads
or kids or both _ it would not look bad in your yard.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The back row of moving clips to match the buttons that hold
down the tarp covering the bed. Ever try to stretch a cold tarp to
a fixed button? These do the job for you.
</P>
<P>
   --The huge center console that is available when you fold down
the back of the middle seat in front.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --It is forgivable that the windshield mirror fell off on a
bump; it is not forgivable that even when it stayed in place, it
kept drooping out of place and there was no way to adjust for its
loose balljoint attachment.
</P>
<P>
   --Why do the rear door handles have to be tucked inside the door
frame, accessible only when the front door is open? Why not put
them outside on the door?

A BEAUTIFULLY TOLD LOVE STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spare, beautiful and achingly tender, ``Besieged''
finds filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci returning to the art of
personal storytelling with a powerful tale of love and
self-sacrifice. This exquisite love story echoes Bertolucci's
``Last Tango in Paris'' in its economy of characters _ there are
only three _ but departs from that film in the way its sensuality
builds slowly instead of immediately erupting. The results,
however, are no less erotic or memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' tells the story of two expatriates living in a
crumbling Roman villa near the city's famous Spanish Steps. A young
African woman named Shandurai (Thandie Newton) lives downstairs,
working as a part-time housekeeper for Mr. Kinsky, a reclusive
British pianist. Shandurai fled her country after her husband was
arrested for opposing a military dictatorship. She now studies
medicine, while Kinsky (when not composing at his piano) studies
her.
</P>
<P>
   The two rarely speak but begin to form a connection. Kinsky
spends his days playing the lush music of Chopin, Mozart and Bach;
Shandurai listens to vibrant African pop to dispel her loneliness.
These disparate musical sounds waft through the villa's striking
spiral staircase and eventually start to seep into its occupants'
thoughts and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The home's living quarters are connected by the central
staircase and a dumbwaiter, which Kinsky uses to send Shandurai
cryptic messages and gifts. There's a composition sheet with a
question mark, a flower and later a piece of antique jewelry. When
Shandurai protests the extravagance of the present, Kinsky blurts
out his deep feelings for her. He is enraptured; she, in turn, is
bewildered by his advances. If he really loves her, she screams,
``Get my husband out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsky never again speaks of his passion for her. But he seems
changed by the encounter. His home, before dark and musty, now is
brilliantly lit, its windows open to reveal the splendor of its
surroundings. All this natural light also illuminates a puzzling
mystery. Piece by piece, Shandurai notices, the villa's furnishings
begin to disappear _ tapestries, bookcases, paintings, sculptures.
And Kinsky seems to have traded his aristocratic awkwardness for a
genuine sense of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who tries to save his life will lose it,'' a priest tells
Kinsky. ``He who gives it away will be saved.'' Kinsky appears to
have taken these words to heart in a way that O. Henry most
certainly would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting such an intimate film, Bertolucci (working from a
screenplay he wrote with his wife Clare Peploe) has discarded the
sweeping canvases of ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Stealing Beauty''
for hand-held cameras and a tighter visual field. The film's
composition is masterful and nothing short of amazing. Almost every
feeling and emotion in ``Besieged'' is communicated visually, and
although Shandurai and Kinsky rarely occupy the same space, we see
that they are always looking for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Newton radiates Shandurai's shining intelligence and aching
loneliness with supreme conviction, and Thewlis fills the
mysterious and mournful Kinsky with all the kinds of English
eccentricities you expect from the Mike Leigh veteran. That said,
he has rarely been this good.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Bertolucci. &QL;

MAINE PAPER'S CIVIC DUTY HITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began back in 1997 when reporter Barbara Walsh and her editor
began talking about the perception that ``everything that was bad
in Maine was related to alcohol'' and decided to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the fruits of that labor were rewarded when
the Pew Center for Civic Journalism awarded the Portland Press
Herald a share of the $25,000 prize as co-winner of the Batten
Award for Excellence in Civic Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In between, ``The Deadliest Drug: Maine's Addiction to Alcohol''
_ the paper's extraordinary 44-page, eight-part series _ did
nothing less than galvanize the public, the social services
community, and the political establishment to openly tackle Maine's
ugly secret, the destructive force of alcohol in the rural state.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``The Deadliest Drug'' kicked off in October 1997, more
than 2,000 Maine residents have gathered at more than 70 locales _
from the Androscoggin County Jail to the Cape Elizabeth Middle
School _ to confront the impact of alcohol in their communities.
Inspired by the series, a newly created Joint Task Force on
Substance Abuse issued a report last November containing 42 public
policy recommendations under the title ``The Largest Hidden Tax:
Substance Abuse in Maine.'' And three pieces of legislation _
dealing with everything from funding the fight against alcohol
abuse to insurance reimbursement for treatment _ are now in the
State House.
</P>
<P>
   In the media world, there are many skeptics about civic
journalism, a controversial practice in which media outlets involve
themselves directly in the search for solutions to local problems.
But in Maine, it's hard to find people who don't think the Press
Herald has done well by doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a case in point in which they helped ignite
something,'' says Emanuel Pariser, a cochair of the Joint Task
Force, who is codirector of an alternative high school. ``The brush
was all dry and ready to go and they lit the spark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were able to do was strike a raw nerve,'' adds State
Representative Michael Brennan (D-Portland), ``and give a focus to
an uneasiness people had for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Press Herald staffers stress that ``The Deadliest Drug'' was
conceived not as some do-gooder mission, but as an old-fashioned
reporting project. ``We did this as an investigative story,'' says
editor Jeannine Guttman. In the course of a seven-month
investigation, the Press Herald team of Walsh, Meredith Goad, and
Abby Zimet tracked domestic violence reports, jail records, fatal
fire cases, homicide reports, drunk driving cases, and interviewed
more than 500 sources.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening article, the reporters concluded that ``The
research led to an inescapable conclusion: Alcohol is Maine's
deadliest, costliest, and most formidable adversary.'' Alcohol
abuse costs the state about $1 billion annually; it is involved in
more than half the homicides; one-third of Maine's families are
headed by parents who abuse alcohol; and at least a quarter of
those admitted to Maine's hospitals are there because of
alcohol-related ills. Most notably, 81 percent of Maine residents
who sought help for substance abuse in 1996 had alcohol problems,
compared to only 52 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deadliest Drug'' humanized alcohol abuse through real
stories _ the middle-aged woman plagued by a 20-year drinking
problem, the 45-year-old man critically injured by a drunk driver,
and the talk-radio host who found her career in shambles after a
drunken driving bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one who still remains skeptical over the place civic
journalism has in newspapering,'' says Michael McGuire, the
executive editor of Courier Publications and a past president of
the Maine Press Association. But ``I actually found this, from the
reader's standpoint, to be very engaging. . . . I really felt that
they managed to keep away from moralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The series opened the floodgates to an overwhelming public
response. ``We were just amazed,'' says Walsh. ``Hundreds of people
were calling us. . . . You would hear people talking about it in
the gyms and the grocery stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, 10,000 reprints of the series had been snatched
up. By November 1997, a coalition of organizations called Maine
Communities Face Alcohol had formed to facilitate statewide
discussions to develop community ``action plans.'' In Farmington,
high school students sat down with college professors. At the
Androscoggin jail, inmates and administrators exchanged ideas. A
new legislative Joint Select Committee on Substance Abuse linked
with the Substance Abuse Services Commission to hold public
hearings and produce ``The Largest Hidden Tax'' report. The three
bills that emerged from this process have been deferred for now.
But $2 million in new funding is currently on the table, and
observers believe more will come later.
</P>
<P>
   No one discounts the still formidable obstacles to a statewide
battle against alcohol abuse. It's difficult to predict how the
State House politics will ultimately play out, a full-scale war on
problem drinking could run counter to the Maine's tourist-friendly
image, and the initial grassroots momentum generated by Maine
Communities Face Alcohol will be hard to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very much an issue that can float back out of
people's consciousness,'' warns Pariser.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Guttman, an innovative editor who has immersed the
paper in civic journalism, is moving on to her next project _
examining the lives and thoughts of Maine teenagers. The idea was
first proposed last fall, says Guttman, and ``in light of
Littleton, I think it's a very prescient process.''

   Blame it on Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   For years, researchers have pointed at Barbie for being a bad
role model for the ideal woman: an incredibly busty blonde with a
super-tiny waist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Harvard psychiatrist says Star Wars' Luke Skywalker's big
biceps are bad for boys.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Pope, a researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont, has
studied how the plastic body shapes of Star Wars and GI Joe toy
figures have bulked up since they were introduced in the 1960s and
70s. He believes the action figures promote an unrealistic body
image for young men, encouraging them to use steroids and work out
with weights compulsively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, when Luke Skywalker first appeared on toy store
shelves, he had a boyish figure and wore a white robe that covered
his entire chest.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two decades later, when he was re-released for the Star
Wars trilogy series, his partially open robe hung over chiseled
pectoral muscles, large thighs and a smaller waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that Luke in the 1990s has been spending a
lot of time in the gym,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope and other researchers are worried that the toys _ and other
images bombarding boys _ are promoting a super-muscular, he-man
body, which can't be attained without compulsive body-building and
anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers measured the circumference of GI Joe's
waist, chest and biceps at different stages in its development over
the years. Such specific comparisons could not be done with the
Star Wars figures because of the clothing they wore.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers scaled these measurements to the height of
an actual man.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the original GI Joe from the 1960s, scaled to human
dimensions, would have a bicep circumference of about 11 1/2
inches, similar to an ordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a GI Joe Extreme purchased in 1997 for the study
would have a bicep circumference of 26 inches, larger than any
bodybuilder in history. A dedicated weight-lifter would have about
16-inch biceps, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   His study of the evolution of action figures is in the current
issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders. The study's
findings should be cautiously interpreted, Pope said, because he
doesn't know if the bulky toy images are the cause or the result of
boys favoring the bar-bouncer look.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc., which makes both GI
Joe and the Star Wars figures, said their sizes have gone up and
down over the years and some of the more buffed-up ones have
actually sold poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Charness said the GI Joe Extreme released in 1995 was ``a
one-year wonder that has come and gone,'' because it didn't sell
well. Back in 1995, Luke Skywalker was also a he-man. ``But kids
didn't like them. And some of the collectors didn't think they were
realistic-looking. And since Star Wars is such a fan-based product
line, we reacted accordingly and changed Luke back to regular
proportions in 1996,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Area gym owners said the trend is actually going away from the
bulky look and more toward the lean, toned look.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are shying away from the competitive body-building look.
Now they want some muscle tone, but not to be huge,'' said Marco
Costentino, co-owner of four Gold's Gyms in the Boston area. ``They
want to be well-manicured.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Barbie.

 UNDATED: ... throw them out.

   ``It was very hard to get bread. Because I was little and I was
cute, I got the job of begging for bread. I went in alone to
bakeries and I had to say, `I'm so hungry. I have ration coupons
and I have money and I need bread.' Very often I got bread. That
got shared not just with my family but with other people. A few
years ago I said to my brother, `Did anyone think how demeaning it
made me feel to do that?' My brother looked me straight in the eye
and said, `It wasn't demeaning. It was bread.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1941, the Reifs learned of a boat leaving from
Lisbon. They arranged the papers needed to leave France, travel
through Spain, and enter Portugal. On Nov. 10, 1941, four days
before Reif-Lehrer's seventh birthday, the family arrived in New
York. Cousins met them and drove them to the tenements of the Lower
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in the car, we were sitting in the back seat, and
my mother under her breath said, `Have I suffered all this just to
come to this?' Even though I was only 7, I remember thinking there
was something not right about her saying that.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While the Reifs were slowly making their way to America via
France, the Loebs were in Brussels. They were from Malsch, in
southern Germany, where Leo Loeb sold cattle. He was president of
the synagogue, which may be the reason he was held at Dachau in
1938 so much longer than his father or brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis released him six weeks after Kristallnacht, they
told him to leave the country, so he arranged to go to Cuba to
await entry in the United States. The rest of the family would
follow. Before he left Germany, the family posed for a portrait,
``probably,'' Forrest says, ``just in case we never saw each other
again.'' It is a mournful picture in which Leo Loeb's head is still
nearly bald after being shaved at Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   Every day after he left, Forrest's mother wrote her husband. To
see him across Havana Harbor, unable to reunite, Forrest says,
``must have been horrendous'' for her.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 months after the return of the St. Louis the Loebs lived
in Brussels. When the chance came for some to sail to America on
the Pennland, her grandparents and her aunt's parents said the
young people _ Forrest, her mother, brother, aunt, and cousin _
should go first. The older ones made plans to come a few weeks
later. Their boat never sailed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 the Loebs were reunited in Elmira, N.Y., where Leo Loeb
worked first as a chauffeur, then as a clerk in a silk factory.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dachau ``my father played the piano. He had a sense of
humor. He was just a nice guy. After the concentration camp he
became very quiet. My brother and I never asked questions about
what happened. It was almost an unwritten law that we didn't,''
Forrest says. ``The one thing that I didn't have for a long time _
and that I'm trying to acquire _ is a sense of humor. My parents
really, and my mother especially, took everything to heart. It
makes life very sad when you're growing up.''

<P>
   Sidney Blechner's brother Oskar, meanwhile, was in England,
waiting out the war, with a job manufacturing belts. Born in Poland
two years before his family moved to Germany, he carried a Polish
passport and avoided the fate of many St. Louis passengers sent to
Britain who were interned as German citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Blechner was not so fortunate. After he missed the
St. Louis, he tried desperately, but unsuccessfully, to leave
Germany. He made his way to Switzerland, only to be sent back to
Germany. His father was deported to Buchenwald, where he was
killed, and Blechner managed to flee to Berlin, where in October
1939 he was arrested and sent to his first concentration camp,
Sachenhausen. Initially, at least, he still had contact with the
outside world, and his mother harbored hope she could get him out
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The family recently discovered the wartime correspondence of
Blechner's mother, and it is filled with frantic efforts to help
her son. Her three other sons were in Switzerland, England, and the
United States. While she was still in the ritual mourning period
following her husband's death, Mina Blechner wrote her son Jakob in
Switzerland, asking him to go to the Chilean Consulate on Sidney's
behalf. ``It is urgent,'' she wrote. ``You should not waste a
minute.'' She signed the letter, ``Your distressed mother.''
Similar efforts to get Sidney Blechner into Portugal, India,
Shanghai, and Bolivia failed. Mina Blechner was deported in 1941 to
Kovno, Lithuania, where she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Sidney Blechner was sent to Auschwitz, and in early
1944, he was among 2,000 internees crowded onto open cattle cars
and transported to Dora-Mittelbau, a concentration camp in Germany.
``It was snowing,'' Blechner recalls. ``And we were all thirsty. We
got nothing to drink so we used the snow and urine.'' Fewer than
200 survived that trip. When he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen,
Blechner weighed 90 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am alive!'' he wrote in a postcard to his brother Jakob on
April 15, 1945. ``It is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Blechner has 14 grandchildren. Forrest has five, with
twins on the way. She asks if a visitor would like to know the
names of her children. Lisa. Susan. Robert. Steven. Richard.
Jonathan. Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the saga goes on,'' Forrest says. ``We were just
very lucky. People who had to go through the camps and were
liberated _ no matter how hard it might have been for us, it was
nothing compared to what these people went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most is inhumanity to man.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Forrest will be in Washington, at the Holocaust
Museum, appearing on a panel with two other former passengers.
``Basically I'm doing it in honor of my grandparents who never got
out of Brussels,'' she says. ``They were on the boat.''

BRICKS-MORTAR COMPANIES FIND WAYS TO SURVIVE NET UPSTARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet companies are like Ivory Snow: The purer they are, the
better we seem to like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure plays,'' firms that start life as Internet companies, are
awarded huge stock market valuations on the theory that they are
the only ones who have what it takes to make it in the brave new
world. Traditional companies, those with the misfortune to have _
horrors _ bricks and mortar _ are often dismissed as hopelessly
handicapped, road kill on the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, two bricks-and-mortar firms, CVS and Barnes &AMP;
Noble, struck back, or at least tried to strike back. While it is
too early to tell how successful they will be, their efforts
suggest investors may have decided too soon that the race to the
future is over.
</P>
<P>
   CVS, the nation's second-largest drugstore chain, agreed to buy
Soma.com., an on-line start-up, for $30 million. The move puts
</P>
<P>
   CVS directly into competition with several ``pure'' Internet
players, including Drugstore.com, which is partly owned by
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   CVS isn't planning to bulldoze its 4,100 stores. Instead, it is
hoping to integrate the Internet operation into its existing
business. In the not-too-distant future, a customer might order a
prescription on-line and come into a store to pick it up. CVS
shopping bags could be used to advertise the on-line service.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Monday said its on-line service would match the
50 percent discount on bestsellers offered by archrival Amazon,
setting off a price war in cyberspace. Barnes &AMP; Noble previously
had announced its intention to spin off its on-line unit as a
separate business.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, Barnes &AMP; Noble has been the textbook case of the
traditional retailer that doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was asleep for three years,'' says Richard Nolan,
a professor at Harvard Business School. During that three years,
Amazon established itself as the name brand in on-line books.
</P>
<P>
   While not excusing Barnes &AMP; Noble's performance, Nolan points
out that meeting the Internet challenge is no easy task for a
bricks-and-mortar outfit. Companies like Barnes &AMP; Noble often have
the wrong people and the wrong skills to do the Internet right,
says Nolan. Their technical people often specialize in back-office
functions, not the customer-connection functions that drive the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the time barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these new companies, guys operate on Internet time,'' says
Nolan. ``It is so fast that it defies understanding in traditional
organizations that work off an annual budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to move to the Internet can also put a traditional
company into conflict with itself. Barnes &AMP; Noble, for instance,
will offer 50 percent discounts on bestsellers on-line, but only 30
percent discounts to those who shop in their stores. What kind of
confusing message does that send to customers?
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer ran into a related problem when it tried to
match rival Dell's strategy of selling computers via the Internet.
The move angered the retailers who historically have sold Compaq's
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you resolve those conflicts?'' asks Thomas Willmott,
president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston consulting firm. ``How do
you balance the old with the new?
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, however, Willmott says such a balancing act,
while difficult, is not impossible. Businesses that are
sufficiently nimble and creative, he says, will find ways of
pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial realm, Charles Schwab, which built its business
on the old-fashioned telephone, is the leader in on-line investing,
outpacing start-up rivals like E-Trade. The Gap, whose stores dot
the landscape, has done a good job of integrating the Internet into
its business, according to Kate Delhagen, an electronic commerce
specialist at Forrester Research in Cambridge. One example of that
crossover? Customers who make purchases on-line can return items to
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Delhagen isn't ready to write off Barnes &AMP; Noble, either. She
thinks the upcoming spinoff of the on-line business will help the
company attract the talent it needs to battle Amazon. She also
speculates that as Amazon moves into everything from drugs to pet
food, it may take its eye off books, giving Barnes &AMP; Noble a chance
to come back.
</P>
<P>
   What's the lesson here? It may be that Wall Street has been too
quick to pick winners and losers in the cyber competition. Getting
a head start is important but it is not the only thing. In some
fields the tortoise may catch the hare or the caterpillar may find
a way to turn itself into a butterfly. Pick your image.
</P>
<P>
   If some of today's losers do manage to catch up or even narrow
the gap, stock prices will have to adjust. A lot. The cautious
investor might want to be prepared for that possibility.

FORMER `TREK' CREW MEMBER EXPLORES SCI-FI SUBCULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A little ``Star Trek'' goes a long way. The
problem with ``Trekkies,'' a documentary about fans who build their
lives around Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi TV creation, is that it goes
on too long _ but never far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you think they're charming eccentrics, harmless
idealists or hopeless geeks, Trekkies or Trekkers (the movie never
really decides which name the devoted prefer) are amusing for about
15 minutes, tops. Barring some deep insights into why anyone would
want to build his life around a pop-culture artifact _ even a good
one like ``Star Trek'' _ the cumulative effect is rather numbing.
These folks come off like Elvis impersonators with pointy ears.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's as possible that individual Trekkies lead rich
and fascinating lives as it is likely that somewhere, among the
billions of planets in the universe, there's another one that
supports intelligent life. But we need proof of both theories. And
when all they're talking about is ``Star Trek,'' the fans don't
exactly come off as well-rounded.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the brainchild of Denise Crosby, who played Lt. Yar
on ``The Next Generation'' series for a few seasons. She'd been the
honored guest at some of the many conventions Trekkies stage all
over the place, and found it a ... well, a subculture. She got
director Roger Nygard to follow her around some of these
gatherings, interview most of the stars and creative personnel
associated with the four TV series and nine feature films, and zero
in on a handful of ``Trek'' lifestylers.
</P>
<P>
   We're treated to exhaustive accounts of which action figures are
more collectible, we're informed about how to translate the Bible
into Klingon and other such obsessive ephemera, and we get up close
and personal _ or, rather, we would if she possessed an actual
personality _ with Barbara Adams. She's the Arkansas fanatic who
wore her Starfleet uniform to duty on the Whitewater grand jury, as
well as everywhere else, insisting on being treated like she
actually was an officer in the imaginary organization.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the visit to the rather fun ``Star Trek''
dentist's office. Fun, that is, until the dentist and his perky
wife divulge their rather Romulan bedroom secrets. But hey, they're
nothing compared to the K/S underground, females who publish
fanzines that fulfill their erotic dreams about Capt. Kirk and Mr.
Spock minus the fantasy-busting intrusion of rival women
characters. In other words ... Well, you do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguing as this handful of Freudian hooks may be, the real
psychological issues raised by such obsessive interest are never
explored in ``Trekkies.'' The film's attitude is more one of mild
bemusement _ we're laughing with them, not at them, wink, wink _
and promotional boilerplate about how the Roddenberry ethic of
inclusion, respect and expansive learning isn't the worst thing
people can build their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, as far as that goes. Too bad ``Trekkies'' gives no
indication that these self-proclaimed individualists are doing much
with that outside of Starfleet's paradoxically restricting
margins. &UR;  &QL;

FOR DUQUETTE, HATE MAIL HAS BECOME LOVE LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- I still have several weeks to work on the letter, so
I'm not worried about finishing it. But that's not the point. This
is: I never thought I would have to write it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can help me. I am composing an apologetic
letter/telegram/poem/e-mail, addressed to Dan Duquette. It is due
to be delivered the evening of July 13, when baseball's All-Star
Game will be played at Fenway Park. Earlier this spring, I was
convinced that would be the night Roger Clemens and Mo Vaughn would
return to Boston as American League starters. I was also convinced
Duquette's Red Sox would be 15 games out of first place, Jose
Offerman would be in Pawtucket, and certain Sox would begin
marketing ``At Least We're Not The Twins'' muscle shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It is only May 20. There is plenty of time for chaos to bloom. A
nasty losing streak is the only thing keeping today's Sox from
being tomorrow's Orioles. But that won't happen. There will be no
division titles, but there also won't be a 78-84 season. The team
with the squatty ``B'' on its caps will lead the wild-card chase
for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   How do I know that? Well, we tend to know when we're wrong
faster than we know when we're right. So I've begun preparing for
All-Star night, when Pedro Martinez will start for the AL (All-Star
manager Joe Torre should save some time and leave a lineup card
with Martinez's name on it before the Yankees leave town).
</P>
<P>
   Before I share some of my ``Dear Dan'' rough drafts, my
attorneys have insisted that I include this footnote on all
documents: (itals)Given the choice of a No. 3 hitter, I would like
to make it clear that I'd take Mo Vaughn over Reggie Jefferson. And
given the choice of an additional power source, I would have signed
Vaughn instead of humiliating myself by calling Seattle and asking
about Butch Huskey. If you choose to misrepresent my feelings on
Vaughn, I'll remind everybody that you signed Bob Hamelin. Thank
you.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox thumping Torre's Yankees, 6-0, Wedneday to solidify
their hold on first place in the AL East, my Apology Campaign
became even more serious. Do you realize how tough it is to
congratulate someone for not being as terrible as you had
originally thought? That type of compliment is difficult to pass,
no matter what the medium. This is why I need help:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning of letter, first draft:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dan, I am shocked that the general manager taking the most
heat in the AL is not you. First-year Baltimore GM Frank Wren may
not make it to August. That's a stunner since he was able to lure
Albert Belle and you weren't . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Second draft:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dan, I can't believe this letter finds you at Fenway Park.
Two months ago, I would have guessed you'd be home in Dalton, fired
because of your team's awful start and for letting Vaughn walk and
for giving Offerman $6 million a year . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Too negative.
</P>
<P>
   Third draft:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dan, Success is a choice. Don't listen to the Fellowship of
the Miserable. I've said all along that Tyus Edney is our best
point guard . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Wrong executive; wrong sport.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth draft:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dan, You need a nickname. It doesn't have to be
complicated. Something like Dan The Man would be fine. You're a
visionary. Silly sportswriters and fans are too emotional to
appreciate your stoic genius. You were right about Clemens. He has
as many wins as Juan Pena. He is ready to come off the disabled
list and had a chance to pitch against the Sox. Guess what? He
backed out and said he would pitch in Chicago. This guy had a
chance to halt a Yankee losing streak against the hated Sox and he
chose to watch here and pitch in Chicago. You tell me. Who the man?
You, baby. Who drafted Nomar Garciaparra? Dan The Man. Who traded
Carl Pavano for Martinez? D-Man, that's who. Who brought in Joe
Kerrigan and suggested that Tom Gordon be a closer? D-Nice. Who let
Mo go for nothing? You _ but you probably had a good reason that we
amateurs can't comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I know there may have been some favorable things written
about Clemens by me. But that was only because Rog temporarily
forced me to put a ``K'' in front of my name so I could be one of
his K-named boys . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Too rah-rah.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately there are seven weeks remaining before all of
baseball crowds Boston and Fenway. That's enough time to craft the
perfect letter to Duquette. By that time, his team will probably be
in second place because, simply, the New Yorkers are better.
</P>
<P>
   But based on what we've seen in the AL, the Sox should like
their playoff chances. The Indians have virtually won the Central,
the Yankees will emerge in the East, and Texas will probably hold
on in the West. Should anyone worry about the young A's? Should you
be concerned about the Orioles (earned run average of 6.04),
Mariners, or Angels?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Duquette went over the same thoughts last winter, when his
name was a New England obscenity. Now all he should do is sit in
his private box, turn up his beloved Springsteen, and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth draft (rhetorical e-mail):
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dan, What do we know?
</P>
<P>

`AGE-DEFYING' PRODUCTS ARE GETTING OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the drugstore I saw a sign that asked: ``Do Your Teeth Make
You Look 10 Years Older?'' It was attached to a package of
Rembrandt Age Defying Adult Formula Toothpaste. ``Your mouth will
look and feel years younger!'' a line on the package promised.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole lot of age defying going on. The battle against
aging has turned positively militant, and promises to escalate into
all-out warfare as the boomer generation succumbs to gravity and
more manufacturers realize that slapping ``age defying'' or similar
words on products boosts profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent story in the Washington Post, a survey of
packaged goods found 69 ``age-defying'' product lines were launched
in 1998, compared with 18 in 1993. They joined hundreds of
age-fighting products already on the shelves, items that promise
not only to defy age, but to defend against it (L'Oreal Wrinkle
Defense), repair it (Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair
Replenishing Creme), revitalize it (Oil of Olay Revitalizing Eye
Gel), and wrestle it into submission in various other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can defy age not just with skin care products and
makeup, but with hair color, toothpaste, even pantyhose. Where will
it end? Age-defying denture cream? Age-defying bladder control
pads?
</P>
<P>
   I'm weary of the fight. I think I'll leave the age defying to
others and get on with life. It won't be easy, because hardly a day
passes without another catalog arriving in the mail, tempting me
with various creams, nostrums, supplements, devices, and a host of
other stuff designed to stop time in its tracks. Once your name get
on the list of middle-aged marks these catalogs seem to multiply
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   One recent arrival is Luminescence, a catalog full of
age-fighting weapons, most of them skin-care products featuring
lipids, collagen, fruit acids, emu oil, seaweed extract, various
vitamins. The Alpha Hydroxy Peel of the Rich and Famous will
``reveal youthful skin trapped under dead skin cells.'' The
BioMagnetic Anti-Wrinkle Mask promises ``to restore a youthful
firmness and resiliency with results you can't get from any
moisturizer.'' Including, apparently, any and all of the many
miracle moisturizers advertised elsewhere in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   On another page, beneath a photograph of a woman wearing a
Hannibal Lecter-style mask, I read, ``Diminish wrinkles at the
deepest layers using the technology NASA astronauts used to absorb
medicine. . .'' Who says the space program is a waste of money? My
favorite item by far is a facial exerciser, the Chin Musle Toner.
It's bright red, ruffled, and wraps around the face like a medieval
chin-and-hair cover, perfect for the woman who wants to look like
the Wife of Bath as she ``tones the muscles of the chin, jaw, and
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't expecting anything of an age-defying nature from the
Omega Institute for Holistic Studies in Rhinebeck, N. Y., but the
summer catalog had several such courses listed. The one that caught
my eye was, ``Beauty Without Surgery: Shamanic Shapeshifting and
Modern Medicine.'' The five-day course is taught by Eve Bruce, a
plastic surgeon who has devised a way to ``shapeshift into beauty
without surgery,'' the result of having studied ``the healing
techniques of indigenous shamans in central and South America.''
She was, the catalog notes, ``the first non-Quechua woman to be
inducted into the Circle of Yachaks, birdpeople shamans of the high
Andes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce seems to have put a whole new spin on the ancient,
shamanic concept of shapeshifting. The catalog quotes her: ``As
inner beauty and spirituality blossom , changes in energy and
intent create `miraculous' cellular shapeshifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do I doubt that all the wisdom of the Yachaks could succeed
in shifting my shape? I think I'll wait for an anti-gravity pill.

 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 13, 1939, eight months after her father committed suicide
because Jews in Vienna were no longer permitted to work and six
months after Nazi storm troopers ransacked her family's home on the
infamous Kristallnacht, Liane Reif-Lehrer, clutching her mother's
hand, boarded the ocean liner St. Louis in Hamburg. Their
destination was safe haven in America.
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer was 4 years old, one of more than 900 Jews, mostly
German, who sailed across the Atlantic to Cuba, where they thought
they had the paperwork necessary to await immigration to the United
States. Instead, they were rebuffed by Cuban officials, denied
entry into the United States and eventually forced back to Europe.
More than 220 subsequently died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 60 years later, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington, D.C., is commemorating the voyage of the St. Louis with
an exhibit that runs until Sept. 6. The former passengers include
two suburban Boston women, 64-year-old Reif-Lehrer of Lexington and
66-year-old Ruth Loeb Forrest of Newton. One of five families
featured in the display includes 84-year-old Sidney Blechner of
Brookline, whose brother Oskar was on the St. Louis and who almost
sailed on the ship himself.
</P>
<P>
   The day Reif-Lehrer, her mother, and her brother boarded the St.
Louis, they headed to the first-class cabins because Chaje Leja
Reif, permitted to take few assets with her, preferred booking
expensive passage to leaving behind money for Nazis to loot. She'd
tossed the gold her husband used in his dental practice into the
Danube River before she departed Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest's father, Leo Loeb, who'd spent six weeks in Dachau
after Kristallnacht, was already in Havana when the St. Louis
arrived, and he ventured out in a small boat as near as he could to
the ship that carried Forrest, her mother, her brother, and her
paternal grandparents. She could see her father and he could see
them, but the view from their separate craft was as close as they
got before the St. Louis turned around. Her grandparents were
killed in Auschwitz. So was her aunt's father, who was also on the
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Blechner was stranded in Poland, released from the camp
to which he'd been deported in 1938 from his hometown of Munich but
unable to secure the documents he needed to make his way to Hamburg
in time to board the St. Louis. So it sailed without him. Blechner
then survived six years in six concentration camps, including
Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The St. Louis affected me,'' says Forrest, a retired nurse and
mother of seven. ``Even in my yearbook I had written that I'm for
the underdog. I feel for the people in Kosovo. It's not just them.
Anytime this happens. Going back to that ship from Haiti when we
wouldn't let them in. That's ingrained in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have felt as frightened or angry about any
situation since then as I do now about Yugoslavia,'' says
Reif-Lehrer, a chemist-turned-consultant and mother of two. ``The
concept that in this century _ and especially at the end of this
century _ people are still trying to resolve their differences by
going out and playing `bang bang, let's see who can shoot the most
of the other guy' is so obscene and so outrageously uncivilized. I
don't have words to describe what I feel about this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis was front-page news in Boston, as elsewhere, in
1939 as it wandered, unwelcome and prohibited from docking, between
Cuba and Florida before turning back, presumably to Germany, on
June 6. Gone was the jovial atmosphere that characterized the
voyage to Cuba. Gone were the sumptuous meals first-class
passengers had enjoyed. The captain feared mass suicide. One man
had tried by cutting his wrists and jumping into the harbor as the
boat left Havana, which earned him a brief respite in Cuba before
he, too, was sent back to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only on June 13 did Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and
Britain each agree to admit some passengers. On June 17, the St.
Louis docked at Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The story has spawned books and films. But it wasn't until
spring 1996, when four St. Louis survivors went to the Holocaust
Museum looking for information, that anyone tried to systematically
learn what happened to the passengers on that ship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after almost three years of searching written records,
contacting Jewish communities around the world, and, more recently,
publicizing the new exhibit, museum researchers know the fate of
all but 23 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 were deported to Auschwitz and the killing center of
Sobibor. None survived Sobibor, and five survived Auschwitz.
Another 40 were deported to other camps, where most were killed. An
undetermined number, including the mother of Forrest's aunt, died
in Europe outside the camps. As far as the museum knows, none of
the 287 who went to England, including Blechner's brother Oskar,
died in the Holocaust for the simple reason that Germany never
occupied Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many survived in the countries that fell to
Hitler, says museum project coordinator Scott Miller, is because
they were already on waiting lists to enter the United States under
the quota system in place at the time. Their turn to immigrate came
while it was still possible to cross the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer and Forrest were young girls on the St. Louis, and
their memories are children's memories boosted by the recollections
of others. Forrest's mother, Bella Loeb, is 95, a resident of the
Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged in Roslindale, unaware of
either her surroundings or her past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Kristallnacht (Nov. 9, 1938) as though it was last
night. My mother was holding me in her arms and my brother was
hanging onto her skirt,'' says Reif-Lehrer. ``The only thing I
remember from the voyage is we were really seasick almost all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Blechner, whose fateful inability to get to Hamburg in time for
the St. Louis departure led to years of suffering, has only started
talking about the Holocaust in the past few years. For more than a
decade he wore a Band-Aid over the number 69717, tattooed onto his
left forearm at Auschwitz on Oct. 23, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start a new life, to cry what is gone is gone,'' says
the retired businessman and father of four. ``If you say something
about the Holocaust you can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer and her family were among the 224 passengers sent to
France. A fellow passenger, a man bound for England, had been
bothering her mother, so she made sure her family went elsewhere.
``My brother tells me he was absolutely livid that my mother made
that request,'' says Reif-Lehrer. ``It was really stupid to go to
France.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine months the family lived in Loudun, the last two weeks
under Nazi occupation. There she befriended a little boy, Jean-Paul
Berg, who, she believes, did not survive the war. In 1940, under
cloak of night, the Reifs and 14 other Jewish refugees made their
way to Limoges, in unoccupied Vichy France. It was far from their
life of affluence in Vienna, where Reif-Lehrer liked to linger in
the kitchen with the cook and squealed when servants pulled the
runners in the hall to give her rides or bounced her in sheets they
were folding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food really got to be a problem,'' Reif-Lehrer recalls.
``There were ration coupons. It was one egg per month per person,
but you could never get them. One day my mother and my brother and
I walked for miles and miles and miles and got three eggs, and when
we came back they were rotten. We had to throw them out.

THERE'S A FUNGUS AMONG US! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a pleasant, if cool, spring with lots of sun and
really not a lot of rain. Just the sort of conditions for us to put
that dreaded plague of mildew out of mind, partly because with such
glorious weather there has not been a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   But mildew knows no season, and we can expect it sooner or
later, whenever and wherever there are warm, damp surfaces. Mildew
just loves organic things, and will feed on everything but glass,
glazed tile and unpainted metal.
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, let it be said that the proper word
for this black plague is mold, but everyone, it seems, calls it
mildew and mildew we will use partly because it sounds more
sinister than plain old mold. It comes in all colors, mostly
black. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Never free &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We will never be free of mildew. The spores of this fungus,
which is related to mushrooms and the mold from which penicillin
was developed, are microscopic. Being very light in weight, the
spores are floating in the air _ indoors and out _ waiting in the
wings, so to speak, to land on any warm, moist surface. Mildew even
grows under water. Check your toilet tank; chances are its sides
and bottom are black with mildew. A little bleach in the tank will
get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Because mildew feeds on anything organic, it is not a good idea
to just let it go. The fungus will decay virtually everything it
touches, given enough time. Wood is especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Mildew will grow anyplace where there is a lot of moisture:
bathrooms, crawl spaces and basements being probably the biggest
part of the plague, at least indoors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mildew knows no bounds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mildew not only has no season but no particular region where it
grows, silent and sinister _ and smelly.
</P>
<P>
   The South is a hotbed of mildew. A writer wrote the handyman
that her two houses in New Orleans were newly painted, and became
black with mildew, on the outside. The fault may have been in the
oil paint, but mildew is just as happy growing on latex paint as
well. The writer also said that in the many previous years she has
lived in the houses, there was no mildew. That is mystifying.
</P>
<P>
   But another writer in Flint, Mich. wrote that his varnished
windows were getting all mildewy and black. That is not mystifying,
simply a matter of too much moisture in the house. Water vapor,
created by breathing, bathing, washing and cooking, builds in the
air until it condenses into water on the cool windows. Result,
mildew on the Flintonian's window frames.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of homeowners are victimized by mildew through no fault of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   But some others have only themselves to blame. For instance, if
a basement or crawl space gets all mildewy, it is because it has
been kept closed tightly, allowing that buildup of water vapor,
condensing, and, ah yes, the mildew.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens in a bathroom that is not ventilated or
equippped with an exhaust fan to the outdoors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
What to do? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, we know why mildew occurs, and where and when. What can we
do about it? Can we get rid of it and keep it away?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and no.
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of mildew, treat it with a solution of one part
liquid chlorine bleach and three parts water. Paint it on and let
dry. This will kill it in seconds, and it will not hurt wood,
paint, and most stains. It will bleach untreated wood, and there
have been some comments that bleach (sodium hypochlorite) takes
oils out of the wood and causes it to deteriorate prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to paint or stain the surface that you just treated
for mildew, be sure to rinse it before painting or staining.
Paints, varnishes, stains and other finishes are not compatible
with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   If deterioration occurs, use a milder bleach/water solution such
as one to five or six. This will still kill the mildew, and you can
experiment to see how weak you can make the solution and still kill
the mildew.
</P>
<P>
   There are substitutes for bleach that can kill or remove mildew,
although they may be less effective. Judson Escalant of Chatham,
Mass. called to say that Era, a Proctor &AMP; Gamble laundry detergent
with enzymes, is designed to remove protein stains (grass, fruit,
blood), but also works well for mildew. Use it straight or diluted
with water, he said. Era is an oxygen-based bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Baking soda in place of bleach also works on mildew. Some
homeowners have had good luck using trosodium phosphate (TSP
cleaner).
</P>
<P>
   Zinsser, a paint company, makes Jomax, a mildewcide concentrate
that is used with bleach and is also effective. This may keep the
mildew off longer than an ordinary bleach/water treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Zinsser also makes a paint for bathrooms, and claims it is
mildew proof. One reader found it to be so, after four years of
mildew-free surface. It is called Perma-White Mildew Proof Bathroom
paint. It has a high gloss and a hard finish, both of which
discourage the growth of mildew. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Keeping it away, indoors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what you do, the mildew can come back, given the
proper environment (warm, wet surfaces).
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the ``no'' part of the question: You cannot
always keep it away, at least outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a way to keep it away indoors, permanently, by
eliminating or reducing moisture. It is simple: Ventilate.
</P>
<P>
   In a crawl space and basement, open windows and vents from April
to October. They can be closed the other months because there is
less moisture in cold air.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no windows or vents, it is best to install some.
And, in a cawl space, cover the earthen floor with polyethylene
plastic, to keep the water vapor from coming up through the earth.
</P>
<P>
   In bathrooms, the best deterrent is an exhaust fan, which must
be vented to the outdoors, not to the attic or anyplace else in the
house. If you ave no exhaust fan and can't put one in, open the
window during showers and leave it open after the shower until the
mirror unfogs. (Hey, so it might be chilly in the dead of winter.
If you want the warmth, then you have to put up with the moisture.)
</P>
<P>
   Attics are another place where moisture builds, and ventilation
is the cure there, too. Put in vents if there are none, and add
more if what you have is inadequate. Unlike vents in basements and
crawl spaces that can be closed in winter, those in attics can be _
should be _ open all year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Yes, but outdoors? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outdooors, well, ventilating outdoors is like trying to
ventilate. Heck, the outdoors is already ventilated, so the battle
outdoors involves removal with bleach and water or other means,
which translates to eternal vigilance and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   And, the use of exterior paints and stains may help, because
virtually all exterior paints and stains contain a mildewcide that
keeps mildew away, but its effect is limited, usually two years,
far short of the standard life of a paint or stain.
</P>
<P>
   Zinsser, the company that makes the Perma-Whtie interior paint,
also makes Perma-White acrylic exterior paint, in a satin finish,
which it claims is mildew proof.
</P>
<P>
   You may be skeptical about that mildew proof claim, but if it
keeps mildew away for several years that's a pretty good start in
the battle against the great mold plague of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck to us all.

SHOULD BOYS HAVE WAR TOYS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonah Gorski was 10 when he got his first toy gun, a plastic
pistol that shot rubber-tipped darts. As toy guns go, he thought it
was pretty innocuous. But after a lifetime of hearing about why war
toys are bad for kids, Jonah figured his father would throw it out,
and he did. He also expected his dad to dispose of the Laser
Challenge gun game he got for his birthday that same year, but he
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lapse Peter Gorski regrets.
</P>
<P>
   A pediatrician and the president of the Massachusetts Caring for
Children Foundation, Gorski says, ``It's the only toy gun I ever
let into our house, a gift from a friend whose parents I didn't
know. I wasn't bold enough to impose my convictions on them.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, that one lapse may have been instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah, now 12, was quick to agree to the rules his parents
imposed for Laser Challenge, for instance, playing no more than 20
minutes at a time. Before long, though, he gave it up and not
because of his parents' obvious unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got boring,'' says Jonah. ``I have a lot of other things I
like to do that are a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words are music to Peter Gorski's ears, and they ought to
embolden other parents, too, as we struggle with a new round of
``Star Wars'' toys and a new summer's worth of souped-up squirt
guns, both set against our heightened sensitivity to gun play in
the wake of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A range of opinion
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it harmful for children to play with war toys? Even among
those who dislike them, there is a range of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University developmental psychologist Ron Slaby rails
against any toy with a violent theme, including toy guns; action
figures (even the good guys) who use violence; video and computer
games like Nintendo; and any game that uses shooting, even if it's
only paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all rehearsal for real-life violence,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne White, a Bethesda, Md., mother and director of the Lion &AMP;
Lamb Project, a national grass-roots organization that provides
support for parents on this issue, was determined that her son,
David, would have no war toys. That takes conviction, as well as a
deaf ear: You have to be able to tolerate cries of ``You're a
terrible mother!'' and ``But all my friends have one!''
</P>
<P>
   She admits it wasn't easy, but she held on to her mantra, which
she shared with David: ``Violence is not OK under any
circumstances.'' Nonetheless, she worried peers might exclude him.
They never did. ``He always had games and activities no one else
had, so kids loved playing at our house,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For parents who want to take the no-guns-at-all route,
educational psychologist Doris Bergen recommends banding together
with like-minded parents. ``It's ideal if they are the parents of
your son's playmates, but even if they aren't, at least he won't
feel alone in the world on this,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Early childhood educator Diane Levin of Wheelock College is one
of the nation's most outspoken critics of toys with violent
messages. But her research also shows the importance of parents
staying connected to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rigid position cuts you off from your son and makes him
feel isolated from his friends and angry at you as a result, you
leave the lessons he learns more open to the influence of others,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The preschool phase
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For parents like her, the trick is to find a position that feels
comfortable in principle and practice. This can be hardest when our
sons are in preschool, the age when they are most insistent about
wanting war toys. There are two reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   --They are working out what it means to be male. ``They are very
concrete thinkers, so, as they struggle with gender identification,
they latch on to salient features,'' says Levin. Because adult as
well as children's culture is rife with images of men engaged in
war, violence, and toughness, these are the behaviors boys identify
with maleness and try on for size, through mimickry.
</P>
<P>
   --They are working out how to control impulses and anger, and
how to conquer certain fears such as separation from parents.
``Playing good guys vs. bad makes them feel powerful and helps
resolve internal conflicts: They symbolically project their fear or
anger onto the bad guy,'' says early childhood educator Nancy
Carlsson-Paige of Lesley College. She is coauthor with Levin of
several books, including ``Who's Calling the Shots? How to Respond
Effectively to Children's Fascination with War Play, War Toys and
Violent TV'' (NAEYC Press).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these two developmental needs can feed off each
other, so that it's difficult to untangle what issue a child is
working on. ``The more violence they see, the more they not only
want to play it out but actually need to, to master the
experience,'' says Bergen, who teaches at Miami University in Ohio.
Even if you don't allow a child this age to play with war toys, she
says, he'll likely take almost any object, from a stick to a piece
of toast, and pretend it's a gun or sword.
</P>
<P>
   We should not necessarily stop him from doing that: How a child
plays is more important than what he plays with, according to
developmentalists like Bergen, Levin, and Carlsson-Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some children get more caught up in war play and
action heroes than others, a result of temperament, a reaction to
what is happening in their lives, or both. Carlsson-Paige tells of
two brothers whose parents were going through divorce. ``The
2-year-old put on his Superman cape, a red towel, every day when he
woke up and kept it on all day. He was Superman. It empowered him;
it was how he learned to cope,'' she says. The older brother read
books.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parental monitoring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the aggressive play involves toast chewed into the shape
of a gun or a toy sword, our job is to pay close attention to the
play and be prepared to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two preschool boys play the same game over and over so that
it looks scripted; if the play is very aggressive and imitates the
show's shooting, karate chops and the like; if the toys are highly
realistic replicas of what they see on the screen; and if the play
at the end of the day looks exactly the same as it did in the
morning, that's not good,'' says Levin.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests finding ways to break its scripted nature and get
them to use their imagination: ``Your Star Wars action figures look
really dirty. I wonder if they'd like a bath?'' and offer to fill
the tub. Or, ``They must be starving,'' and suggest making Play-Doh
food or mud pies.
</P>
<P>
   It's less problematic if a child's play is more creative from
the get-go, even if he's pretending the paper towel tube is a gun.
``If it's a gun one day and a telescope the next, and if they were
fighting aliens in the morning and wild animals in the afternoon,
you know there's creativity at work. This child is working on his
own issues, not issues dictated to him by a TV script,'' says
Levin. ``That's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   With either child, however, if you see play that's too
aggressive, repetitive, or mean-sounding, say so. Levin suggests
doing it in a way that keeps you connected: ``I know you like to
pretend you're Darth Maul (a new evil `Star Wars' character) but
you were so mean, it felt like you really were him. I was worried!
I want to make sure you know you're still my little boy!'' ' Or:
``When the two of you get worked up, I worry you'll get hurt. What
can we do to make sure no one does?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing itself out
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Developmentally, boys lose interest in war play in the late
elementary school years. But, says Bergen, ``Because violence
dominates video play and because there are more sophisticated gun
toys geared to the older child, kids stay with it.'' That increases
the likelihood that they will buy into the violent message and
highlights the need for parents to remain vigiliant, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Gorski has consistently told Jonah and his younger son, Matt,
that video games are bad for the brain: ``They help you to grow
stupid.'' White lets her son have Nintendo, but only the sport
games. Levin's son has had two toy guns in his life, a cowboy gun
at 5 (the result of a trade he negotiated) and a giant squirt gun
as a preteen, but only after he agreed it would be used in a
specific part of the yard, never out in the neighborhood, and would
never be squirted randomly, only at people who had agreed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jonah, these children are well aware of their parents'
objections and have not always been happy with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm different from a lot of kids,'' says Jonah.
``Sometimes I wish I could be like them, but then it crosses my
mind that I'm proud of my parents for standing up for something. It
hasn't stopped me from having friends. Friends like me for who I
am, not for the toys I have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Telling a preschooler, ``You can't have a toy gun because a
real gun can kill someone,'' doesn't compute for him because he
can't make the leap from concrete to abstract. Say instead, ``Kids
get hurt from pretend play with guns because they get so wild, even
when they don't mean to''; or, ``Real shooting can hurt. Even
pretending it is mean and not nice.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tell an older child, ``Guns are serious things. Even seeing a
toy gun reminds me of all the real accidents from real guns.''
</P>
<P>
   --Teach even a preschooler: If you find a gun you think is real,
never touch it, and tell an adult right away.
</P>
<P>
   --Research shows that school-age boys who engage in lots of war
play, including video games with guns, are most at risk for not
being able to distinguish between real and fantasy violence and for
becoming increasingly aggressive because they think they can never
be strong or tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   --Boys who don't like war play and/or violent video games may
feel ashamed for not being like other boys. They need lots of
support for the activities they do enjoy.
</P>

NETANYAHU SOWED THE SEEDS OF HIS OWN DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five weeks before he was elected Israel's prime minister in May
1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was asked whether a Likud-led government
would agree to turn over Hebron _ the world's oldest Jewish city _
to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason to withdraw from Hebron,'' Netanyahu said,
reiterating his longstanding position. ``It will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But in January 1997, Netanyahu's government (itals)did(unitals)
turn over Hebron to the Palestinians. A cartoon in the Jerusalem
Post showed the prime minister looking into a mirror and seeing the
face of Shimon Peres, his extremely dovish predecessor, gazing back
at him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Peres, as foreign minister under the late Yitzhak Rabin,
who had quarterbacked the Oslo accord between Israel and the PLO
that was signed with such fanfare at the White House in 1993. And
when Israel, in the 2 1/2 years following that ceremony, was rocked
by a wave of Palestinian terror attacks, it was Peres who repeated
time and again: ``The peace process must continue.'' To Netanyahu
and his supporters, this was appeasement of the most suicidal kind,
tantamount to rewarding Palestinians for murdering Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was Netanyahu himself, just weeks after the latest
terrorist atrocity _ the gunning-down of Ita Tzur and her
12-year-old son Ephraim _ shaking hands with Arafat and handing
over the keys to Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   If you take your cues from US media commentators, you may
believe that Netanyahu was tossed out of office by Israeli voters
this week because he was a stiff-necked obstructor of the Oslo
``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the commentariat has it backward. Netanyahu didn't lose to
Ehud Barak because he derailed what Rabin and Peres began. He lost
because he (itals)didn't(unitals) derail it, after having promised
that he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derail'' is my word, of course, not Netanyahu's. When he ran
for prime minister the first time, he made it clear that he could
not abrogate an agreement lawfully entered into by an Israeli
government. What he could do, he said, was enforce it. If Arafat
and the Palestinians would not live up to their Oslo commitments _
by turning over suspected terrorists for trial, halting the
constant incitement to anti-Israel violence, closing down their
illegal operations in Jerusalem, and repealing the covenant calling
for Israel's liquidation _ then Israel would surrender no more
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of land-for-peace in a Netanyahu government
would depend on the Palestinians. If they proved themselves serious
about making peace, they would get more land. If not, not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a popular position, and it grew more popular with each
new terror attack. In the runup to the 1996 election, polls showed
that fewer and fewer Israelis believed Peres capable of making
Arafat fulfill his Oslo obligations. On election day, Netanyahu won
a solid majority of the Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon the would-be Israeli Churchill began to morph into a
Chamberlain. The rhetoric remained tough, but the deeds belied
them. Doves and softliners were appointed to key government posts.
Netanyahu agreed to meet personally with Arafat, a gesture of great
symbolic importance, without receiving any peaceable gesture in
return. When Palestinian troops opened fire on Jewish targets in
Gaza, Ramallah, Bethlehem, and Nablus in September 1996,
Netanyahu's reaction was to seek another meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leftists and the global media continued to paint
Netanyahu as an intransigent warmonger, but it was clear to savvy
Israelis that for all Netanyahu's tough talk, the Rabin-Peres
policy of unilateral concessions was going to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't honored even one of the promises which he made to
the Likud before the elections,'' a pro-Oslo Israeli
parliamentarian happily pointed out in October 1996. ``He said that
Jews would pray on the Temple Mount, and it didn't happen. He said,
`We will close Orient House' (the unlawful Palestinian headquarters
in Jerusalem), and it isn't closed. Netanyahu said he would not
honor the Oslo agreements if the Palestinians did not honor every
paragraph in them, and now Netanyahu is committed in any case.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians still dream of erasing Israel from the map. As
Barak's supporters were celebrating their victory on Monday night,
Katyusha rockets were fired into Israel's Galilee towns by
terrorists from Hezbollah _ the same Hezbollah that repeated its
call two weeks ago to ``eliminate the Jewish state.'' Arafat is now
demanding not only Jerusalem, but Beersheba, Acre, and Jaffa, too.
Three years of Netanyahu's governance have not dampened Palestinian
irredentism. They have encouraged it.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiescing in the Oslo ``peace process'' whose dangers he
once decried, Netanyahu fatally demoralized that segment of the
Israeli public that had insisted on Palestinian compliance.
Opposition to Oslo collapsed; what remained was a national
consensus in favor of appeasement. When Netanyahu committed Israel
to further withdrawals in the Wye agreement last fall, public
opinion overwhelmingly backed it.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, this represents a failure of national will, one for
which Israelis will pay an awful price. But I am not an Israeli
voter, and for Israeli voters this week, the choice was not between
pro-Oslo and anti-Oslo. It was between an enthusiastically pro-Oslo
candidate and a pro-Oslo candidate whose support was sullen and
half-hearted. They went with the real thing.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

   `Raise your hands,'' said the man at the head of the room. ``On
a scale of 1 to 10, how do you rate today? One? Two? Three? Four?
Five? Six?'' One hand went up. ``Seven?'' A smattering. ``Eight?''
Most of the hands were up by now. ``Nine?'' A few more. ``Ten?''
Two hands went up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of my first day at the Option Institute in
Sheffield, Mass., five weeks ago. I was taking a weeklong workshop
in ``Optimal Self-Trust'' with Barry Kaufman, who with his wife
founded the institute to teach people how to live happier, more
self-empowered lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Barry said, ``What do you think accounts for such a
range?'' It didn't take us long to realized that the rating we'd
each given had as much to do with our expectations and standards of
excellence as with the class itself. The degree to which each of us
valued the day's events depended to a great extent upon our own
frame of mind. Barry asked the women who'd raised their hands at 10
to explain why they'd chosen the highest number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I only had five days here and I wanted to make the best
of every opportunity,'' said a lovely blonde with a British accent.
``I didn't hold back. I was really present and it was great!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind to take advantage of every moment. I did and
so it turned out to be a terrific day,'' said the second
enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean that, before you even got here, you'd decided to
make each day a 10 for yourself?'' Barry asked. The women nodded. I
was stunned. I've always believed that having a good time depended
upon the places you went and the company you kept. It was
incredible to think that you could accomplish the same thing by
simply stating your intention and sticking with it. With four more
days to go, each of us, I think, was determined to try to pull off
that trick for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, I vowed to give myself over entirely to our various
discussions and exercises. Each evening, I decided I would rate
whatever had happened at the top of my scale. The result surprised
me.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of feeling a discrepancy between my assessment and
reality, each day somehow enlarged itself to fill my definition. To
my surprise, planning on calling the day a 10 actually made it a
10. My experience, it turned out, didn't exist apart from my
opinion of it. It was malleable and utterly within my control. My
attitude alone seemed to be as powerful as anything the world threw
at me.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you one small example. We'd been given yellow
markers, and at the end of the first day, a few were left behind in
the room. I picked up an extra and put it in my pocketbook. The
next day, however, when I saw a woman desperately searching for her
missing marker, I immediately went up to her and said, ``I have
two. I must have accidently taken an extra one. Here it is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys sidled up behind me. ``I don't believe that
story for a minute,'' River whispered. My face flushed with
embarrassment. I'd been caught lying. How often did I do this? Who
else had noticed? Was I always this transparent? My day was quickly
unraveling into a 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how easily those words came out of my mouth,''
I confessed, burying my head against River's shoulder. When I
finally looked up, he was smiling at me as if I were his very
favorite liar. My day began to perk up into a 6. Would the others
be equally forgiving? Did I dare to share this story without making
excuses for myself?
</P>
<P>
   I remembered my intention. I was going for a 10 and that meant
taking risks, but maybe not. Barry had said that there was no such
thing as a risk if you weren't attached to the outcome. What if I
stopped worrying about what people might think and concentrated on
learning from my mistakes? Could I admit what I'd done and be
comfortable, no matter what happened? As we settled into our
circle, I was totally involved.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, I confessed to my lie, along with another
``fib'' from the day before. No one lifted an eyebrow. I checked
myself out. I was hovering around an 8. It occurred to me that,
strictly for my own peace of mind, I should either reform or simply
decide to tell the truth about myself just as I am. Both choices
seemed equally acceptable. My spirits began to soar. I felt as
light as a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a 7-plus existence. This was daring, stretching,
reaching beyond comfortable boundaries I usually stay within. I
zoomed past 10.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't come down yet.

<P>
   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.

   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This summer, consider leaving the automobile at home and
exploring America from the deck of a windjammer, a paddlewheel
steamer or a barge.
 &HT;    From the mighty waters of the Mississippi to the Napa River in
California, all-American small ship cruises have become
increasingly popular ways to vacation. There are voyages on vintage
vessels like ``Victory Chimes,'' a 99-year-old retired working
schooner that sails on Maine's Penobscot Bay.
 &HT;    There are replicas, like the ``Queen of the West,'' a
paddlewheel steamer that plies the Columbia, Willamette and Snake
Rivers in Washington and Oregon.
 &HT;    There are also ships like ``Spirit of Discovery,'' modern
vessels built for exploration, that are used in California wine
country.
 &HT;    These cruises reward passengers with a sense of discovery and an
opportunity to see American history come alive. Whether the theme
is Cajun country, Mark Twain or Lewis &AMP; Clark, there's an essential
aspect of Americana that takes on fresh meaning to anyone who has
ever gone on a small ship cruise.
 &HT;    Small ships, in this case, mean vessels that accommodate
anywhere from 20 to 440 people. They're a far cry from the
2,000-plus passenger cruise ships that ply the Caribbean.
 &HT;    These cruises are quieter, slower and less hectic. Daily shore
excursions are a vital part of such trips. The cost depends upon
the boat, cabin size, cruise length and season, but such cruise
prices usually include all meals and entertainment, and many
include the cost of shore excursions as well. Here's a selection of
small ship cruises around the country.
 &HT;    Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery Bldg., Suite 700,
Seattle, Wash. 98121; 206-441-8687; www.cruisewest.com) has
eight-day cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington
and Oregon.
 &HT;    Down in California, the same company offers four- and five-day
cruises through wine country, on the Napa and Sacramento Rivers.
This cruise line uses 54- to 102-passenger expedition-style
vessels, like ``Spirit of Glacier Bay,'' the same ones they use in
Alaska's Inside Passage in summertime. Running from September to
November, four-day wine country trips start at $595.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232; www.columbiarivercruise.com)
has the ``Queen of the West,'' a 163-passenger paddlewheel steamer.
They offer four and seven-day cruises on the Columbia, Snake and
Willamette Rivers through the heart of Oregon and Washington.
 &HT;    The cruise follows the trail blazed by explorers Lewis &AMP; Clark
in the early 19th century, with such modern-day excursions as a
jet-boat ride into Hells Canyon. Running from February through
December, four-day cruises start at $645
 &HT;    Delta Queen Steamboat Company (1380 Port of New Orleans Place,
New Orleans, La. 70130; 800-543-1949; www.deltaqueen.com) offers
hundreds of departures on the Mississippi River, as well as the
Ohio, the St. Croix, the Illinois, the Kanawha, the Cumberland and
the Tennessee Rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    Offering what are arguably the most famous river trips in
America, the Delta Queen has three- to 14-night cruises aboard
three paddlewheel steamers: the 174-passenger ``Delta Queen,'' the
416-passenger ``Mississippi Queen'' and the 436-passenger
``American Queen.''
 &HT;    There are upwards of 24 different theme cruises each year,
ranging from ``Gardens of the River'' to ``Big Band'' cruises. The
ships run year-round and three-night cruises start at $660.
 &HT;    Maine Windjammer Association (P.O. Box 1144P, Blue Hill, Me.
04614; 800-807-WIND; www.sailmainecoast.com) is comprised of 13
traditional tall ships, including ``Victory Chimes,'' ``Grace
Bailey'' and ``Mary Day,'' that range in size from 64 to 132 feet
on deck. All of the ships are privately owned and operated. Each
windjammer carries between 20 and 44 passengers.
 &HT;    The fleet departs from the ports of Rockland, Rockport and
Camden, located in the mid-coast region of Maine, about two hours
north or Portland. They sail on three- to six-day cruises
throughout the islands of Penobscot Bay from May until October.
Rates start at $350 for three-day cruises.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursions (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-238-0125/www.riverbarge.com) has four- to 10-day trips
on a hotel barge, the ``River Explorer.''
 &HT;    The vessel is actually two interlocked oil barges, complete with
dining room, entertainment area and 99 staterooms. The
198-passenger vessel is pushed, not towed, on the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, as well as the Intracoastal
Waterway and the Atchafalaya Basin.
 &HT;    There are theme cruises such as ``Cajuns and Creoles,'' which
travels through the Atchafalaya Basin and the lower Mississippi, as
well as ``America's Junction,'' along the Ohio River Valley.
Running year-round, four-day trips start at $740.

<P>
   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a storybook cuteness reminiscent of Williamsburg in
its newly restored state. It is also a small city of only 62,000
inhabitants, and many historic sights are within easy walking
distance of each other. Many side streets are closed to most cars,
but travelers who find a hotel in town won't need to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The old market square, or Marktplatz, is surrounded by lovingly
restored buildings, including the Rathaus, or City Hall, and the
neo-classical Hotel Elephant, rebuilt in 1938, which has attracted
guests from Bach to Hitler. The interior has been renovated in the
Bauhaus style with Art Deco details.
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors can stroll down winding cobblestone streets
to the cathedral at Herder Platz, the newly restored Deutsches
National Theater and the homes of Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe spent much of his professional life in his house and
garden at 1 Frauenplanweg, not only as a poet but also as a
part-time scientist and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   The large Baroque building, constructed in 1707-09, has been
meticulously preserved, complete with his large library and a
studyhousing the books he was reading at the time of his death.
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; admission, $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Goethe House is the Goethe National Museum, which
features a new, permanent exhibit about Goethe and his time. It
includes manuscripts and letters; $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another key stop is the Stadt schloss Museum of contemporary art
at 1 Burgplatz. The museum, in a sprawling Baroque palace with a
courtyard big enough for open-air concerts, has attracted a broad
range of European art, from 16th-century paintings to contemporary
works, and will be the site of many of theart exhibits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stadtschloss is also appealing because of its character
and its idyllic location overlooking the wooded parkland of the Ilm
River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission, $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city is the reminder of a more recent, grimmer past.
At Buchenwald, the former concentration camp consists of two
separate sites: a massive memorial built by the East German
government and the remnants of the camp itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the camp is through an iron gate that bears the
chilling inscription, ''Everyone Gets What He Deserves.'' Though
much of the camp was razed and is now open fields, the preserved
buildings include some of the prison cells, a disinfection chamber
and the crematorium. Admission is free. In the summer, hours are
9:45 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Visitors can pick up
Bus No. 6 in Goethe Platz downtown for Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has a few big hotels and many smaller ones; even the
cheapest places are clean and secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Villa Hentzel, 12 Bauhausstrasse, (49-3643) 86580, fax
(49-3643) 865819, is a comfortable old hotel in downtown that has
been nicely renovated and offers all the basic amenities at a low
price. Its 13 antiques-filled rooms come with cable television,
private baths and floor-to-ceiling windows. Double room with
breakfast, $85 to $107.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Bargain hunters can find excellent deals at the small
pensions that have been converted from private homes. One of the
more upscale of these is the Pension Savina at 60 Meyerstrasse,
(49-3643)86690, fax (49-3643) 866911. Its 12 rooms have showers,
computer connections, mini-kitchen and cable TV. And there is a
sauna and solarium. Doubles: $78, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The city's most famous establishment is the 102-room
Hotel Elephant, 19 Markt, (49-3643)8020, fax (49-3643) 802610, now
part of the Kempinski chain. Situated on the central market square,
it was constructed as a government building in 1542 and converted
to a hotel in 1741, with Bauhaus and Art Deco interior. Doubles:
$175 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar has many small cafes and restaurants, and guides say that
the Residenz Cafe, looking out overthe Ilm at 4 Grunemarkt, is the
oldest cafe in Germany. Today it is a gathering spot with a vaguely
bohemian feel that draws many of the actors and workers from nearby
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharfe Ecke, 2 Eisfeld, (49-3643) 202430, is one of several
small homey restaurants in the historic section. It serves
Thuringian specialties like the meat-filled dumplings known as
klossen and the spicy Thuringian bratwurst. The walls are decorated
with kitschy German paintings, the ambiance is old-fashioned, the
waiters are friendly to children. Meal for two with wine: $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the Felsenkeller, 37 Humboldstrasse, (49-3643) 850366, the
beer comes from its own microbrewery. It accompanies good
Thuringian cuisine in a wonderful location just a few steps from
the Nietzsche House on a quiet street of meticulously renovated
houses. Picture windows in the back look out onto the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Felsenkeller offers a range of German meat and fish dishes,
as well as Thuringian specialties such as bierfleisch, pork
marinated in beer and served like goulash. Dinner for two with wine
is about $34.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's best lunchtime bargains is the ACC Galleria
Cafe next to the Stadtschloss Museum, 1 Burgplatz, (49-3643)
851161. At this little cafe, the chef's daily specials are the best
bet. What the menu lacks in choice it makes up for in creativity
and price. Though the cooking tends toward French, recent specials
included a vegetable paella and an apricot chicken curry. The price
is $6.25 a person, with drinks extra. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.

   &UR; By EDMUND L. ANDREWS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who imagines the former East Germany as grim, gray and
dominated by Stalinist architecture is in for a surprise in Weimar.
Even during the four decades of Communism, this small city in
Thuringia was protected as a cultural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Weimar's history as home to many of Germany's
greatest writers and composers, notably the poet Goethe, Communist
authorities took pains to preserve many of its stately homes and
historic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the European Union named Weimar this year's cultural
capital, its ninth such designation but the first from a formerly
Communist country, the pace of restoration and renovation became
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Financed in large part with money from western Germany, city
officials have lined up an extraordinary calendar of concerts, art
exhibits, theater and dance from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They have also tried to weave together the three major
historical legacies that shaped this city. The first is Weimar's
golden era in the 18th and 19th centuries, encompassing the time
when Goethe wrote his epicdrama ''Faust,'' and others living and
writing in the city included the poet and dramatist Schiller, the
composers Liszt and J.S. Bach and Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The second, tragic legacy is that of Hitler and the Third Reich,
when Weimar was a way station for prisoners taken to Buchenwald,
about six miles outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald has been preserved as a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust since the late '50s and draws thousands of tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The third legacy is Communism, which split Germany until the
Berlin wall fell in 1989. Like all of eastern Germany, this city
still struggles with the financial and cultural adjustment to a
capitalist system run largely by western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the year's festivities is available at
www.weimar1999.de; ticket orders: (49-3643)240024, fax (49-3643)
240025.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cultural calendar includes scores of programs devoted to
Goethe, whose 250th birthday is on Aug. 28, and all kinds of
interpretations of ''Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   One version directed by Janusz Wisniewski and performedby the
Dusseldorf Theater has been nicknamed the ''80-minute Faust.'' The
show has been described by its promoters as a jarring adaptation
set in a surreal time of the ''futuristic Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The production will take place June 17 to 20 at 8:30 p.m. at the
Kubus Theater in Goethe Park; $20.50 to $27.85, at 1.77 marks to
the dollar. '
</P>
<P>
   ''Urfaust, a Subjective Tragedy,'' by the Spanish writer
Fernando Pessoa and staged in German by the Theatre UBU from
Montreal, contrasts a modern angst-ridden Faust with one obsessed
by the search for meaning. At the Redoute, Ettersburger Strasse,
June 4 to 6 at 8 p.m.; tickets,$20.50 to $27.85.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest concerts will take place on the days
surrounding Goethe's 250th birthday. In a program whose theme is
reconciliation, Zubin Mehta will conduct a joint performance of
Mahler's Second Symphony by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Bavarian State Orchestra. Tickets for the open-air concert on
Aug. 28 at 8:15 p.m. at the Park Tiefurt, just east of town along
the Ilm River,are $20.50 to $75.70.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be the site of another outdoor concert on Aug. 30
at 8 p.m., when Kurt Masur will conduct the Jeunesses Musicales
World Orchestra in Beethoven's Concerto in D for Violin, as well as
Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony; $20.50 to $75.75.

BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A BEHEMOTH _ THE F250

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, spring. Warm breezes, quenching mists, a time of flowers,
young buds, tender sprouts, tissue-soft leaves and fecund soil; a
time of renewal, when the fancies of many people turn to . . .
big-honkin' pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we've got garages and cellars to clean; the detritus
of winter to move from our yards; loam and manure and railroad ties
and rocks to haul; lumber to truck in for new decks and docks and
sheds. What more utilitarian vehicle for many of us to own at this
time of year than a pickup truck?
</P>
<P>
   It was just over 50 years ago that Henry Ford himself spotted
this looming need and one of the last projects he oversaw at Ford
Motor Co. was the development of the F-Series pickup trucks,
arguably the most enduring of its ilk in auto history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pickup truck is in constant transition and, to the
surprise of folks at Ford, some of its biggest trucks, developed
with contractors in mind, are now selling to the general public.
And why not? They'll seat six comfortably, have the 4WD panache of
an SUV, and have that pickup truck bed. And in a day when size
matters to many, they are huge.
</P>
<P>
   We're rolling up and out of Boston's North End and onto
Interstate 93 in the 1999 F250 Supercab. It felt big on entry,
since that was a step-to-running-board and then
step-into-cab-from-there affair. It feels even bigger looking out
the driver's side window and down into the lap of someone sitting
in . . . a Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Ease out onto the highway and open up its V-10 Triton engine and
this beast charges down the lane. Gain speed and hold it and some
remarkable traits are noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Given how high it sits off the ground _ creating a potential
wind tunnel underneath _ and the huge mirrors that radiate like
wings from each front doorpost, this is an aerodynamically quiet
vehicle. Even tire noise _ and these are serious, gnarly truck
tires _ is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The engine, 6.8 liters pushing out 275 horses, is noticeable but
not intrusive. It sounds more like a strong and distant wind
blowing somewhere out on the stretching mesa that is the hood than
it does any thumping engine of stressed steel.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that this engine puts out 410 lbs.-ft. of torque and
you are into the diesel league in that category, serious hauling
and towing capacity without the loud and incessant chatter, or the
smell, of diesel.
</P>
<P>
   And in any truck or SUV, with their specific design intent,
torque talks far louder than horsepower. The difference: Consider a
track star and a mountain climber. The track star's horsepower can
send her flying down the track. But strap an 80-pound pack on that
nimble track star and another on the seasoned climber and ask each
to put one leg up on a step at waist level and hoist themselves up
on the power of that leg, and the woman who's climbed mountains
will push up with far more ease. That's torque.
</P>
<P>
   It's what let this F250, its front tires set against an 18-inch
ledge in the woods, push itself up and over from a dead stop.
</P>
<P>
   It's what let it be hooked to a trailer hauling a 22-foot
waterski boat with its own 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, and pull it
with ease. At speed _ 60 m.p.h. and less than 2,000 rpms _ the
presence of the trailer and boat were not even noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   While smooth and relatively quiet on the highway, its stiffness
was noticeable even on small bumps, cracks, or even pressure plates
on the ends of bridges and ramps. One jolt dropped the rearview
mirror from the center of the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is quite a comfortable truck for long trips. Its front
bench seat holds three adults easily. Three could ride in the back
_ accessed with a door on each side _ but it would not be fun on a
long trip. Three kids are OK back there.
</P>
<P>
   If Aretha Franklin sang about this truck, the song would be
``RESPECT'' _ as in that's what you get from drivers who might
otherwise challenge you on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts rotaries, its sheer size imposed what neither
the law, common sense, nor common courtesy has been able to do:
acknowledgement that a vehicle already in the rotary has the right
of way.
</P>
<P>
   But with mass comes responsibility. In traffic, you must drive
this truck far more carefully _ and differently _ than you would
other vehicles. Its rear end sits so high that smaller cars can
virtually disappear behind it. They shouldn't be that close, but
folks do that and you have to be aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its massive wheelbase, turns must be anticipated _
and thus announced _ earlier, and they must be made slightly wider.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a place to park in the city is problematic and some
tight turns into alleys or parking lots are nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Off road, it has plenty of power, of course, and its bite in mud
and muck and water and gravel and sand is phenomenal. The problem
is, the deeper you get into the woods, the narrower the roads
become. If you've done any serious four-wheeling you know that you
sometimes have to squeeze between trees on narrow roads and _ bane
of 4WDers _ sometimes turn around and go back. There are places out
there just too tight for this truck to pass through and places
where you might get stuck and not have the space to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Expect between 10 and 13 miles per gallon from a 38-gallon tank
and expect crowds to gather around it when you park it. In my neck
of New Hampshire it drew them. My pal ``Big Truck'' Mike Delisle
took one look at it down at the local baseball field, forgot all
about his cup of coffee and crawled over, under, around and through
it. He particularly liked the tow package with its grill-mounted
transmission cooler, the separate fuse box for all trailer
electrics, and the myriad tie-in options to those electrics that
come standard on the F250.
</P>
<P>
   And women, who virtually ignored recent past appearances of a
BMW sports car, a turbocharged Volkswagen Beetle, and a $70,000
Mercedes in my little town, were far more interested in this beast.
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of that may be something that Ford Motor Co.
says it has noticed: families looking to get into trucks the
manfacturer thought would sell almost exclusively to industry and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a truck for the city; it is not even a truck you'd
want to use to drop into the city from the suburbs. It is not an
offroad truck in the pure sense. It was not designed to be any of
these things, really. But if you've got hauling to do _ big loads
or kids or both _ it would not look bad in your yard.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The back row of moving clips to match the buttons that hold
down the tarp covering the bed. Ever try to stretch a cold tarp to
a fixed button? These do the job for you.
</P>
<P>
   --The huge center console that is available when you fold down
the back of the middle seat in front.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --It is forgivable that the windshield mirror fell off on a
bump; it is not forgivable that even when it stayed in place, it
kept drooping out of place and there was no way to adjust for its
loose balljoint attachment.
</P>
<P>
   --Why do the rear door handles have to be tucked inside the door
frame, accessible only when the front door is open? Why not put
them outside on the door?

   On May 13, 1939, eight months after her father committed suicide
because Jews in Vienna were no longer permitted to work and six
months after Nazi storm troopers ransacked her family's home on the
infamous Kristallnacht, Liane Reif-Lehrer, clutching her mother's
hand, boarded the ocean liner St. Louis in Hamburg. Their
destination was safe haven in America.
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer was 4 years old, one of more than 900 Jews, mostly
German, who sailed across the Atlantic to Cuba, where they thought
they had the paperwork necessary to await immigration to the United
States. Instead, they were rebuffed by Cuban officials, denied
entry into the United States and eventually forced back to Europe.
More than 220 subsequently died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 60 years later, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington, D.C., is commemorating the voyage of the St. Louis with
an exhibit that runs until Sept. 6. The former passengers include
two suburban Boston women, 64-year-old Reif-Lehrer of Lexington and
66-year-old Ruth Loeb Forrest of Newton. One of five families
featured in the display includes 84-year-old Sidney Blechner of
Brookline, whose brother Oskar was on the St. Louis and who almost
sailed on the ship himself.
</P>
<P>
   The day Reif-Lehrer, her mother, and her brother boarded the St.
Louis, they headed to the first-class cabins because Chaje Leja
Reif, permitted to take few assets with her, preferred booking
expensive passage to leaving behind money for Nazis to loot. She'd
tossed the gold her husband used in his dental practice into the
Danube River before she departed Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest's father, Leo Loeb, who'd spent six weeks in Dachau
after Kristallnacht, was already in Havana when the St. Louis
arrived, and he ventured out in a small boat as near as he could to
the ship that carried Forrest, her mother, her brother, and her
paternal grandparents. She could see her father and he could see
them, but the view from their separate craft was as close as they
got before the St. Louis turned around. Her grandparents were
killed in Auschwitz. So was her aunt's father, who was also on the
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Blechner was stranded in Poland, released from the camp
to which he'd been deported in 1938 from his hometown of Munich but
unable to secure the documents he needed to make his way to Hamburg
in time to board the St. Louis. So it sailed without him. Blechner
then survived six years in six concentration camps, including
Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The St. Louis affected me,'' says Forrest, a retired nurse and
mother of seven. ``Even in my yearbook I had written that I'm for
the underdog. I feel for the people in Kosovo. It's not just them.
Anytime this happens. Going back to that ship from Haiti when we
wouldn't let them in. That's ingrained in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have felt as frightened or angry about any
situation since then as I do now about Yugoslavia,'' says
Reif-Lehrer, a chemist-turned-consultant and mother of two. ``The
concept that in this century _ and especially at the end of this
century _ people are still trying to resolve their differences by
going out and playing `bang bang, let's see who can shoot the most
of the other guy' is so obscene and so outrageously uncivilized. I
don't have words to describe what I feel about this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis was front-page news in Boston, as elsewhere, in
1939 as it wandered, unwelcome and prohibited from docking, between
Cuba and Florida before turning back, presumably to Germany, on
June 6. Gone was the jovial atmosphere that characterized the
voyage to Cuba. Gone were the sumptuous meals first-class
passengers had enjoyed. The captain feared mass suicide. One man
had tried by cutting his wrists and jumping into the harbor as the
boat left Havana, which earned him a brief respite in Cuba before
he, too, was sent back to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only on June 13 did Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and
Britain each agree to admit some passengers. On June 17, the St.
Louis docked at Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The story has spawned books and films. But it wasn't until
spring 1996, when four St. Louis survivors went to the Holocaust
Museum looking for information, that anyone tried to systematically
learn what happened to the passengers on that ship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after almost three years of searching written records,
contacting Jewish communities around the world, and, more recently,
publicizing the new exhibit, museum researchers know the fate of
all but 23 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 were deported to Auschwitz and the killing center of
Sobibor. None survived Sobibor, and five survived Auschwitz.
Another 40 were deported to other camps, where most were killed. An
undetermined number, including the mother of Forrest's aunt, died
in Europe outside the camps. As far as the museum knows, none of
the 287 who went to England, including Blechner's brother Oskar,
died in the Holocaust for the simple reason that Germany never
occupied Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many survived in the countries that fell to
Hitler, says museum project coordinator Scott Miller, is because
they were already on waiting lists to enter the United States under
the quota system in place at the time. Their turn to immigrate came
while it was still possible to cross the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer and Forrest were young girls on the St. Louis, and
their memories are children's memories boosted by the recollections
of others. Forrest's mother, Bella Loeb, is 95, a resident of the
Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged in Roslindale, unaware of
either her surroundings or her past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Kristallnacht (Nov. 9, 1938) as though it was last
night. My mother was holding me in her arms and my brother was
hanging onto her skirt,'' says Reif-Lehrer. ``The only thing I
remember from the voyage is we were really seasick almost all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Blechner, whose fateful inability to get to Hamburg in time for
the St. Louis departure led to years of suffering, has only started
talking about the Holocaust in the past few years. For more than a
decade he wore a Band-Aid over the number 69717, tattooed onto his
left forearm at Auschwitz on Oct. 23, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start a new life, to cry what is gone is gone,'' says
the retired businessman and father of four. ``If you say something
about the Holocaust you can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Lehrer and her family were among the 224 passengers sent to
France. A fellow passenger, a man bound for England, had been
bothering her mother, so she made sure her family went elsewhere.
``My brother tells me he was absolutely livid that my mother made
that request,'' says Reif-Lehrer. ``It was really stupid to go to
France.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine months the family lived in Loudun, the last two weeks
under Nazi occupation. There she befriended a little boy, Jean-Paul
Berg, who, she believes, did not survive the war. In 1940, under
cloak of night, the Reifs and 14 other Jewish refugees made their
way to Limoges, in unoccupied Vichy France. It was far from their
life of affluence in Vienna, where Reif-Lehrer liked to linger in
the kitchen with the cook and squealed when servants pulled the
runners in the hall to give her rides or bounced her in sheets they
were folding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food really got to be a problem,'' Reif-Lehrer recalls.
``There were ration coupons. It was one egg per month per person,
but you could never get them. One day my mother and my brother and
I walked for miles and miles and miles and got three eggs, and when
we came back they were rotten. We had to throw them out.

   ``It was very hard to get bread. Because I was little and I was
cute, I got the job of begging for bread. I went in alone to
bakeries and I had to say, `I'm so hungry. I have ration coupons
and I have money and I need bread.' Very often I got bread. That
got shared not just with my family but with other people. A few
years ago I said to my brother, `Did anyone think how demeaning it
made me feel to do that?' My brother looked me straight in the eye
and said, `It wasn't demeaning. It was bread.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1941, the Reifs learned of a boat leaving from
Lisbon. They arranged the papers needed to leave France, travel
through Spain, and enter Portugal. On Nov. 10, 1941, four days
before Reif-Lehrer's seventh birthday, the family arrived in New
York. Cousins met them and drove them to the tenements of the Lower
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in the car, we were sitting in the back seat, and
my mother under her breath said, `Have I suffered all this just to
come to this?' Even though I was only 7, I remember thinking there
was something not right about her saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   While the Reifs were slowly making their way to America via
France, the Loebs were in Brussels. They were from Malsch, in
southern Germany, where Leo Loeb sold cattle. He was president of
the synagogue, which may be the reason he was held at Dachau in
1938 so much longer than his father or brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis released him six weeks after Kristallnacht, they
told him to leave the country, so he arranged to go to Cuba to
await entry in the United States. The rest of the family would
follow. Before he left Germany, the family posed for a portrait,
``probably,'' Forrest says, ``just in case we never saw each other
again.'' It is a mournful picture in which Leo Loeb's head is still
nearly bald after being shaved at Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   Every day after he left, Forrest's mother wrote her husband. To
see him across Havana Harbor, unable to reunite, Forrest says,
``must have been horrendous'' for her.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 months after the return of the St. Louis the Loebs lived
in Brussels. When the chance came for some to sail to America on
the Pennland, her grandparents and her aunt's parents said the
young people _ Forrest, her mother, brother, aunt, and cousin _
should go first. The older ones made plans to come a few weeks
later. Their boat never sailed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 the Loebs were reunited in Elmira, N.Y., where Leo Loeb
worked first as a chauffeur, then as a clerk in a silk factory.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dachau ``my father played the piano. He had a sense of
humor. He was just a nice guy. After the concentration camp he
became very quiet. My brother and I never asked questions about
what happened. It was almost an unwritten law that we didn't,''
Forrest says. ``The one thing that I didn't have for a long time _
and that I'm trying to acquire _ is a sense of humor. My parents
really, and my mother especially, took everything to heart. It
makes life very sad when you're growing up.''

</P>
<P>
   Sidney Blechner's brother Oskar, meanwhile, was in England,
waiting out the war, with a job manufacturing belts. Born in Poland
two years before his family moved to Germany, he carried a Polish
passport and avoided the fate of many St. Louis passengers sent to
Britain who were interned as German citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Blechner was not so fortunate. After he missed the
St. Louis, he tried desperately, but unsuccessfully, to leave
Germany. He made his way to Switzerland, only to be sent back to
Germany. His father was deported to Buchenwald, where he was
killed, and Blechner managed to flee to Berlin, where in October
1939 he was arrested and sent to his first concentration camp,
Sachenhausen. Initially, at least, he still had contact with the
outside world, and his mother harbored hope she could get him out
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The family recently discovered the wartime correspondence of
Blechner's mother, and it is filled with frantic efforts to help
her son. Her three other sons were in Switzerland, England, and the
United States. While she was still in the ritual mourning period
following her husband's death, Mina Blechner wrote her son Jakob in
Switzerland, asking him to go to the Chilean Consulate on Sidney's
behalf. ``It is urgent,'' she wrote. ``You should not waste a
minute.'' She signed the letter, ``Your distressed mother.''
Similar efforts to get Sidney Blechner into Portugal, India,
Shanghai, and Bolivia failed. Mina Blechner was deported in 1941 to
Kovno, Lithuania, where she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Sidney Blechner was sent to Auschwitz, and in early
1944, he was among 2,000 internees crowded onto open cattle cars
and transported to Dora-Mittelbau, a concentration camp in Germany.
``It was snowing,'' Blechner recalls. ``And we were all thirsty. We
got nothing to drink so we used the snow and urine.'' Fewer than
200 survived that trip. When he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen,
Blechner weighed 90 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am alive!'' he wrote in a postcard to his brother Jakob on
April 15, 1945. ``It is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Blechner has 14 grandchildren. Forrest has five, with
twins on the way. She asks if a visitor would like to know the
names of her children. Lisa. Susan. Robert. Steven. Richard.
Jonathan. Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the saga goes on,'' Forrest says. ``We were just
very lucky. People who had to go through the camps and were
liberated _ no matter how hard it might have been for us, it was
nothing compared to what these people went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most is inhumanity to man.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Forrest will be in Washington, at the Holocaust
Museum, appearing on a panel with two other former passengers.
``Basically I'm doing it in honor of my grandparents who never got
out of Brussels,'' she says. ``They were on the boat.''

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE TO STOP GUNS SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Police Department says it will
end a 4-year-old practice of selling obsolete service revolvers and
confiscated guns to firearms dealers and instead will destroy the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to stop selling them,'' police Chief Fred
Lau said Wednesday. ``There have been concerns from the community.
There is no need to do this any more ... I doubt we'll ever do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The police are worried that the guns sold by the department
could be re-sold, or stolen from registered owners, and wind up in
the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns us that we can't control where these guns would
ultimately end up. It could be very embarrassing to have one of
these used in a crime,'' police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said.
``We take every precaution now, but that's always a possibility
down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's decision comes as the city prepares to sue gun
manufacturers over safety issues. Marc Slavin, the spokesman for
City Attorney Louise Renne, praised the police department's change
in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if they are taking those guns out of commission,
that is a well-advised policy,'' Slavin said. ``I think that it is
all for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   It is anticipated that Renne will file the lawsuit in June, at
which time San Francisco would join a growing number of cities
taking gun manufacturers to court to recoup police and medical
costs caused by gun violence. Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Miami
and New Orleans have filed similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Police Department began selling or trading about
1,500 firearms to out-of-state gun dealers and used the proceeds to
upgrade officers' weapons from revolvers to semiautomatic handguns.
The majority of the weapons sold were six-shot, .357-caliber Smith
and Wesson police revolvers.
</P>
<P>
   The department also sold several hundred other weapons,
including a number of ``old shotguns and rifles that are considered
obsolete.'' Among them were World War II-era carbines that were
given to the department in the 1950s by the federal government,
Ackerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Also sold was ``a small fraction'' of the number of confiscated
guns the department had taken in, Ackerson said. He could not give
a specific number.

AS MIND WANDERS, BODY SUFFERS THE HUGE CHORES OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The work continues. Late spring brings little respite for the
gardener, although the occasional balmy day promises summer's
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly the weather bedevils, and we say, ``My, what a wet spring
we're having,'' or we mutter something much worse. Later, we'll
say, ``Gosh, what a dry summer. Will it never rain?'' Of course, we
say these things every year, because those are the weather patterns
of New England _ monsoon to desert to arctic.
</P>
<P>
   A recent trip to England illustrated how different is that
climate, the root cause of frustration for American gardeners
enamored of all those English gardening books. For, while we bend
to Yankee vagaries, they enjoy seemingly everything blooming at
once. Rhododendrons, azaleas, all the bulbs, the earliest of roses,
the host of annuals, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they have seasons, but they are blurred, as they should be.
On the other hand, a lot of their favorites are plants from the New
World, things imported by the Tradescants, both father and son, and
those shipped over by John Bartram in the 18th century. We can grow
heat-loving meadow plants, and they must stick to their own. There
are no English prairies.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener's mind wanders in procrastination. I have recovered
from the wounds received in ripping out an incredibly overgrown
Rosa multiflora. It was a good 6 feet tall, with a canopy spread of
5 feet. Its trunk was as thick as my leg, and I had to ease under
it, carefully, to cut it with my pruning saw. Then it leaned onto
the lawn, and its thorns latched onto lawn and edging and low maple
branches (not to mention me), and it refused to budge. I had to cut
it up as it lay, ripping out chunks and carting them off, with
concomitant loss of blood, until it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   With that devil exorcised, I have a lovely bare patch dominated
by a dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). This is a
recuperating plant, which had flagged badly in the center of the
lawn, where it baked too much and its leader (the primary shoot of
a tree) died. I moved it to a low spot on the east side of the
property a few years ago, and now it is shooting up, having
developed a new leader from one of its side branches.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, this deciduous conifer with reddish bark and pyramidal
habit may reach close to 100 feet high (OK, not in my yard it
won't, but it still will be big). It is between a red maple that
lost one of its biggest limbs a few years ago, and about which I
worry, and a crab apple that struggles along and elicits
disparaging comments from my neighbor (``You going to cut that
down?''). The dawn redwood is insurance against the demise of
either adjacent tree.
</P>
<P>
   I am fond of dawn redwoods, and you can see some fine examples
at Boston's Arnold Arboretum. The tree was thought to be extinct
until 1945, and an arboretum expedition fetched seeds from China in
1948, leading to the present collection.
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum is one of six public gardens in the Boston area on
the Garden Conservancy's tour list this year. There are 25 private
gardens as well, and these are worth the cost and procedure
necessary to see them.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy, dedicated to preserving notable American
gardens, is modeled after its English counterpart. A booklet
describing and giving directions to all the participating gardens
in the nation is sold for $12.95. The visitor then pays $4 at each
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Directories are available at Allandale Farm in Chestnut Hill,
Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, Garden in the Woods in
Framingham, Mahoney's Garden Center in Cambridge, Russell's Garden
Center in Wayland, Weston Nurseries in Hopkinton, and Winston
Flowers at 160 Southampton St. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 10 gardens in Brookline, Chestnut Hill and Weston
will be open. Next Sunday, 15 gardens in Hamilton, Manchester,
Beverly Farms, Marblehead, Salem and Swampscott will be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big range in the nature of the gardens, from teeny
little intimate ones to large estates,'' Mary Ann Streeter, the
conservancy's Boston area representative, told me. Being a frugal
swamp Yankee, I'll be seeing as many as I can to get my money's
worth. For this gardener, a brief respite at last.

FOR A CHURCH `STAYER,' THE ROUTINE IS THE ADVENTURE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``I don't want to go to church today,'' I said, sounding more
like a 9-year-old than an adult.
 &HT;    ``Whatever,'' my husband replied, ``you decide. I'm going.''
 &HT;    Less than an hour later, I went to church -- just as I have been
doing for most of my life. Another standard-issue Sunday. Coffee in
the parish hall.
 &HT;    Liturgy, sermon, Holy Communion. A church brunch thanking choir
members and Sunday school teachers. Another church year -- roughly
the same as a school year -- ends.
 &HT;    For 20 years, my standard Sundays have been in the Episcopal
Church. Before that, several years in no-brand-name evangelical
churches. During childhood, Sundays meant a weekly pilgrimage to
the Methodist church.
 &HT;    I am a churchgoer. Unlike so many of my baby-boomer peers who
only recently have returned to church, I never left. I never
dabbled in Eastern religion, rebelled against my parents, or
doubted the existence of God. Sociologists dubbed my generation
``seekers'' because of our disposition to explore spirituality,
reject institutional religion, and dismiss traditional
denominations.
 &HT;    Eventually, many of these seekers returned to mainline churches
-- thus earning themselves the title ``returnees.'' But I am oddly
out-of-step with this generational ethos. I am a stayer.
 &HT;    For as long as I can remember, the Christian story claimed both
my heart and mind. Growing up, I studied the Bible and theology,
attended prayer meetings and youth rallies, and went on mission
trips. I dreamed of being a preacher or missionary or seminary
professor. On most Sundays during the last 40 years, I have been to
church.
 &HT;    Stayers do not get much attention. Unlike the returnees who tell
tales of experimenting with alternative lifestyles and exotic
religions before coming back, us stayers have no such adventures.
Instead, stayer-spirituality grows in conversation with the Bible
and tradition, with hymnody and theology, with parish life and
church suppers, with fights over church organs and stained glass
windows. On the face of it, it seems a bit dull.
 &HT;    Over the last two decades, I have ``stayed'' within the
Episcopal Church. In those years, I lived in six different states
and been twice married. I changed parishes but never denominations.
Defying the statistic that Americans have no denominational
loyalty, I kept choosing the Episcopal brand.
 &HT;    In the process, I discovered something odd: the Episcopal Church
became my hometown. It grounded me. Within its walls, I found a
common worship experience, similar ways of practicing faith, shared
traditions, and a common language. There were connected
relationships, almost like circles of kin, woven through the
church. Without realizing it, Episcopal people became my people; a
family tied through faith.
 &HT;    I did not choose to be an Episcopalian because of family or
tradition. I choose it because I felt I had come home. For me,
Episcopal worship resonated with something so deep in my soul that
I have never been able to identify it. I only knew I had found what
I was looking for. It was like falling in love.
 &HT;    And thus, I stayed with that which I loved. In time, ardor
dimmed for more mundane concerns -- mostly those of living with
other Episcopalians. Like other towns, this one is full of oddball
and eccentric folk whose tragedies, conflicts, crises, joys and
triumphs give life to the community. These thousands of stories --
diverse as the characters themselves -- come together to share the
communion meal around the altar. Every Sunday. Week after week.
 &HT;    Stayers do the same thing every Sunday, say the same words, see
the same people. But in the places where our stories are known, and
in the place where we know the stories, our lives may be changed in
unexpected ways. The routine is the adventure.
 &HT;    In her small book, ``The Quotidian Mysteries,'' Kathleen Norris
writes, ``Our daily tasks, whether we perceive them as drudgery or
essential, life-supporting work ... have a considerable spiritual
import, and their significance for Christian theology, the way they
come together in the fabric of faith, is not often appreciated. But
it is in daily tasks, daily acts of love and worship that serve to
remind us that religion is not strictly an intellectual pursuit ...
faith is a way of life.''
 &HT;    Stayers often do these daily tasks of faith. Being there.
Chairing committees, changing diapers, cleaning the coffee cups.
 &HT;    ``It is a paradox of human life,'' continues Norris, ``that in
worship as in human love, it is in the routine and the everyday
that we find the possibilities for the greatest transformation.''
 &HT;    Sometimes, after 40 years, I don't want to go to church on
Sunday. It is so routine. But routine is the point. So I go. And I
hope to keep that routine for another 40.

NEW NATO NATION WEIGHS ITS DEDICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ It was not the most auspicious timing in history:
Just weeks after Hungary joined NATO, it became a member of an
alliance waging a nasty war, right under Hungary's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Hungary has never been known for its well-timed
choices. In World War I, Hungary sided with the Germans, and
forfeited substantial territory when it lost. In World War II,
Hungary sided with the Nazis, and in the postwar negotiations ended
up under the thumb of the Soviet Union for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to be on the winning, prosperous side for a change,
Hungary lobbied hard to get into NATO. And now, many Hungarians are
wondering just what they've gotten themselves into _ again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Throughout history, we have always joined the wrong organization at
the wrong time,'' lamented Agi Veres, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy Hungary has joined NATO, since it's the first step
to joining Western Europe in general,'' said Veres, a management
consultant. But the timing was off, she said. ``The war is too
close and it could turn into something messy,'' Veres said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's most prominent members are bickering over the extent and
direction of the military campaign against Yugoslavia. The British
are advocating ground troops; the Americans are reluctant to send
them, and both Germany and Italy have made noises about
interrupting the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO newcomer, Hungary has officially been extremely
cooperative. The government has agreed to allow the use of
Hungarian air space; it is accepting the arrival of 24 F-18 fighter
jets this weekend; and it is allowing the use of its southern base
in Taszar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really stepped up to the plate,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``They've done everything we've asked, and have welcomed
us with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cracks are starting to show in Hungary's commitment, as
they are in the rest of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Socialist opposition camp, which earlier agreed
to allow the use of Hungarian air space for NATO, have called for a
new vote on the resolution. A recent poll by Teledirect showed that
72 percent of Hungarians opposed air strikes from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hungarian voters want to be in NATO, they do not
always want to accept the responsibilities associated with it,
according to surveys by the respected Median polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the bombing, a solid 60 percent wanted to be in
NATO, studies from March and April show. But two-thirds say no NATO
troops should be sent from Hungary; just 10 percent think Hungarian
troops should go; and only 26 percent of people think Hungarian
soldiers in general should have to defend other NATO members, which
is a basic element of the NATO mutual-defense charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined NATO for security and peace. Then, right after we
joined, NATO got into a shooting war, and it stunned people. They
are thinking, `Is this what we bargained for?' '' said Laszlo
Kondor, a 58-year-old photographer who fought for the United States
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's demands ``are a good wakeup call for Hungary,'' Kondor
said. ``People here need to understand there is no free lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is also feeling an economic pinch. Nearly 8,000
Yugoslavs, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs, have come to Hungary
requesting asylum. Another 35,000-40,000 are staying with friends
and family here, waiting out the war, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gabor Horvath.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's once-blossoming tourist industry is likely to take a
substantial hit, dropping from $1.3 billion in 1998 to an estimated
$1 billion this year because of travelers' worries about touring
just north of the war zone, according to a study released Wednesday
by GKI Economic Research said.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians are also nervous that they, or the 400,000 ethnic
Hungarians living in nearby Vojvodina, will become targets of
retribution if troops or fighter planes are sent from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Vojvodina, a nothern province of Serbia, is best protected by a
speedy NATO victory, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
told reporters after meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's scare-mongering to say Vojvodina would be
next in the drive for ethnic purity,'' Robertson said, and Hungary
must do its part in the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the European Union are ``attractive to join and bring
benefits,'' he said. ``But they also bring heavy responsibilities,
too.''

 &HT;    LYNCH CAUTIONS AGAINST WILLY-NILLY INVESTING
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peter S. Lynch had some advice Thursday for
investors caught up in the Internet stock frenzy: Don't ignore the
fundamentals of good investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' he said at the mutual fund industry's annual
meeting in Washington, that people buy stocks based only on a
belief that ``this sucker is going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Know what you buy, invest for the long term, and refrain from
trying to predict what the stock market will do, he said in
addressing the Investment Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who made his reputation managing Fidelity's Magellan
fund, said those principles worked 20 years ago, work today, and
will work ``20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to invest in a company with no revenue, no earnings,
but a $10 billion market value, an investor needs to have a reason
to expect profits down the road, Lynch added. ``You have to be
convinced they have a reasonable chance, 10 years from now, to make
$500 million to $1 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, now vice chairman of FMR, the parent of the Fidelity,
called the Internet sector ``a very irrationally priced market.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Fidelity doesn't like Internet stocks. It
just has resisted the idea of introducing an Internet-only fund,
citing the speculative nature of those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started that fund, I could get $3 billion in the first
month,'' FMR President Robert C. Pozen said earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fidelity has chosen to include Internet stocks within
some of its existing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a better approach,'' Pozen said.

ARRESTED 30 YEARS AGO, CANADIAN FINALLY FINDS JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For David Milgaard, hell at the hands of the Canadian
judicial system started in 1969 in his hometown of Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, when a pretty young nursing aide was raped and
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the assault suggested that Gail Miller, 20, was
the victim of a serial rapist who had attacked other women at
knifepoint, and police had an obvious suspect in a local man with a
long history of vicious sexual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for reasons that today appear almost sinister,
investigators focused on Milgaard, a 16-year-old possessed of a
wild streak _ but whose only prior brush with the law involved a
joyride in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Their case against Milgaard was circumstantial _ he had been
placed in the same neighborhood. But it was the only case they
seriously pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard was charged, convicted and sentenced to prison. And
that's where his real nightmare began. He was sodomized by
cellmates, and abused by guards. He attempted suicide and made two
desperate escape attempts in his 23 years behind bars. On the
second of these, he was shot by Toronto police.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Milgaard was innocent of the crime. Not ``not
guilty'' by reason of some legal technicality. Truly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Milgaard's 30-year ordeal came to a close when he was
awarded $7 million by the Canadian and Saskatchewan governments. It
was the largest payout for wrongful conviction in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three terrible decades, it finally feels like it's
over,'' said his mother, Joyce Milgaard, who led the long battle
for exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard, now 46, skipped the press conferences and apologies
from government officials to go camping in British Columbia with
his wife, Marnie. ``You can't really appreciate the horrors he's
survived,'' said lawyer Hersh Wolch, part of the volunteer legal
team that challenged the system on Milgaard's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard suffers from depression so severe he was recently
committed temporarily for treatment at a psychiatric hospital, and
rarely comments on the injustices that threw a boy into prison and
regurgitated him as a middle-aged man.
</P>
<P>
   ``No words can describe it,'' he told reporters two years ago
when a DNA test proved he was not Miller's assailant. ``I always
knew I was innocent. The hardest thing has been the waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The question shouldn't be: `How do I feel about
this?' The question should be, `How did this happen?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an unprecedented federal and provincial deal with
Milgaard's family, Saskatchewan pledged to mount a public inquiry
into a case that has drawn international attention and tarnished
the image of Canadian justice.
</P>
<P>
   But observers give Canadian officials credit for finally making
an unequivocal apology to Milgaard and agreeing to the
extraordinary payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Canadians still have the ability to blush,'' said
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the American former prizefighter whose
unjust conviction for a triple homicide in New Jersey was
immortalized in a Bob Dylan ballad and is the subject of an
upcoming film starring Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes like David Milgaard at least stir some sense of shame
among Canadians,'' said Carter, executive director for the
Toronto-based Association for the Wrongfully Convicted, who has
received neither apologies nor restitution for his own 20 years
behind bars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The public inquiry into Milgaard's case is almost certain to
cause major embarrassment to Saskatoon police, whose behavior
appears to have gone beyond bungling and misjudgement to the realm
of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial files on suspects have vanished and evidence pointing
away from Milgaard was ignored. Incredibly, the police seeme to
have similarly shrugged off tips about the murder weapon and a
string of knife attacks against women that could not have been
perpetrated by Milgaard.
</P>
<P>
   The original suspect in the rape-murder, Larry Fisher, now 49, a
lifelong sexual criminal with seven rape convictions, has been
charged in Miller's death. He is scheduled to go on trial in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing aide died from as the result of 12 stab wounds on
Jan. 31, 1969. The savage attack fit the pattern of Fisher's knife
assaults against women in Saskatchewan. Moreover, Fisher's own wife
refuted his alibi and told police that the paring knife probably
used in the attack was missiong from her kitchen on the day of the
killing. Police never followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors insisted on trying Milgaard for the case.
After the teenager's conviction, Saskatoon police files on Fisher
mysteriously vanished, and the prosecution's star witness was
killed in an odd hunting mishap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned Milgaard's
conviction because of procedural errors, but urged Saskatchewan to
order a new trial. The province refused, but police and
prosecutors, in bizarre public statements, insisted that Milgaard
was guilty, and that even if he had been wrongfully convicted it
was just tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   That sance was abandoned only when DNA tests showed that semen
found on Miller could not possibly have come from Milgaard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wrong of the most serious kind was committed,'' said
Saskatchewan Justice Minister John Nilson. ``How did a 16-year-old
end up serving 23 years for a crime he did not commit?''

IN WELD'S REAL-LIFE SEQUEL, WASHINGTON IS PART OF THE PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a novelist, he has sent his fictional alter ego to
Washington. Now Bill Weld admits he still has an interest in making
the journey himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not as a senator or even as a cabinet secretary _ two jobs he
once lusted after but now dismisses with a wave of the hand. Weld
would only shoot for president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come up for air in 2003 and have a look,'' Weld
said while he munched on Chinese food during a lunch interview that
ranged from the future of the GOP to the depredations a red-tailed
hawk has visited upon the Weld family menagerie.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Weld is putting the final touches on his second
novel, which will be published this fall, and mulling the plot for
a third book. He's squeezing in the literary work as he carries out
a white-shoe law practice that is steadily expanding his already
considerable wealth and that promises to give him a hefty personal
bank account to jump-start his political career.
</P>
<P>
   As for his national ambitions, the former Massachusetts governor
would be a long shot, and he knows it. A Republican victory in 2000
would bring the portcullis crashing down on any hopes for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a Democrat wins next year, the socially liberal Weld
realizes he would have a difficult time overcoming opposition from
hard-core GOP conservatives, the more so since his 1997 showdown
with Jesse Helms, the archconservative North Carolina Republican
and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Weld's
failed bid for for an ambassadorship boosted his national profile
but reinforced his status as anathema to the Republican right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most likely result is I'll come up for air, see my
shadow, and plow forward in the business world,'' mused the
governor, in one of a series of mixed and whimsical metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether another defeat would force the GOP to move
centerward enough to make his politics palatable, Weld sloughed off
the questions. That line of inquiry, he said, puts the focus on a
possible future candidacy and not where it belongs: on his hiatus
from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a five-year vow of chastity,'' he said. ``And it's
likely the vow will not be only five years. The most likely thing
is that the vow will be sempiternal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's obviously thinking change. Weld is backing Texas
Governor George W. Bush for president next year, partly because he
considers Bush's politics a refreshing change from the party's
standard conservative fare.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, where he spends several nights a week on
business, Weld is a strong supporter of Mayor Rudy Guiliani for US
Senator, even if his foe turns out to be Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Weld's friend since their service together on the House Judiciary
Committee staff during Watergate. He and Guiliani, both former
federal prosecutors, go back nearly two decades. But Weld also
thinks Guiliani's election would help strengthen the GOP's moderate
wing nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, having Rudy Guiliani and Christy
Whitman to join Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and Arlen Specter
is helpful from within the Republican Party,'' Weld said.
</P>
<P>
   But when decision time comes, Weld doubts the first lady will
run. ``I am not sure she will see the upside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Weld says he wouldn't take a cabinet job if the
Republicans win in 2000, he thinks his successor, Paul Cellucci,
stands a good chance of landing a top spot if Bush makes it to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not be interested, but I think the Bushes, both
father and son, think highly of him,'' said Weld, who seemed coy
even as he denied having discussed the possibility with his former
Number Two.
</P>
<P>
   Weld may have ruled out ever again seeking a Senate seat, but
Terrence Mullally, the prosecutor-cum-pol he created last year as
the lead character in ``Mackerel by Moonlight,'' his first novel,
commences a career in the Senate in the sequel, ``Big Ugly,'' due
out in October.
</P>
<P>
   There, Weld says, Mullally finds himself over his head, under
fire, and in danger of being revealed as the murderer he became at
the end of the first novel. Last year's title came from an 18th
century insult that John Randolph of Virginia once hurled at a foe:
``Your record, sir, resembles a rotting mackerel by moonlight: it
shines and it stinks.''The sequel is named for a town Weld has
invented in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   There's never been any doubt that Mullally is Weld in disguise.
And indeed, in speaking about his protagonist, the former governor
sometimes lapses into the first person.
</P>
<P>
   Weld makes no boasts about the book's literary merit. Asked if
his second book is better than his first, which received mixed
reviews, he is forthright: ``No, it's worse.'' But, he says, he's
studied best sellers and hopes that shortening the chapters will
make this a page turner.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, a man who as governor prided himself on never
holding a grudge hints that the book contains a little payback for
Helms, whose opposition blocked his confirmation as ambassador to
Mexico in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find when you read the second book that to the
extent that I had any road rage left over from the fall of 1997, it
was reserved for Big Ugly,'' he concluded.

GETTING STAINS OFF MARBLE IS A CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Someone left a bucket on my dark-green marble bathroom floor,
leaving a ring on the marble. How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   BILL HOYSGAARD, Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Marble will stain if you look at it _ it is that absorbent,
and a pain to maintain. Try wetting the spots, applying a little
Soft Scrub, and rubbing a bit. There is enough abrasive in the Soft
Scrub, it is hoped, to abrade the stain without affecting the
marble. If it removes the stain but leaves the spot dull, apply a
little marble polish to that one tile.
</P>
<P>
   An even milder abrasive is rottenstone, sold in hardware stores.
This is how to use it: Apply water to the stain, sprinkle just a
bit of the rottenstone on the wet spot, and rub with your hands.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My prefinished, oak strip flooring was installed last June,
and so far there are no gaps between the strips. Is June a good
time to install strips to prevent development of gaps? Also, I have
another prefinished floor. Can I sand it?
</P>
<P>
   D.P., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it's OK to install strip flooring in June but just
barely; definitely not July and August, and maybe September, when
the boards are at their wettest and largest.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to install oak strip flooring (or any other strip
wood) is in winter (October to April and May), when they are at
their driest (the heat is on, helping to dry them out). Then, when
they gain moisture and expand, then contract again, no new gaps
will show.
</P>
<P>
   You can sand and refinish prefinished oak boards, as long as
they are 3/4-inch thick and not laminated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Armstrong Never-Wax kitchen floor is 20 years old and
getting dull. How can I refinish it or treat it so it will be a bit
shinier? My daughter has a No-Wax floor. Can the same thing be done
for it?
</P>
<P>
   L.M., Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Before doing anything further, call Armstrong to determine
the right treatment. Armstrong and other flooring companies used to
have special treatments for Never-Wax and No-Wax flooring. I would
think they still do.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, use Future on the floor. It will darken it a bit
but also give it a shine. Repeat in a year. The same treatment can
be used on a No-Wax floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About those gray marks on nailheads in plasterboard walls that
show up even when covered with joint compound.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman suggested that this was due to water vapor in the
house condensing on the nailheads, which are cooler than the
surrounding plasterboard. The condensing water vapor makes these
spots damp (you might not even see the dampness), and dirt tends to
collect on the damp spots. Those spots also might be mold (mildew).
To clean the dirt, wash with Spic and Span and water, although spot
washing is iffy. If the spots are mold, wash with a solution of
bleach and water.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tom Ruden of Newton Highlands, Mass. has another idea:
that the spots are caused by Earth's magnetic field. Minute
particles of iron (or steel) collect on the slightly magnetized
nailheads (even through the plasterboard), showing up as gray
marks, said Ruden in a recent call.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Tom. The handyman assumes that these particles can
be brushed off, especially before they show rust (if the spots are
damp).
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the metal particles is to use aluminum, brass,
or other nonmagnetic metal screws or nails to put up the
plasterboard. There is no practical cure for the gray spots if they
are caused by dirt or mold. Simply keep after them by washing
and/or bleaching.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The nailheads on my clapboard siding are beginning to rust.
How can I prevent that rusting? How can I cover the heads?
</P>
<P>
   MARY MURRAY, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, the rusting nailheads on clapboards. It's a perennial
problem on some houses where galvanized nails or bright
(ungalvanized) nails were used. High-quality galvanized nails (hot
zinc dipped, not electroplated) will resist rust for many years,
but eventually will rust.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have galvanized nails that have given up the ghost.
It is not practical to cover them, you cannot countersink them and
fill the holes with putty because the clapboards are too thin, and
painting them with a rust resistant paint is also unsatisfactory _
it won't work for long, and you would have to repaint or restain
the house.
</P>
<P>
   The only real solution is to pull the nails and replace them
with stainless steel ones. To pull the old nails, pry up the
clapboard a bit, then tap back, revealing the head so it can be
pulled. If the head does not reveal, pry up the clapboard again and
hold the shank of the nail with pliers before tapping back.
</P>
<P>
   You can put the stainless steel nails in the same hole, or drive
them an inch or so to one side of the hole. You can fill the holes
with exterior wood filler or leave them alone; left alone, they
will soon virtually disappear when the clapboards gain moisture and
swell up a little.
</P>
<P>

BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR FAMISHED KOSOVARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The food chain, spanning continents and
cultures, doesn't quite end with the seven loaves of bread in Adem
Kruiziu's arms.
</P>
<P>
   As he does once a day every day, the construction worker and
Kosovar refugee still has to dole them out to the 15 relatives who
accompanied him to Kukes six weeks ago. It's his job to make sure
that none of the children and adults who make up the displaced
Kruiziu clan go hungry, and it's his job to pick up the loaves from
the back of a relief agency's truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread is everything,'' said Kruiziu, a 34-year-old father
of five. ``I ate it for breakfast and I will eat it with dinner. We
eat it with beans, with canned meat, with every meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kruiziu, hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees now
living in Albania consider bread both sustenance and soccer
equipment. The free loaves, thousands baked locally in Kukes,
thousands more trucked up from the south, are so plentiful that
some youngsters use them to practice kicking goals. Others rot in
piles in a neighborhood park. Pilfered sacks of wheat also
sometimes turn up for sale at local markets.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the fat, golden loaves appear to be used as
intended: as a cheap, easily deliverable staple in a country
overwhelmed overnight by the number of newcomers it must feed. Each
one is expected to sustain two to four people a day, depending on
their other rations, and some refugees joke that they plan to cut
bread from their diet as soon as they return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good they give us bread,'' Zade Cholku said through a
translator as she waited in line for the six loaves that her family
of 10 consumes daily. ``They give us a lot of bread. In the two
months we are here, we eat more bread than in all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The loaves that Choklu and another 30 or so refugees were
waiting to collect outside one of the tractor camps that have
sprung up around Kukes started as surplus US wheat, although Japan,
Turkey and the European Union have donated tons and tons of it,
too. Arriving mostly by ship, the wheat flour's international
flavor expands anew once inside Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden, for instance, has donated a fleet of 20-plus trucks,
drivers and crews to load the flour at the dock in Durres and
unload it at one of the warehouses maintained by the World Food
Programme, the United Nations agency that is overseeing the entire
operation. NATO, the US Army and Albanian truck drivers have also
helped transport enough to provide Kosovar refugees in Kukes alone
with 35,000 loaves of bread a day.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 cents a loaf, paid by the food program with UN funds, the
employees at a half-dozen Kukes bakeries work from before dawn on
to provide their share of the bread. On a recent morning, a human
chain formed outside the bakery where Osman Qoqaj pulls 4,000 black
bread pans a day from six ovens, one batch after another after
another. The men, many of them volunteers, were passing two loaves
at a time from shelf to man to truck in the most efficient way,
perhaps the only way, to move that much bread several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Himself a Kosovar refugee and third-generation baker Prizren,
Qoqaj said he lines up like everyone else for his own extended
family's share of bread. Thirty-three relatives are currently
sharing a one-room apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit sick of bread myself, but I'm glad for the work,''
said Qoqaj, a 29-year-old father of one who landed the job a month
ago, almost as soon as he arrived. ``And it's good to be helping in
the best way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, Kukes bakeries provide 7,000 loaves a day, with
another 25,000 arriving from Albania's largest bakery in Elbasan. A
mobile bakery in Shkodra, as well as four bakeries there, bring
total production to about 50,000 loaves a day _ a number that will
double when a new mobile bakery goes into operation and additional
bakers are hired to provide bread to the new and fast-growing
refugee camps in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   From the bakers, non-governmental relief agencies take over
delivery, a system that appears to work better in the camps near
cities than in outlying villages where both Kosovar refugees and
Albanians displaced by Serb shelling along the Yugoslavia-Albania
border are living with host families. Although those refugees do
not yet receive fresh bread, they complain that supplies of wheat
and other basics such as sugar, beans and cooking oil are not
reaching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no food, no flour, nothing,'' said Hamdi Gajraku, 50,
a construction worker forced to relocate along with 25 relatives
and about 250 other Albanians from their border village to a safer
spot in the hills above Kukes. ``The international community has
done nothing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As they do in Kukes, Gajraku and about two dozen other
``delegates'' stood waiting for the trucks to arrive. But Reiseal
NiChilleachair, a representative with a distribution agency called
CONCERN, fretted that she could not verify who was a refugee and
who wasn't, and that the food would not reach the right 259 people.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kukes, attempts are also made to ascertain who is
entitled to the free bread. An employee with Catholic Relief
Charities, which distributes the loaves locally along with the
Adventist Development and Relief Agency, read out names from a list
at each stop. But scores of children had already grabbed as many
loaves as they could carry in their arms and every so often an
impatient adult reached into the pile and popped a half-dozen
loaves into a sack, purse or plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a beneficiaries list, where we've identified group
leaders or the heads of refugee families who can pick up the
bread,'' said Kim Wahlberg, a project coordinator with Catholic
Relief who helps distribute 5,000 loaves a day from the back of the
agency's two white trucks. ``It doesn't always go exactly as
planned, but we know we're getting the bread to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Luke Stephens, a project coordinator wth MedAir, a Swiss
non-profit agency that manages a transit center and has so far
served 70,000 meals of hot soup, ``As far as I can tell, there
aren't any cracks to fall through. You don't see anyone going
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Around lunch-time earlier this week, Driton Sahatgiu, a Kosovar
who works one of the Catholic relief trucks for what he described
as decent pay, climbed down, helped spread a cloth on the ground
and began unloading the bread he had loaded only hours ago. On a
typical day, he said, his group makes three bread runs _ morning,
noon and night _ and hands out at least 1,700 loaves at 22 sites
around Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   For Sahatgiu, bread has become both a way to make a living and a
way to keep his mind off his refugee status. Surrounded by the rich
aroma of fresh-baked loaves, a smell that he said reminded him of
home, he bemoaned the dirty, dilapidated hotel where his family now
lives. In Kosovo, they owned two houses, and he stayed behind alone
to protect one until three weeks ago. His wife, mother and other
relatives had been sent ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing is good, the money is OK ...,'' Sahatgiu said
in English mid-way through the bread run. ``But someone just told
me that my cousin who is in the (Kosovo Liberation Army) is dead. I
don't want to believe it. I have to find out if he is alive. I'm
going to try to figure out how to do that between deliveries.''

WORLD CHAMPIONS SEEM TO BE WILTING BEFORE OUR EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It doesn't get any better than this for beleaguered
Bostonians. Long-suffering legions of Red Sox Nation will tell you
there is nothing sweeter than beating the Yankees; especially a
defending world champion Yankee team; especially with George
Steinbrenner fuming in the expensive seats.
</P>
<P>
   Think these Yankees can win the American League wild-card
playoff spot?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, no photos of mighty, mighty Boss George snarling from the
lower boxes this morning. Steinbrenner was safely encased behind
the soundproof glass of the 600 Club Wednesday night when his team
fell behind the Red Sox for the second straight evening. George
left early, before a 73-minute rain delay stretched the game toward
the midnight hour.
</P>
<P>
   The final was Boston 6, New York 0, pushing the Sox to a 1
1/2-game lead over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah, they're frustrated,'' manager Joe Torre said of
his troops. ``I don't see despair, but they're fighting themselves.
We were a little spoiled last year. We didn't have any
malfunctions. But somebody's gonna take a beating out there one of
these days. Tonight it was us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Yankees Suck'' chants rained down from the Fenway
Park grandstand at precisely 9 p.m. _ an hour before the
ninth-inning rain delay effectively emptied the yard.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic lore these upstart Red Sox are the gypsies, tramps,
and thieves of the big leagues. Their real names are Varitek,
Offerman, and Rose and Wednesday night they again conquered the
Bronx Bomb Shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Duquette's Revenge.'' Call it ``No Fear Strikes Out.''
Maybe the Rocket's red glare somehow brings bad karma to a
successful clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Probably this is only a temporary condition but right now Jason
Varitek is better than Bill Dickey or Thurman Munson, and the
greatest team of the century (one year later) is sagging under the
weight of its own destiny. The Yankees have lost seven of eight,
and eight of 11.
</P>
<P>
   What else is there to say? Bring back Don Zimmer?
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks have the man they love back in the dugout, but not
even the estimable Torre could have expected things to be going
this badly upon his return to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, a.k.a. the ``fat toad'' and ``the fat plum,'' was
the victim of Boston's latest assault. In Georgespeak, Irabu ``spit
the bit,'' surrendering nine hits and five runs in 3 2/3 innings.
In eight innings, Yankee pitchers surrendered 15 hits to the
oft-ridiculed Red Sox. Today's New York starter is Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez, who has a whopping ERA of 6.56. Do they really
expect help from Tony Fossas and Jay Tessmer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in myself,'' Irabu said through his Holy
Cross-trained interpreter, George Rose. ``I expect to do well. I
know that's what people expect of me.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, there is no comparison between the Red Sox and
Yankees. So why have the Sox been able to pummel the pine tar out
of the New Yorkers for two straight days? And why is it that Brian
Rose, he of nine big league appearances and one victory, was able
to shut out the Yankees for seven frustrating innings? In their two
games here this week, the Yankees have scored three runs and left
24 men on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly going through a bad stretch,'' admitted center
fielder Bernie Williams. ``We can't get any offense going. It's
very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers are reeling. Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch
(he's no Jose Offerman) just snapped out of an 0-for-22 funk, but
continues to struggle at the plate and threw a ball into left field
Tuesday night. Like many of the normally patient Yankee hitters,
Knoblauch has suddenly decided to make things easy on pitchers by
swinging early in the count.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much the same up and down the lineup. None of the
Yankee catchers are hitting and that would include Mike Figga, this
year's candidate for the Roger LaFrancois memorial trophy. Figga
has yet to bat this season, though Wednesday night seemed like a
perfect opportunity to give him a shot. Meanwhile, the
ever-combustible Paul O'Neill is in a funk and remains a threat to
destroy all helmets, bat racks, and urinals in his path.
</P>
<P>
   This is all great news for the suddenly surging Red Sox. Boston
fans can only hope the Yankees are still ice cold when the Sons of
Jimy Williams invade the Bronx early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The hallowed halls of Boston's numerous colleges and universites
must be fun this week. Traditionally, Boston-New York athletic
jousts are cause for commotion in the corridors of higher learning
and New Englanders no doubt are having some fun with their New York
classmates during this strange spring of bizarro baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned,'' admitted Torre. ``But not to the
point of thinking you can't do something. It's just a matter of
time when it'll turn around. It's just a matter of keeping your
composure.''
</P>
<P>
   They play one more Thursday night at the Fens. El Duque vs. Mark
Portugal. The Sox are guaranteed to be in first when it's over,
maybe by 2 1/2 games.
</P>

IDEA TO SHIP NUCLEAR WASTE OVERSEAS IRKS ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated at the glacial pace of federal efforts to open a
nuclear waste disposal site, the owners of three closed New England
nuclear plants quietly discussed shipping their high-level
radioactive waste to Britain, raising alarms among British
anti-nuclear groups when the talks were disclosed this week.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Yankee Rowe nuclear plant in Massachusetts as well
as two other reactors say the talks last year with British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd. went nowhere. Under the plan, they would have shipped
thousands of lethally hot used fuel rods to Sellafield, England,
for storage or reprocessing into new fuel rather than waiting for a
federal waste site to open in 2010 at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have been trying to do is turn over every stone so we
don't miss an opportunity and we can finish the job,'' said Kelley
Smith, spokeswoman for Yankee Rowe and Connecticut Yankee nuclear
plants, neither of which can completely shut down until their used
fuel rods are removed from the sites.
</P>
<P>
   However, disclosure of the waste talks sparked angry accusations
on both sides of the Atlantic over one of the world's true
political hot potatoes. Activists were particularly distressed that
the British firm insisted on secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, which
released documents outlining the talks, said that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair ``must act now to stop British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd. from turning Britain into a nuclear waste dump for other
countries. The BNFL senior management who set up the deal should
resign at once, or be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, activist Ray Shadis accused Maine Yankee
nuclear plant officials of withholding information and undermining
efforts to close down the plant safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company is trying to earn the
public trust, they have a damnably poor way of going about it,''
said Shadis, who had not heard of the talks even though he is a
member of the community advisory panel assisting Maine Yankee in
shutdown procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the closed nuclear plants said they can't
understand the fuss. After decades of failed federal efforts to
build a waste repository, they say they have considered a wide
array of ideas _ such as shipping the waste to Apache land in New
Mexico _ most of which fizzle out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't possibly be held to a standard of communicating every
idea,'' said Mary Ann Lynch, vice president for law and government
affairs at Maine Yankee. ``For every 10 ideas that we have on
decommissioning, nine of them end up in the great heap of''
failures.
</P>
<P>
   High-level radioactive waste, which remains dangerous for
millennia, has long been the Achilles' heel of nuclear power. Under
federal law, the US Department of Energy is responsible for finding
a permanent repository, but possible sites _ from the Kansas salt
domes to the wilds of eastern Maine _ have flopped in the face of
intense opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the agency has been trying to develop a
waste site at the Nevada Missile Test Site, but environmental
reviews and political battles have pushed the opening date back to
2010, and many observers say 2015 is more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the long-simmering issue is coming to a head in New
England, where four of the nine nuclear reactors are closing down.
Officials at Yankee Rowe, which closed in 1991, want to begin
tearing down the buildings, which would put them on a course to
complete decommissioning within a few years _ except for the 533
fuel rods still in the waste pool.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities that own the reactors already have sued the
Department of Energy for the cost of storing the waste, and found a
federal claims court that agrees the department should pay. Maine
Yankee alone wants $130 million, including $60 million to build
concrete and steel casks to hold the waste until the Yucca Mountain
facility opens.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Smith said officials from Connecticut
Yankee and Yankee Rowe approached British Nuclear Fuels more than a
year ago about the possibility of shipping their waste to the
Sellafield reprocessing facility. Separately, Maine Yankee
officials made a similar inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said officials at the plants advanced the idea of
exporting the waste to Britain as part of an invitation from the
Department of Energy to offer new ideas for solving the problem.
Ultimately, she said, the federal agency shot down the idea before
formal negotiations could begin.
</P>
<P>
   At Maine Yankee, the British firm went so far as to draft a
paper titled ``Transport of Spent Nuclear Fuel from Maine Yankee
Power Plant: Conceptual Arrangements,'' which laid out a plan for
hauling up to 1,432 used fuel rods from Maine to England, according
to documents from Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lynch of Maine Yankee said the plant never received a
formal proposal from British Nuclear Fuels. ``It never got beyond
the most preliminary stages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials say they were not part of the waste
export talks, but said they warned US utilities that any nuclear
waste exports would have to satisfy federal concerns about nuclear
weapons proliferation. The reprocessing plant at Sellafield
generates plutonium from nuclear waste, a key ingredient in atomic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But activists say British Nuclear Fuel hoped to get around the
proliferation issue by portraying the deal to the US government as
a storage plan. In Britain, where long-term storage of foreign
nuclear waste is illegal, they would have emphasized the
reprocessing of the waste, activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate out how much of this is real and how
much of this is the desperate acts of desperate people,'' said
Jonathan Block, attorney for the New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution, which is challenging Yankee Rowe's cleanup plans. ``Once
again, we are confronted with what a stupid way nuclear power is to
boil water for your coffee.''

 Birth control injection awaits federal approval
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For women who have a hard time remembering to take their birth
control pills every day, another choice may be on the way as early
as the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A once-a-month shot was found 100 percent effective in its first
US clinical trial of almost 800 women. The injectable drug, called
Lunelle, contains estrogen and progestin, the same hormones used in
most birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   The birth control shot is currently under review by the Food and
Drug Administration. It is developed by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, which
also makes Depo-Provera, a quarterly injectable contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The study, at 42 sites in the United States for 60 weeks,
compared 782 women ages 18-49 using the monthly shot and 321 women
using Ortho-Novum, a birth control pill. Researchers found that the
most common adverse effects were similar to oral contraceptives,
and women on Lunelle had one less day of regular menstrual bleeding
than those on the pills. After skipping a shot, women returned to
fertility in a month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the study investigators, Dr. Andrew Kaunitz of the
University of Florida in Jacksonville, said the monthly shot is
easily administered in the hip, thigh or shoulder muscles. Kaunitz
said he was not aware of any allergic reactions. During the study,
which will be extended for a year, there were two unplanned
pregnancies in the oral contraceptive group and none in the Lunelle
group. Many of the women who took part in the first phase of the
study plan to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has already gone through extensive testing outside the
United States. About 17,000 women have participated in the World
Health Organization's clinical trials of the product, which has
also been called Cyclo-Provera and Cyclofem.
</P>
<P>
   Depo-Provera, the injectable contraceptive currently on the
market, is administered four times a year. However, women do not
have regular menstrual cycles, experience unpredictable spotting or
absence of bleeding, and do not return to fertility until nine
months after stopping the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn said that the cost of the monthly shot would
be comparable to a monthly supply of pills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Chinese herb mix shows hope on prostate cancer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A blend of eight Chinese herbs has shown promise as a treatment
for advanced prostate cancer, even with men who have failed
conventional hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The herbal concoction, called PC-SPES (``PC'' stands for
prostate cancer and ``SPES'' is Latin for hope), is sold in health
food stores as a dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers at the University of California in San
Francisco are not sure what active ingredients in the mixture are
beneficial, they believe the compound holds estrogenic and active
anti-cancer qualities.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 61 men received nine capsules of the herbal
mixture daily. Twenty-seven men had not received hormonal therapy,
which is used to reduce a man's supply of testosterone to a
prostate tumor, and 34 were hormone-resistant patients, whose
tumors no longer responded to hormonal therapies.
</P>
<P>
   All the men who never received hormones responded to the herbs
with lower levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a blood
marker used to track the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised USCF associate professor Eric Small was that
almost 60 percent of the hormone-resistant patients also
experienced at least a 50 percent decline in their PSA levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patients have been taking the herbs, which cost
about $450 for a month's supply, for about eight months. To find
out more about the duration of the mixture's effectiveness on
patients, the study will go on for at least another year or two,
Small said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Screening process seen for form of anal cancer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also at USCF, researchers said a simple, early screening
procedure for anal squamous cell cancer could lead to a drop in
disease and death among gay men similar to what the Pap smear test
has done for cervical cancer in women. Anal sex puts people at risk
for this uncommon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study in this week's issue of JAMA, 35
HIV-negative gay men per 100,000 develop this form of anal cancer
each year (the rate is even higher among HIV-positive gay men),
which compares to about 40 women per 100,000 who contracted
cervical cancer each year before the Pap smear was widely used.
Now, about eight women per 100,000 get cervical cancer. The
procedure would involve inserting a swab into the anal canal.

FILMMAKER SKIRTS HOLLYWOOD APPROACH BY MARKETING ON-LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you're getting pretty efficient about dismissing
breathless announcements of Internet ``firsts'' _ such as the first
on-line radio station for boomers with bad musical taste or the
first Web site to market mediocre paintings on line _ along comes a
genuine breakthrough that could shake up The System in Hollywood.
Imagine: no more power lunches. No more groveling to get a foot in
the door at the major studios. No more jockeying for quality time
with the head honchos.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Mark Tapio Kines, the first aspiring filmmaker to announce,
fund, cast, and market his screenplay on the Internet. His first
feature film, ``Foreign Correspondents,'' was completed in
February; it stars Melanie Lynskey (``Heavenly Creatures'') and Wil
Wheaton (``Stand by Me''). Kines, 29, raised a sizable chunk of the
film's $500,000 budget from complete strangers who visited his Web
site (www.forcor.com); he located some of the props by posting
notices on line; and he courted cast members with e-mail. Now, the
young director is peddling the film at indie film festivals, where
he hopes to attract a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   If his feature, which intertwines two bizarre love stories,
achieves even modest success, it could inspire other scribes to
trade in their film degrees for certificates in Web design. And it
could prompt the Hollywood studios to find more innovative uses of
the Internet than glitzy fan clubs and mandatory marketing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kines earns his daily keep by designing such Web sites. After
graduating from the California Institute of the Arts in 1992, he
launched a career designing entertainment sites; his credits
include ``MADtv,'' ``12 Monkeys,'' and the ill-fated
``Waterworld.'' So when he finally got around to writing his own
screenplay back in 1996, he designed a Web site to announce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know how to juggle, you use your juggling to promote
your film,'' says Kines, now art director for Paramount Digital
Entertainment. ``I know how to make Web sites, so it seemed like
the most natural and cheapest way to market my film.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he figured he could make the film himself, using his
personal savings of about $40,000. But while surfing the Net one
day, he discovered a Lynskey fan site, which noted that the actress
was eager to work in American independent films. Using that nugget,
Kines contacted her agent and, in a few months, the actress agreed
to make the film. Producer Julia Stemock signed on soon after, and
Wheaton and other actors joined the cast. Lynskey's letter of
intent is posted on the site, along with storyboards and other
behind-the-scenes details.
</P>
<P>
   After the cast was signed, Kines posted a ``quiet little plea''
for potential investors on his Web site. He expected a few
donations of $10, maybe even $100. Instead, several people kicked
in six-figure sums. One Canadian family that admired Wheaton's work
in ``Stand by Me'' sent $10,000. A computer consultant in San Jose
agreed to donate $5,000 a month until the film was completed; he
eventually anted up $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, isn't it?'' asks Richard Klein, the computer
consultant, who discovered the ``Foreign Correspondents'' site
while randomly surfing. ``I don't know a damn thing about the film
business. It's kind of crazy, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. But Klein was named executive producer of the film,
and he will recoup his investment plus a percentage of the profits
_ if the film ever gets off the ground. ``I'm a single guy. My
salary is good, and my expenses are low,'' he says. ``I've been in
the computer business for 20 years, and I was looking for something
different, something that involved interacting with artists as
opposed to computer geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kines circumvented the system with his film, but he's not
convinced that the business is going to change overnight. Studio
executives share the fear that is rocking the music industry, which
is being forced to realign because of technology that enables
artists to distribute their music on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of fat cats in the industry who have made
their fortune through traditional ways, and they're afraid these
young guns are going to steal their fire,'' Kines says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kines is already launching two future projects on line,
this time before the screenplays are even written. (Those sites are
www.scarredforlife.com and www.typhoidmary.com.) And he continues
to raise money to pay back the debts he racked up while shooting
``Foreign Correspondents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you mention that I sell photos of the stars on the Web
site?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly nothing new about trying to make money on
line, and Kines is unapologetic about turning into a sort of cyber
P. T. Barnum. ``I had to make sure that I exploited everything I
possibly could, and the Internet is an interactive medium,'' he
explains. ``I had to go out and lure people in like a carnival
barker.''
</P>
<P>
   If this cyber barker gets his way, his film will be coming to a
theater near you.

USB DESERVES MORE SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Universal Serial Bus, more commonly known as USB, is a
relatively new system for attaching keyboards, mice, printers,
scanners, microphones, and lots of other kinds of devices to
desktop and laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   USB is supposed to make computers easier to use, less expensive,
and more flexible. USB is also supposed to end the second-class
status of Macintosh users, since USB devices are theoretically
compatible between Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of USB is the flat, rectangular connector that is on
the backs of many laptop and desktop computers sold today. This
connector supplies both power and data to peripherals. If you want
to attach a USB scanner to your laptop, you just plug it in. The
Windows 98 operating system is supposed to automatically recognize
the scanner, load the driver, and let you use the device _ all
without having to reboot.
</P>
<P>
   Most new computers today come with two USB connectors. If you
want more, you can buy a USB hub. Some hubs also have their own
serial ports or printer ports, allowing you to connect older modems
and printers to the high-performance USB system. If you have an
older computer, fret not: You can buy a plug-in USB adapter card
for less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while USB is off to a pretty good start, it still
has a lot of growing up to do. Surprisingly, that's because the
same companies that have been quick to adopt USB have been slow to
give the technology their full support.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has been one of the most enthusiastic adopters of
USB, largely because it has the most to gain. When Apple introduced
the iMac, the new computer came with a USB keyboard and a USB
mouse. What Apple left out was the floppy disk. The company told
people who wanted a floppy to go out and buy one that could plug
into the USB port. A lot of people said that Apple really
blundered, because there weren't actually any USB floppy disk
drives on the market when Apple first launched its iMac.
</P>
<P>
   But what Apple actually did was jump-start the market, by
creating a class of users that were desperate for the technology.
Today you can see the result: There are many USB floppy drives and
Zip drives on the market from a variety of companies. Shipping the
iMac without a floppy revitalized Apple's third-party suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't been going as well in the PC world. In principle,
USB allows computer makers to eliminate the confusing collection of
sockets that are on the back of most PCs and instead have a neat
little row of USB connectors. In theory, this would let computer
makers simplify their production lines and thus cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   But most PC makers aren't looking for ways to cut prices.
Instead, they are looking for techniques to justify higher prices
and profit margins in an increasingly competitive environment. So
PC vendors simply added two USB ports to their standard port
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Because no PC vendor jumped whole-hog to USB, the technology has
spread more slowly in the PC world. Today you can buy some USB
devices, but the majority of peripherals sold for PC users are not
USB-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One really neat USB device that I've seen is a microphone made
by Telex and designed for use with PC speech-recognition systems,
such as Dragon Systems's Naturally Speaking. One of the big
problems that companies like Dragon have had is that PCs don't have
very good audio recording subsystems. The electronics that digitize
the microphone pick up lots of cracks and pops. The noise makes
speech recognition much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Telex USB microphone gets around this problem by digitizing
the sound outside the computer and sending it to the PC in digital
form, through the USB interface. This is especially important for
laptop uses, since laptop PCs typically have even worse sound
systems than desktop units.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Systems sells the Telex microphone under the name Dragon
NaturallyClear USB System H100 at a list price of $79.95. I haven't
seen it in stores, but you can buy it from Dragon's Web site at
www.dragonsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting USB device is Visioneer's new PaperPort
Strobe Pro ($200). Visioneer's scanner can connect to a PC through
either the USB port or through a standard serial port. The
advantage of running the Visioneer off the USB port is that it is
faster, and you don't need an external power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Visioneer's scanner also demonstrates just how
much work is needed for PC firms to realize USB's full potential.
Even though data travels over USB more than 10 times faster than
over a high-speed serial port, Visioneer's Strobe Pro scans pages
somewhat slower than the Strobe scans using its high-speed parallel
interface.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has been software compatibility. Visioneer's 6.0
PaperPort desktop software won't work with its top-of-the-line USB
scanner. Visioneer knows about the problem and is working on it.
(An experimental driver is available that fixes the problem.
Contact Visioneer for details.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Visioneer is selling a Macintosh version of its
USB Strobe Pro scanner, it's priced at $249.99. This misses the
point of USB entirely.

OVERCLOCKING AND LOVING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a would-be designer of computer games, Boston University
student Tyrell Gales needs the fastest, most powerful computer he
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   His machine is set up to run both Windows 98 and Microsoft's
high-end Windows NT operating systems. It's packed with 128
megabytes of RAM. And where most computers have a single graphics
accelerator to draw 3D images on the screen, Gales has three of
them for razor-sharp image quality.
</P>
<P>
   So you'd expect Gales' machine to have one of Intel's most
powerful chips under the hood. A Pentium II 450 perhaps, or one of
the new Pentium III chips.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's running an Intel Celeron, a chip developed for use
in those sub-$500 PCs they sell at Best Buy. In fact, Gales uses
the Celeron 300A, a version so obsolete Intel has stopped making
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gales doesn't care; he loves his Celeron. ``They can outperform
the Pentium II 450 on games,'' he says ``There's no question of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. How can a $100 Celeron chip outperform a $400
Pentium II chip? Well, it can't _ unless you cheat. That's what
Gales and thousands of other hardcore computer buffs do every day.
By using a risky little trick called overclocking, they can turn a
low-end chip into a flamethrower.
</P>
<P>
   The speed rating of the typical chip contains a sizable safety
margin. A Celeron chip rated at 300 megahertz can actually run
faster. You speed up the chip by speeding up the motherboard, and
sometimes by slightly increasing the voltage to the chip. A Celeron
300A was designed to communicate with the motherboard at 66
megahertz. But if you reset the motherboard speed to 100 megahertz,
the Celeron is suddenly running at 450 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better. Processor chips use a bit of memory called a
cache to speed up performance. Ironically, the Celeron's cache is
faster than a Pentium II 450's at any speed. So a Celeron running
at 450 is actually a bit faster for some tasks than the Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Goodman, who runs PCs for Everyone, the geek headquarters
in Cambridge, told me he can't keep the 300As in stock. College
kids like Gales gobble them up for use as overclocked 450s. The
$300 they save on the processor gets spent on better graphics cards
or larger hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   And cooling fans, of course. Overclocking a chip causes it to
run much hotter than usual. To do it safely, you've got to bolt
extra cooling fans and heat sinks onto the chip. A whole
chip-cooling industry has sprung up to cater to the needs of
overclockers. For instance, a South Carolina firm called KryoTech
Inc. makes a computer case with a small refrigerator built in, just
for cooling the processor. Even the motherboard makers have gotten
into the act, creating special boards tailored for overclockers.
</P>
<P>
   Overclockers are passionate about their art, even compiling
reams of statistics on the performance of their chips. Joe
Citarella, a retired GTE marketing manager, has published their
data at his Web site, overclockers.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like a wine buff who says he can taste a cabernet and tell you
what corner of the vineyard the grapes came from, Citarella says he
can roughly predict the performance of an overclocked chip by
looking at which Intel plant cranked it out. ``The chips that came
out of Costa Rica,'' he says, ``require on average a tenth of a
volt more to run than the chips that come out of Malaysia.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Michael Sullivan regards the whole thing with
wary amusement. ``We know that people like to do this and they're
willing to take risks with their property, and that's OK,'' he
says. But Sullivan warns that overclocking will invalidate the
warranty on a computer. Besides, even if it works, overclocking may
shorten the life of the chip. ``Our recommendation is, don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance of that. Citarelli's overclockers.com Web site,
founded in November, has drawn nearly a million visitors. Some are
drawn by the technical challenge of overclocking, while others just
like the idea of paying Intel $100 and getting $400 worth of
horsepower. ``I think there's a great American tradition of
sticking it to the big guy,'' says Citarelli. ``I think it's as
simple as that.''

 &HT;    Texas gave charter just enough money to get into trouble
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes throughout.)
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Emma L. Harrison Charter School is $300,000 in
debt, give or take thousands. Teachers have missed six weeks worth
of paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Workforce Commission stopped all state funds to the
school because of failure to pay unemployment taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Teacher Retirement System also also put a hold on state
payments alleging the school deducted retirement funds but didn't
remit them to the state.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of creditors around town told the Tribune-Herald in
March they were waiting for payments on a host of services from
electrical installation to carpeting, to a 12-foot-long,
double-sided, $3,000 custom sign. The latter was made but not
delivered for lack of payment.
</P>
<P>
   A state-assigned educational master has urged that the school be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the Texas Education Agency holds a hearing here on
whether to revoke Harrison's charter. This should be the easiest
call since the official designation of day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Talk in Waco isn't about Kosovo or China spying. It's about
where all the money went at the Harrison Charter. Texas has
committed $750,000 to this endeavor, assuming children would get
taught with innovative methods. At this point the major innovation
(no doubt Austin is studying closely) appears to be how to get
teachers to teach without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Within this mighty laboratory for change _ charter schools _ it
appears Texas thinks it has fulfilled its duty by giving the
Harrison entrepreneurs just enough change to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship'' _ that's the language used at the Texas
Education Agency charter division, language that implies taking
risks with capital. Texans appreciate things entrepreneurial, but
they are less appreciative when children's schooling is put at
risk, and when educators are denied paychecks, and when local
businesses are hung out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Charter holders receive a set sum per
student. The money, averaging about $4,000 a year per child
statewide, or $22 a day for 180 school days, is for educating
alone.
</P>
<P>
   What about carpets? What about signs? What about electrical
wiring? What about the van Harrison Charter School bought? How to
pay for all that?
</P>
<P>
   As the folks at the education agency explain it, the rest must
come down to belt-tightening and rustling up donations and grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No start-up or facilities capital'' from this per-student
allotment is the word from TEA.
</P>
<P>
   What about capital needs? All school districts borrow to pay for
those. That's a good question the state doesn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harrison's problems is a dilapidated building. The former
R.L. Smith Elementary needs lots of repairs. It has been the East
Waco Community Center for a few years, managed by Harrison CEO Ida
Pinkard. It would appear that the killing of two birds with one
stone _ establishment of a charter school and refurbishment of the
community center _ could have been seen as the opportunity that
came with that $4,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   Who sees that these dollars are better spent? The state charter
division is a skeleton crew: two people and a receptionist. And
this year leading ``entrepreneurs'' in the legislature leaned on
the state school board to add 80 charters to the current 88.
</P>
<P>
   State charter officials assert that the risk-taking is paying
off at such venues as the EOAC Waco Charter School and the newly
renamed Audre and Bernard Rapoport Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Texans still should wonder who is standing in line to play
charter dollars like scratch-off winnings at the Quik-Pac.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $3,000 sign that was never delivered to the Harrison
school, and likely never will be, there still can be a use for it.
Texas policy makers should install it on the Capitol grounds to
beam day and night, a reminder of risk-taking with public dollars.

CHEF'S DEVOTION TO FOOD LEADS TO USEFUL COOKBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no doubting Amanda Hesser's devotion to food. Or her
ambition or creativity in pursuit of that devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Hesser decided seven years ago when she was at Bentley College
in Waltham, Mass., that she wanted to learn from the very best
everything there is to know about cooking and baking.
</P>
<P>
   She contacted her favorite restaurant, Michela's in nearby
Cambridge and persuaded chef-owner Jody Adams to allow her to come
work weekends _ at no salary _ in the kitchen. She also convinced
her favorite bakery, Panini, to allow her to spend Saturday nights
learning the basics of artisanal bread making. At no salary, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good view, the real view, of restaurant life and I
learned the basics of bread making. I even drove the delivery truck
around Boston at 6 in the morning, when the sky was just lighting
up,'' Hesser said. ``I guess it shows how nuts I am, because that's
how I spent all my weekends my senior year in college.''
</P>
<P>
   She followed that by spending three months upstate New York at
the highly regarded Wookstock-area bakery Bread Alone, continuing
her education in wood-fired oven baking. Then Hesser took off for
Europe, where she spent the next three years serving
apprenticeships at some of the premier restaurants and bakeries in
France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   She was there to learn, and asked for only room and board in
return. She had prearranged each job while still in the United
States, knowing instinctively that this was a path to a chef's
version of a doctorate degree that didn't require the tuition of a
leading culinary school.
</P>
<P>
   Hesser's experiences in Europe also gave her the opportunity to
write one of the most attractive and pleasing food books of 1999,
``The Cook and the Gardener: A Year of Recipes and Writings from
the French Countryside'' (W.W. Norton, $32.50).
</P>
<P>
   Hesser, 27, a writer for the New York Times' Dining In/Dining
Out section since 1997 (her first full-time job), chronicles a year
she spent as a cook under Anne Willan at the fabled Chateau du Fey
in Burgundy. There, she met the gardener, Monsier Milbert, a
curmudgeonly man mistrustful of the young American chef.
</P>
<P>
   As the seasons change, Hesser slowly gains Milbert's confidence
and their relationship begins to bloom. ``The Cook and the
Gardener'' combines Hesser's descriptions of Milbert and his sage
ways in the garden with more than 200 recipes. Also included is
practical kitchen advice, everything from making spring stock and
strawberry jam to crafting autumn centerpieces.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are organized, naturally, by season. Most of the
dishes feature just-picked produce, rich with the flavor of the
earth, or, as the French call it, le gout de terroir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized not long after I arrived that I really didn't
understand the ways of the garden at all,'' she said. ``We're
always striving to cook with the freshest ingredients possible, but
a lot of chefs aren't in tune with the garden. It took me two whole
years to gain a better sense of appreciation for the seasons and
why different things are harvested when they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardeners are visionaries,'' she added, ``always looking ahead
to the next season, while cooks live for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   From the April chapter, here is Hesser's recipe for crisp
rhubarb preserve. It can be made, she notes, without the berry
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRISP RHUBARB PRESERVE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound rhubarb stalks, peeled and sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar, or more if needed
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 boysenberry leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 strawberry leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 raspberry leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 bag Ceylon tea
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, washed, hulled and halved (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   Place the rhubarb in a large heatproof bowl. Bring 1 cup water,
the wine and the sugar to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar,
then turn off the heat. Add the berry leaves and tea and let infuse
for 15 minutes. Bring mixture back to a boil and strain over the
rhubarb. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap to contain the heat and
to create a hermetic atmosphere in which the rhubarb can absorb the
flavors of the infusion. Let cool, then refrigerate for at least 8
hours, to crisp the rhubarb and allow it to imbibe the flavors
further.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, taste the syrup, adding more sugar if desired,
and the strawberries. Ladle into tall parfait glasses or small flat
bowls. If serving ice cream, place 1 scoop in each glass and ladle
the rhubarb over it.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Strawberries may not yet be in season; in this case,
either omit them, of if you have fruit preserved in alcohol (e.g.,
raspberries eau-de-vie) from the previous year, substitute these.

OVERLOOKED RHUBARB DESERVES MORE RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a vegetable, rhubarb is rather neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbooks, even notable ones such as ``Vegetables,'' by James
Peterson, and ``Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables,'' by Elizabeth
Schneider, don't include it. Even the ``Joy of Cooking'' (1975
version) only gives it a passing mention. Rhubarb deserves better.
</P>
<P>
   This tall, slim vegetable _ yes, it is a vegetable even though
in 1947 the U.S. Customs Court in Buffalo, N.Y., declared it a
fruit _ is easy to cook, has a nice tart flavor and can be used
many different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Court decided to relegate rhubarb to the fruit
category because that's how it's used most of the time. When it is
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of demand for it,'' says Richard Holmes,
owner of Holmquist Farms in Hudson, N.Y., where rhubarb is grown
for sale this time of year. ``I don't think young kids know what
rhubarb is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether buying rhubarb from a farm stand or at the grocery
store, look for fresh stalks that are firm, not wimpy. Though
rhubarb stalks are both red and green, you'll want to find some
with red in it to give color to your finished dish. As for flavor,
it doesn't matter what color stalks you use, growers say.
</P>
<P>
   You can look for rhubarb with plump, heart-shaped leaves but you
probably won't find any. The leaves, which contain large amounts of
oxalic acid, are poisonous and generally removed before the rhubarb
is sold.
</P>
<P>
   You'll usually need to cook the rhubarb before you use it in
recipes. Elaine Holmquist, Holmes' wife, chops the stalks into
1-inch pieces and places them in a saucepan with a little water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much,'' she says, ``only a cup, because the rhubarb is
going to make its own water.''
</P>
<P>
   Boil it down until you have rhubarb puree and add some sugar.
Let cool. At this point, Holmquist says, you can freeze it or use
it in pies, cakes or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Most people combine rhubarb with strawberries and bake them in a
pie. But there are other uses for rhubarb as well. Anne Gardon
suggests making Mint-Rhubarb Juice in her newly released book,
``Preserving for All Seasons'' (Firefly).
</P>
<P>
   _ Boil 12 cups of rhubarb chunks in 2 cups water until soft.
Drain cooked mixture overnight in a cheesecloth-lined colander (if
you don't have cheesecloth use an old pillowcase). Discard pulp.
Measure juice and add enough water to make 4 cups. Combine juice,
10 springs of mint and 3 cups sugar in a heavy saucepan and bring
slowly to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Strain mint, cool and then
freeze in rigid containers. To make a nice springtime ade, plop a
couple scoops of the frozen juice in a blender, add a bit of water
and puree.
</P>
<P>
   Gardon also combines rhubarb with orange in a lively compote.
</P>
<P>
   Simply combine the grated rind and chopped sections of 3
oranges, with 8 cups chopped rhubarb, 4 cups sugar, a pinch of
nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thick, 20 to 25
minutes. Ladle into 4 hot 1-cup jars and seal. Keep refrigerated
until ready to use or store in freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Additional tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a blender, combine 1 cup rhubarb puree with 2 tablespoons
honey, 1 teaspoon grated gingerroot, 1 pound cleaned strawberries
and 4 cups plain yogurt for smoothies. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   _ One pound of rhubarb equals 3 cups of raw, sliced rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since rhubarb was one of the first crops of spring in colder
climates, it was considered as a tonic, wrote James Beard in
``American Cookery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Interestingly enough, rhubarb has laxative properties, so it's
best not to have too many helpings of the rhubarb pie.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1/2 cup serving of diced, sweetened rhubarb has 139
calories, 0.1 gram fat, 2.4 grams fiber, 37 grams carbohydrate and
2 milligrams sodium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RHUBARB-STRAWBERRY PIE
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 8 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerated pie crust for a 9-inch 2-crust pie
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped rhubarb
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sliced strawberries
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Line a 9-inch pie pan with a pie crust. Heat oven to 450
degrees. Combine rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, flour, salt and
orange rind. Turn into pie pan. Dot with butter. Top with other pie
crust and crimp top and bottom edges together. Cut slits in top of
pie. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake 25 to 30
minutes more. Cool on rack. Serve warm or cold.

HOW CAN SEXUAL CONTACT BE HARMLESS FOR `WILLING' CHILD?

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the popular radio talk
show host, participated in a press conference last week hosted by
the Family Research Council to denounce a study published by the
American Psychological Association that suggests if a child is
''willing'' to have sex with an adult, it may not be harmful, and
can even be a positive experience.
 &HT;    Further, the article asserts that when there is a ''willing''
sexual encounter between an adult and child, there should be no
talk of victims, or child abuse, but we should use the
value-neutral term, ''adult-child sex.''
 &HT;    Dr. Laura charged, ''This study is the first step on the road
toward normalizing pedophilia.''
 &HT;    That could have profound legal consequences. Dr. Joseph
Nicolosi, president of the National Association for Research and
Therapy of Homosexuality, made a prediction: ''When a man gets
arrested for sex with a child, you can bet he will have an attorney
who will cite this report, saying `He did no harm to the child.''
 &HT;    Nicolosi said the article in the prestigious ''Psychological
Bulletin'' alleges that ''childhood sexual abuse is on average only
slightly associated with psychological harm, and that harm may not
be due to the psychological experience, but to the negative family
factors in the children's backgrounds. When the sexual contact is
not coerced, especially when it is experienced by a boy and is
enjoyed, it may not be harmful at all.''
 &HT;    Rhea Farberman, spokeswoman for the American Psychological
Association, told me, ''The APA position is that child sexual abuse
is seriously harmful, especially to females and should never be
considered acceptable behavior. All abuse is wrong. All is
exploitative of the child.''
 &HT;    If that is APA's position, why would it publish a study arguing
the opposite? ''We publish studies not because we agree or
disagree, if it can pass our peer review process,'' she replied.
 &HT;    Sorry, but that's irresponsible. The health and security of tens
of thousands of lives are at stake. If a green light is given to
pedophiles, there will be more child molestation. And there will be
fewer convictions in court.
 &HT;    The American Psychiatric Association has already taken a
dangerous step down this road. Dr. Nicolosi reports that in its
latest diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), ''a person no longer has a
psychological disorder simply because he molests children. To be
diagnosed as disordered now he must also feel anxious about the
molestation, or be impaired in his work or social relationships.
Thus the APA has left room for the `psychologically normal'
pedophile.''
 &HT;    This is very alarming to men such as Anthony Falzarano, who was
a victim of six major molesters from age 9 through 17. One was a
school teacher at a Key Club convention. He says, ''I was very
naive. I was consenting. But I was a child, and did not know any
better.'' The result is that he began to think of himself as being
homosexual. And indeed, he later became a male prostitute who had
hundreds of partners.
 &HT;    However, when the AIDS issue surfaced, Falzarano realized that
he had been risking his life, and withdrew from the gay life scene.
He later married, fathered children and founded Transformation, a
prominent ex-gay ministry in Washington. He adds, ''I have
ministered to 500-600 homosexuals in our ex-gay ministry, 75
percent of whom have been molested, raped or sexualized before the
age of 18. That is too high a statistic to ignore.''
 &HT;    Therefore, the last step of the sexual revolution, normalizing
pedophilia, must be fought.
 &HT;    Interestingly, Falzarano organized 25 ex-gays and their parents
to picket the American Psychiatric Association's meeting in
Washington this week for another reason, its newly stated
opposition to ''reparative therapy' designed to change a person's
sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual.
 &HT;    ''There is no scientific evidence that reparative or conversion
therapy is effective in changing a person's sexual orientation.
There is, however, evidence that this type of therapy can be
destructive,'' argued Dr. Rodrigo Munoz, APA President.
 &HT;    ''We are concerned about this latest move to vilify therapists
who help homosexuals heal,'' said Falzarano.
 &HT;    Dr. Nicolosi has been trying to get three different studies
published by the APA proving the viability of reparative therapy,
without luck. One asked 882 people who had received therapy whether
it helped them. Some 17.6 percent said they are now exclusively
heterosexual; 16.7 percent are ''almost entirely heterosexual'' and
another 11 percent are ``more heterosexual than homosexual.''
 &HT;    Another survey of 280 licensed therapists reported similar
results: one third were cured and another third made progress.
 &HT;    If the APA is intellectually honest, it would publish evidence
contradicting its bias.

is seriously harmful, especially to females and should never be
considered acceptable behavior. All abuse is wrong. All is
exploitative of the child.''
 &HT;    If that is APA's position, why would it publish a study arguing
the opposite? ''We publish studies not because we agree or
disagree, if it can pass our peer review process,'' she replied.
 &HT;    Sorry, but that's irresponsible. The health and security of tens
of thousands of lives are at stake. If a green light is given to
pedophiles, there will be more child molestation. And there will be
fewer convictions in court.
 &HT;    The American Psychiatric Association has already taken a
dangerous step down this road. Dr. Nicolosi reports that in its
latest diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), ''a person no longer has a
psychological disorder simply because he molests children. To be
diagnosed as disordered now he must also feel anxious about the
molestation, or be impaired in his work or social relationships.
Thus the APA has left room for the `psychologically normal'
pedophile.''
 &HT;    This is very alarming to men such as Anthony Falzarano, who was
a victim of six major molesters from age 9 through 17. One was a
school teacher at a Key Club convention. He says, ''I was very
naive. I was consenting. But I was a child, and did not know any
better.'' The result is that he began to think of himself as being
homosexual. And indeed, he later became a male prostitute who had
hundreds of partners.
 &HT;    However, when the AIDS issue surfaced, Falzarano realizedthat
he had been risking his life, and withdrew from the gay life scene.
He later married, fathered children and founded Transformation, a
prominent ex-gay ministry in Washington. He adds, ''I have
ministered to 500-600 homosexuals in our ex-gay ministry, 75
percent of whom have been molested, raped or sexualized before the
age of 18. That is too high a statistic to ignore.''
 &HT;    Therefore, the last step of the sexual revolution, normalizing
pedophilia, must be fought.
 &HT;    Interestingly, Falzarano organized 25 ex-gays and their parents
to picket the American Psychiatric Association's meeting in
Washington this week for another reason, its newly stated
opposition to ''reparative therapy' designed to change a person's
sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual.
 &HT;    ''There is no scientific evidence that reparative or conversion
therapy is effective in changing a person's sexual orientation.
There is, however, evidence that this type of therapy can be
destructive,'' argued Dr. Rodrigo Munoz, APA President.
 &HT;    ''We are concerned about this latest move to vilify therapists
who help homosexuals heal,'' said Falzarano.
 &HT;    Dr. Nicolosi has been trying to get three different studies
published by the APA proving the viability of reparative therapy,
without luck. One asked 882 people who had received therapy whether
it helped them. Some 17.6 percent said they are now exclusively
heterosexual; 16.7 percent are ''almost entirely heterosexual'' and
another 11 percent are ``more heterosexual than homosexual.''
 &HT;    Another survey of 280 licensed therapists reported similar
results: one third were cured and another third made progress.
 &HT;    If the APA is intellectually honest, it would publish evidence
contradicting its bias.

QUAYLE COURTS CONSERVATIVES BY BLASTING LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle is back on the
moral values warpath, this time attacking the legal system for
driving religion out of the schools and encouraging children to sue
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allowed our legal system to distort and deny the role
of faith in American life, and unfortunately it's had a harmful
ripple effect,'' the Republican presidential hopeful said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also went after ``children's rights zealots'' for pushing the
idea that children can sue their parents, which he said undermined
parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every baby boomer in this room that has teen-agers has heard
the words: `I can sue you,''' he said. ``Where do they get this
idea? From the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle made his remarks in a much-hyped address at the
Commonwealth Club on the seventh anniversary of his famed ``Murphy
Brown speech,'' in which the then-vice president criticized the
fictional television character for having a child out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech, on May 19, 1992, he said, ``It doesn't help
matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown, a character who
supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid professional
woman, mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone
and calling it just another lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark made him the target of ridicule but boosted Quayle's
standing with conservatives in his party. As he tries to break out
of the pack of candidates for the Republican nomination in 2000, he
hopes the family values message will play well with the party's
right flank.
</P>
<P>
   The message may not resonate with enough California voters, said
Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based Republican political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is known as a libertarian state,'' he said.
``California voters, the majority of them anyway, get nervous about
candidates who sound more like their preacher than their
lawmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffenblum said Quayle, knowing the speech would receive
substantial news coverage, was aiming at a larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really the Commonwealth Club he was talking to,''
Hoffenblum said. ``He was talking through the media ... to the
cultural conservative camp'' across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's new target was an easy mark: lawyers. Quayle, 52, a law
school graduate who began his career in the Indiana attorney
general's office, singled out lawyers for liberal groups, such as
the American Civil Liberties Union, but also criticized judges for
what he described as removing any shred of religion from schools
and other public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He cited these cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACLU's lawsuit against the Chicago public schools for
sponsoring the Boy Scouts, which declares a belief in God in the
organization's bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ A U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that a Colorado schoolteacher
who silently read the Bible during a reading period had violated
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   _ A decision by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia that a student could not read the story of Joshua to
his class because the tale comes from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal aristocracy calls it separation of church and state.
But just as the old rule `separate but equal' really meant separate
and unequal, separation of church and state has come to mean all
state and no church,'' said Quayle, saying that any judges he
appointed would have to show a respect for religion.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffenblum said Quayle is trying to find his place among other
socially conservative Republican presidential hopefuls, including
publisher Steve Forbes and commentator Pat Buchanan. Quayle hopes
to find enough support to compete in the primaries against those
seen as the early favorites _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the son of
Quayle's former boss, and former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole.

   ISRAEL-SETTLERS _ ACHIYA, West Bank _ For Shmuel Kohen, in the

things still look pretty good. Below his hilltop mobile home are
olive orchards and a nearby Arab village. A new paved road snakes
its way up to his remote outpost and, next door, the Israeli
soldiers who protect his and the four other families here are
grilling hot dogs. ``It is important to build Israel,'' says the
affable Kohen, 28. While his daughter toddles around beneath the
posters of famous rabbis, he dismisses the chances of peace with
Arabs. ``They want to kill Jews only because we are Jews.'' But, an
hour's drive in Jerusalem, Kohen's political supply lines have been
damaged. Israel's elections Monday dealt a stunning blow to the
right-wing settler movement. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   Take a look at any of today's newsstand magazines, and chances
are one of the leading articles may be on the management of stress
or fitness. Stress is one of the leading causes of illness in
today's world, and more and more doctors and scientists are
discovering vital links between body, mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional stress can weaken the immune system, making the body
more susceptible to disease. Dr. Ronald Grossarth-Maticek, a
Yugoslavian oncologist, published the results of three studies,
which were begun in the 1960s, that stirred international
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of interviews and questionnaires given to a large
group of men and women, he assigned people to one of four
personality types. By following their medical histories for 10 to
13 years, he found evidence that certain aspects of mental and
emotional behavior may be linked to cancer or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Disease-prone people often exhibit emotional dependence,
passivity, and dissatisfaction with their key relationships. They
tend to be unduly influenced by the way others respond to them and
may find difficulty in improving unsatisfying relationships. They
also often seem unable to take the initiative in forming or
maintaining close emotional ties with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no single cause for cancer,'' says psychiatrist Hans
Eysenck. ``It is always a combination of risk factors such as
smoking, drinking, genetic factors, environmental factors,
psychosocial factors. We find that all these reinforce each other.
But personality is one of the most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Hay, author of ``Heal Your Body and Heal Yourself,''
says, ``I find that resentment, criticism, guilt, and fear cause
the most problems in ourselves and our lives. Whatever is happening
`out there' is only a mirror of our own inner thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests have shown that people who develop heart disease often
have problems handling anger, either by failing to control it or by
overcontrolling it so that their feelings may not be adequately
expressed. Frustration, fear, and helplessness are also emotions
that may create disease in the body.
</P>
<P>
   So, where do we look for an answer? The fast pace of today's
world makes it hard to avoid some stresses. We might get on the
freeway, and the intensity of the traffic may cause our blood
pressure to go up. We often work hard to make a living and achieve
the lifestyle we want, but that may mean putting in 50 to 60 hours
or more a week at our work. We might take an evening class to
improve our minds, but then we may sacrifice needed rest.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. It could be important,
however, to have some strong stress relievers at the top of our
list.
</P>
<P>
   First, take some time to be outdoors. Nature can be good
medicine -- the beauty of the earth can stimulate joy, thanksgiving
and healthy thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many stories in recent years of terminally ill
patients who may have literally laughed themselves back to health.
Those men and women had nothing to lose when they began a
systematic program of watching funny television shows and reading
humorous books. Without realizing it, they may have stimulated a
stronger immune system and helped to conquer, or at least
stabilize, their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Meditation can be a proven method of achieving a more relaxed
state of consciousness. Recent findings reported by Stanford
University researcher Kenneth Eppley review the effects of
transcendental meditation. He reports that ``TM has consistently
beneficial effects on anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   The health benefits of meditation are recognized today by many
physicians; it can lower blood pressure, slow the aging process,
and help keep the emotions in balance. It is said that one
insurance company now gives a discount to those who practice
transcendental meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Another proven method for reducing stress can be owning a pet.
Long-range studies with the elderly and the ill many times report
that having a dog or cat to stroke and love can increase happiness
and extend longevity. Mother Teresa of Calcutta often provided
animals as therapy for mentally disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   In order to be happy, healthy, and stress-free, it is important
to believe in yourself and your individual right to happiness and
health. Louise Hay writes, ``Our subconscious mind accepts whatever
we choose to believe. Life is very simple. What we give out, we get
back. I believe that all of us are responsible for every experience
in our lives, the best and the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every thought we think is creating our future. Each one of us
creates our experiences by the thoughts we think and the words we
speak. If you accept a limiting belief, then it will become a truth
for you. The universal power never judges or criticizes us. It only
accepts us at our own value.''

   BRUSSELS _ A massacre on the road to Prizren, more than 100
civilians _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ torn apart in the
village of Korisa, stories of women and children ripped apart by
NATO cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And how did NATO kick off their its o'clock follies Friday
afternoon? Without a single word about these frightful reports, not
a single bloody word of astonishment or compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jamie Shea and his Luftwaffe general droned on about
NATO's successful operations over Kosovo. ``They went very well,''
Luftwaffe Major General Walter Jertz informed us. ``It was another
very effective day of operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saigon, they had the five o'clock follies. In the 1991 Gulf
War, the Americans boasted of their military successes at the four
o'clock follies. In Brussels, NATO's follies start at three
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Shea-Jertz show was theatre of the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as we all waited to hear NATO's reaction to what might
be its most terrible bloodbath to date (or Serbia's most successful
propaganda), a NATO technician projected a massive test slide onto
the screen next to the 19 flags of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're young and we don't know _ won't find out until
we grow,'' the words said on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Were these lines from the Sonny and Cher song supposed to be
gallows humor or just monumental ill-taste? The moment Shea and
Jertz walked to the podium, we knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see no indications of a Serb ground force redeployal
(sic),'' Jertz announced. Forty tons of supplies had reached the
Red Cross at Pristina. ``I can assure you we will do everything
possible to ensure the safe passage of these convoys.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us in the darkened Joseph Luns auditorium at NATO
headquarters were holding our breath. Several journalists (the
television coverage never shows this, of course) shook their heads
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   There had, it seemed, been no safe passage in Kosovo. We were
thinking of the first reports coming in _ of NATO cluster bombs
bursting amid 500 Albanian refugees, many of them children, of a
massacre that would make even the April Prizren-Djakovica slaughter
small-scale.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to know about those who were young but would never
grow.
</P>
<P>
   But no, General Jertz of the Luftwaffe _ or the ``German Air
Force'' as we are for some reason encouraged to call it here _
wanted to tell us there had been 679 NATO missions over Yugoslavia
in 24 hours, that there had been attacks on oil refineries,
electricity stations, the Batajnica airfield.
</P>
<P>
   On the slide screen _ incredibly _ were projected the words ``A
GOOD DAY.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Shea launched into his usual denunciations of Serb
atrocities, exhuming some old pictures of alleged mass graves and
some (slightly) newer ones of burned villages.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted from old human-rights and newspaper articles and
managed to mispronounce the names of seven Kosovo villages. ``God
knows, frankly, what we are going to find when Kosovo is open,'' he
said, solemnly shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   God knows, I'm sure, what Shea was thinking; he was far more
frightened of what western journalists _ bussed to the scene by the
Serb authorities _ would find in the village of Korisa.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty tractors had been destroyed in the attack, the Serbs were
reporting, close to an area that had been the scene of sustained
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was, you see, significant that Shea had not mentioned _ had
not alluded for a second _ to these extraordinary reports. Had he
thought for a moment that the Serbs had slaughtered these people,
he would have told us all he knew. But he was silent.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague muttered in my ear that when Shea was asked about
the reported massacre, he would express no compassion for the dead
but ``promise another of his full and thorough investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   And when at last he was asked, Shea expressed no compassion for
the dead but promised ``a full and thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped, he added sarcastically, that the journalists bussed to
the village by the Serbs would ``insist on their right to go around
freely and do their own research'' _ Shea is now apparently a
professor of journalism as well as a NATO flak _ and that they
would investigate ``ethnic cleansing'' in the nearby town of
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know NATO _ we give the truth on these issues, every
single time, the full facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't. NATO does not give ``the full facts'' (or ``the
full fax'' as Shea keeps saying). It lies.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked for NATO's reaction to the KLA appointment of one
of the most notorious ethnic cleansers as its new military
commander _ Agim Ceku, one of the planners of Croatia's ethnic
cleansing of 300,000 Serbs in Krajina _ Shea said he had no comment
because ``NATO has no direct contact with the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   This is totally untrue. NATO liaises with the KLA, holds
security and intelligence meetings with their commanders, maintains
radio contact with KLA men in Kosovo. NATO officials (including J.
Shea, Esq.) regularly announce KLA operations with approval. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when I asked General Jertz if NATO was using depleted
uranium munitions in Serbia, he said that it had not done so for
two weeks but that depleted uranium is harmless.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is a lie. There is growing evidence that the dust
from spent depleted uranium shells has caused an explosion of
cancers in southern Iraq and may well be a cause of Gulf War
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   British weapons testing sights are meticulously washed down
after depleted uranium test-firings, their contents sealed in
concrete. Nothing to worry about, said the general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find uranium in all sorts of things _ in rocks, soil...''
No harm could be caused by the use of such shells, Shea added. So
much for the deformed babies now being born in Basra.
</P>
<P>
   And so much, I suppose, for the contaminated homes of Kosovo to
which NATO claims it will return all of the Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I kept wondering what this whole farce reminded me of. Here were
the two NATO men recording, minute after minute, hour after hour,
day after day, the destruction of the Kosovo population _ the fault
of the Serbs, to be sure, but the symbol nonetheless of NATO's
total, abject failure in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, they tell us about mass graves and death and torture.
And I recalled after a while what it all reminded me of _ the
discreet voices, the dipped lights, the flags hanging like dead
flowers behind the podium, even the sinister iron Death Star which
stands grimly outside NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of an undertaker's office. The mock
soul-searching, the old pictures, the expressions of regret. The
cockney and the general were the morticians, as unable to
contemplate an end to NATO's bombardment of Serbia as they were to
arrest old age or find a cure for death.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is dead. Its people are dead or dispossessed. For
investigation, read autopsy. And after a while it dawned on me as
it has dawned on others attending these preposterous gatherings: we
are being prepared for the death of NATO. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the dirt of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp and in Mar Elias, they were not celebrating the
election victory of Israeli Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entrance to Mar Elias camp, with its open sewers and
old, worn water pipes running down the pavement, there hung an iron
map of Palestine: the original Palestine, Haifa as well as
Ramallah, Tel Aviv as well as Nablus, Jerusalem as well as Jericho,
the whole shebang. And they are not going to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   They would like _ the Palestinians who live among the garbage
here _ to have the same ``right of return'' that U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have promised to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Blair did not intend their promise to apply to
the Palestinians from Haifa and the rest of that part of Palestine
that became Israel in 1948 (nor do they want them to return there).
</P>
<P>
   And when you enter the grotty concrete hovel where Suheil Natour
holds forth, you can see how enormous is the chasm that divides CNN
from reality, which separates ``peace hopes'' from peace _ which
makes Ehud Barak's election a mere footnote to catastrophe for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the Likud and Labor are minor,'' the
spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor wants the annexation of 52 percent of the West Bank,
Likud wanted 64 percent _ this is the difference for the
Palestinians.'' Which, for the dispossessed, for the 4 million
Palestinians of the diaspora, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak wants peace. But everyone wants peace; the
Palestinians and the Israelis. Yet Barak has said that he will not
cede the Arab quarter of Jerusalem to Palestine. So what hope for
Palestine?
</P>
<P>
   It may be peace of a kind that the electorate of Israel has
voted for. But it is not peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world _ the supine, humiliated Arab dictatorships whose
leaders have pleaded for Washington's love and support and money _
welcomed the Labor leader's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Egypt's familiar ``hand of peace'' (and oh, if only
President Hosni Mubarak would hold the same kind of free elections
which Israel conducts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate with the new Israeli prime
minister to revive the peace process and to change the general
atmosphere in the region which was extremely poisoned over the last
three years,'' the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said.
</P>
<P>
   And from Jordan _ whose Plucky Little King II has prayed for
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat _ came equally familiar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' the deputy prime minister, Ayman Majali said,
``we will witness a serious move on the peace process, on the
Palestinian-Israeli track and on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese
tracks and hopefully we will witness a serious move for a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But note the double ``hopefully'' and the reference to a
``just'' peace. And the use of the American phrase ``tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Israelis have been trying to divide the Arabs
into these different tracks. The Palestinians fear Barak will do
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yasser Arafat joined in the applause. ``I respect the
choice of this democratic election,'' he said without missing a
heartbeat when he used the word ``democratic'' _ that quality which
Arafat's Palestine so miserably lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my best wishes to Barak,'' Arafat chimed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, many a sheikh will be breathing a similar sigh of
relief. Now that the awful Netanyahu has gone, they can deal with
the nice Barak. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   But history _ especially Palestinian history _ does not work
like that. If there is to be a Palestinian state _ the only hope
for a real peace _ then the Palestinians will have to have a
capital in part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to see an end to occupation, an end to the theft
of Arab land and the continued building of Jewish settlements on
Arab land, an end to the confiscation of Palestinian identity
papers, an end to the demolition of Arab homes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised none of this. Indeed, he may be more
interested in making a peace overture to Syria and Lebanon rather
than Palestine, in leaving Arafat to suffocate for awhile longer in
his Gaza dunghill as the Palestinian leader's popularity sinks even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Syria still demands, consistently, the return of
the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad had held out (in Syria's negotiations with
the Rabin-Peres Labor government) for a withdrawal of Israeli
troops to the borders of June 4, 1967, a frontier which would give
Damascus that part of Golan which Arafat considers Palestine, the
bit which is the source of water _ the Middle East's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin refused. Barak may accept. So goodbye, Arafat would
conclude, to another bit of Palestine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a peace with Syria would allow Israel to withdraw
from the cauldron of Lebanon _ ``unconditionally,'' according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, though Barak may have other
ideas _ and save its soldiers from the increasing attacks of
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to be out of Lebanon in a year. But on the
ground, where it always matters in the Middle East, things do not
seem that easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (don't look for the news reports because it went
unmentioned) Israeli shellfire killed two civilians in the Lebanese
town of Nabatea. The Hezbollah retaliated with Katyusha rockets
into Galilee (wounding Israeli civilians, which did not go
unreported).
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Lebanese resistance movement displayed in
Beirut an entire armored personnel carrier _ captured from Israel's
surrogate ``South Lebanon Army'' militia in southern Lebanon over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Middle East has changed since Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in Israel three years ago. President
Mohamed Khatami of Iran _ elected democratically with a far more
devastating popular vote than Barak _ has been meeting King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia after visiting President Assad in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   For Iran is no longer the pariah of the region, feared by those
Gulf Arabs who so eagerly invited American troops to their
peninsula when Iraqi president Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
became the greatest threat to the region since the last greatest
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians are now talking of a ``strong regional alliance''
between Tehran and the Arab Gulf. And they have reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab kings and emirs are tired of America's crusade against
Iraq and its sanctions-cull of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
   They are weary of Washington's vacillation in the face of
Israel's refusal to abide by the American ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   They are distrustful of an America which demands obedience to
U.N. resolutions from Arabs but none from Israel.

building more settlements, what will it not permit Barak to do? &QL;

   Back, then, to that hovel in the Mar Elias refugee camp Tuesday.
``The Labor government did not block settlements _ it went on
building them,'' Natour said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a genius for prolonging the ``peace process,'' to
create new settlements, to ``Judaicize'' Jerusalem, to create facts

   Most of the Lebanese press took Natour's view, warning readers

   ``The wings of angels will not sprout on the shoulders of
Barak,'' the daily ``An Nahar'' warned. ``Claws already decorate

   Pessimism, of course, comes as easily to the Arabs as optimism
comes to the Israelis. But it's going to be a long haul.

   For the Middle East _ and for America _ Barak is better than
Netanyahu. But it is not peace in our time. &QL;

 And MARY DEJEVSKY, WASHINGTON  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ As Israel was adjusting Tuesday to Ehud
Barak's sweeping electoral triumph over Benjamin Netanyahu, it
emerged that close aides to Tony Blair and Bill Clinton had been
working closely with Barak's Labor Party and transforming it in the
way Blair modernized Britain's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Gould, the British Prime Minister's opinion polling guru,
and Stan Greenberg, who does the same job for President Clinton,
have held monthly strategy meetings in Israel for the past two
years with Barak, the newly-elected Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential documents seen by The Independent reveal the extent
of their work in helping the Israeli Labor Party back to power.
</P>
<P>
   Barak even came to London for a two-day brainstorming session on
how to remodel his image.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Tuesday hailed the election of Barak with
restrained delight but was closer to the election campaign than its
public neutrality suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Greenberg, advising Barak in his planning strategy,
conducting polls and framing advertising, were two other members of
the election team credited with helping Clinton to his first
presidential victory in 1992: James Carville and Robert Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a new advance in the Middle East is
especially welcome in Washington, where Clinton is in sore need of
a foreign policy success following the diplomatic setbacks in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his military service, the question of General
Barak's devotion to the security of Israel is not in question,''
Clinton told reporters Tuesday after a meeting with King Abdullah
of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The direct involvement of Blair and Clinton aides followed an
appeal for help by Daniel Levy, the Tel Aviv-based son of Lord
(Michael) Levy, a close friend and the tennis partner of Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg were the architects of the proposal that the
party change its name, even suggesting at one point that it be
called New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Labor party kept its name but fought the
election under the One Israel banner, the name of the alliance it
formed with two smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   How far the new model Labor party made more than a cosmetic
difference to the outcome of the election is doubted by some
Israeli analysts. Barak won, they believe, because so many of the
former prime minister's senior colleagues had been fired or
deserted and set up the Center Party to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategy amounted to keeping his mouth shut and
watching his opponent who presided over a rickety coalition,
self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   But when they became involved in 1997, Gould and Greenberg
warned that the modernization of Labor was the most important and
difficult task facing the Barak campaign. They recommended the
``dramatic high risk'' strategy pursued by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial assessment of Labor's prospects was poor. Labor's
combination of ``elitism plus softness on the core security
issues'' was summed up as ``fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   A center-left party must do two things, they advised: ``It must
be the party of the people. This means the party of the new middle
class; the new majority; hard-working; tough-minded. It must win
the center: on security; on crime; on welfare it has to be tough,
not soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg warned that Labor was not considered to be
``the party of the people''; the party that could best resolve
social problems or unite the country. Neither was it the ``party of
security or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg described Barak's strengths as ``a powerful
and imposing presence; a manifest sense of destiny; the genesis of
a talented team and the innate weakness of Netanyahu, a poor prime
minister tainted by corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night Gould said most of the credit should go to Greenberg,
a partner in his London-based political consultancy. ``Stan did an
extraordinary job. He kept faith during a difficult project and got
an incredible result,'' said Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Carville meanwhile _ who was one of Clinton's most bullish
defenders during the Monica Lewinsky affair _ has said in the past
that he accepted the job with Barak in his capacity as a private
consultant and had not asked the White House for approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made no secret of the fact that he regularly briefed
Clinton on the progress of the campaign _ briefings that will
doubtless smooth the path of U.S.-Israeli cooperation now.
</P>
<P>
   Among American Jews _ several thousand of whom had taken charter
flights to Israel to cast their vote _ reactions to Barak's victory
reflected the polarization of opinion over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of his victory, however, the majority were
expected to rally around Barak, reinforcing calls for peace and
increasing the pressure to establish a durable peace. &QL;

3COM SEEKS TO PUT INTERNET IN YOUR PALM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet in the palm of your hand. That's
the hope of the 3Com Corp., which plans to unwrap its new Palm VII
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This latest version of the popular hand-held organizer kicks the
portable device market to another level. The Palm VII features a
built-in modem that allows users to connect, without wires, to the
Internet, plus send and receive electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII could be the first successful ultraportable,
easy-to-use Internet-linked computing device. That, so far, has
been an elusive dream of Silicon Valley, which has seen
contraptions such as the Apple Newton hand-held device killed off
by battery-life problems, size restrictions and price.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII, which will appear on a limited number of store
shelves later this year, will have a list price of $600 and will
have a ready-made market. Palm hand-helds account for 73 percent of
the palm-sized computer market, according to the market research
firm International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Palm VII sets the bar of what can be done in the
area of small Internet wireless devices,'' said Jill House, an IDC
analyst. ``It's really a great machine and a great execution of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Palm VII resembles the current Palm III models except
that it's a fraction of an inch longer to accommodate the modem and
a rechargeable ni-cad battery. The ni-cad powers the modem and is
charged by the two replaceable AAA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The modem is actually a small radio data transmitter that beams
information back and forth through the Bell South network. Service
is available in 260 cities, mostly on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, based in Santa Clara, says the modem has an 8,000 bps
rate. That's slower than the standard 52K modem, but the connection
is more than adequate, given the Palm VII's connection method to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII automatically links to the Internet when the user
raises a small antenna on the side of the device.
</P>
<P>
   For e-mail, the Palm VII uses installed software called
iMessenger. Here, e-mail is shuttled back and forth through the
Palm.net network. When users sign up for Palm.net service, they are
assigned an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   To retrieve e-mail sent to other addresses, it must be forwarded
to the palm.net address. Because of memory limitations, palm.net
service strips away any attachments before sending messages to the
Palm VII.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Palm applications, such as the calendar and contact
information, continue to be featured on the Palm VII.

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair started this war as
the European leader who combined impeccably pro-European
credentials with a stiffening twist of Atlanticism.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, he appeared as the perfected version of the flawed
Clinton model: an invigorating, center-left politician who didn't
need to lie about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he was the example of revitalized centrism on whom
Gerhard Schroder modelled himself in his bid for the
chancellorship.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's ideas and style were a universally sought-after British
export.
</P>
<P>
   How different things look today in the pre-terminal phase of the
conflict in Kosovo. The Prime Minister is finding himself stuck in
the position that comes least naturally to one of nature's
bridge-builders _ out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is panting for an exit strategy from the conflict, at
practically any price. The Chancellor who said a month ago that
Germans should not rule out ground troops because to do so was to
neglect the country's special responsibility for peace in the
Balkans, is now flatly declaring the option ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The French political establishment and opinion polls remain
hawkish, but the military, observing the raison d'etat that led it
into semi-estrangement from NATO four decades ago, is enthusiastic
only about being part of a ground force in which they, rather than
the Americans, provide the lead, take the glory and establish
themselves as the diplomatic force majeure in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As his European support flakes away, Blair has resorted to
pursuing a zigzag policy with the Americans in the hope that he can
needle or wheedle them into some kind of action consistent with
NATO's rhetorical stand against the Serbs' oppression of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days he has alternated praise with criticism in
the hope that this will have some effect on the policymakers in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Having allowed dissatisfaction with American hemming and hawing
on ground troops to leak out at the weekend, Blair has changed tack
on his visit to Albania and lauded the ``vision and steadfastness''
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Prime Minister has recruited the weapon of heavy
irony to his rhetorical arsenal. Vision and steadfastness are the
two qualities most strikingly absent from American policy towards
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be a final throw for ground intervention,
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook will venture to Washington
armed with the British assessment of the Yugoslav National Army's
fighting strength, which shows the Serbs to be far weaker than the
Pentagon's analysis suggests and the environment as ``permissive''
for NATO troops as it could be without Milosevic issuing a
gilt-edged invitation.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their association, before Blair's
election, Clinton and Blair sought to appear as a political item.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way was their love child _ a concept at once so
perfectly inclusive, economically neutral and innocently vacuous
that to oppose it seemed to be an act of bloody-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   My complaint against the Third Way is that it fudged the
inevitability of making stark choices. War is the starkest choice
of all. Blair realizes that. Clinton does not. As a result, we have
a disquieting loss of resolve at the heart of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The special relationship between Britain and America will not
survive a shabby end to the intervention in Kosovo. Neither, in its
present form, will NATO. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tragic circumstances, Blair has been confronted by the
shortcomings of his political blood brother. New Labor has long had
a blind spot about Clinton's moral vacuum. They considered Monica
Lewinsky and the rest to be the minor lapses of a president who was
otherwise in great ethical shape.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they betokened a deeper weakness _ his talent for
vacillation and relativism, which has returned to haunt us all in
the conflict with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blair, Clinton cannot see a line without fudging it. He
wanted a war without risk, intervention without setting American
foot in the war zone, compassion without cost.
</P>
<P>
   The more fervent Clinton's verbal commitment to help, the less
American resolve has held. When Hillary Rodham Clinton told the
Kosovar refugees last week that she felt their pain, I knew we
really were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   America aimed to win the war by fluke. When this hope foundered
as Milosevic defied the bombs, Clinton ditched his original goal
and began to seek an exit from war, using the Russians as brokers.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember the scene near the end of ``Schindler's List''
when the Germans have fled the camp and the refugees, still too
numb from their ordeal to feel the joy of liberation, are lying in
a field.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes a uniformed figure on horseback. ``You have been
liberated by the Red Army,'' says the Soviet officer. Such is the
narrative power of Spielberg's film and his cinematography that the
terrible bathos of this moment goes largely unnoticed by audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Liberation by the Russians has always been a mixed blessing, as
those who experienced it in eastern Germany and Poland at the end
of the Second World War still recall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars will not return to a part of their territory under
Russian protection. That means partitioning, or, as the Russians
now put it, with nostalgia for their post-1945 role in Germany,
``sectorization.'' There is even talk of a force without a U.S.
component, a triumph for Milosevic. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The closing lines of Robert Southey's poem, ``The Battle of
Blenheim,'' spring to mind, In them, a small boy quizzes his
grandfather over the fate of the doomed 600 cavalrymen: ``What good
came of it at last?'' quoth little Peterkin, ``Ah, that I cannot
tell,'' said he, ``But t'was a famous victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, we are watching NATO alliance being destroyed by its
creators, the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some will welcome this as freedom from Washington's hegemony in
world affairs. Others see it as the great opportunity for Europe to
develop a common military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have no other choice. But let us not deceive
ourselves that this is going to happen easily, quickly or reliably.
</P>
<P>
   The continent that cannot agree on how to reform a Common
Agricultural Policy lacks the common will and shared resolve, let
alone the experience, to uphold a peaceful order through thick and
thin.
</P>
<P>
   At the new millennium, we are in a far more exposed and volatile
position in Europe than we have yet begun to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Victory will be announced in the Balkans, whatever the outcome.
The Democrats have an election to fight in 18 months' time. The
American people will be told that they did their best to help some
beleaguered people far away.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such thing as a victimless military failure.
Blair feels this keenly, as any good European must.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Washington can be persuaded that the shame of a bad
compromise will return to haunt it, ``ethnic cleansing'' will again
have been rewarded, and evil gone unpunished. That would be a
famous victory, all right. No good can come of it. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like police officers moving spectators away from a
nasty accident, spin-doctors and officials in both Britain and the
U.S. were shooing reporters away from the idea of a transatlantic
split Monday _ ``Nothing to see here; move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ringing endorsements of NATO solidarity Monday from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Minister Robin Cook
cannot hide a growing and disturbing fact: Washington and London
risk putting themselves on a collision course over the question of
sending infantry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble could end up making life all the worse for hundreds
of thousands of refugees still at the mercy of the Serbs inside
Kosovo and being used as human shields as Nato steps up its bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spat is all the more surprising because of the hitherto very
close ties between Downing Street and the White House, celebrated
in daily telephone calls, policy seminars and familial closeness
between ``Tony'' and ``Bill.'' But no amount of ``Third Way
weekends'' can hide the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither London nor Washington wants a full-scale invasion, and
neither wants to end the air war. But some officials in Britain
believe that threatening to push harder on the ground would make it
possible to ease up in the air and reduce the civilian casualties
that are mounting daily.
</P>
<P>
   America does not. Britain wants to accelerate planning. America
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a row over substance, officials on both sides
underline, but presentation - so far. Yet as a consequence of its
persistence and moral fervor, Britain is in danger of creating a
serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some in Washington, Britain has repeatedly tried
to steer the United States towards a more aggressive land strategy
for the war.
</P>
<P>
   America will not allow its forces to be put in Kosovo except as
part of a peacekeeping force, or be railroaded into making
commitments until it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement goes back to Blair's evening visit to the White
House before the NATO summit last month, when he and his weary
officials clustered into the Oval Office to put their case after a
transatlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton deferred repeatedly to Sandy Berger, his hard-nosed
National Security Adviser, and Berger would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is agreed that if and when a deal is signed with
Belgrade, ground forces _ under NATO command, but with a United
Nations cover _ would enter Kosovo and return the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More troops would be needed than originally thought _ perhaps
50-60,000, with perhaps 10-15,000 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for this force is under way. But Britain is pushing for
early decisions, before there is a deal, and before it is clear
under what conditions a force would enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Washington and London is one of tone,
strategy and motivation. &QL;

   There is broad support for the war in Britain, so Blair and Cook
can afford to be more bellicose. They also seem to believe that
pushing Belgrade harder _ by hinting at a willingness to put in
infantry _ will cut short the air war. And they see the war as a
moral issue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. believes that the bombing, now up to 700 sorties a day,
is working; that it will press Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
to a deal in the next few weeks; and that raising any alternatives
will confuse the diplomacy, split NATO and undermine domestic
support for the campaign. &QL;

   U.S. policy has emerged from three competing interests, and it
attempts to balance them all. First, there is the strong moral case
for intervention put by Madeleine Albright, Clinton's secretary of
state and herself a refugee from genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there are the pragmatic arguments of White House staff
against a ground war, and to limit the possibility of U.S.
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the military case against a ground war but in
favor of aggressive air strikes _ as aggressive as possible. This
is the strategy pursued by General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme
Commander in Europe. &QL;

<P>
   It is not just still-raw memories of Vietnam or political
cowardice that militates against the aggressive use of ground
forces to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not keen, for a start: the army generals do not
believe that invasion would work, except with massive force in an
operation that is almost impossible to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, Washington knows that at least three NATO
governments would probably collapse if it tried to push the war on
in this way. It has already antagonized Moscow almost beyond the
point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, the ghost of Bosnia still stalks the corridors in
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   Then, America pushed for air strikes while the Conservatives put
British forces on the ground as part of a U.N. force. As far as the
Americans are concerned, that proved ground forces could simply
become hostages to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There is no constituency in Washington for a land war, or even
the aggressive use of U.S. forces on the ground. Most Americans
would no more willingly see their sons die in Kosovo than Britons
would allow theirs to die in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is irretrievably split, unable in recent votes to back
the current strategy, escalation or an end to the war. It will be a
hard fight for Clinton to get permission from Congress even for a
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not necessarily see Blair's crusade as a heroic
struggle for good. Many think he is arguing for Americans to be
killed in a war that is not theirs. Unlike Blair, Clinton has to
listen to the opposition: they control the purse strings and the
right to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Cook to Washington is an opportunity to ease the
disagreements. The long-planned trip will be used to present a
united face as often as possible, and efforts were under way to
arrange joint appearances with Ms. Albright to show there is no
divide.
</P>

   NATO has started planning for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
and commitments will soon be needed from the U.S. for a new and
larger force. Britain wants a substantial U.S. presence, but there
is a strong argument in the U.S. that the force should be largely
European.
</P>
<P>
   There are also discussions on how to handle Kosovo's political
future. There is an emerging view in Washington that Milosevic must
be given some latitude to help him to back down; and there is a
continuing view in the White House that ultimately, only he can do
the deal that will end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has sometimes seemed to lean more in the direction of
removing Milosevic. If the current row is not rapidly smoothed
over, it risks making these differences all the harder to bridge. &QL;

<P>
   TEL AVIV _ The crushing fall of Benjamin Netanyahu tells an
amazing Israeli story of a bright man who changed the rules of the
local political game, and became his own victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his policies, though they did set Israel back, that
brought about his resonant, pathetic defeat. It was his character.
</P>
<P>
   A child when Israel was born, I have never witnessed an election
campaign here in which the main issue was the incumbent leader's
personality. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was, as The Economist once dubbed him, a serial
bungler, an erratic leader for a nation in urgent need for an
orderly agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The popular slogan, referring to his nickname _ ``Just Not
Bibi'' _ ended the three-year dominance of a flawed politician over
the Israeli scene. This abysmal failure to make good on a vaulting
ambition gave his short career almost Shakespearean dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Netanyahu's self-destructive psyche, the election was
about Israel's political culture.
</P>
<P>
   In as much as they are surprisingly conservative, and still
gripped by tribal allegiances, the majority of Israelis felt they
had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the cunning play on their angst over Arab threats.
Enough of their leader's unbearable propensity to alienate almost
all his colleagues and most of Israel's friends in the world, while
engaging his opponents with heated hate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite Netanyahu, in a meticulous Tony Blair-like campaign,
Ehud Barak smartly grasped the popular urge for reconciliation,
stability and basic common sense.
</P>
<P>
   At times, as his understated tone made some of his TV
appearances seem a disaster, his supporters despaired. But as
Netanyahu was intensifying his populist, distorted attacks on the
``leftist'' elites and on the media, he isolated himself in an
increasingly paranoid campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bibi became a burden. Barak gained momentum. He now enjoys a
rare parliamentary leeway in a political system used to choking
near-ties.
</P>
<P>
   His victory is actually a revival of the late Yitzhak Rabin's
era, which was tragically cut short in the midst of major political
and economic achievements. Barak will now have to renew that
national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a vague campaign of soundbites, steered by a host of American
consultants, there was, for example, hardly a mention of the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations stopped by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak remained opaque on whether his wish for a wide power base
might evolve into an embrace of the religious parties _ and a
cohabitation with the Likud party that poisoned the politics of the
1980s. This will be the stuff of criticism soon awaiting the prime
minister designate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hope is rampant. Never have so many enthusiastic
Israelis thronged in the squares to celebrate on election night, as
if it were Independence Day. They also signaled their expectation
of a new leader who would cut a new national deal. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As bombs rain down on ``strategic'' targets while
Serbian forces empty Kosovo, public opinion in Britain, France and
the United States largely approves NATO's ``air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of those polled feel that a ``ground
campaign'' will eventually be required. Most defense experts in the
three countries mirror those conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has a vocabulary problem. The terms ``air''
and ``ground'' seem to offer a classic choice of military options.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they offer incomplete choices, fail to reflect accepted
U.S. or NATO military concepts, and thus blur _ perhaps fatally _
the search for a military solution of NATO's current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The saying that hope is not a method expresses that dilemma. A
single-dimension strategy based on the use of force to ``signal''
and ``punish,'' instead of decisive force used in all dimensions to
compel, leaves only the hope that all will come out right.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better choice. The campaign which offers the surest,
and in the long run a less costly, way to accomplish the alliance's
political goals _ surer than the hope-to-win choice of an air-only
effort, and leaner than a ``ground campaign's'' hundreds of
thousands of troops _ is the one already embodied in the
war-fighting doctrine of NATO and the U.S. armed forces: a truly
joint campaign in all dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint U.S. and NATO military doctrine published after the
Gulf War, the term ``air campaign'' was deliberately never used.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War had made clear two things about air power. First,
air power has so immensely matured as a military tool that air
interdiction is now conceptually the equal of land and sea maneuver
_ something that soldiers and sailors do not like to admit.
</P>
<P>
   But second, the use of air power, although essential to success
in modern warfare, is not alone sufficient to ensure such success.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of problems associated with ground campaigns as
well, problems which have kept that option off the table so far in
this war.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of significant numbers of casualties and extremely
difficult terrain, as well as completely inadequate ports and
infrastructure for large land forces, give pause to all but the
most fervent advocates of a land solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the shortcomings of single-dimensional
solutions that a truly joint campaign is designed to avoid. The
superb functioning and capabilities of allied air power, and the
enabling power of allied naval forces, makes adding land combat
power to the equation much less costly and much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the military aim focused primarily on the occupation of
Kosovo and the repatriation of refugees makes the operation more
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   This also makes an extensive Serbian guerrilla movement less
likely, since there are relatively few Serbian civilians in the
province to nurture a guerrilla resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Given that aim, NATO can leverage its overwhelming power to
protect the introduction of land forces, using all the tools
available: light infantry, armored, motorized, airborne, airmobile
and special forces, plus operational maneuver from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   That mix of forces, relying on massive air and naval power,
means substantially smaller land forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once introduced, the simple existence of land combat power (if
only in Albania, where it should have been deployed before the
first bomb was dropped) should force the Serbs to abandon some of
their passive defense measures such as spreading out their tanks in
ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   As the concepts that are supposed to guide future U.S. military
operations stress, synchronized land maneuver and air interdiction
create an agonizing dilemma for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating will brutally expose Serbian forces to heavier
losses from interdiction. But if they stay hunkered down, their
passive measures to reduce losses to interdiction mean they cannot
effectively counter allied surface maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Single-dimensional operations are not the way it's supposed to
be done in the post-Gulf War era. It is not too late to start using
all the tools in NATO's bag. &QL;

   NEW YORK CITY _ Parents plotting a family vacation to this
metropolis may feel a bit like those cowpokes in the picante sauce
commercial drawling incredulously ``Noo Yawrk Cee-uh-ty?!''
</P>
<P>
   They don't call it the Big Apple for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, all right _ not to mention incessantly noisy and
extremely crowded. Everybody, it seems, is in a powerful rush to
get where they're going. Stop to gawk at a skyscraper or consult a
map, and you could find yourself swept down the sidewalk by a tidal
surge of humanity before you know what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   For a first-time visitor, this vibrant city of 7.3 million can
be as intimidating as King Kong on a rampage down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder orchestrating a family getaway can be a daunting
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much to see and do in Manhattan, vacationers find it
hard to know where to start. Just deciding how to budget time can
be overwhelming. Is half a day long enough to spend at the American
Museum of Natural History? Can you squeeze the Empire State
Building, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island into one day?
Should you buy theater tickets before you leave home or spend an
hour or more standing in line for half-price seats?
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of hotels in Manhattan (59,000 rooms, if you're
counting), picking the right place to stay can be mind-boggling.
How do you begin to sort the deals from the dumps? Will that
``bargain'' room going for $150 turn out to be a broom closet?
</P>
<P>
   But if you decide to make the trip _ as my family did this
spring _ you'll join the more than 34 million tourists who'll visit
this year. And with savvy planning, you can make the most of your
visit and render the city less forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the newly polished Big Apple has never been more
alluring _ or more family-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square, the famous 30-square-block neighborhood in
Midtown, has been stripped of sleaze and transformed into a
wonderland wrapped in 40 miles of neon and flashing lights with
more than 50 mammoth advertising billboards. A Virgin Megastore and
huge Disney and Warner Bros. stores share the turf with new or
renovated hotels, hundreds of restaurants, Broadway theaters, movie
theaters, those ubiquitous camera and electronics shops, cheesy
souvenir dens and the recently opened Times Square Visitors Center.
Red-uniformed custodians keep the streets and sidewalks swept clean
as a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away at 42nd Street and Park Avenue is the grandly
refurbished Grand Central Station. The amazing $196 million cleanup
of the once grimy rail station includes rows of chic boutiques and
Michael Jordan's The Steakhouse. Scrubbing of the ceiling, which
was covered in oily gunk, revealed a wondrous celestial scene.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalized city fairly gleams.
</P>
<P>
   Even the criminal element seems to be getting with the program.
The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau boasts that New York's
crime is lowest among cities with populations of 1 million or more.
FBI statistics showed crime down by 11 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no urban area is ever without danger _ and you'd be
well-advised to hang on tightly to your totes. But don't miss out
on a family vacation to one of the world's most exciting cities
because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a crime.

IDEA TO SHIP NUCLEAR WASTE OVERSEAS IRKS ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated at the glacial pace of federal efforts to open a
nuclear waste disposal site, the owners of three closed New England
nuclear plants quietly discussed shipping their high-level
radioactive waste to Britain, raising alarms among British
anti-nuclear groups when the talks were disclosed this week.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Yankee Rowe nuclear plant in Massachusetts as well
as two other reactors say the talks last year with British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd. went nowhere. Under the plan, they would have shipped
thousands of lethally hot used fuel rods to Sellafield, England,
for storage or reprocessing into new fuel rather than waiting for a
federal waste site to open in 2010 at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have been trying to do is turn over every stone so we
don't miss an opportunity and we can finish the job,'' said Kelley
Smith, spokeswoman for Yankee Rowe and Connecticut Yankee nuclear
plants, neither of which can completely shut down until their used
fuel rods are removed from the sites.
</P>
<P>
   However, disclosure of the waste talks sparked angry accusations
on both sides of the Atlantic over one of the world's true
political hot potatoes. Activists were particularly distressed that
the British firm insisted on secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, which
released documents outlining the talks, said that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair ``must act now to stop British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd. from turning Britain into a nuclear waste dump for other
countries. The BNFL senior management who set up the deal should
resign at once, or be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, activist Ray Shadis accused Maine Yankee
nuclear plant officials of withholding information and undermining
efforts to close down the plant safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company is trying to earn the
public trust, they have a damnably poor way of going about it,''
said Shadis, who had not heard of the talks even though he is a
member of the community advisory panel assisting Maine Yankee in
shutdown procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the closed nuclear plants said they can't
understand the fuss. After decades of failed federal efforts to
build a waste repository, they say they have considered a wide
array of ideas _ such as shipping the waste to Apache land in New
Mexico _ most of which fizzle out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't possibly be held to a standard of communicating every
idea,'' said Mary Ann Lynch, vice president for law and government
affairs at Maine Yankee. ``For every 10 ideas that we have on
decommissioning, nine of them end up in the great heap of''
failures.
</P>
<P>
   High-level radioactive waste, which remains dangerous for
millennia, has long been the Achilles' heel of nuclear power. Under
federal law, the US Department of Energy is responsible for finding
a permanent repository, but possible sites _ from the Kansas salt
domes to the wilds of eastern Maine _ have flopped in the face of
intense opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the agency has been trying to develop a
waste site at the Nevada Missile Test Site, but environmental
reviews and political battles have pushed the opening date back to
2010, and many observers say 2015 is more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the long-simmering issue is coming to a head in New
England, where four of the nine nuclear reactors are closing down.
Officials at Yankee Rowe, which closed in 1991, want to begin
tearing down the buildings, which would put them on a course to
complete decommissioning within a few years _ except for the 533
fuel rods still in the waste pool.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities that own the reactors already have sued the
Department of Energy for the cost of storing the waste, and found a
federal claims court that agrees the department should pay. Maine
Yankee alone wants $130 million, including $60 million to build
concrete and steel casks to hold the waste until the Yucca Mountain
facility opens.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Smith said officials from Connecticut
Yankee and Yankee Rowe approached British Nuclear Fuels more than a
year ago about the possibility of shipping their waste to the
Sellafield reprocessing facility. Separately, Maine Yankee
officials made a similar inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said officials at the plants advanced the idea of
exporting the waste to Britain as part of an invitation from the
Department of Energy to offer new ideas for solving the problem.
Ultimately, she said, the federal agency shot down the idea before
formal negotiations could begin.
</P>
<P>
   At Maine Yankee, the British firm went so far as to draft a
paper titled ``Transport of Spent Nuclear Fuel from Maine Yankee
Power Plant: Conceptual Arrangements,'' which laid out a plan for
hauling up to 1,432 used fuel rods from Maine to England, according
to documents from Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lynch of Maine Yankee said the plant never received a
formal proposal from British Nuclear Fuels. ``It never got beyond
the most preliminary stages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials say they were not part of the waste
export talks, but said they warned US utilities that any nuclear
waste exports would have to satisfy federal concerns about nuclear
weapons proliferation. The reprocessing plant at Sellafield
generates plutonium from nuclear waste, a key ingredient in atomic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But activists say British Nuclear Fuel hoped to get around the
proliferation issue by portraying the deal to the US government as
a storage plan. In Britain, where long-term storage of foreign
nuclear waste is illegal, they would have emphasized the
reprocessing of the waste, activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate out how much of this is real and how
much of this is the desperate acts of desperate people,'' said
Jonathan Block, attorney for the New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution, which is challenging Yankee Rowe's cleanup plans. ``Once
again, we are confronted with what a stupid way nuclear power is to
boil water for your coffee.''

 &HT;    Broadway: Show kids theater at its glitzy best
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May23.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best things about New York is Broadway theater _ and
a good meal before or after the show. Currently, there are lots of
good musicals that Broadway babies and their families can enjoy
together. Take a look at some options.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE GREAT WHITE WAY:
</P>
<P>
   A KID'S-EYE VIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids Eat Broadway'' (Kids Eat Publishing, $12.95;
212-929-0734) arrives in bookstores just in time to help you plan
your summer vacation in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Written by 12-year-old Sam Freund and his mother, Elizabeth
Carpenter _ they also wrote ``Kids Eat New York'' _ the book
includes reviews of 25 family shows on Broadway and off-Broadway
plus 50 kid-friendly restaurants. The original ``Annie,'' Andrea
McArdle, who's now appearing in ``Beauty and the Beast,'' wrote the
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   We like ``Kids Eat Broadway's'' comments on each show's
age-appropriateness and appeal for various age groups (infant to 4
years, 4-7 years, 8-12 years and teenagers). For instance, it
recommends the fairy tale ``Peter Pan'' as one of the few shows
suitable for children under 4. ``It is beautiful, filled with song,
and fast-paced,'' the authors write. ``Little children will not
lose interest. However, parents should immediately take their child
out of the theater if they start to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to see that Sam and his mom loved ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' and ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' _ both
Tony-nominated revivals _ as much as we did.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from three of their reviews:
</P>
<P>
   On ``Annie'': ``Everything about `Annie' hits the bullseye. It
is a light-hearted `aw shucks' kinda show, filled with gags,
hillbilly dialogue and terrific, upbeat songs like `Doin' What
Comes Natur'lly' and `Anything You Can Do.' There is nothing
unsuitable for children.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Charlie Brown'': ``All the scenery and props looked like
they were big comic strip drawings with heavy black outlines filled
in with bright colors. ... Clearly everyone in the cast was having
a good time, and so was the audience. Without resorting to childish
cliches, the actors convincingly deliver the personalities of their
overdrawn characters. The result: A charming show that is the
perfect family entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Pan'': ``The Neverland of this show is as magical as can
be. The kids in the audience go right along with Peter, Wendy and
the boys on their adventures. ... All the way to the very end, when
Peter makes his dramatic flight out over the audience, this is the
show where there are happy endings, even if the kids do grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GOOD EATS
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    NYC offers banquet of summertime pleasures
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher

<P>
   New York calls itself ``the best restaurant city in the world.''
That may be a matter of opinion, but certainly the numbers are in
its favor: There are 18,000-plus restaurants in the city's five
boroughs, which boast about 144 ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, 200 restaurants from Manhattan to Queens will take
part in New York Restaurant Day, a whirlwind tasting event.
Participating eateries will sell samples of their signature menu
items (for $3-$5 at lunch) outside their entrances. At least a
dollar from each serving sold goes to hunger-relief organizations
Citymeals-on-Wheels and Share Our Strength.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during Restaurant Week (June 21-25), more than 100 of New
York's finest restaurants will offer a three-course lunch for
$19.99 (exclusive of beverage, tax and gratuity). A list of
participating restaurants will be posted on the Web site www
</P>
<P>
   .restaurantweek.com on Monday; make your reservations anytime
thereafter. Information: 1-800-692-8474.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alley ``Cats'' (and more): The Broadway theater season ends
with the 13th annual ``Stars in the Alley'' in Shubert Alley (west
of Broadway between 44th and 45th streets). The free event,
produced by the League of American Theatres and Producers, features
music and dance numbers performed by more than 60 cast members from
Broadway's most popular musicals. Showtime is 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
June 2. It's the highlight of Theatre Week, which culminates June 6
with the 53rd annual Tony Awards. For information on ``Stars'' and
other Broadway events, call the Broadway Line at 1-888-276-2392.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Taking the Fifth: It's one of the world's most famous
thoroughfares _ home to the Empire State Building (34th Street),
Rockefeller Center (47th Street), St. Patrick's Cathedral (50th
Street), the Trump Tower (56th Street) and the Plaza Hotel (59th
Street). An estimated 100,000 people converge on Fifth Avenue each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some quick facts (courtesy of Elizabeth Arden Red Door
Salon and Spa, another Fifth Avenue fixture): It's the site of more
parades than any other avenue in the world. The world's highest
rents are on Fifth Avenue between 50th and 58th streets. More
diamonds are purchased on Diamond Row (Fifth Avenue and 47th
Street) than anywhere else in the world. And it is the inspiration
for a fragrance that's a Top 10 best seller in Tokyo, Paris, London
and Milan _ Elizabeth Arden's 5th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Supermodel Amber Valletta, the ``face'' of Elizabeth Arden,
offers these Fifth Avenue favorites: the Egyptian Gallery at the
Metropolitan Museum, a walk in Central Park from the museum to the
reservoir (or east to west, from Strawberry Fields to the
boathouse), the view from atop the Empire State Building and
sampling some of the 100 varieties of tea at Takashimya ``Tea
Box.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garden variety: The New York Botanical Garden's Summer Garden
Getaway brings the world to the Bronx on July 1-Sept. 26. Colorful
model trains take a tour across the country in the
6,000-square-foot outdoor show ``America's Trains and Trees.'' For
a taste of the tropics, head to the Exotic Courtyard Garden at the
pools of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. It's a summer of discovery
at the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, where families can see
``Big Bugs'' (dino-sized insects), giant flowers and three mazes
and enjoy lots of hands-on activities. Information: 718-817-8700 or
www.nybg.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have a ball: The Salisbury Hotel on 57th Street is offering a
``Summer Sports Package for Two.'' For $475 plus tax, you get two
nights' accommodations, continental breakfast for two each day, two
field-level box seats for a New York Mets baseball game at Shea
Stadium and two $25 gift certificates for lunch or dinner at the
Official All Star Cafe in Times Square (along with VIP pass to
bypass the waiting line). The Salisbury has special room rates June
28-Sept. 15: $189 single or double, $209 one-bedroom suites.
Reservations: 1-888-692-5757.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Live it up: Five members of the Leading Hotels of the World in
New York City have joined forces for ``Leading Offers . . . The
Manhattan Summer Sale.'' From June 18 through Sept. 18, travelers
to the Big Apple can enjoy world-class luxury accommodations and
added-value amenities at reduced rates. Participating hotels and
starting nightly rates: the Mark ($299), Hotel Plaza Athenee

and the Waldorf Towers ($389). Rates are based on availability and
taxes are not included. Reservations: 1-800-223-6800.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scents and sensibility: Don't turn up your nose at this
gimmick to rejuvenate jet-lagged and stressed-out travelers. Guests
of the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel, an Irish luxury boutique
hotel in New York, can order the travel-size ``scent-sational''
Aromatherapy Rebalancing Kit for $25 plus tax. Included are Davies
Gate aromatherapy products including Sevilla Body Oil, Sage
Mosturizing Body Mist and a Mixed Herb Bath Salts Sampler.

   New York City: at most hotels. 1-800-876-9868
</P>
<P>
   MONEY SAVERS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CityPass: If saving 50 percent off the combined admission
prices at six of Manhattan's top sights is appealing, purchase this
pass. Included are the American Museum of Natural History, Empire
State Building Observatories, Intrepid AirSeaSpace Museum,
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and Top of the
World Trade Center. The pass is good for nine days from the first
use. The cost is $26.75 for adults, $18 for seniors 65 and older,
$21 for ages 13-18.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MetroCard: NYC Transit offers a one-day card good for
unlimited rides and free transfers on subways and local buses. Buy
one for $4 at subway token booths, newsstands, banks and many other
businesses throughout the city. 212-638-7622.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TKTS booth: Seems like there's always a line _ actually two
lines _ snaking up the sidewalks between Seventh Avenue and
Broadway at 47th Street. What's everybody waiting for? The chance
to buy discounted day-of-performance tickets for selected Broadway
and off-Broadway productions (available shows are posted each day).
We got great seats for ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' less
than 30 minutes before the 1 p.m. Sunday matinee and we paid $37.50
each for the tickets, half the regular price. We spent a little
more than an hour in line. The booth is open 3-8 p.m.
Mondays-Saturdays, noon-8 p.m. Sundays and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Saturdays
and Wednesdays. Lines form an hour before opening. There is a
second TKTS booth at the World Trade Center, mezzanine level, 2
World Trade Center, open 11 a.m.-5:30 p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m.-3:30
p.m. Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freebies: There are lots of things you can do in New York that
don't cost a cent. The Staten Island Ferry used to be a bargain at
50 cents; now it's free. (We were serenaded by a duo that set up a
keyboard and speakers and crooned songs such as ``My Cherie Amour''
to the crowd for tips.) It also costs nothintch the ongoing
diversions at F.A.O. Schwartz on Fifth Avenue _ puppeteers,
storytellers, magicians, etc. _ and play with toys displayed for
hands-on interaction. (But take the kids at your own risk: You'll
be lucky to get out without spending.)
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the green expanses of Central Park _ which stretches from
59th to 110th streets between Fifth Avenue and Central Park West _
and stop to watch ducks on a pond or lake, roll down grassy slopes,
climb on rock outcroppings, visit the zoo and watch skaters (ice in
winter, roller in summer) at Wollman Rink (if you want to skate, it
costs $7 adults, $3.50 for children under 12 for a whole day).
</P>
<P>
   Check newspapers, magazines and city guides for freebies. For
instance, if you're in New York on June 8, you can join the 21st
annual Museum Mile Festival. From 6 to 9 p.m., there's no charge to
visit nine cultural institutions _ including the Metropolitan
Museum, the Jewish Museum and the Guggenheim Museum _ along Fifth
Avenue from 82nd to 104th street. Look for free concerts in Central
and Battery parks.
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN A MEAL
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Theme restaurants: At these dining spots, eating is almost
secondary to the atmosphere. Little sluggers will love
baseball-memorabilia-filled Mickey Mantle's at Central Park South.
Sci-fi buffs will be right at home in the alien ambience of MARS
2112 at Broadway and 51st Street. Motorcycle mamas and their
offspring should roar into the Harley-Davidson Cafe at Sixth Avenue
and 56th Street. Scary props are just part of the fun at the
faux-macabre Jekyll &AMP; Hyde on Sixth Avenue between 57th and 58th
streets. Even though Atlanta has all three, kids may want to see
New York's versions of the All-Star Cafe, Hard Rock Cafe and Planet
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   THE REST OF THE STORY
</P>
<P>
   New York may be the city that never sleeps, but you will
definitely want to after a long day of sightseeing. We booked the
425-room Hotel Warwick, just outside the Times Square area at 54th
Street and 6th Avenue, through Hotel Reservations Network
(1-800-964-6835 or www.180096hotel.com). For $225 a night
(discounted from the usual $295-$340 for a double room), we got a
large room with two double beds, roomy marble bathroom and mini-bar
(declared off-limits after my daughter snagged a small bag of
Famous Amos cookies for $4.50).
</P>
<P>
   Another good source for discounted hotel rooms is
www.hotres.com, which features more than 1,000 cut-rate rooms
daily.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Good value: Apple Core Hotels, a group of five recently
renovated turn-of-the-century hotels in Midtown, are
economy-priced. Children under 13 stay free with their parents, and
continental breakfast is included. For example, a room with two
double beds at the Quality Hotel &AMP; Suites Midtown, 59 W. 46th St.,
runs $179-$209; large suites are $239-$269 (1-800-567-7720 or
www.applecorehotels.com).
</P>
<P>
   Others with rates starting below $200: the 131-room Comfort Inn
Manhattan, on 35th Street near the Empire State Building
(1-800-228-5050 or www.choice-hotels.com); the 532-room Holiday Inn
Broadway, Broadway at 32nd St. (1-888-694-6543); the 1,000-room New
Yorker Hotel, 481 Eighth Ave. at 34th Street (1-800-764-4680 or
www.hotelnyr.com); and the 72-room Best Western Seaport, Peck Slip
at South Street Seaport (1-800-528-1234 or www.bestwestern.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the glow of Times Square: If you are drawn to the bright
lights of Broadway, go for 460-room Doubletree Guest Suites, 1568
Broadway (1-800-243-6969); the 1,919-room Marriott Marquis, 1535
Broadway (1-800-483-6275); 770-room Crowne Plaza Manhattan, 1605
Broadway (1-800-243-6969); the 305-room Renaissance, 2 Times Square
at 47th Street (212-765-7676). Expect to pay in the high $200s or
more for a family-size room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Suite deals: Manhattan East Hotels' ``Suite Family Values''
package, good through July at nine all-suite hotels in East Side
and Midtown neighborhoods, includes a one-bedroom suite,
complimentary Frommer's ``New York City With Kids'' and ``Kids
Cruise Free'' certificate with each paid adult on a Circle Line
Cruise. Rates begin at $220 a night (1-800-637-8483 or
www.mesuite.com). The 450-to-650-square-foot suites include
kitchens with microwaves and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  We're in the money: The Plaza on Central Park South is where
Macauley Culkin ran up his dad's credit card in ``Home Alone II:
Lost in New York.'' You'll pay $300-plus for the privilege (768 5th
Ave., 1-800-759-3000). But the St. Regis (2 E. 55th St.), Pierre
(2. E. 61st St.), Peninsula (700 5th Ave.) and Four Seasons (57 E.
57th St.) are among the true budget-busters.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Booking a flight:
</P>
<P>
   The lowest fare is $218 round trip for nonstop flights on
AirTran and Delta to LaGuardia or on Continental to Newark, N.J.,
with a 14-day advance purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended reading: ``Frommer's New York City With Kids''
(Macmillan Travel, $15.95) is probably the best all-around
guidebook. ``The Really Cool Parents Guide to All of New York'' by
Alfred Gingold and Helen Rogan (City &AMP; Co., $12.95) takes readers
off the beaten track, beyond the official tourist circuit.
</P>

 &HT;    Pace yourself for big city, bright lights
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK CITY _ You'll have a much better Big Apple family
vacation if you remember this phrase: You can't do it all.
</P>
<P>
   It would take at least a week to even begin to hit all the high
spots. You certainly can't do more than get a taste in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Try this: Write down everything you'd like to do while you're in
the city, then cut the list in half. (Then figure out how much you
think you'll spend and double the amount.)
</P>
<P>
   I can't pretend to offer an insider's look; I've visited the
city maybe half a dozen times over the past three decades, counting
a recent visit with my husband and daughter. I planned our trip for
months ahead, working out an ambitious itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Having slept in on a Saturday morning after being
out late at the theater and eating pizza at midnight, we were
determined to make up for lost time. So, in one day, we attempted
to tour the Empire State Building (where we also took in a
tummy-churning big-screen virtual-reality attraction called the New
York Skyride), have a quick soup-and-sandwich lunch at Au Bon Pain,
then make it to the ferry to cruise over to the Statue of Liberty
and Ellis Island. Scratch the last part: We arrived in Battery Park
at 3:30 p.m., after a $6 white-knuckle cab ride from Midtown, to
find that they had stopped selling tickets 15 minutes earlier. We
settled on a back-and-forth (but free!) cruise on the Staten Island
Ferry and waved wistfully to Miss Liberty as we passed by.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we managed to cram a lot into four days. And that
includes spending the better part of a day at the fascinating
American Museum of Natural History, where we also saw the IMAX
movie ``Amazon.'' We explored the origins of man, marveled at 90
million-year-old dinosaur eggs from Patagonia, made snarly faces at
a set of T-rex bones, strolled through a rain forest and ogled
gemstones and seashells. (All of which was almost as exciting for
my 11-year-old daughter as spotting spiky-haired MTV personality
Jesse Camp on a Times Square street corner.)
</P>
<P>
   We saw three Broadway musicals _ the now-closed ``Titanic,''
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' On
Saturday night, we made reservations for dinner at Tavern on the
Green in Central Park, as much theatrical spectacle as dining
experience. One guidebook described it as the place New Yorkers
take their country cousins. Call us Ma and Pa Kettle _ but we were
dazzled by the tiny lights strung in the trees outside, chandeliers
dripping with crystal, over-the-top-ornate decor (mirrors, flowers,
balloons, topiary, statuary) . . . and the food wasn't bad, either.
But it's no bargain. Even the children's menu prices approach those
at a typical suburban eatery. Was it worth $150 for two adults and
a child? Look at it this way: Three theater tickets cost $225 _ and
you still have to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Just being in the Big Apple can be as exhausting as it is
invigorating. By the time we took a limo back to the airport, we
were drained _ yet filled with wonderful, only-in-New-York
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to help you get started:
</P>
<P>
   THEME OUTINGS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Big Apple A-list: If your family goes nowhere else, these
are a must for first-timers to the city: The Empire State Building,
the Statue of Liberty, American Museum of Natural History and
Central Park. Give your regards to Broadway: Splurge on at least
one show. Buy a hot dog or salty pretzel from a street vendor. Say
hello to Prometheus, that big golden statue, at Rockefeller Plaza.
Take a subway ride (a token is $1.50).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Come visit the world: Find out what's in the city's big
melting pot. Pay a visit to the United Nations (one-hour tours are
offered every 15 minutes), then explore ethnic diversity in
neighborhoods such as Chinatown and Little Italy. Sample the
cuisine of about any country you can think of _ from Chile to
Vietnam, from Hungary to Turkey, Afghanistan to Mexico. Visit Ellis
Island to see where 12 million immigrants who arrived in America
between 1892 and 1954 spent their first hours (or days, in some
cases). The Jewish Museum has a new children's exhibition,
``Pickles and Pomegranates: Jewish Homes Far and Near,'' an
interactive experience that evokes life in two late-19th-century
Jewish households: a Lower East Side tenement in 1897 and a house
of the same period in Persia (now Iran). Take a cab ride _ you
never know what nationality your driver will turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The artsy approach: Do a museum marathon, starting with the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose major exhibition for the summer
is ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Doctor Gachet.'' Then
do the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of American
Folk Art and/or the American Craft Museum, depending on what most
appeals to you. The current special exhibition at the Children's
Museum of Manhattan is ``Body Odyssey,'' but kids who love the Cat
in the Hat, the Grinch and Sam I Am won't want to miss the
permanent exhibit ``Seuss!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two if by sea: Explore New York's maritime past at South
Street Seaport, an 11-square-block historic district just south of
the Brooklyn Bridge on the East River. Take a Circle Line tour
around the island. Visit the Intrepid SeaAirSpace Museum, home of
the 900-foot-long aircraft carrier Intrepid, the guided missile
submarine Growler and the destroyer Edson. The hundreds of
interactive exhibits include dozens of vintage and modern aircraft.
It's at West 46th Street and 12th Avenue on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TV or not TV: Hit your kids with this bombshell: There hasn't
always been television. They can learn about the history of the
medium at the Museum of Television and Radio on 52nd Street between
Fifth and Sixth avenues. Selected shows are presented on giant
screens in four theaters, and you can spend up to two hours
watching vintage TV at one of the 96 viewing consoles. New this
spring is the NBC Experience, a high-tech attraction at NBC
headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where you can experience what
it's like to do the weather report with Al Roker or settle into Jay
Leno's guest chair. The 20,000-square-foot facility is filled with
interactive stages, a high-definition TV theater, NBC memorabilia
and retail shops with NBC logo merchandise. You could be seen on
national TV if you show up outside the glass studio where the
``Today'' show is taped between 7 and 9 a.m. weekday mornings. NBC
studio tour tickets, which disappear quickly, go on sale at 9 a.m.
in the lobby. Getting tickets for ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' is
nearly impossible, but if you call 212-506-3288, you can gauge your
chances.
</P>
<P>
   TIMESAVERS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Insider's Hour tours: This is one way to squeeze in as much as
possible: More than 40 cultural institutions, including South
Street Seaport, Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
the Intrepid SeaAirSpace Museum, are offering guided, one-hour
tours highlighting their collections and facilities. For details,
including other participating institutions, visit the New York
Convention and Visitors Bureau Web site at www.nycvisit.com or send
a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Insider's Hour, NYCVB, 810
Seventh Ave., Third Floor, NY, NY 10019.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Times Square Visitors Center: Talk about one-stop shopping.
Inside the newly renovated Embassy Theater on the east side of
Broadway at 46th Street, you can buy theater tickets, souvenirs,
international newspapers and postcards; book a Gray Line or Circle
Line tour; get cash from an ATM; make a phone call; surf the
Internet; pick up piles of brochures; and, maybe best of all, go to
the restroom. Open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Another must stop: the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau's
new state-of-the-art Visitor Information Center at 810 Seventh Ave.
(at 53rd Street).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Double-decker bus tours: The unlimited ``hop-on and hop-off''
privileges make these tours, offered by several lines, a good way
to get to all the major attractions for one price. We like the big
red double-decker buses of New York Apple Tours that take riders
from Harlem to the Statue of Liberty to Brooklyn. With one ticket
($39, $22 children under 12), you can get on and off at 65
attractions over two days and take a night tour. Buy tickets at the
Visitor Information Center at Eighth Avenue and 53rd Street or at
most hotels. 1-800-876-9868.

   BRITISH-AMERICA (Undated) _ Much has been made of the fact that
British culture has of late been flooding these shores with almost
colonial aplomb. Just look at Broadway and British film. Paranoia
sets in quickly: everywhere one looks there are Young British
Artists or old British television programs or new British plays.
But despite all the hemming and hawing about the Anglofication of
American life, very few cultural connoisseurs have bothered trying
out all these dandy English imports. I, on the other hand, did. My
mission was simple: to immerse myself during a mere 48 hours in all
things British, from food and drink (with an emphasis,
understandably, on the latter) to sports and sounds to theater and
art. It would take Bondian endurance (as in Bondian, James
Bondian), but I felt up to snuff. By Jesse McKinley.

   APPLES-VIRGINIA (Norfolk, Va.) _ Hampton Roads, the natural

Chesapeake Bay, has had a balcony seat for history. Hampton Roads _
composed, for our purposes, of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth,
Virginia Beach, Hampton and Newport News, plus the towns of
Jamestown, Yorktown and Williamsburg _ has long since overtaken
Richmond as a metropolitan area. Its population now exceeds 1.5
million, roughly a quarter of the state's total, and Virginia
Beach, of all unlikely places, is the Old Dominion's largest city,

   BIOTECH-EVOLUION (Seatte) _ A child born today stands a good
chance of living into the 22nd century. As futuristic as it sounds,
it's a reality. And it's owed, in part, to a revolution in medical
drug discovery that has taken place over the plast 20 years. That
revolution hasn't happened in big pharmaceutical companies. It has
taken a new type of organization _ one that combines academic
curiosity with entrepreneurial drive, creative thinking and quick
reaction times to make it happen. And it's given rise to a whole
new business sector: The biotechnology industry. MAIN BAR.

   BIOTECH-PATIENT (Seattle) _ Several biotech companies, including
Immunex Corp. in Seattle, and Cypress Bioscience Inc., have
developed novel new approaches to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which
affects about 2.5 million in the United States and can be a
crippling, even fatal, disease. Their approaches to treat the
disease are based on a new understanding of how the body turns on
its own tissues. For Lisa Caswell, whose rheumatoid arthritis was
particularly aggressive, participating in clinical trials to test
some of these new arthritis therapies has made a huge difference in
her quality of life.

   BIOTECH-GENOME (Seattle) _ Behind the hoopla about genes,
biotechnology and the coming revolution in medicine, is a
labor-intensive, massive and contentious scientific effort that is
building the foundation for all the hopes and promises. It's called
the Human Genome Project. And the goal is to identify the 100,000
or so genes that reside somewhere within the 3 billion ``letters''

 &HT;    CUBA-RUSSIA DEAL TO BUILD NUCLEAR PLANT IN CUBA DOWNPLAYED BY
SKEPTICS
 &HT;    With JURAGUA-TIMELINE-$ADV22.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., May 22 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Cuba watchers, it has become a familiar pattern:
Cuba and Russia announce a deal to jump-start construction of the
mothballed Juragua nuclear power plant on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Then, due to prohibitive costs -- it would take an estimated
$650 million to $1 billion to finish the project -- construction
never resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such announcement came May 14, when Cuba and Russia
declared that they had reached agreement on forming a joint venture
to complete the plant and its first reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was part of a trade deal that allows Cuba to swap
its sugar for Russia's oil.
</P>
<P>
   But similar declarations have been made before -- perhaps four
times in seven years -- leading experts on the project to downplay
its significance, as well as reiterate their insistence that the
plant will likely never be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is meaningless,'' said Jonathan
Benjamin-Alvarado, a University of Georgia professor writing a book
on the Juragua (pronounced ``HUR-ra-gwa'') project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing more than two very poor and economically
strangled countries trying to consummate an agreement that is
mostly hollow and fiction,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the signing of such agreements has become almost as
reliable as Christmas, although no progress has ever been made in
arranging actual financing.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the plant was launched in 1982 with the hopes of
alleviating the chronic electricity shortages that still plague
many parts of Cuba. But construction stalled 10 years later with
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main benefactor, after
more than $1 billion had been pumped into it.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Cuban officials announce that work will resume,
but even Cuban President Fidel Castro said last year that prospects
for the project looked bleak, and that Cuba would start searching
for alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado said Cuba has recently built small geothermal energy
plants tapping into steam from deep wells to provide reliable
electricity in areas frequented by tourists, such as Varadero,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Juragua project is opposed by U.S. officials -- and
especially conservatives in Congress -- who worry about the
prospects of a Chernobyl-like disaster 240 miles away from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   They say Cuba lacks safety standards and a mature regulatory
body to oversee Juragua, which utilizes old Soviet technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they worry that a leak could spew radiation as far
west as Texas and as far east as Washington, D.C. with the brunt
falling on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Many American nuclear experts, though, say the Juragua plant is
conservatively designed and is safer than Ukraine's ill-fated
Chernobyl plant because it has a containment wall.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential threat has prompted the Pentagon to spend $2
million this year on a radiation-monitoring system to collect air
samples scattered across Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear physicists at Florida State University have spent the
last two months collecting and analyzing air samples. Four other
air-monitoring stations are scheduled to be established in states
along the Gulf of Mexico within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   But experts familiar with the Juragua project say the U.S.
government is wasting its money protecting citizens from something
that doesn't yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan borders on lunacy because no one even knows if the
Juragua plant will ever be finished,'' said Thomas Cochran, a
senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based environmental lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Even a U.S. State Department official told Cox Newspapers this
week that the plan would appear to be a waste of money if its sole
purpose was to monitor radiation from the Juragua plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no evidence that the Juragua project is moving forward
or that any financing is being made available,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who has visited the Juragua plant twice, said that even
if construction resumed today, it would take four to six years to
complete the plant. He said the Pentagon's radiation-monitoring
scheme -- if needed -- could be up and running within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Kemper, the chairman of the FSU physics department, agreed
that a baseline for the project will likely be finished within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the May 14 announcement made by Cuba and
Russia proves the radiation-monitoring project is valuable and must
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really just insurance because we really don't know
what these countries are going to do from one minute to the next,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Darley, spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Defense, said the radiation-monitoring stations are
being established ``out of prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba has always stated an intention to complete the plant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed, though, that no country is in a position to provide
the kind of financing that's needed to finish the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The May 14 agreement was signed by Russian Trade Minister Georgy
Gabuniya and Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Juragua plant, Cuban officials this week
agreed that the lack of financing was a major obstacle to finishing
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish we could work with the Americans on it,'' said Carlos
Fernandez de Cossio of the Foreign Relations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia's Alvarado, who's visited Cuba five
times to research the project, said buildings at the Juragua site
are 70 percent complete, but that the ``instrumentation and
control'' system -- the most important part of the project -- is
only about 20 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be completed but it is difficult to conceive how
anyone would get a return on an investment of this size,'' he said.
``Many international firms from Italy, Spain, Brazil, and France
have taken a look at this project, and walked away.''

   BRITISH-AMERICA (Undated) _ Much has been made of the fact that
British culture has of late been flooding these shores with almost
colonial aplomb. Just look at Broadway and British film. Paranoia
sets in quickly: everywhere one looks there are Young British
Artists or old British television programs or new British plays.
But despite all the hemming and hawing about the Anglofication of
American life, very few cultural connoisseurs have bothered trying
out all these dandy English imports. I, on the other hand, did. My
mission was simple: to immerse myself during a mere 48 hours in all
things British, from food and drink (with an emphasis,
understandably, on the latter) to sports and sounds to theater and
art. It would take Bondian endurance (as in Bondian, James
Bondian), but I felt up to snuff. By Jesse McKinley.

   APPLES-VIRGINIA (Norfolk, Va.) _ Hampton Roads, the natural

Chesapeake Bay, has had a balcony seat for history. Hampton Roads _
composed, for our purposes, of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth,
Virginia Beach, Hampton and Newport News, plus the towns of
Jamestown, Yorktown and Williamsburg _ has long since overtaken
Richmond as a metropolitan area. Its population now exceeds 1.5

 &HT;    SETTLERS SIZE UP ELECTION LOSSES, WHILE LEFT-WINGERS ENVISION
PEACE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHILO, West Bank _ Shmuel Kohen's life might not be as secure as
it seems.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the Israeli settler was in his hilltop
mobile home looking out over olive orchards and a nearby Arab
village. Across the street, Israeli soldiers, who protect the five
families here -- including Kohen's -- were grilling hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, Kohen has made his home in this little group of
trailers a short drive from the established settlement of Shilo, in
territory that Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He is claiming biblical land in preparation for the messiah and
acting as a human buffer between Israel, and the Arabs he believes
would destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this week, in urban Jerusalem just an hour's drive
away, the political leaders of the settler movement were reeling
from wounds inflicted by the very Jews Kohen claims to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was soundly thrashed in
Monday's election by challenger Ehud Barak. It was Netanyahu who
encouraged people like Kohen to stake claims to new hilltops before
they might be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am with the right and we failed,'' says the affable,
28-year-old Kohen, relaxed in his yamulka, side curls and T-shirt.
``It was a big failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the ``failure,'' settler power was growing.
</P>
<P>
   Known for their harsh rhetoric and opposition to peace with the
Arabs, the settlers seemed invulnerable to cries from U.S.
officials and left-wing Israelis that their expansions were
destroying Arab trust in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Their population has been growing by several thousand a year.
Now, there are about 150 settlements in Israel's West Bank and Gaza
with more than 171,000 Jewish occupants. They live in gated
communities similar to those in the suburbs of major U.S. cities,
spread among the 2.5 million Palestinians since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   All this week, Netanyahu's loss reverberated among the settlers
and their allies.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Begin, extreme right-wing leader who opposed any land
handovers, resigned from the parliament. He said he felt like a
``public representative without a public.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinhas Wallerstein gave up his job as the settler movement
leader, admitting that the election-night disaster was partly a
result of the settlers' own designs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, confident they could control the Israeli political
agenda, settler leaders helped topple Netanyahu's government to
punish him for signing the Wye River Memorandum. The Wye accord
continues the Oslo peace process, in which occupied territory in
the West Bank is being handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, any hope that Netanyahu would win the election and come
back reborn to his right-wing ways was dashed when he was
humiliated by Barak, a moderate who pledges to restart the peace
process. Instead, Netanyahu's loss and the domino effect among
settler allies has one expert predicting better chances for a final
compromise with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make it easier, definitely,'' said political scientist
Shmuel Sandler, of Bar-Ilan University. ``Israelis are thinking
about the state, not just some dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a former general who pledges to be tough on security.
His stand on the settlements is vague. He has pledged to let most
settlers stay in place and said he shares their religious
commitment to the biblical land.
</P>
<P>
   On his hill in the West Bank, Kohen takes Barak at his word.
But, settler leaders are typically coarse in their warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have hidden what their actual plans are,'' Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settlers association, Yesha, says of Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the prevailing news images of mass graves in Kosovo,
Tayar defended pre-election accusations that Barak intends to
``ethnically cleanse Jews'' from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Tayar said the settlers will keep expanding with or without his
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that we're in a struggle for our lives
now,'' she said. ``Anything we can implement now is going to
protect these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts would continue what Peace Now, Israel's largest
peace advocacy group, and U.S. diplomats see as a dangerous trend.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Wye accord, according to Peace Now, at least 20 new
communities have been started on new hilltops. They usually start
with mobile homes, then get water towers, fences and synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli papers have reported that even when the Israeli army,
which controls the area, intended to remove such new settlements,
Netanyahu intervened to stop them. Many thought it was his way of
trying to calm the angry settler movement.
</P>
<P>
   The building of the so-called ``pirate settlements'' goes on
despite that, according to Peace Now, more than 3,700 existing
settlement homes are still vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Now's Didi Remez said Barak must at least enforce the law,
allowing the army to remove settlements that are built without
approval. That, he said, is one of the messages of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements rank very low on the majority of Israelis'
list of priorities,'' he said.

`CLEOPATRA' FAILS TO CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE QUEEN OF
EGYPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more glaring failings of arts criticism is the news
media's follow-the-leader weakness in covering singular
entertainment projects as ``events.'' Take ``Star Wars.'' Its
overblown hype made the actual movie utterly irrelevant, nothing
more than the final hit of a grand marketing sting.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Cleopatra,'' the much-hyped, highly bankrolled
miniseries airing Sunday and Monday on ABC, doesn't deserve the
prized space it occupies in this newspaper. But here it is, front
and center, big and bold.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the shame of it. Because in four hours and at a cost
of more than $30 million, ``Cleopatra'' manages to titillate
viewers but hardly illuminate the portrait of the queen of Egypt,
whose life story is complex, fascinating and deserving of a more
definitive, respectful telling.
</P>
<P>
   I've read where director Franc Roddam (''Moby Dick'') has
assured us that this latest version of ``Cleopatra'' does what a
half-dozen others haven't: paint the queen as ``a more fully
realized woman and leader, a person who effectively uses her power
to better the individual and collective health and welfare of her
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that part was cut out of the review tape mailed to this
office.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Leonor Varela plays Cleopatra as an irresistibly
gorgeous, power-hungry vixen, as did ABC with those endless
promotional teasers showing a naked Varela sprawled across a bed, a
sheet covering her unmentionables just so.
</P>
<P>
   History buffs know that Cleopatra lacked such drop-dead beauty.
It was Shakespeare's writings that shaped her looks for the better.
Cleopatra was known for her intelligence (she was, after all, an
accomplished mathematician), charm, wit, and certainly ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is an interesting life because she was the last ruler in
the dynasty founded by Ptolemy I in 323 B.C. (Ptolemy was a general
in the army of the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great.)
</P>
<P>
   She became queen after the death of her father _ and there's a
question of whether she had him done in. Her 12-year-old brother,
Ptolemy XIII, became her co-ruler and husband, and this is where
``Cleopatra'' jump-starts. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   We see Rome's Julius Caesar (Timothy Dalton) being seduced by
Cleopatra and later encouraged to bring her back to power, knocking
her brother and sister to the curb. He does, but only after the
couple takes a few dips under the sheets. What Caesar didn't know
is that Cleopatra had hired an Egyptian prostitute to teach her not
only the fine art of lovemaking but also to give her a crash course
on the B.C. version of ``The Rules'' in catching powerful studs
with visions of world domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold (Ra man's) interest,'' Cleopatra is told by the
prostitute, ``you must always make him believe, no matter how much
you've given him, there's still much to conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   With Caesar smitten (he's in bed, sleeping off the night
before), Cleopatra has her jailed sister killed. Her brother is
knocked off, too.
</P>
<P>
   From there, ``Cleopatra'' delivers on its teaser promises:
jealousy, rage, back-stabbing, blood, death, battles, scheming,
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. It's ``Melrose Place Goes to Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Roddam directs ``Cleopatra'' from a script by Stephen Harrigan
and Anton Diether, and the vast overhead shots showing the hundreds
of extras _ from horses to Roman warriors _ can be breathless. At
least they pinpoint where the money was spent and establish that
this at least wants to ``look'' like an above-average TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   As for the key performances, Dalton does his usual dance with
the prose, delivering every line as though it's a dying scene.
Varela, who was born in Chile and spent much of her childhood in
Colorado, makes for an exotic Cleopatra. But her performance trails
off when she's asked to do more than purr.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she comes off as more of a spoiled brat than the great
stateswoman depicted in Margaret George's ``The Memoirs of
Cleopatra,'' on which the movie is based. If you get this far,
watch her pout over spending too little time with Caesar, who has
his mind on other things, like conquering every living being.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Zane has the showiest performance as the committed Marc
Antony, who has been maligned in history as a strong ruler who
turned into Cleopatra's helpless puppet.
</P>
<P>
   Several historical truths are skipped for the sake of moving the
story line along. Cleopatra gave birth to twins with Marc Antony.
He left her to marry the sister of his co-ruler, Octavian, for
political reasons. He returned years later and married Cleopatra.
They had another son. In ``Cleopatra,'' Marc Antony and Cleopatra
die as lovers and failed rulers, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the killing, there are no emotional beats in
``Cleopatra,'' nothing that stays with you for the long haul. What
producers Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi Jr. have done is make a
lavish production with no center.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't surprising. Because of Cleopatra's historical
legacy, no one can get past the more lurid details of her life.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, does it make for steamy promotions.
</P>

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON LEADERSHIP, NOT POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 23)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its early stages the first presidential campaign
of the 21st century resembles the classic Bud Abbott-Lou Costello
``who's on first'' comedy routine that became part of American
folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Like the comedians' hilarious debate over the positioning of
baseball players, discussion of the campaign too often dwells on
how the candidates are faring in the political process rather than
on the qualifications of the two Democrats and 11 Republicans who
aspire to the office.
</P>
<P>
   In our obsession with where the candidates stand in the public
opinion polls we tend to focus on personality and popularity rather
than leadership and character. The problem is especially acute with
commercial television because the nightly news is far more inclined
to spotlight the latest poll results than the substantive comments
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Polls undoubtedly are important to candidates and their
supporters, but the individual who is elected in November 2000
faces a far greater task than worrying about polls. He or she must
lead the world's most powerful nation through perilous times.
</P>
<P>
   To the contenders, the battle for the Democratic and Republican
presidential nominations is serious business. Most have proposed
policies on public issues _ Al Gore and Lamar Alexander on
education, John McCain on Kosovo, Elizabeth Dole on gun control,
Bill Bradley on race relations, Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes on tax
reduction and Social Security reform, Patrick Buchanan on a retreat
from globalism and Dan Quayle and most of the other Republicans on
family values, including efforts to ban abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But to many voters and journalists, who read great meaning into
early polling results, the campaign at this early stage is a game
of chance in which there will be winners and losers just as there
are in the Super Bowl and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The time undoubtedly will come when all of us begin to ponder
the character, courage, talent, steadfastness and credibility of
each of the contenders. We also need to understand that a president
should be flexible enough to abandon bad policies for good.
</P>
<P>
   We still have more than a year to go before the Democrats
convene in Los Angeles and the Republicans in Philadelphia. But if
the pattern of recent years prevails, both parties will have
selected their nominees in primary elections long before convention
time.
</P>
<P>
   So far as we know, none of the contenders has indulged in the
kind of abysmal personal behavior that we associate with Bill
Clinton. Yet in some ways, Clinton has been quite successful.
Working with outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and leaders of Congress, he has
presided over a phenomenally successful economy. Using his veto or
threat of veto, he has kept spending in line, while joining the
Republican Congress in approving welfare reform and other issues
popular in middle America.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has sought protection of Social Security
and Medicare and has moved his party from the left to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what they do about Clinton's personal life, voters would
probably not reelect him. But that is an option barred by the 22nd
Amendment, which limits a president to two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is possible, after the revelations about Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky and months of impeachment turmoil, that voters
could favor candidates more because of their private behavior than
their public positions.
</P>
<P>
   It is normal for voters to want their president to have led an
impeccably clean life before entering the White House. But that
does not make the individual a good president.
</P>
<P>
   A president wears many hats _ commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, strategist and spokesman for America's position in the
world, leader of a political party, promulgator of domestic policy,
symbol of American democracy and presumably an image for young
people to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, Harry Truman wrote: ``No one who has not had the
responsibility can really understand what it is like to be
president, not even his closest friends or members of his immediate
family. There is no end to the chain of responsibility that binds
him, and he is never allowed to forget that he is president.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the office has often been filled with men who were not up to
that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever would have suggested that Calvin Coolidge was untrue
to his wife or that he was a poor father to his sons. He was a man
who practiced thrift and, so far as is known, led a clean life.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a weak president who spent much of his time napping,
and he refused to recognize dangers on the economic horizon.
</P>
<P>
   During Coolidge's presidency, Herbert Hoover, as commerce
secretary, was the living symbol of the prosperity created by the
free enterprise system in the 1920s and of a decent private life.
Having headed the U.S. effort to feed starving Europeans after
World War I, he was greatly admired.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after he became president in 1929 the stock market
crashed precipitously and Hoover could not accept the fact that
government intervention was needed to the save the economy. He
served but one term.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson offered a bit of wisdom that should be kept in
mind when we choose a new president: ``The president is at liberty,
in both law and conscience, to be as big a man as he can. His
capacity will set the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the presidency is about. That is what Washington,
Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Truman, Reagan and the two
Roosevelts were about.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Philosophers, physicians, psychologists and poets have struggled
for centuries to fathom obsessive love. So it is probably hopeless
in the presence of ``Trekkies'' to do anything but sit back _
amused, bemused and astonished _ and watch the devotions of fans of
the various incarnations of ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trekkies,'' directed and edited by Roger Nygard, is a
disarming documentary that takes a good-natured look at the hold
that the 1966 television series and its sequels and film
incarnations exert over millions of fans. And perhaps only Diogenes
the cynic would care to note that this wide-eyed production arrives
courtesy of Paramount Pictures, home of the lucrative film
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although historians have observed that the original ``Star
Trek,'' Gene Roddenberry's saga of the adventures of Capt. James T.
Kirk and his crew aboard the starship Enterprise among the Klingons
and Romulans and other alien life in space in the 23d century, was
less than a smashing success on NBC from 1966 to 1969, its reruns
and growing fan base turned it into a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And as ``Trekkies'' documents, these fans include grown-ups and
their families and cats and dogs who duly wear their Starfleet
uniforms. An Orlando, Fla., dentist and his staff carry out their
duties in uniform in an office decorated in a ``Star Trek'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   A woman chosen for the Whitewater jury wore her costume to court
in Little Rock, Ark., as she does to work. A bright 14-year-old boy
from Bakersfield, Calif., has attended at least 28 ``Star Trek''
conventions, one of the gatherings said to take place somewhere
every weekend of the year. A Sunday night radio program called
``Talk Trek and Beyond,'' out of Sunland, Calif., lays claim to 2.5
million listeners.
</P>
<P>
   People take Klingon language courses, and Klingon-language
versions of the Bible and ``Hamlet'' are said to be in preparation.
Devotees bid avidly at auctions for Klingon headpieces and other
memorabilia and souvenirs. And fans will debate the difference
between a Trekkie and a Trekker, the former said to be an earlier
designation of a fan, the latter said to connote serious fandom.
</P>
<P>
   With Denise Crosby _ Lt. Tasha Yar of television's ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation'' _ as chief guide to this alien culture,
``Trekkies'' naturally trots out many ``Star Trek'' stars.
</P>
<P>
   These include everybody from William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy,
James Doohan, DeForest Kelley, Walter Koenig, George Takei,
Nichelle Nichols and Grace Lee Whitney of the original crew to
LeVar Burton and Jonathan Frakes of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' and Kate Mulgrew and Ethan Phillips of ``Star Trek:
Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   Tales are told of depressed and suicidal fans whose lives were
saved by the concern of cast members, and lives of accomplishment
in science inspired by the television series and films, and, of
course, the careers of actors shaped ineradicably by ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, your magic spell is everywhere.

FOX TO WADE DEEPER INTO SEX AND VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making more changes than any other network and reaching for
programs deliberately aimed at breaking new ground in terms of sex,
language and violence, Fox announced a fall television schedule
Thursday with eight new series, including a reshaped, half-hour
version of ``Ally McBeal'' that will play the night after the hour
version.
</P>
<P>
   The show (Tuesdays at 8) will consist essentially of old
episodes of the series edited down to a half-hour. It is part of a
growing trend in which networks reuse programs in the same week as
a way of cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will also add a new comedy, ``Action'' (Thursday at 9:30),
that will overtly use many of the words that have not previously
been used on network television but will bleep the actual sound.
The show is about a producer of action movies who is an egomaniac.
It stars Jay Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of ``Harsh Realm'' (Friday at 9), a new drama from
Chris Carter, the creator of ``The X-Files,'' includes as heavy a
quotient of violence as any show ever made, though Fox executives
have promised the series will tone the violence down.
</P>
<P>
   The show is about an elaborate government virtual-reality game
and a former American military officer's efforts to solve it and
stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   The network also has its own version of the high school shows
that are a dominant trend for the coming season, but with
``Manchester Prep'' (Thursday at 8), a spinoff of the film ``Cruel
Intentions,'' which was itself a teen-age take on the film
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' Fox is emphasizing a much darker, sexually
promiscuous side of teen-age relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, Fox has a family show,
``Malcolm in the Middle'' (Sunday at 7), which will aim more for
sweetness than spice as a family deals with the discovery that
their 9-year-old son _ their middle child _ is a genius.
</P>
<P>
   The network has a spinoff of its successful drama ``Party of
Five'' in the show ``Time of Your Life,'' (Monday at 8) in which
the character played by Jennifer Love Hewitt runs away to New York
City to search for her birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   Another family show, ``Get Real'' (Wednesday at 9), fits the new
trend toward hourlong shows more based in comedy than drama. The
family in the show experiences an unending series of crises, like
car accidents, a teen-ager's refusal to go to college, a child
being beaten up by bullies, but all are handled in comic fashion.
It stars Debrah Farentino as a decidedly young mother of this
brood.
</P>
<P>
   The final Fox drama is another show that bucks the current trend
away from violence. ``Ryan Caulfield'' (Fridays at 8) is about a
young man who stuns his friends by becoming a police officer
instead of going to college. He experiences the hard world of
police work, including a first case involving a gruesome murder
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is rebuilding every night of the week but Saturday. Among
the shows it is dropping are ``Millennium,'' ``World's Funniest''
and ``The PJ's,'' though Fox promised the latter would be back
later this season.
</P>
<P>
   The network resolved its dilemma about which animated show to
pair with ``The Simpsons'' by giving the 8:30 Sunday slot to
``Futurama'' and moving ``Family Guy'' to Thursday, where it will
be paired with ``Action'' in a direct attempt to pull male viewers
away from NBC's long-time comedy stronghold. The Fox schedule:

`LOVE LETTER' DELIVERS GENTLE ALTERNATIVE FOR MOVIE-GOERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is so obvious that you have to ask it, and so
obvious that you don't want to ask it. It's the question for anyone
involved in ``The Love Letter,'' the new romantic comedy opening
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you out of your mind, opening two days after `Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,' perhaps the most hyped movie in
history?''
</P>
<P>
   So you don't ask. Instead, you ask Kate Capshaw, who stars in
and co-produced ``The Love Letter,'' if she's sick of hearing the
question. And, with mild surprise, you learn that the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was not Capshaw's idea to schedule her $8 million movie
in direct competition with a monolith. The movie studio,
DreamWorks, which was co-founded by Capshaw's husband, Steven
Spielberg, came up with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they sat down with us to tell us that in fact it was
going to be summertime and that it would be May 21, we all felt
really, really great,'' said Capshaw, a Fort Worth native. ``And
then they said, `It's the same weekend as `Star Wars.' '' And we
all started laughing, because we thought that that was the joke,
that they were going to open this tiny $8 million movie with `Star
Wars.' And they weren't laughing, so we stopped laughing and they
said, `No, we're very serious.' And we all sat down and our hearts
were racing because, of course, this is our baby and we felt like,
`Oh my God, where's the life jacket?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives gave Capshaw and co-producers Sarah Pillsbury
and Midge Sanford time to sleep on it. ``We all called each other
from our cars,'' Capshaw continues, ``and the next morning we
called each other from breakfast and said, `You know what? What the
heck _ let's get behind this. This is interesting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like folly, but a similar strategy worked when
``Phenomenon'' aimed its slingshot at the cinematic Goliath
``Independence Day'' in 1996. The small-scale romantic drama became
a hit even as ``Independence Day'' became a blockbuster, proving
that there was room for both at the multiplex. But, as Capshaw
points out, ``Phenomenon'' had John Travolta. ``The Love Letter''
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Letter'' does have is Capshaw as Helen MacFarquhar, a
bookstore owner in a New England town whose life takes a turn when
she discovers an anonymous love note. Believing the letter is for
her, Helen becomes open to a fling with the much younger Johnny
(Tom Everett Scott) _ who thinks that Helen wrote the letter for
him. Helen's co-worker, played by Ellen DeGeneres, also thinks the
letter is for her, and Tom Selleck plays a shyly shambling
firefighter who doesn't know about the letter but is trying to work
up the guts to tell Helen about the torch he's carried for her
since high school.
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw was the driving force behind the movie, which is based
on Cathleen Schine's novel. The actress bought the book after
reading a positive New York Times review and decided before she
finished it that she wanted to make the movie version and be in it.
In the early stages, though, she kept Spielberg out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved so quickly and didn't tell my husband because I was
afraid that he would stop me,'' she says. ``You know that thing of,
you know you have to do something, so instead of telling anybody
who might talk you out of it, you just go do it? And that's how I
proceeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she teamed with Pillsbury and Sanford, who produced
``How to Make an American Quilt,'' an ensemble piece featuring
Capshaw. Spielberg and DreamWorks came on board late in the game,
when Spielberg became curious about what his wife was working on
and asked that his studio be given a crack at the movie. Although
producing was new to Capshaw, she had absorbed enough from watching
her husband work, and had experienced enough partners, that making
the movie was a pleasurable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a girl from Texas. Or sort of from Texas; she was
born at Carswell Air Force Base but left for St. Louis when she was
5 or 6. If you had asked her father, though, there was no ``sort
of'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the Air Force; he fell in love with Texas,'' says
Capshaw, who was born Kathleen Sue Nail. ``The whole time I was
growing up in Missouri, that's all I heard about, was Texas. And he
would tell me, `You are from Texas. Don't tell anybody you're from
Missouri. You're from Texas.' And he was not from Texas; he was a
farm boy from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he loved the horses and the cowboys and the ranch
mentality and country-western music. He wore cowboy boots the
entire time I was growing up. Now, in Texas, that is so natural to
see people in cowboy hats and boots that you wouldn't blink an eye.
But in Missouri, in the suburbs of St. Louis, he was the only
father with a cowboy hat on, and cowboy boots on, and the yoked
jacket and the yoked pants. We used to get the country-western
catalogs, and I would hide them. I was so embarrassed that my
father dressed this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Capshaw's father, Edwin Nail, died in December at 65 after
living a quiet existence in Hurst that showed little signs that he
was Capshaw's dad or Spielberg's father-in-law. He had worked 38
years at American Airlines, and Capshaw and Spielberg quietly
attended his funeral in Colleyville.
</P>
<P>
   But then, most of Capshaw's visits were quiet. She visited her
father in Hurst about once a year, until her blended family of
seven children made travel more difficult, and Nail began traveling
to visit her. But work has brought Capshaw to Texas, most recently
with 1997's melodrama ``The Locusts,'' shot in Rosenberg outside
Houston. And although Capshaw left when she was still a child, she
sounds just like a Texan when she talks about the filming:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hot in Texas in August,'' she says. ``But it's
sooo beautiful. Just beautiful.''

`LOVE LETTER' SENDS MIXED SIGNALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie couldn't be filled with a nicer group of people than the
characters in this film adaptation of Cathleen Schine's novel,
``The Love Letter.'' It follows the waves caused when an anonymous
love letter, filled with ever so slightly lavender prose, makes its
way through a small New England town. (''Do you know how in love
with you am I? Did I trip? Did I stumble? Lose my balance, graze my
knee ... graze my heart?'' the letter begins.) The novel played on
the idea of small-towners who know everything about each other
being rocked by this unsigned note, as well as the ripples of
confusion, delight and despair it sends through the burg's
residents.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a movie about people who are unable to tell others
what they really want until prodded by the letter, which nudges the
plot into motion. Helen (Kate Capshaw) keeps her emotions in a
pincers-like grip. That is, until she discovers the letter, and
slowly the walls of her resolve crumble. Capshaw's willfulness
probably led to the movie getting made, and it shows in her
portrayal of Helen. Her depiction offers a single-mindedness more
heated than the rest of the cast's. Her ambition crashes headlong
into director Peter Ho-Sun Chan's controlled handling, which mixes
the wistful with the humid. ``Love Letter's'' rhythms don't quite
feel like his.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is precise but lacks the knockabout underpinnings of
his Hong Kong work, several of which are romantic comedies that toy
with traditional gender roles (e.g., ``He's a Woman, She's a Man''
and ``Tom, Dick and Hairy''). It's as if the edges have been buffed
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letter's'' cast includes Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the
youngster whose blood is riled up by Helen's chin-up independence.
Tom Selleck is George, the decent, divorce-bruised pal who wants to
be more than pals. Ellen DeGeneres brings her worried eyes to the
role of Helen's best friend, who's briefly caught up in the
romantic undertow. Julianne Nicholson is an utter goofy delight as
the intense feminist coed whose ideals are tossed into a blender
when she falls for Johnny. (When she shears her hair after a
romantic stumble, her smooth, round head makes her look like a
naked chick right out of the shell _ and she still seems
shell-shocked.) And Blythe Danner plays Helen's troubled mother _
the kind of low-comedy, highly stylized role that's become her
stock in trade these days _ even though there can't be much more
than a 10-year age difference between her and Capshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its source material, ``Letter'' also seems to take its
lead from the 1985 comedy ``Secret Admirer'' (this device has been
used in other films, too). ``Admirer'' is worth seeking out for the
hilarious performance by Fred Ward as a territorial cop who's eager
to prowl after receiving an anonymous note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admirer'' has a raucous streak that ``Letter'' could've used.
``The Love Letter'' is so mild and muted that it also could have
used some of the melancholy '60s pop of the ``Rushmore'' soundtrack
instead of the jaunty, jazzy standards we hear played. It has an
autumnal bittersweetness _ right down to the turtlenecks that
Capshaw sports. Problem is, the movie's set in summer and
supposedly floats on the warm winds of summer romance. It just
can't make up its mind.

`FROGS FOR SNAKES': RECYCLED `PULP' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino has already blasted himself a niche in cinema
history, but his full impact on the gross national product may not
be measurable until the last of his filmmaking disciples has
exorcised the demon that impels them to imitate ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest of these bloody black comedies is ``Frogs for
Snakes,'' written and directed by Amos Poe. It tells the story of a
group of lower Manhattan lowlifes circulating in the malign milieu
of a corpulent loan shark who also happens to be a bit of a
theatrical impresario. And all of his associates, lovers,
ex-lovers, children and their friends yearn seriously to act.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the joke that is repeated throughout the film: for all
of these people, killing or maiming is simply business. What really
stirs their blood is the thought that someone else in this circle
might get a part they covet or have the gall to choose a monologue
in an audition or acting class that they regard as theirs. These
are people who would literally kill for a role.
</P>
<P>
   Poe has assembled a fine cast, led by Barbara Hershey as Eva,
and including people like John Leguizamo, Robbie Coltrane, Justin
Theroux, Ron Perlman, Harry Hamlin, Debi Mazar and Lisa Marie. But
in the end, after the oral sex monologue and the bouncing
shotgunned head and the gallons of blood and the diner that have
their ``Pulp Fiction'' counterparts, ``Frogs for Snakes'' remains
derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Although surely not for delicate sensibilities, the film
nonetheless maintains a consistent sense of macabre humor and
delivers vivid performances. Ms. Hershey as the ex-wife of Al
(Coltrane), the mother of their little boy, a sometime hit woman
and occasional waitress, is the best actor of the lot but eager to
escape to a better life. ``I don't kill people,'' she says to one
of her targets. ``I maim them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her determination is intensified after her lover, Zip
(Leguizamo), is gunned down by Al's wheel man, U.B. (David
Deblinger), whose zeal is heightened by his desire for a role in
Al's next production, David Mamet's ``American Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frogs for Snakes'' begins intriguingly, but thereafter it is
mostly recycled ``Pulp.''

MET OPERA ASSOCIATION NAMES PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul M. Montrone was elected president and chief executive
officer of the Metropolitan Opera Association at its annual meeting
Thursday. The association oversees the company's financial affairs,
and although it has no direct artistic input, it is responsible for
hiring both the general manager and the artistic director. The term
of office is one year, with no term limit.
</P>
<P>
   Montrone, 58, succeeds Bruce Crawford, 70, who was elected
honorary chairman. Crawford was president of the association in
1984 and 1985 and general manager of the Met from 1985 to 1989. He
has been president since he was re-elected to that post in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure the company appointed Joseph Volpe as its
general manager and installed Met Titles, a system that provides
English translations on seat-back screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real strength of the Met today is a combination of
artistic achievement and financial wherewithal, and today we're
standing strong in both areas,'' Montrone said Thursday. ``My job
will be to maintain that momentum. None of this happens by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a budget of $170 million, of which we raise about $70
million in contributions, with almost nothing from the government.
So we have a large job to be done each year, and to do it, we have
an active board that is a mosaic of people from various fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Montrone joined the Met's advisory board in 1986 and its
managing board in 1991. He has been a member of the executive
committee since 1992. He is the president and chief executive
officer of Fisher Scientific International Inc., which supplies
products and services to research and clinical laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Scranton, Pa., he graduated from the University of
Scranton in 1962 and later earned a doctorate in economics and
finance from Columbia University. He began his career as a systems
analyst in the office of Robert S. McNamara when he was Defense
secretary.

 &HT;    Waking up with Gurvir
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She greets me in her bathrobe. Her white bathrobe.
It's early, OK? Really early: 3:25 a.m. The only house lights
glowing on this leafy Decatur (GA.) street this pitch-black morning
are hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually get up 3:15, 3:30,'' says Gurvir Dhindsa, winning
co-host of WAGA's ``Good Day Atlanta,'' the locally produced
wake-up call (6-9 a.m.) that runs a close ratings race in metro
Atlanta with ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
(Third place overall during the last sweeps rating period, ``Good
Day'' tied with ``Today'' for first in the coveted
18-to-49-year-old age group.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up a little earlier today because of you,'' she adds,
already showered. ``Want a cup of coffee?''
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa, 37, is a little thing, with big eyes and a wide smile
framed by short, dark hair. A small-screen, local-news knockoff of
Audrey Hepburn _ if Hepburn had been born in India. Dhindsa says
people often look at her and don't know what to think: Hispanic,
mixed. She left India at age 7 and grew up mostly in Nashville;
she's always ``fixin' '' to do stuff. A news director in
Mississippi once suggested that maybe she should change her name,
to something a little more . . . understandable. Dhindsa (it's
pronounced Gur-veer DIN-za) declined.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move. While Katie Couric on ``Today'' and Diane Sawyer on
``GMA'' wage a high-profile battle for morning network viewers,
Dhindsa plays a version of the same game _ but in the role of clear
local alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Day'' began as an hourlong alternative in 1992 when WAGA
decided it could do a better job in the morning than CBS, then its
network parent (it's now Fox). The show worked, flourishing with
hosts Amanda Davis and Paul Ossmann. By 1994, ``Good Day'' topped
both ``GMA'' and ``Today'' in local ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But the show lost ground after the 1996 Olympics, and a year
later Davis moved to the evening news. ``Good Day'' floundered
until Dhindsa arrived, in June 1997. Though Ossmann eventually left
for local rival WXIA, the show has regained about 40,000 viewers
since Dhindsa arrived, many attracted to an on-air presence that's
at once uncommon and approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's exotic because she doesn't look like anyone else on
TV,'' says Don Fitzpatrick, a San Francisco-based TV news
consultant. ``She's not a typical white female. And she's not a
black female. And she doesn't have a name that's spelled and sounds
like everyone else's.'' Adds Ossman, now a WXIA weatherman and
``Peachtree Morning'' co-host: ``She's not going to blow you over
with big hair and jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 3:30 now. Dhindsa, still in her bathrobe, leaves to get
coffee. Two Australian shepherds follow her.
</P>
<P>
   A chance to snoop. Framed pictures are everywhere in a quaint,
crowded living room: lots of relatives; a black-and-white of her
mother and father (wearing a turban), soon after their arranged
marriage; a 6-year-old Gurvir, her dark eyes swallowing even more
of her face than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Books: Elvis, photojournalism, Robert Kennedy, D-Day, CNN, a
pictoral history of westerns. The fiction tends toward the florid:
``From Here to Eternity,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' a pile of John
Grishams.
</P>
<P>
   CDs litter the armoire around a blinking TV: Gladys Knight,
Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett (``I love Texans,'' she says), Cole
Porter, Willie Nelson (``Heard his new one? Amazing''), Sinatra's
``Best of the Columbia Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa arrives with the coffee. Sees me snooping. Couldn't care
less. Grabs a remote. Flips to ``CBS Overnight,'' CNN, back to
``Overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a news junkie,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's 3:45. She's still in that bathrobe. She hates to get
dressed. She'd wear jeans every day if she could. The bosses keep
steering her toward bright colors. It's a morning show. People like
it bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gravitate toward black,'' she says. ``My tendency is to grab
the first black jacket in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   She heads into her bedroom. Another opportunity to nose around.
An Emily Post wedding book on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa is getting married for the first time on Nov. 13, to
George Phillips, former U.S. attorney in Mississippi. Pictures of
him in the living room, her bedroom (snooped there earlier). Twelve
years her senior, he's as much cowboy as counselor: When not
working as legal counsel for U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, he's all boots
and dogs and pickup trucks. He lives on a farm outside Hattiesburg
with 27 horses, spends time at a mountain cabin in Colorado, where
the two hope one day to settle. They've dated for almost eight
years, having met when Dhindsa covered a big murder trial that
Phillips prosecuted in Biloxi, where she reported and anchored for
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa comes out of her bedroom in a bright blue suit. Pats the
dogs goodbye (``I hate leaving the doggies''), grabs her coffee, a
makeup bag, piles into her car. The station is 10 minutes away. She
turns on news radio, mmm-hmm-ing after each report (President
Clinton held in contempt: ``Mmm-hmm'').
</P>
<P>
   She comes to a red light. Stops. Looks left, looks right. Looks
left again. Steps lightly on the gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't tell anyone I ran a red light, will you?'' she says
as the car glides across an empty North Decatur Road. ``I look both
ways, but at 4 a.m. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   `What you see is what you get'
</P>
<P>
   She is sort of Atlanta's Katie Couric: a smart, likable, morning
picker-upper who, like a hometown version of the ``Today'' co-host,
can bring you the latest school tragedy right along with the latest
spring fashions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Couric, Dhindsa squirms a bit at being called ``perky'';
she also squirms at comparisons to Couric, whom she considers
sometimes ``mean-spirited.'' But, as with Couric, there's an
unmistakable . . . perkiness about Dhindsa that's attractive
exactly because it stops just short of going over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morning TV is very tricky: You can't be too up, so you give
people a headache, and you can't be so laid-back that you don't
wake them up,'' explains John Kukla, WAGA creative services
director. ``It has to be a natural enthusiasm. You have to have the
talent to talk to Bonnie Blair when she brings on her baby, and
then say, `By the way, 15 people were killed at Columbine.' You
have to have news credibility, then turn around and do the Dirty
Bird, and people don't feel like it's fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa sums herself up: ``I'm not the best-looking anchor, and
I'm not the best reporter. I think my strength is, what you see is
what you get. Doing a morning show leaves you vulnerable _ you
don't have that anchor desk as a buffer between you and the viewer.
It exposes your strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   She finishes: ``I am who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a little more complicated than that. While her on-air
personality is only a slightly revved-up version of what she's like
off the air _ Dhindsa is one of those people you meet and you like
_ she's not always what she might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People meet her with a certain set of assumptions, then have
to put them aside,'' says Sidmel Estes-Sumpter, ``Good Day
Atlanta's'' executive producer. ``People wouldn't assume that,
being Indian, she really is Southern _ (but) she was raised in the
Deep South, and has lived in a deeper South than most Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume she's a woman of color and expect her to enjoy a
certain kind of music, and to be familiar with issues that affect
women of color,'' Estes-Sumpter adds. ``But she's a country gal who
enjoys living in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa isn't so easy to pinpoint on the air, either. Set within
the show's ceaselessly upbeat, welcome-to-our-living-room format,
it's easy to take her lightly. But after chatting up Jane Fonda for
two minutes about teenage pregnancy, Dhindsa turned the
conversation to husband Ted Turner, who had recently angered
Polish-American Catholics with some shoot-from-the-hip comments.
Fonda stewed, saying she should have expected a question like that
from a Fox station. When Evander Holyfield came on to talk about a
children's charity, Dhindsa asked him about his own out-of-wedlock
paternity problems. The boxing champ was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``She combines a genuine warmth with an intensity on top of
that,'' says Marc Bailey, Dhindsa's ``Good Day'' co-host. ``That
intensity says, `Don't be mistaken by the fact I'm being warm and
open here _ don't try to snow me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Says Dhindsa: ``I think I'm nice. But I have a real competitive
edge. Don't get in my way.''

<P>
   ATLANTA: in my way.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheltered childhood
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa didn't always think she was cut out for television. The
oldest of three daughters born to what she describes as loving but
overprotective immigrant parents, working in TV news seemed a
million miles away. Her father once retrieved her from a movie
theater where she'd gone to see a Saturday matinee with a
minister's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up very sheltered,'' she says of an upbringing that
began in India, then wound through Oregon and Alabama before
settling in Nashville. ``I grew up with nice people _ my parents
were nice, my parents' friends were nice. People in TV news were
aggressive, cutthroat.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes her first job, behind the scenes at a Nashville TV
station, as ``traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People were cursing, shouting. I thought, `What have I gotten
myself into?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But the news hound in me comes from my father,'' she says of
Harbans Dhindsa, a principal at the Tennessee School for the Blind.
``He watched Walter Cronkite every night. To this day, I won't
watch anything but the `CBS Evening News.' My father encouraged me
to go into journalism. I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbans and Dev Dhindsa were both teachers in India. Harbans'
focus was special education, and he saw greater opportunity in the
United States, where his brother had moved.
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa recalls her culture shock when she landed in Portland,
Ore., with her mother, who arrived in America with $40.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I rode in a car,'' she says of the drive with her
uncle from the airport to his house. The first time her father got
a haircut, the whole family trooped with him to the barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the car and cried,'' she remembers. ``I thought he
wasn't going to be my father anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in subsidized housing while Harbans and Dev
alternated going to school for advanced degrees. The Dhindsas then
moved to Talledega, Ala. (``another kind of culture shock,''
Harbans recalls), where the parents worked at the Alabama School
for the Blind and Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later they moved to Nashville. Gurvir was a go-getter,
into drama, the yearbook, forensics, the school paper (but few
movie dates). She majored in mass communications at Middle
Tennessee State University.
</P>
<P>
   Her first reporting job was at a TV station in Jackson, Miss.
``It was where the world was exposed to me,'' she says of the
local-news universe of crime, tragedy and political corruption. She
loved it. When she next saw her parents, they asked, ``What
happened to your softness?''
</P>
<P>
   She was fired after three years in what she calls a ``classic
personality conflict.'' She was hired a day later by well-regarded
WLOX in Biloxi, quickly becoming evening anchor and the face of the
Mississippi coast's TV news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was good, but she turned out to be better than I
thought,'' says WLOX news director Dave Vincent, who hired her.
``You could see it in her eyes. Some people just have an ability to
attract people. When you see it, you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, she seemed better than Biloxi, and it
surprised me she stayed as long as she did,'' Fitzpatrick, the San
Francisco consultant who remembers being impressed with her back
then, says of Dhindsa's nine-year stint in the country's
158th-largest TV market. ``She had major-market qualities. I showed
her tapes to the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa received feelers from major markets: a Boston station, a
fledgling Fox News in New York. But she stayed in Biloxi: She liked
the life there, the station treated her well, she met Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But even all that eventually wasn't enough. She remembers a
drive back from a vacation in Colorado a few years ago when she
turned to Phillips and said, ``I don't want to wake up years from
now and look at you and resent you (because) I regret what I didn't
do with my career. I need to see what I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `Go. Do it. Now's the time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do this forever,'' Dhindsa says of her work. ``Look at
the TV _ this business is hard on women and relationships.
Sometimes I wonder if I chose a career over family and
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the future
</P>
<P>
   We're in the bridal salon at Saks Fifth Avenue. The fitting room
is a hall of mirrors _ a mirror positioned to capture a blushing
bride's every blushing angle. Dhindsa has just slipped on her white
Badgley Mischka strapless gown for a final fitting. She turns this
way, that way. She's a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you love it? Really?'' She stares into the mirrors. ``I
feel like a princess. I really feel like a princess in this dress.
Oh, I love it I love it I love it I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   An attendant offers a pair of Vera Wang shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm-hmm,'' Dhindsa says. She floats one millimeter back down
to earth. ``As far as shoes, I hate to say this, but is it crazy to
wear . . . slippers?''
</P>
<P>
   Heads tilt. Mouths scrunch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are my cowboy boots when I need them?'' she sighs,
taking the Vera Wangs and slipping them on.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later she's back home, in jeans and a flannel shirt,
patting and shooing her dogs in the late afternoon light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have kids,'' she says from the couch, where she
greets the same dog she just sent away. ``I have no consistency. As
soon as they suck up, it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   She's joking, of course. Kids _ and anything else that comes
under the heading of ``future'' _ are very much on her mind these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been stressing out the last two weeks,'' she says,
``thinking I'm never going to be in the same place (as Phillips)
unless I give up the business. It's difficult being in two
different places, not having a feeling of being settled in any one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Phillips see each other almost every weekend; mostly she
makes the six-hour drive to Hattiesburg. He's eligible for
retirement in less than two years, but there's no chance he'd move
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to move here,'' she says. ``It wouldn't be
who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is she? She loves her job, loves the challenge of
filling three hours of live television every morning, loves the
adrenalin rush when things fall apart behind the scenes while she
coolly ad-libs on the air.
</P>
<P>
   She loves Atlanta: loves being a player in a bigger pond, loves
for the first time, after growing up in suburban Nashville, having
Indian friends and feeling . . . Indian. (Her wedding will have two
parts: the one in the gown from Saks will be preceded by a
traditional Indian Sikh ceremony.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to share a common experience,'' she says. ``As an
Indian friend here said, `We all lived in the same house in
different places.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They love her at WAGA, where management sees limitless
potential. But some there also understand the forces faced by a
37-year-old career woman thinking about children and marrying a man
two states away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be making some very difficult life choices, and those
choices will determine her future,'' says Estes-Sumpter, the
executive producer. ``Things like, `What is the true meaning of my
life, and what do I want my life to be?' (Those questions) are
terrible to face sometimes, and only she can decide her fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, her fiance, adds, ``I suspect she'll do just like she
did when she moved (to Atlanta): look at what all her options are,
then pick something that's not only financially beneficial, but
something that keeps that spark in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Have the two discussed family? A pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little,'' he says finally, from a cell phone on his farm,
where the horses he's feeding whinny in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Dhindsa says she'll put off making any decision about her future
for another year, when her three-year contract at WAGA expires.
Until then, she'll keep doing what she likes to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I thought
</P>
<P>
   I wanted Jane Pauley's job,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the best job in America. You get to do
anything. Funny, now I do have Jane Pauley's job _ on a local
level.''

 &HT;    Follow a few simple steps to a quaint stone pathway
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A stone pathway can add a quaint touch to a flower
garden. But if you really want your slice of paradise to offer the
charm of an English cottage garden, fill the gaps between the
stones with creeping plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really plant anything that's low and crawly and see
what works best,'' said Sylvia Attkisson, an Atlanta garden
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Choose plants based on the pathway's exposure to sun or shade
and ones that prefer well-drained soil.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs such as creeping thyme, Corsican mint and golden oregano,
as well as perennials such as dianthus, make ideal choices. They
may look dainty, but they're tough enough that when walked upon,
they bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   They also are rapid spreaders, quickly filling the gaps,
overlapping the stones and making the pathway appear as if it's
been there for years.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about choosing appropriate combinations of plants,
Attkisson said. ``Just have fun with it!''

   Step 1: Inspect the soil. Herbs don't require rich soil, so the
space between the stones may not need amending. If the pathway is
mortared, you can chisel out a few pockets for planting, but be
aware that the soil may be rich in lime because of the concrete. If
so, amend with a soil conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Using a trowel, landscaper Gregg Catchie digs out the
soil to loosen it. If you plan to amend the soil, remove enough to
allow space for the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Plants should be set out so that the tops of their root
balls are level with the stones, Sylvia Attkisson said. If you're
concerned about taller plants, such as creeping rosemary, plant
them along the outer edges of the pathway. Sprinkle soil
conditioner around the plantings once they're in. Pathway plantings
don't require fertilizer because too much growth will cover the
stones.
</P>
<P>
   Finished product: This pathway in Don and Selene Morgan's Ansley
Park garden includes an array of herbs, which when stepped on
release their fragrance. ``The only maintenance is to go out and
pick something for dinner,'' said Attkisson, who designed the
plantings.

 &HT;    Peasant perfect for Summer
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some women may have a hard time reconciling the way major
designers want them to dress this season _ peasant style _ with the
modern, active lifestyles they lead.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are poised on the edge of a new millennium, and
designers are advocating a look spawned during feudal days. The
``peasant'' look was reborn and renamed ``bohemian'' during the
1950s and '60s. And today's version of the look is being touted as
``hippie chic.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days we live under shrouds of conservatism: Who wants
to look like a hippie? And we live in times of unprecedented
prosperity: What's chic about looking like a milkmaid? And in an
age when women still struggle for equal footing in the workplace,
where's the sense in dressing so flagrantly femininely?
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that.
</P>
<P>
   Now's the right time for peasant dressing because, in the summer
especially, there's never a wrong time for the cool comfort of the
lightweight fabrics that peasant styles come in.
</P>
<P>
   After so many seasons of minimalist clothes in neutral tones,
all the color and embroidery and lace and beading attached to
peasant looks comes as a refreshing change. Besides all that,
what's the use of being a woman if you can't dress like one?
</P>
<P>
   Designers flooded the fashion runways with peasant blouses and
skirts, beaded belts and ethnic espadrilles and embroidered slides
because they offered a romantic escape from the restrictive styles
of seasons past. They presented them as an alternative, something
to dabble in, like the ``utility chic'' and geisha-inspired styles
they also dotted their collections with.
</P>
<P>
   Some women may find the buying and wearing of ``hippie chic''
clothes to be habit-forming, but it's best not to plunge into the
trend too deeply. After all, it's only a matter of time before the
major designers want you to start wearing something else.

`THE LOVE LETTER': AN UNSIGNED LETTER SENDS THE SPARKS FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loblolly by the Sea, the jauntily named New England town that is
the setting for ``The Love Letter,'' is the kind of idyllic seaside
retreat that could exist only in a cheery children's folk song or a
yuppie sitcom. The place radiates an alarming perkiness. And for
its first three-quarters, ``The Love Letter,'' which takes place in
the summer, hurtles toward a seemingly inevitable fairy-tale ending
in which its nice middle-class characters all end up snugly coupled
before the first nip of autumn frost.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about this cute-as-a-button screen adaptation of
Cathleen Schine's whimsical romantic novel is that the story ends
up defying expectations. Once its characters have been magically
awakened to the romantic possibilities of their lives by a stray
document, most of them don't end up sharing Nora Ephron moments.
</P>
<P>
   What's not so wonderful about this wisp of a movie, directed by
Peter Ho-sun Chan from a screenplay by Maria Maggenti, is its bland
dialogue and dull sitcom acting. When the movie's over, you are
hard put to remember a single scrap of dialogue beyond a couple of
sour quips from one character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) who
pretty much disappears halfway into the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' revolves around Helen MacFarquhar (Kate
Capshaw), an attractive divorced woman in her 40s who runs a local
bookstore and spends her spare hours jogging. Helen, who fields
irritated phone calls from an ex-husband who complains about having
to pay for everything, lives a life of contented celibacy. Or so
she imagines, until one day she finds a mysterious love letter,
unsigned and addressed to no one, tucked in her mail.
</P>
<P>
   The letter isn't especially steamy, but it is ardent. And
suddenly Helen's erotic imagination, which has been shut down, goes
into overdrive. In Woody Allen-like fantasy sequences, she imagines
everyone in her orbit secretly drooling over her.
</P>
<P>
   One likely possibility is Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), a
20-year-old college student who has a summer job in the bookstore.
Dropping by Helen's for dinner one night, he accidentally discovers
the love letter on the kitchen counter tucked under a bottle of
wine and assumes she deliberately left it there for him to find. By
the end of the evening, each is secretly convinced the other is the
author, and before long the two embark on a passionate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a more age-appropriate suitor, George (Tom Selleck),
who has been in love with Helen since they were in high school
together and who is in the final throes of a divorce, starts
hanging around and wagging his bushy tail.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden blossoming of romantic possibility among these and
several other characters sets up expectations that ``The Love
Letter'' could evolve into the sort of luxuriant rumination on age,
youth and Eros that Eric Rohmer has turned into a cottage industry
in France. But the deeper literary resonances of Ms. Schine's novel
have been so thoroughly bleached out of the film that Helen and
Johnny's May-September relationship has no depth or poignancy.
Beyond her generic snippiness and his generic ingenuousness, these
two are devoid of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Helen's mother (Blythe Danner) and grandmother
(Gloria Stuart) turn up in Loblolly. The new set of relationships
they introduce arrives in the film so late that they've barely
registered before the final credits are rolling. And not a minute
too soon.

`SEASONS' APPEALS TO THE HEART AND THE MIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a certain type of movie that doesn't want to make you
cry yet is steeped in sadness, that doesn't want to make you guess
but is filled with a sense of mystery. In recent years, ``The Sweet
Hereafter'' and ``Affliction'' have fit that description; they're
movies that sink into your heart and linger long after you've seen
them.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that list ``Three Seasons,'' the beautifully melancholy
new film from 26-year-old Vietnamese-American director Tony Bui.
Like the aforementioned films, ``Season'' is strongly literary but
distinctly cinematic, an astute synching of words, pictures and
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seasons,'' the first American film to be shot in Vietnam, is
set in modern-day Saigon. Within the bustling city, which is
dominated by American brand names and symbols (including a cafe
called Apocalypse Now), the movie discovers four interlocking
stories suffused with loss, hope and redemption. A young woman
(Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) picks lotuses for a mysterious master (Tran Manh
Cuong), who finds a bond with her through music. A cyclo, or
bicycle-taxi, driver (Don Duong) falls for a call girl (Zoe Bui). A
street urchin (Nguyen Huu Duoc) searches for his lost case of cheap
merchandise, which he believes has been stolen. And an American war
veteran (Harvey Keitel, who acted as executive producer) sits
quietly in front of his hotel, pensively smoking cigarettes and
becoming engrossed in a search of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel's story, and that of the cyclo driver, are hardly
original, but that makes little difference in this movie's context.
The surprises in these tales, which were written for the screen but
feel as if they were adapted from a short-story anthology, aren't
in the outcomes but in the way Bui lets them envelop you. Although
this is his first feature, he's one of those directors who's
blessed with an instinctive visual sense that can find as much
beauty in a whirring oscillating fan as it can in a rain-drenched
street soccer game or in a shower of rose petals. Cinematographer
Lisa Rinzler (''Menace II Society'') and composer Richard Horowitz
(''The Sheltering Sky'') contribute mightily to the movie's beauty
and mood.
</P>
<P>
   Bui, who was born in Saigon near the end of the Vietnam War and
came to the United States at age 2, tells his stories as
illustrations of the past, of transition, of the present and of the
country's future. But he's not obvious about it, and as a result,
the movie affects you almost subliminally. We are at a time of the
year when most movies want to lead you by the hand, telling you
when to laugh, when to cry or when to duck. And often, we happily
agree to be led. But it's always a welcome sight when you encounter
a movie that trusts you and trusts that you know when to think.

`BESIEGED': A LOVE THAT SOARS ABOVE WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age when televised psychobabble presumes to unlock life's
greatest mysteries, it's easy to forget that love isn't the product
of words and therapeutic negotiation. Civilized relationships are
one thing; the raw force we call love is another.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why ``Besieged,'' Bernardo Bertolucci's new film,
feels so bracingly fresh is that the love that grows between its
two main characters, Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis), a wealthy
expatriate English pianist living in Rome, and his black
housekeeper, Shandurai (Thandie Newton), who has fled an oppressive
African regime, has little to do with words. This is one
contemporary love story in which you won't hear terms like
``boundaries'' and ``narcissistic'' thrown around. You won't even
hear the word ``relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' is a purposefully romantic exploration of the
nonverbal connections between people that can blossom into love.
Filled with rich, glinting images of the world imagined as a
confusingly lovely mosaic, the movie has one of the sparsest
screenplays of any film released this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the feelings that this love story examines are built up more
through music than through talking, and through mysterious deeds,
carried out by one character and observed by the other, that don't
seem to add up. Even after the story ends, a lurking sense of
mystery hovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' opens with a harrowing montage of images from
Shandurai's unidentified African homeland, which is in the throes
of a military coup. As she rides a bicycle toward a one-room
schoolhouse where her husband teaches, posters are slapped upon
buildings of her dilapidated village, and a wizened, gap-toothed
griot hobbles through the rutted streets playing a crude thumb
piano and singing in an anguished wail. Shandurai has nearly
reached the schoolhouse when soldiers barge into her husband's
classroom and drag him away. Subsequent scenes of Shandurai huddled
in bed alone and listening to ominous sounds outside her house
convey a nightmarish terror.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly we are in the Roman villa where Jason, an
eccentric musician with a sweetly goofy smile, feverishly plays the
piano day after day, while Shandurai polishes his artworks and mops
his floors. How and when she got there we are never told. We do
learn that she is using her income as a housekeeper to put herself
through medical school, and that she is an A student. Shandurai has
made one close friend, a fellow student, Agostino (Claudio
Santamaria), who says he wants to sleep with her despite the fact
that he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   As Shandurai discharges her housekeeping duties, the tension
between her and Jason builds. Finally, one afternoon he seizes her
in his arms, confesses that he is hopelessly in love with her and
begs her to marry him. He'll do anything to win her love, he
insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get my husband out of jail,'' she challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned to realize Shandurai is married, Jason apologizes for
his advances.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the rest of the film the two circle each other
warily in Jason's grand four-story villa, which has a spiral
staircase and dumbwaiter. The camera is continually peering at the
characters from odd angles, including many shots from below the
stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   The film pointedly contrasts the music Jason plays on his grand
piano _ everything from Bach to Scriabin (which Shandurai says she
doesn't understand) _ with the lilting African pop of Salif Keita
and Papa Wemba that she plays on the stereo in her room. But when
Jason begins to compose a piece on the piano, the music he writes,
with its hypnotically repetitive figures, suggests that he has
absorbed some of the incantatory spirit of her favorite music.
</P>
<P>
   Shandurai is overjoyed one day to receive a mysterious letter
informing her that her husband has been transferred from a military
prison to an ordinary jail. She also observes her employer meeting
with a local African clergyman. Meanwhile Jason mysteriously begins
to sell off items from the house. First a lavish tapestry is
removed, and eventually his piano itself is lowered into a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' is so determinedly elliptical that its refusal to
be direct seems at times affected and evasive. Its two main
characters, though appealingly played by Thewlis and Ms. Newton
(who gives Shandurai a bursting emotional volatility), never quite
come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, its anti-psychological perspective is so
refreshing that you applaud its creation of two grown-up people who
don't have to be explained by a list of character traits or fit a
personality profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It has nudity and sexual situations.

`SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT': WORTH 1,000 WORDS? MORE LIKE A GAZILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``The Saragossa Manuscript'' was shown as part of the
New York Film Festival in 1997. Following are excerpts from Stephen
Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 27,
1997. The film _ in Polish, with English subtitles _ opens Friday
at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   There comes a point late in Wojciech Has' teasingly labyrinthine
three-hour film, ``The Saragossa Manuscript,'' when so many
phantasmagoric stories have sprouted out of one another in such
rapid succession that the mind begins to reel.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of who did what to whom and which adventures were
charades invented by characters who revel in deceit, and which were
not, begin to blur into a surreal comic vision of a world in which
reality and fantasy are indistinguishable. Or at least they become
so in the mind of the film's genially swashbuckling protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from an early-19th-century novel by the Polish author
Jan Potocki, and set at the end of the Napoleonic era, the movie
follows the travels of Capt. Alphonse van Worden (Zbigniew
Cybulski), a Belgian military officer who is making a
cross-European trip to Madrid but keeps getting sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the heat of battle as Alphonse, who has fled
to a cabin, is mysteriously attracted to a manuscript whose
pictures are so compelling he barely notices when enemy soldiers
arrive to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   When these soldiers become as entranced as Alphonse by the
manuscript, especially by a drawing of two beautiful princesses,
the film dissolves into an ``Arabian Nights''-like journey in which
Alphonse lives out the book's magical, picaresque adventures. They
unfold as a series of dreams from which Alphonse periodically
awakes to find himself wounded on a battlefield heaped with skulls
beside a gallows on which two executed prisoners still hang.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing, he meets two sisters, the princesses Emina (Iga
Cembrzynskza) and Zibelda (Joanna Jedryka), who subject him to a
series of tests of his worthiness to marry them. These trials
suggest a goofy, sprawling, all-purpose allegory so overstuffed
with symbolism that it plays as a kind of epic spoof of the form.
</P>
<P>
   If Alphonse's soldierly adventures on behalf of the princesses
have the aura of satanic temptations, the voluptuous attractions
thrown in his path appear to be a mishmash of Islamic and Christian
imagery without a clear-cut moral agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The film's central skein of interlocking tales focuses on a
hermit priest, later revealed as a sheik (Kazierz Opalinksi), and
his howling one-eyed assistant, Pacheco (Franciszek Pieczka), who
at first seems to be possessed by demons but who may be faking. As
Pacheco tells his life story, it spins off into a cycle of
monologues with one character after another becoming the chief
storyteller relating fantastic tales of sexual intrigue,
skulduggery and Faustian bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is really an extended jokey meditation on reality and
illusion, in a self-mocking comic style that keeps emotion at arm's
length.

   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 days of concerted bombing an estimated total of 40,000
troops and paramilitaries remain in the province with 69 percent of
their tanks and heavy equipment intact.
</P>
<P>
   Even these figures are open to doubt because NATO's military
spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday that the alliance
had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31 percent of Serbia's
heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no evidence of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics illustrate the distance NATO is from launching a
successful ground invasion of Kosovo, even if it could muster the
political will to assemble one.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would suffer ``enormous'' casualties, one source said _ in
addition to the suffering that would be inflicted on ethnic
Albanians inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of destruction _ 5 percent a week _ the
allies would need to bomb for another month before Serb forces
could be close to breaking point. But there is some doubt as to
whether NATO's existing rate of destruction inside Kosovo can be
kept up .
</P>
<P>
   The alliance said 75 percent of fixed surface-to-air missile
sites and 69 percent of high-performance MiG-29 jets have been
destroyed, along with 11 command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But other statistics were less impressive: only 12 percent of
mobile surface-to-air missile units and 34 percent of remaining
combat aircraft have been destroyed, including 24 percent of
MiG-21s, 46 percent of Galebs and 33 percent of Super Galebs.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance claims to have hit 556 pieces of equipment of which
312 were tanks, artillery or armored personnel carriers. That
compares with the figures given two weeks ago when General Jertz
said that 300 pieces of equipment had been struck, 200 of which
were heavy artillery, roughly 20 percent of the Serbs' total
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the general cited a figure of 50 percent as the
point at which the Serbs would cease to operate as an effective
force, becoming more concerned with survival.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has conceded that President Milosevic might
order his troops to continue with as little as 20 to 30 percent of
its equipment. &QL;

`TOUGH, TOUGH TOYS:' FORKS THROUGH WINDOWS , NEUROSES GALORE   AND
OTHER GROTESQUERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been any question whether the flamboyant British
writer Will Self had talent. The question was whether he would
squander his manic imagination and tactile, hyperventilated prose
on self-consciously nasty exercises in sophomoric humor (``Cock &AMP;
Bull,'' ``Great Apes'') or create fictions commensurate with his
copious gifts (``My Idea of Fun'').
</P>
<P>
   Self's latest book, ``Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys''
represents his most disciplined storytelling yet. The tales in this
collection demonstrate a new control and polish, without
sacrificing anything in terms of inventiveness or plain weirdness.
Like his 1994 novel, ``My Idea of Fun,'' it attests to Self's
ability to render even the most bizarre, ``Twilight Zone''-like
events with convincing verisimilitude while enthralling _ and often
horrifying _ the reader with his scathing, Swiftean humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough, Tough Toys'' comes with an epigraph from Oscar Wilde _
``Life is a dream that keeps me from sleeping'' _ and most of the
characters in these stories realize that their lives have come to
resemble a nightmare or hallucination. In ``Flytopia,'' a
Hitchcockian thriller that slowly morphs into a William
Burroughsesque fantasy, a mild-mannered clerk enters into a strange
pact with the insects infesting his house. In ``The Rock of Crack
as Big as the Ritz,'' a drug dealer named Danny discovers that
there's a huge vein of crack cocaine running beneath the basement
of his house. In ``A Story for Europe,'' a 2-year-old English child
and a German businessman appear to exchange personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those stories, of course, is meant as a wacky
commentary on the new, unified, economically interdependent Europe,
and its sardonic humor recalls ``My Idea of Fun,'' which satirized
the go-go years of the 1980s by depicting yuppie greed as a
Faustian pact with the Devil. An even more pronounced version of
this sort of social satire can be found in the story ``Caring,
Sharing,'' which depicts a therapy-obssessed America in which
people mate not with lovers but with ``emotos'' _ that is, giant
manifestations of their own inner children. ``The whole messy
business of sexual and emotional entanglement'' has been written
off by these narcissistic Americans; what they want more than
anything is ``the absolute reassurance that an emoto would provide
them with.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the remaining tales in ``Tough, Tough Toys'' are
ostensibly more realistic, their characters fall prey to drug- and
hormone-fueled fantasies that infect their day-to-day lives,
undermining their sense of self and throwing into question their
most basic assumptions about the world. The narrator of ``Dave
Too'' _ arguably, the weakest story in this volume _ sees everyone
around him turning into someone named Dave.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of the title story, a former psychiatrist named Bill,
finds himself forced by a chance encounter with a hitchhiker to
re-evaluate his entire self-indulgent existence. Danny, the
drug-addicted hero of ``The Nonce Prize,'' discovers an unlikely
new vocation as a writer, while serving time in prison for a
horrific rape and murder he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Using his eye for detail to flesh out his oddest imaginings,
Self does a nimble job of evoking the addled states of mind of
these characters. The Dave man looks at his psychiatrist's window
and thinks it looks like an egg: ``If a fork like a prop for a
Magritte painting were to be plunged through the window of Dr.
Klagfarten's office,'' he tells himself, ``a gush of yellow
neurosis would undoubtedly ooze out.''
</P>
<P>
   During long drives, Bill the ex-shrink likes to imagine himself
merging with his car, becoming part of the big machine as he
cruises the long, twisty roads between London and the Orkneys.
While he drives, he allows his mind to wander, musing that the
landscape beyond his windshield is ``a terrain in which a few
triceratops and pterodactyl wouldn't have looked altogether out of
place.'' His favorite fantasy involves a seraglio made up of all
the women he has had sex with: a Felliniesque dream sequence in
which the younger women handle the bulk of the domestic work and
the older ones spend their days in ``idle conversation and
hobby-style activities.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Danny, the former crack addict turned short story writer,
he suffers from visitations of menacing spirits he calls ``the
Fates'' _ ``tall, wispy, indeterminate figures'' who metamorphose,
much like the ghostly special effects in ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark,'' into terrifying djinnlike creatures, ``bearded, turbaned,
wearing long gray-and-black robes, and carrying mutant,
nine-foot-long Kalashnikovs.''
</P>
<P>
   In both this story and ``Tough, Tough Toys,'' Self expertly
orchestrates suspense: in the former by turning a simple drive home
from a country house into a harrowing adventure in which every
attempt to pass another car on the twisting road feels like a life
and death confrontation; in the latter, by conjuring up a
particularly gruesome crime _ the sexual torture and murder of a
6-year-old boy _ and the almost equally terrifying subculture of
sex criminals in a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other stories in this volume may not be as
thrilling as this pair of tales, they, too, attest to Self's ease
and authority as a storyteller. His tendency displayed in previous
books to force his tales into predictable shapes with obvious,
italicized morals, has given way in these pages to masterfully
shaped narratives that are both complex and unexpected, just as his
earlier, adolescent preoccupation with sex has evolved into a more
deeply felt interest in the mysteries of identity and emotional
(dis)connection. Along with ``My Idea of Fun,'' ``Tough, Tough
Toys'' stands as Self's most powerful work yet.

   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 days of concerted bombing an estimated total of 40,000
troops and paramilitaries remain in the province with 69 percent of
their tanks and heavy equipment intact.
</P>
<P>
   Even these figures are open to doubt because NATO's military
spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday that the alliance
had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31 percent of Serbia's
heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no evidence of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics illustrate the distance NATO is from launching a
successful ground invasion of Kosovo, even if it could muster the
political will to assemble one.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would suffer ``enormous'' casualties, one source said _ in
addition to the suffering that would be inflicted on ethnic
Albanians inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of destruction _ 5 percent a week _ the
allies would need to bomb for another month before Serb forces
could be close to breaking point. But there is some doubt as to
whether NATO's existing rate of destruction inside Kosovo can be
kept up .
</P>
<P>
   The alliance said 75 percent of fixed surface-to-air missile
sites and 69 percent of high-performance MiG-29 jets have been
destroyed, along with 11 command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But other statistics were less impressive: only 12 percent of
mobile surface-to-air missile units and 34 percent of remaining
combat aircraft have been destroyed, including 24 percent of
MiG-21s, 46 percent of Galebs and 33 percent of Super Galebs.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance claims to have hit 556 pieces of equipment of which
312 were tanks, artillery or armored personnel carriers. That

force, becoming more concerned with survival.

<P>
   A woman and a man meet at the end of the day. He asks how her
day was, and she replies with a long report of what she did, whom
she met, what they said and what that made her think and feel. Then
she eagerly turns to him:
</P>
<P>
   She: How was your day?
</P>
<P>
   He: Same old rat race.
</P>
<P>
   She: Didn't anything happen?
</P>
<P>
   He: Nah, nothing much.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappointment is deepened when that evening they go out to
dinner with friends and suddenly he regales the group with an
amusing account of something that happened at work. She is cut to
the quick, crestfallen at hearing this story as part of an audience
of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he have said nothing happened?'' she wonders. ``Why
didn't he tell me this before? What am I? Chopped liver?''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this frustration is that women and men typically have
different ideas about what makes people friends. For many women, as
for girls, talk is the glue of close relationships; your best
friend is the one you tell your secrets to, the one you discuss
your troubles with.
</P>
<P>
   For many men, as for boys, activities are central; your best
friend is the one you do everything with (and the one who will
stick up for you if there is a fight).
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches and commentators examine how our
lives have changed in the last thousand years, I find myself
wondering about the change in relations between the sexes. Clearly
there has been a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the woman was deferential, subordinate. Now we are
not trying to be partners in a societal arrangement with a clearly
defined separation of labor, but rather hoping to be each other's
best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at least two aspects of women's and men's relations have
endured _ our differing expectations about the importance of talk
in intimacy, and the tendency of women to take the role of listener
in conversation with men.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of tape recordings from earlier times, we can
look to conversations in literature. For a glimpse of how a
16th-century couple might have talked to each other, I turned to
Shakespeare _ and my earliest memory of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   When I was at Ditmas Junior High in Brooklyn, my classmates were
all atitter: Our teacher had us reading ``Julius Caesar'' aloud
and, having read ahead, we knew that the next day some poor girl
would have to stand and read a passage in which Brutus' wife uses
the word ``harlot.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ehrlich had the bad luck to be chosen, and I can still see
her, tall and brown-haired, reading, ``Portia is Brutus' harlot,
not his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting those lines today, what strikes me is how similar the
sentiment is to what I hear from contemporary women. Portia wants
to be Brutus' best friend _ and her idea of what this means is very
similar to ours.
</P>
<P>
   Waking up to discover that her husband has left their bed, she
finds him pacing, and implores him to say what is worrying him.
Like the modern woman who feels that best friends tell each other
secrets, Portia pleads:
</P>
<P>
   Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
</P>
<P>
   Is it excepted I should know no secrets
</P>
<P>
   That appertain to you? Am I yourself
</P>
<P>
   But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
</P>
<P>
   To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
</P>
<P>
   And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
</P>
<P>
   Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sentiment emerges in an even more distant conversation
_ in the Arabian romance of the Bedouin hero Antar, believed to
have been written between 1080 and 1400. In one episode, a
character named al-Minhal, escaping a king he has wronged, comes
upon a ruined castle inhabited by a female demon named Dahiya. She
gives him shelter, feeds him, falls in love with him and wins his
love by her attentions, which include her conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding rather like Portia, Dahiya says: ``I want you to be my
companion and to be my lord, and I will be your wife. Disclose to
me what is in your heart. Do not believe that I will ever let you
go. Open your mind to me for I have need to know your thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   They are married on the spot and, we are told, ``Long was their
companionship, and they loved each other dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not suggesting that relationships between women and men
were the same then as now. But it's intriguing to think that what
women regard as intimacy, talking about what's on your mind, has
been a common thread right through the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, related pattern that seems to have endured. It
too is evident in the case of the husband who can't think of
anything to tell his wife but comes up with an amusing story to
entertain a dinner gathering. To her, it's a failure of intimacy:
If we're truly close, I should hear everything first. To him, I
think, the situation of being home with someone he feels close to
does not call for a story performance.
</P>
<P>
   This creates a paradox. Many women were drawn to the men they
fell in love with because the men told captivating stories. After
marriage, the women expect that the closer they get, the more the
men will open up and tell. Instead, to their deep disappointment,
after marriage the men clam up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, looking at how boys and girls are socialized
provides a key. Boys' groups are hierarchical; low-status boys are
pushed around. One way boys earn and keep status is to hold center
stage by verbal performance _ boasting, telling jokes or recounting
mesmerizing stories. And this seems to work well in winning maidens
as well.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of storytelling can be seen as far back as
``Beowulf,'' that Anglo-Saxon saga, usually dated to the eighth
century. The hero, a member of a Swedish tribe known as the Geats,
wins the attention of Wealhtheow, queen of Hrothgar, who is serving
beer to a gathering of men:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow: ``I resolved, when I
set out on the sea, sat down in the sea-boat with my band of men,
that I should altogether fulfill the will of your people or else
fall in slaughter, fast in the foe's grasp. I shall achieve a deed
of manly courage or else have lived to see in the mead-hall my
ending day.'' These words were well-pleasing to the woman, the
boast of the Geat. Gold-adorned, the noble folk-queen went to sit
by her lord.(end ital.)
</P>
<P>
   Boasting, my colleague Catherine Ball tells me, was a customary
male activity in the Anglo-Saxon mead-hall, so it is not surprising
that Wealhtheow was well pleased, even though the exploits Beowulf
boasts of have not yet taken place. (In fact, he sounds a little
like Cassius Clay predicting what he will do to Sonny Liston.)
</P>
<P>
   This scenario _ a woman wooed by a man's boasts of exploits in
battle _ brings us back to Shakespearean icons: Desdemona and
Othello. As Othello tells ``how I did thrive in this fair lady's
love,'' he explains that she became entranced when she heard him
telling ``the story of my life'':
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
</P>
<P>
   Of moving accidents by flood and field,
</P>
<P>
   Of hair-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
</P>
<P>
   Of being taken by the insolent foe. ...(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And so on, until:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)My story being done,
</P>
<P>
   She gave me for my pains a world of kisses. ...
</P>
<P>
   And bad me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
</P>
<P>
   I should but teach him how to tell my story,
</P>
<P>
   And that would woo her.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As we know, he wooed her himself with his own story.
</P>
<P>
   In our era, the tactic of wooing by verbal performance takes a
funny turn. Etiquette books of the '50s instructed young women to
be good listeners if they wanted to win their men, and you need
only look around a restaurant to see many women attentively
listening to talking men.
</P>
<P>
   In place of battle yarns, what I hear, over and over, is that a
woman fell in love because ``he makes me laugh.'' That's why
Michelle Pfeiffer said in 1992 she picked a particular boyfriend,
and why Joanne Woodward fell for Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't hear the same explanation from men as to why they fall
in love. What I hear is the corresponding one, as for example when
Woody Allen said of his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn: ``She's a
marvel. And she laughs at all my jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have a situation of ``plus ca change.'' Even as
relationships between men and women have changed, our contrasting
expectations about the meaning of closeness still cause confusion
and disappointment. And though the performance has shifted from
heroic tales to amusing entertainment, more often than not the
apportionment of roles has stayed the same: Women are the audience
and men are the show.

   &UR; THE LOCAL ANGLE: Here are a few ideas to localize this piece.
</P>
<P>
   -- When do women learn to listen rather than speak up? Gender
bias in the classroom may reinforce passivity in girls as early as
elementary school, say some educators. Here are two story ideas for
exploring what roles girls in your area are learning to play.
</P>
<P>
   1. Find out what schools are doing to encourage excellence and
leadership among girls. Interview girls about their experiences;
look at textbooks to see if women are represented in all
disciplines; find out if girls have equal access to computers and
what rules exist for taking turns; see what girls' team sports are
offered and how much funding they receive.
</P>
<P>
   2. What summer enrichment programs are available in your area to
develop girls' skills in entrepreneurship, sports, leadership,
math, science, computers, the arts? A sampling of such programs
around the country can be found online at
 &QL; http://www.academic.org/programs.html &QR; . If none are near you, ask
school guidance counselors if they know of any students who are
studying at such programs elsewhere. Interview the girls when they
get back.
</P>
<P>

Holyoke College with information from the Women's College
Coalition, also can lead you to lists of ideas for encouraging
excellence in girls and young women and links to other

BEARING THE STARFLEET SEAL OF APPROVAL

<P>
   Leave it to Data to sum up the appeal of ``Trekkies,'' Roger
Nygard's bemused and amusing documentary about ``Star Trek'' fans.
Well, not Data, really, but Brent Spiner, who played the
wannabe-human android on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Spiner
readily acknowledges the peculiarity of the most passionate ``Star
Trek'' aficionados _ but then asks, aren't we all peculiar in some
way?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Most of us, however, are not so peculiar that we wear
our ``Star Trek'' uniform when called to serve on the Whitewater
jury, as Barbara Adams does in ``Trekkies.'' Or that we would
design our office completely in a Star Trek motif, as Orlando,
Fla., dentist Dr. Denis Bourguignon does (his family and staff also
wear ``Trek'' uniforms). Or muse about getting our ears surgically
sharpened in order to look more Vulcan, as David Greenstein does
(as Greenstein considers this, his wife looks at him as if he's
gone over the edge _ a look that would bear more credibility if she
weren't wearing a ``Trek'' uniform and cradling their uniform-clad
poodle).
</P>
<P>
   Because of people such as these, ``Trekkies'' is often hilarious
without half trying. Its concern isn't with people who've collected
every episode of every ``Star Trek'' series on tape, but with
people who have begun living the phenomenon _ people who make the
``Star Wars'' fans who camped out for ``Phantom Menace'' tickets
look like relaxation therapists. It's hard to tell whether Nygard,
who examined similar fanaticism in the USA Film Festival entry
``Six Days in Roswell,'' is studying his subject with affection or
with condescending irony, but by keeping himself out of the movie
he avoids a ``Daily Show'' sort of nastiness. He makes a smart
movie in using Denise Crosby to ask questions of the Trekkies who
appear on camera. Crosby, a ``Next Generation'' actress who was
merely a blip in the ``Trek'' universe, constantly looks baffled by
their adoration.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Trekkies'' doesn't teach you is why these fans have
reached this point of fanaticism. They frequently complain that
although they're treated like freaks, sports fans who wear the
clothing of their favorite teams are considered normal. Point
taken, and a subject for further research. But Nygard doesn't dig
deeply enough into the ``Trek'' phenomenon to be illuminating about
the culture of fiction-worshiping.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of several ``Trek'' stars buoys the movie, although
William Shatner is only on camera incidentally and succeeding
captains Patrick Stewart and Avery Brooks don't appear at all.
That's indicative of why ``Trekkies'' isn't more satisfying: What
we see is entertaining enough, but it's what we don't see that
makes the movie mildly disappointing. Still, considering the hype
for that ``other'' movie with ``Star'' in the title, this is the
movie that's more likely to come off as a pleasant surprise.

   TIRANA _ NATO's reluctance to send in ground forces against the
Serbs is creating a sense of foreboding among the Kosovar
Liberation Army, who fear they will be let down.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters in the organization report a mood of creeping pessimism
and worries that the West's desire to avoid a land war may lead to
a compromise peace deal falling far short of an independent Kosovo,
or even a NATO protectorate. Instead it may end up by leaving
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with powers to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA leadership is grateful to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair for his much more hawkish views, compared to some of the
other Allied leaders. But they are anxious that voices such as that
of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may encourage U.S. President
Bill Clinton to stiffen his antipathy to a ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a private meeting with KLA leaders on Tuesday Blair is
believed to have stated NATO's commitment to extracting Kosovo from
Milosevic's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But as one KLA senior official said: ``His country (Britain)
can't fight the war on its own. The Prime Minister was told that
the KLA is growing stronger all the time and NATO must not back
down now. We hope our alliance with the West will continue to grow
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs of friction with the West over the
relocation of refugees from the Kosovar-Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commission for Refugees wants to move
tens of thousands of exiled Kosovars from the border region around
Kukes to the south because of the dangers posed by the coming
winter and a possibility of Serbian artillery attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many KLA senior commanders oppose the scheme. They claim this
will make hinder a rapid return of the refugees to Kosovo after the
Serbs have been expelled. It also damages their ability to draw
from pools of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Although the KLA leadership denies it sanctions these actions,
the U.N. says families who agreed to move south have suddenly
changed their minds after visits from local KLA members.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA position is that if NATO does not want to send land
forces to Kosovo it should arm the guerrillas with heavy weapons.
Lack of fire power compared to the Serbs is one of the major
problems. However, there is still no sign that NATO is prepared to
do this.
</P>
<P>
   The precise state of the KLA is a matter of debate. There is
little doubt that some outside supplies are getting through to the
guerrillas. But many doubt that the rebels have inflicted much
damage on the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to some intelligence estimates, the KLA has fewer than
4,000 fighters inside the province, locked into small enclaves,
while the bulk of the 20,000 force are now in Albania hoping and
waiting for a NATO ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the KLA that is increasingly disappointed at the
procrastination of the West. Kosovar exiles in Albania say if NATO
fails to invade, the Milosevic regime will remain in power and it
will be unsafe for them ever to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Imrahim Bekir, a 48-year-old office worker from near Pristina,
now living in Albania, last saw his 17-year-old son when he was led
off at gunpoint by Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday: ``We have endured our suffering in the belief
that one day we shall return home. Even if my son had been killed
maybe I can find his grave and give him a proper burial. But this
will not happen unless NATO goes in and fights the Serbs. Why are
some of their leaders saying they don't want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Murad added: ``We know that people in Djakova are now
starving. They are hiding in the countryside without food. These
include members of my family I don't know how many of them are
alive now, but if NATO does not go into Kosovo all of them will
probably die.'' &QL;

<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Thursday tightened the
noose on Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic which has
repeatedly been at odds with Belgrade. The republic is slipping
constantly closer towards war.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army set up checkpoints at all Montenegro's main
border crossings. ``It's getting worse. They want to throttle us,''
one government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, warned that there
should be no ``dual power.'' But such dual power _ where government
forces and the army argue it out between themselves _ is exactly
what Montenegro now faces.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic accused ``top Yugoslav army officers'' in the
republic of wanting to serve ``the dictatorship in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Montenegro fear that a coup is just around the corner _
a coup which would almost certainly be followed by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin television showed army bunkers with newly set up
machine-gun positions at checkpoints along the coastal road towards
the border with Croatia. The deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan,
travelled to the coastal town of Herceg Novi to try to negotiate
the removal of the army roadblocks, but without apparent success.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials also said that tanks and heavy artillery
are now positioned around the town of Cetinje. Hundreds of soldiers
have moved in recent days into the town, the old Montenegrin royal
capital and a heartland of Montenegrin nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Cetinje has been virtually an army-free zone,
apparently because the troops were still wary of provoking head-on
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the Cetinjans are determined not to be cowed. What was
officially described as a ``fairly tense situation'' arose when
Yugoslav soldiers demanded rooms in a hotel in the town, only to be
told that none were available.
</P>
<P>
   Miodrag Vukovic, a presidential adviser, warned of the ``tragic
fate'' now facing Montenegro, especially in view of the ``new media
and political campaign'' launched by Serbia against Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   From the Montenegrin point of view, the pattern is nightmarishly
clear. On the one hand, their independent standpoint cannot be
tolerated by Belgrade. On the other hand, further conflict in
Montenegro might help to distract Serbs from rebelling against
their own government.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent this month, President
Djukanovic made it clear that Montenegro would certainly seek to
break away from Serbia if, as seems increasingly likely, Milosevic
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, he said, a single Yugoslav federation
was ``not feasible.'' Djukanovic acknowledged that such a breakaway
would almost certainly be accompanied by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro was an independent kingdom before union with Serbia
in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The army this week turned back an Italian truck of humanitarian
aid, after confiscating the aid itself. Two truckloads of French
medical and food aid were confiscated over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The current tensions may recede again in the next few days, for
the moment at least. But none of the underlying difficulties seem
likely to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Control over Montenegro's borders has in recent weeks been
ambivalent, at best. The Montenegrin government seeks to allow
foreigners into the country. But the army does not recognize the
government's authority to issue entry papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government has tried hard to remain uninvolved
in the war with NATO. For Belgrade, this merely compounds the
Montenegrins' offense. The Montenegrins are now accused of
``treachery.'' &QL;

<P>
   A woman and a man meet at the end of the day. He asks how her
day was, and she replies with a long report of what she did, whom
she met, what they said and what that made her think and feel. Then
she eagerly turns to him:
</P>
<P>
   She: How was your day?
</P>
<P>
   He: Same old rat race.
</P>
<P>
   She: Didn't anything happen?
</P>
<P>
   He: Nah, nothing much.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappointment is deepened when that evening they go out to
dinner with friends and suddenly he regales the group with an
amusing account of something that happened at work. She is cut to
the quick, crestfallen at hearing this story as part of an audience
of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he have said nothing happened?'' she wonders. ``Why
didn't he tell me this before? What am I? Chopped liver?''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this frustration is that women and men typically have
different ideas about what makes people friends. For many women, as
for girls, talk is the glue of close relationships; your best
friend is the one you tell your secrets to, the one you discuss
your troubles with.
</P>
<P>
   For many men, as for boys, activities are central; your best
friend is the one you do everything with (and the one who will
stick up for you if there is a fight).
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches and commentators examine how our
lives have changed in the last thousand years, I find myself
wondering about the change in relations between the sexes. Clearly
there has been a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the woman was deferential, subordinate. Now we are
not trying to be partners in a societal arrangement with a clearly
defined separation of labor, but rather hoping to be each other's
best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at least two aspects of women's and men's relations have
endured _ our differing expectations about the importance of talk
in intimacy, and the tendency of women to take the role of listener
in conversation with men.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of tape recordings from earlier times, we can
look to conversations in literature. For a glimpse of how a
16th-century couple might have talked to each other, I turned to
Shakespeare _ and my earliest memory of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   When I was at Ditmas Junior High in Brooklyn, my classmates were
all atitter: Our teacher had us reading ``Julius Caesar'' aloud
and, having read ahead, we knew that the next day some poor girl
would have to stand and read a passage in which Brutus' wife uses
the word ``harlot.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ehrlich had the bad luck to be chosen, and I can still see
her, tall and brown-haired, reading, ``Portia is Brutus' harlot,
not his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting those lines today, what strikes me is how similar the
sentiment is to what I hear from contemporary women. Portia wants
to be Brutus' best friend _ and her idea of what this means is very
similar to ours.
</P>
<P>
   Waking up to discover that her husband has left their bed, she
finds him pacing, and implores him to say what is worrying him.
Like the modern woman who feels that best friends tell each other
secrets, Portia pleads:
</P>
<P>
   Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
</P>
<P>
   Is it excepted I should know no secrets
</P>
<P>
   That appertain to you? Am I yourself
</P>
<P>
   But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
</P>
<P>
   To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
</P>
<P>
   And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
</P>
<P>
   Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sentiment emerges in an even more distant conversation
_ in the Arabian romance of the Bedouin hero Antar, believed to
have been written between 1080 and 1400. In one episode, a
character named al-Minhal, escaping a king he has wronged, comes
upon a ruined castle inhabited by a female demon named Dahiya. She
gives him shelter, feeds him, falls in love with him and wins his
love by her attentions, which include her conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding rather like Portia, Dahiya says: ``I want you to be my
companion and to be my lord, and I will be your wife. Disclose to
me what is in your heart. Do not believe that I will ever let you
go. Open your mind to me for I have need to know your thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   They are married on the spot and, we are told, ``Long was their
companionship, and they loved each other dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not suggesting that relationships between women and men
were the same then as now. But it's intriguing to think that what
women regard as intimacy, talking about what's on your mind, has
been a common thread right through the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, related pattern that seems to have endured. It
too is evident in the case of the husband who can't think of
anything to tell his wife but comes up with an amusing story to
entertain a dinner gathering. To her, it's a failure of intimacy:
If we're truly close, I should hear everything first. To him, I
think, the situation of being home with someone he feels close to
does not call for a story performance.
</P>
<P>
   This creates a paradox. Many women were drawn to the men they
fell in love with because the men told captivating stories. After
marriage, the women expect that the closer they get, the more the
men will open up and tell. Instead, to their deep disappointment,
after marriage the men clam up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, looking at how boys and girls are socialized
provides a key. Boys' groups are hierarchical; low-status boys are
pushed around. One way boys earn and keep status is to hold center
stage by verbal performance _ boasting, telling jokes or recounting
mesmerizing stories. And this seems to work well in winning maidens
as well.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of storytelling can be seen as far back as
``Beowulf,'' that Anglo-Saxon saga, usually dated to the eighth
century. The hero, a member of a Swedish tribe known as the Geats,
wins the attention of Wealhtheow, queen of Hrothgar, who is serving
beer to a gathering of men:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow: ``I resolved, when I
set out on the sea, sat down in the sea-boat with my band of men,
that I should altogether fulfill the will of your people or else
fall in slaughter, fast in the foe's grasp. I shall achieve a deed
of manly courage or else have lived to see in the mead-hall my
ending day.'' These words were well-pleasing to the woman, the
boast of the Geat. Gold-adorned, the noble folk-queen went to sit
by her lord.(end ital.)
</P>
<P>
   Boasting, my colleague Catherine Ball tells me, was a customary
male activity in the Anglo-Saxon mead-hall, so it is not surprising
that Wealhtheow was well pleased, even though the exploits Beowulf
boasts of have not yet taken place. (In fact, he sounds a little
like Cassius Clay predicting what he will do to Sonny Liston.)
</P>
<P>
   This scenario _ a woman wooed by a man's boasts of exploits in
battle _ brings us back to Shakespearean icons: Desdemona and
Othello. As Othello tells ``how I did thrive in this fair lady's
love,'' he explains that she became entranced when she heard him
telling ``the story of my life'':
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
</P>
<P>
   Of moving accidents by flood and field,
</P>
<P>
   Of hair-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
</P>
<P>
   Of being taken by the insolent foe. ...(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And so on, until:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)My story being done,
</P>
<P>
   She gave me for my pains a world of kisses. ...
</P>
<P>
   And bad me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
</P>
<P>
   I should but teach him how to tell my story,
</P>
<P>
   And that would woo her.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As we know, he wooed her himself with his own story.
</P>
<P>
   In our era, the tactic of wooing by verbal performance takes a
funny turn. Etiquette books of the '50s instructed young women to
be good listeners if they wanted to win their men, and you need
only look around a restaurant to see many women attentively
listening to talking men.
</P>
<P>
   In place of battle yarns, what I hear, over and over, is that a
woman fell in love because ``he makes me laugh.'' That's why
Michelle Pfeiffer said in 1992 she picked a particular boyfriend,
and why Joanne Woodward fell for Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't hear the same explanation from men as to why they fall
in love. What I hear is the corresponding one, as for example when
Woody Allen said of his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn: ``She's a
marvel. And she laughs at all my jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have a situation of ``plus ca change.'' Even as
relationships between men and women have changed, our contrasting
expectations about the meaning of closeness still cause confusion
and disappointment. And though the performance has shifted from
heroic tales to amusing entertainment, more often than not the
apportionment of roles has stayed the same: Women are the audience
and men are the show.

   &UR; THE LOCAL ANGLE: Here are a few ideas to localize this piece.
</P>
<P>
   -- When do women learn to listen rather than speak up? Gender
bias in the classroom may reinforce passivity in girls as early as
elementary school, say some educators. Here are two story ideas for
exploring what roles girls in your area are learning to play.
</P>
<P>
   1. Find out what schools are doing to encourage excellence and
leadership among girls. Interview girls about their experiences;
look at textbooks to see if women are represented in all
disciplines; find out if girls have equal access to computers and
what rules exist for taking turns; see what girls' team sports are
offered and how much funding they receive.
</P>
<P>
   2. What summer enrichment programs are available in your area to
develop girls' skills in entrepreneurship, sports, leadership,
math, science, computers, the arts? A sampling of such programs
around the country can be found online at
 &QL; http://www.academic.org/programs.html &QR; . If none are near you, ask
school guidance counselors if they know of any students who are
studying at such programs elsewhere. Interview the girls when they
get back.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES:  &QL; http://www.academic.org &QR; , a site set up by Mount
Holyoke College with information from the Women's College
Coalition, also can lead you to lists of ideas for encouraging
excellence in girls and young women and links to other
organizations. The Women's College Coalition has its own website
 &QL; http://www.womenscolleges.org &QR;  and can be reached by phone,
202-234-0443. The American Association of University Women
 &QL; http://www.aauw.org &QR; , has Internet links to its branch and state
offices. The AAUW recently issued a report on how girls are falling
behind in technology. Media can obtain a copy of ``Gender Gaps:

   TIRANA _ She was a beautiful little girl, just 18 months old,
who had been loved. She was found alone and crying on the steps of
a mosque in Kukes. The only words she said were ``mother, truck,
KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, who was given the name Atdhetare, was just one
of several hundred children who have arrived at Albania and
Macedonia without any adults after being ``cleansed'' from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They are being looked after by adoptive families with the mostly
forlorn hope of ever being reunited with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in recognition of the need to care and counsel these
lost boys and girls as well as 160,000 other children in refugee
camps, the U.N. children's body UNICEF and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees signed an agreement in Tirana to
establish ``Child-Friendly Spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The centers in 20 camps in Albania will provide education,
sports and other aspects of childhood which have been missing. The
children also receive psychological counselling about their
traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have seen relations and neighbors killed and have
been chased out of their homes which have been burned behind them.
Some had seen their mothers and sisters raped.
</P>
<P>
   Child-Friendly Spaces will not only attempt to give structure to
the lives of the children, but also protection.
</P>
<P>
   There have been persistent reports of teenage girls being lured
or abducted into prostitution from the camps, boys becoming
enmeshed in criminality and others who want to become boy soldiers
and go and fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program 3,000 prepacked schools are being flown
into Albania. The scheme has the backing of NATO and will be
overseen by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   Atdhetare, which means ``love of homeland'' in Albania, was
treated for bronchitis and diarrhea and placed with the Misini
family, of 17 children and 18 adults, themselves refugees. But the
search to find their natural parents had not so far been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was terrified of large vehicles and men in uniforms,
trembling and crying. But with the efforts of the UNICEF
counsellors she appears to be slowly recovering from the worst of
her nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The counsellors come across evidence of the childrens' harrowing
experiences every day.
</P>
<P>
   One nine-year-old boy, who, asked to portray his home,
repeatedly sketched a rug. At first he would not say why, but
eventually burst into tears and told how the family were forced to
move home 17 times and the only thing left from the original home
was the rug which he had faithfully rolled up and taken with him
through his travels.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the case of the 14-year-old girl who lay in a
fetal position for two weeks and would not talk. She too has
recovered to an extent after counselling.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cohen, of UNICEF, said: ``It takes a while to draw these
children out. When we first start working with them they tell the
same kind of stories and same kinds of drawings the children make
everywhere in the world _ fairy tales and nursery rhymes, pretty
houses, trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But once they begin to unburden themselves in the drawings the
houses catch fire, there are dead bodies among the flowers and the
stories are no longer fairy tales but of people killing and
burning.
</P>
<P>
   These children have been through often unimaginable experiences,
but they are astonishingly resilient and hopefully most will
recover.'' &QL;

A HARD-WORKING QUEEN AND HER MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's big, it's bad, it's ``Cleopatra!'' What else could anyone
expect? Onscreen, Cleopatra's legend has always been about
spectacle, not character. So ABC's expensive two-night mini-series
includes chariots, warships, battle scenes on horseback, the
Pyramids, the streets of Rome, and countless varieties of Egyptian
headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a spectacle going nowhere except off the deep end.
Shakespeare may have described Cleopatra's power best when he
praised ``her infinite variety,'' but here her charms are finite.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this version strains so hard to make her an
overachieving modern woman that she might as well have a to-do list
taped to her throne: 1. Be a sexpot. 2. Be a great mom and queen.
3. Hook up with some Roman guy and try to conquer the world. The
last one, of course, is the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cleopatra should hold this story together, the two halves
of the mini-series have opposite tones, each borrowed from a
different man she seduces. Sunday's installment begins with Roman
legions marching into Alexandria. Julius Caesar arrives, helps
Cleopatra oust her sister and brother to become queen, and falls
for her.
</P>
<P>
   But even when cavorting with Cleopatra, Timothy Dalton's Caesar
is the essence of a buttoned-down Englishman. This episode
resembles one of those clunky Bible movies from the 1950s, full of
clanging armor and stiff declarations of love.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Caesar fall so hard for Cleopatra? Excellent question,
despite the early scene in which she summons a courtesan for a
question-and-answer session. (The ancient advice: leave him wanting
more.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 1963 film, now a legendary bomb, there was logic behind
casting Elizabeth Taylor, then considered the most beautiful woman
in the world. In the public mind, she simply had to show up to
channel Cleopatra. Her off-screen affair with Richard Burton, her
Marc Antony, only enhanced the character.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``Cleopatra'' has poor, unknown Leonor Varela. She
looks exotic enough but you can practically see her straining to
throw smoldering glances at Caesar. The courtesan should have told
her that seduction should never look like that much work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cleopatra gets her man, and he invites her to Rome, where
she is carried through the streets. The costume department hauls
out many colorful veils to wrap around her sedan chair. Yet the
crowd shouts, ``Caesar's whore!'' She has, after all, brought along
their illegitimate son. (Don't look for historical accuracy here;
the mini-series has written out two children she later had with
Antony.)
</P>
<P>
   And Caesar's troubles are just beginning. When he stands before
the Senate and declares himself dictator for life, the camera
closes in on Brutus, looking plenty mad and stalking out. Could he
be, maybe, plotting something?
</P>
<P>
   The first episode ends with Caesar's assassination by Brutus.
The second begins with Antony avenging his death. At once, Billy
Zane's loony, overheated performance turns ``Cleopatra'' into some
campy late-night cable movie.
</P>
<P>
   Where Caesar was all dignity, Antony is all hands, grabbing
Cleopatra in a drunken passion. The girl can't help it, she's in
love again. Soon she's squeezing pomegranate juice on his back and
licking it off, all the while dreaming of world domination. When
she plans to seduce Antony she says things like: ``Prepare the
royal barge for war. A different kind of war.''
</P>
<P>
   When Antony marries Octavia to form an alliance with Octavian,
her brother and Caesar's successor, Cleopatra is understandably
annoyed. Antony and Cleopatra squabble on the beach, gesticulating
at each other wildly. He says: ``Forget Octavia. I married for
convenience, now I live for love.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Graves plays Octavian as if he had been bullied at an
English public school and is now using his power to get even. His
whiny superiority adds an especially icky feel to the scene in
which he and Antony toss around Brutus' severed head.
</P>
<P>
   As the story heads toward the Battle of Actium, and Antony and
Cleopatra's final defeat by Octavian, the Queen picks up a weapon
and proves that, among her many other talents, she's not a bad
little swordswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Franc Roddam (who has directed movies and, for television, the
recent ``Moby Dick'') knows how to maneuver those barges and keep
those sword fights moving. ``Cleopatra'' has the seamless look of a
feature film. But there aren't enough big battle scenes in history
to overcome the laughable dialogue and acting in this tale of her
infinite familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   `The Jesse Ventura Story'
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Sunday night at 9
</P>
<P>
   (Channel 4 in New York)
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing we'd all like to know about Gov. Jesse Ventura
of Minnesota. How in the world did this happen? There are no clues
in this dull, simple-minded, unauthorized movie, which is even
flatter and more whitewashed than the governor's newly published
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   At least in his book he admits to a wilder streak in his younger
days. Revelations of smoking marijuana and visiting a prostitute
(legally) in Nevada have been good for a few book-promoting
headlines. There isn't even that much candor in this quickie film.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is played by Nils Allen Stewart, a onetime wrestler who
acts with his wardrobe. A uniform tells you when Ventura is a Navy
Seal. During his biker days he wears a fringed jacket. When he
becomes Jesse (the Body) Ventura he parades around the ring in a
fuchsia boa and leopard hat.
</P>
<P>
   All along he is really a good guy, family man and future
governor trapped in a wrestler's body. There are a few wrestling
scenes, but not enough to entice actual fans. There is a political
campaign, but not a fraction of a thought that will aid all those
analysts still fretting over the wrestler-turned-governor
phenomenon.

THEATER NOTES: TWO MUSICALS FROM ONE POEM;   CALISTA FLOCKHART
COMES TO BROADWAY;   A NEW PRESS AGENCY OPENS;   AND MORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Depending on how you look at it, it's either a
testament to the magnetic theatrical appeal of really fine poetry
or it's the paucity of really good stage ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Two top nonprofit theater companies, the Manhattan Theater Club
and the Joseph Papp Public Theater, are in the late stages of
developing musical adaptations of ``The Wild Party,'' based on the
jazz-era poem by Joseph Moncure March. But while the competition
for press attention and audience members would seem to be intense,
both sides are playing nice, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The theater club's version, by Andrew Lippa, had a private
workshop performance Thursday for a select crowd of friends, staff
members and others in the theater. The Public's workshop of a
``Wild Party,'' written by Michael LaChuisa and George C. Wolfe,
was in February and had Mandy Patinkin, Vanessa Williams and Eartha
Kitt in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   This week Wolfe said that the production would probably begin
rehearsals in January for a spring 2000 run and that the theater
was exploring the option of playing in a Broadway house.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a producer, we're looking at various spaces to perform it
in,'' Wolfe said. ``And some of those spaces have been on
Broadway.'' He said part of the reason was that the production's
set may be too large for the Public's theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway option was hinted at in a brief article in Daily
Variety last week. But Wolfe laughed off the suggestion that the
report had been leaked by Public officials to scare off the theater
club. ``That's just people projecting their own thought processes
on this very pure nonprofit institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the theater club, said
that a production of its ``Wild Party'' was possible but not
definite for next season. Much depends on the reaction to
Thursday's reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't describe it as a test,'' she said. ``We just want
to see where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   As for overlap, creative or otherwise, with the Public, Ms.
Meadow said: ``Both pieces are based on the original source
material, but once the material works through the imaginations of
the artists, they could come out looking like two completely
different things. A priori, that would not give us great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said his reading settled his insecurities about another
``Wild Party'' stealing the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me this question six months ago, I would have
had more apprehension,'' he said. ``But having done the reading and
found its voice and found its power, I don't get into all that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Back From `McBeal'
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, who is ``Ally McBeal'' on television and an
alumna of the New York stage, isn't taking any time off this
summer. Instead, she'll be acting Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny: Beginning on June 15 at the Douglas Fairbanks
Theater, Ms. Flockhart will appear in what is tentatively titled
``A Gaggle of Saints,'' three one-act plays by Neil LaBute, film
director of ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and
Neighbors.'' Joe Mantello (``Love! Valour! Compassion!'') is likely
to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Los Angeles, LaBute described his plays as having
``a continuing theme from my work, which is basically beautiful
people doing awful things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart, who will appear in two of the three pieces, has
been rumored to be involved in any number of projects over the last
month, from a production of Strindberg's ``Miss Julie'' to a
revival of Marsha Norman's `` 'Night, Mother.'' A promising theater
actress before her break into television, Ms. Flockhart appeared in
``Three Sisters,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company in 1997. She
also played Laura in the Roundabout's 1994 production of ``The
Glass Menagerie.''
</P>
<P>
   Comings and Goings
</P>
<P>
   This week's news that James Morrison, a press agent who
represented many major nonprofit theaters, would close his office
and that another team would open shop shows how part of the
theatrical food chain works.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Morrison announced the closing of his office, two
other rising young press agents, John Barlow and Michael Hartman,
said they were leaving Boneau-Bryan Brown, a powerhouse Broadway
agency, to form their own company. Adrian Bryan Brown and Chris
Boneau, owners of the agency, said the two left ``with our
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   While the timing may have been coincidental, it is certainly
opportune. Morrison, who represents the Broadway production of ``It
Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' has had many mid-size clients,
including Playwrights Horizons and the Classic Stage Company, all
of which will probably need new representation.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he would take some time off before deciding what
to do next. He has been making recommendations to his clients about
who might take his place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Barlow said he and Hartman had not aggressively pursued
clients, he said they felt it was ``the right time'' to set up
shop. They will open as Barlow/Hartman Public Relations on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact,'' a dance theater piece by John Weidman and Susan
Stroman, will open at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center
on Oct. 7. Boyd Gaines will star.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Ivey, Dylan Baker and Charles Kimbrough will be in the
Public Theater's ``Tartuffe,'' opening in August at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Add Laurence Fishburne, Christian Slater, Christine Baranski and
Chita Rivera to the list of Tony presenters for this year's
broadcast on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Call it theater or just plain odd, but the latest project of the
producer David Binder (``Rent,'' ``Villa Villa'') is ``Delicious
Vaudeville,'' a melange of twisted circus arts, bizarre monologues
and vaudeville, now playing at the Theatorium in Manhattan.

ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIP WITH WEB CUSTOMER WAVE OF FUTURE, AUTHOR
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a world where companies asked for your ``permission''
before slapping a billboard alongside the highway or piping a
television commercial into your living room.
</P>
<P>
   While such strategies would never fly on Madison Avenue, such an
approach might represent the secret to effective marketing in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument put forward by Web entrepreneur Seth Godin
in a book published this month, ``Permission Marketing: Turning
Strangers Into Friends and Friends Into Customers'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $24, 255 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Godin, who started the Web marketing firm Yoyodyne, which last
year was purchased by Web search engine parent Yahoo!, makes the
case that consumers suffering from media overload have little time
to pay attention to anything and, hence, are increasingly tuning
out many of the mostly irrelevant TV commercials, billboards and
newspaper advertising that bombard them daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's infoglut, people are more selfish than ever,''
Godin writes. ``And they're most selfish about their time and
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What consumers will pay attention to, Godin says, are
personalized messages from marketers with advertising that touches
issues they are interested in. The consumers most likely to be
receptive to these messages are those who have asked to be placed
on a marketer's electronic mailing list, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   For companies, the idea is to give consumers incentives for
initiating an ongoing dialogue. A marketer, for exmple, may offer a
coupon or gift certificate to a consumer signing up to an
electronic mailing list. The marketer then sends follow-up e-mail
messages to the consumer at regular intervals offering more
coupons, highlighting special deals or simply providing
newsletter-style information to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must find a reason for the prospect to pay attention,''
Godin writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to offer an explicit reward-information, education,
entertainment or even cold hard cash to get the consumer to opt in
to the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a process may sound difficult and expensive. But it may be
more efficient to focus marketing efforts on building a small set
of good customers rather than using the shotgun approach of
mass-market advertising to deliver a message to thousands of people
who couldn't care less about your product or service, Godin writes.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to build lasting relationships with consumers. And
with the cost of sending e-mail small, the expense of sending
frequent messages that can build customer loyalty and future sales
is negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permission marketing cuts through the clutter and allows a
marketer to speak to prospects as friends, not strangers,'' Godin
writes. ``The personalized, anticipated, frequent and relevant
communication has infinitely more impact than a random message
displayed in a random place at a random moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Godin's book is more than a primer on Web-based direct
marketing. It reminds marketers of some fundamentals that can help
transform a wayward shopper into a customer for life.
</P>
<P>
   The author weaves a variety of examples from outside the realm
of cyberspace to illustrate the power that ``permission marketing''
can wield in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the best-known permission marketing campaigns of
all time is American Airlines' frequent-flyer rewards program.
Customers hand over key personal information to the airline in
exchange for rewards that ultimately make them more loyal customers
of the airline. American Airlines then takes the information
collected from its reward program to offer users sets of coupons
and services tailored to match their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the one-to-one communication power of the Web,
consumers may expect more companies to begin offering rewards to
shoppers who will spend the time listening to their sales pitches
and share information.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies that are most aggressive in forging these
bonds with consumers will have the inside track on selling to users
_ perhaps for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every industry, just a few companies will end up with the
permission to market to a huge number of qualified customers,''
Godin writes. ``And when that happens, these companies _
gatekeepers _ will start to exert power.''

   STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian
McDiarmid, Ahmed Best, Terence Stamp, Ray Park, Frank Oz &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by George Lucas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 132 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In a galaxy far, far away, the time is a generation before the
original ``Star Wars'' (1977), and (no huge surprise here) the
powerful are about to dispose of some inconvenient little folk.
</P>
<P>
   For bureaucratic reasons that don't seem to matter much, the
tiny planet of Naboo is singled out for attack by the giant Trade
Federation, which is controlled by an electrostatic see-through
presence named Darth Sidious. Naboo's Queen Amidala (Ms. Portman),
a diminutive teen-ager with a startlingly throaty voice but not
much in the way of a defense force, must succumb and is taken
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Amidala, though, has the allegiance of two Jedi knights, the
wise older hand Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and the able but
inexperienced Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor). Together the pair
dismantle scores of Federation soldiers (robotic contraptions
called droids) with their light sabers and eventually rescue the
Queen, who determines to mount a resistance.
</P>
<P>
   On the remote planet of Tatooine, the knights encounter Anakin
Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a tow-headed 9-year-old boy with a gift of
gab and a genius for things mechanical. And Qui-Gon Jinn senses
more: the lad may look like a refugee from ``Leave It to Beaver''
but the Force is clearly with him. Train him right and he could be
a knight among knights.
</P>
<P>
   For now, young Skywalker runs away with the pod race, a wildly
exciting contest between jet-powered chariots that does ``Ben Hur''
proud. Later he hops in a star fighter and, though he can barely
see over the dashboard, plunges into the climactic battle for
Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The two knights duel furiously with their light sabers
and there are big battle scenes, with armies laid to waste and
space ships erupting in great orange fireballs. But the violence is
bloodless and often more industrial than fleshly or disturbing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE For all the ``Star Wars'' fanaticism, this is also a
children's film. Convoluted in its details, the story is easy to
follow in broad outline. Creatures tend to be amiable cartoon
critters. Serious matters of villainy are frequently forgotten at
the sight of the next big vista _ an enormous cityscape, a vast
space colony, a stadium for a half-million spectators _ which is
this movie's strong point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;

   THE MUMMY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Stephen Sommers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 134 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Having misbehaved with the Pharaoh's mistress, a priest named
Imhotep (Vosloo) is whisked off to Hamunaptra, city of the dead,
where he is put to an unimaginably horrible death. Let him lie, the
legend goes, or he will arise and revisit the plagues upon the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Try to make that stick three millennia later. Pounding up to
Hamunaptra on horse and camel in 1923, scholars and grave robbers
get to the sarcophagus. ``He's still juicy!'' exclaims Evelyn (Ms.
Weisz), a budding Egyptologist.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of the box, Imhotep (who in fully restored form
resembles Kojak) feeds on the innards of stray adventurers, but
what he needs to really get rolling are the contents of several
golden jars.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with defending the interlopers, the dashing Rick
O'Connell ( Fraser), a kind of Harrison Ford knock-off, races all
over the desert blasting away at zombies with a brace of pistols
and rescuing Evelyn and others. ``I'm a librarian,'' she says. Fine
but she has only seconds to decipher an inscription that will save
them all.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Pitched gun and sword battles produce dozens of dead,
but then many of the victims were dead already. Some situations
promise true horror but shy away at the last second. Flesh-eating
beetles provide the nastiest moments. On balance, there is little
gore and the violence isn't very real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX It's on the minds of Evelyn and Rick, not to mention poor
Imhotep, who wants to resurrect his ancient beloved, but nothing
transpires. &QL;

   AGES 3-9 This movie rides on its special effects, many of them
in the horror vein. That will frighten many young children. &QL;

   TEA WITH MUSSOLINI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith, Lily
Tomlin, Charlie Lucas and Baird Wallace &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Franco Zeffirelli &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 117 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Florence in 1935 is home to a tight-knit group of Englishwomen
of eccentric demeanor who all but worship at the grave of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning and fondly chide their American friends, Georgie
(Ms. Tomlin) and the big-hearted Elsa (Cher), a former Ziegfeld
girl who collects rich husbands. ``Amazing how they can even
vulgarize ice cream,'' sniffs Lady Hester (Dame Maggie), leader of
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Then into their midst falls a little boy named Luca (Charlie
Lucas), the illegitimate son of a deceased friend. Taking pity,
Mary (Ms. Plowright) shelters and tutors him until, with the winds
of war building, he is sent to school in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In Florence, black-shirted gangs of Fascists have begun to make
life difficult for the English. Lady Hester finds that hard to
understand since she has gone to Rome and has had tea with
Mussolini, who gave her his assurances that her little colony will
be allowed to carry on as always.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, the women are herded into genteel
confinement. Luca returns a young man and surprisingly un-Nazified.
Together, they resist the German occupation and strike a blow for
art.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Fascist squads yell and break things, but they are
dissuaded or distracted before physical harm is done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Elsa is shown in bed with a cad, but the scene is discreet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 This is an unusual choice for children, but an
evocation of time and place is a nice change of pace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Probably not, but certain teen-agers would like
the film if they gave it a chance.

VARIOUS/``SWING WEST!'' (Razor &AMP; Tie)
<TEXT>
<P>
   This excellent series, packaged as three separate discs titled
``Bakersfield,'' ``Guitar Slingers'' and ``Western Swing,'' surveys
California country with items from Bob Wills, Rose Maddox, the
Farmer Boys and Merle Travis. The first volume illustrates how the
raw, earthy sound produced in central California by Haggard and
others during the '50s was at odds with Nashville's pop-friendly
output. Standouts on the guitar disc include the brilliant Jimmy
Bryant, James Burton and Joe Maphis, each with a different approach
to the Fender Telecaster but sharing a common ground. On the final
volume, much of the sophisticated Western swing by the likes of
Spade Cooley, Tex Williams and Wills points toward rock 'n' roll.

   REGINA CARTER/``RHYTHMS OF THE HEART'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   The classically trained Carter shows the range of her abilities
as a violinist on this enjoyably eclectic disc that includes sounds
ranging from Latin to lounge. Four of the 10 tracks feature the
smooth piano work of Kenny Barron; elsewhere Carter duets with
Cameroonian guitarist Richard Bona and backs singer Cassandra
Wilson on a silky ``Papa Was a Rollin' Stone.'' Toss in a little
bossa nova and a strong hard-bop influence and you have a playfully
smart album from a singular talent. 3 1/2 stars

   BACKSTREET BOYS/``MILLENNIUM'' (Jive)
</P>
<P>
   With their formulaic blend of r&AMP;b and Euro-pop now assimilated
on all sides, Backstreet offers a near-copy of their enormously
successful debut disc, complete with a handful of innocuous upbeat
tracks that sound almost exactly like last year's smash ``Everybody
(Backstreet's Back).'' The ballads, too, break little new ground,
aside from the well-crafted bubblegum hit, ``I Want It That Way,''
which you can't help humming after one hearing. With all the
competition these boys face, it remains to be seen how much longer
the teen-pop quintet will be on easy street. 2 stars &QL;

   VARIOUS/``BLUEGRASS MANDOLIN EXTRAVAGANZA'' (Acoustic Disc)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too many virtuosos can spoil the gumbo. Fortunately
that's not the case with this all-star concoction, which serves
both as a thoughtful, thorough primer on bluegrass mandolin music
and as a showcase for several of the genre's top pickers.
Confidently subtitled ``A Complete &AMP; Perfect Compendium of
Bluegrass Mandolin Artistry,'' this cross-generational mash note is
co-produced by Ronnie McCoury, whose guitar-playing father, Del,
was briefly a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys, and the
ubiquitous David ``The Dawg'' Grisman, a pioneer in crossover
bluegrass/folk/klezmer collaborations. The other artists _ mandolin
players Sam Bush, Jesse McReynolds, Bobby Osborne, Ricky Skaggs,
Frank Wakefield, Buck White and McCoury pere on rhythm guitar _
demonstrate the amazing grace and wistfulness, the sacred and
profane passions that can be coaxed from this venerable instrument.
From the gospel-inflected ``Wayfaring Stranger'' to the neo-trad
yearnings of ``Ashokan Farewell,'' a tremolo-style fiddle waltz, a
bluesy Monroe-esque piece (``McCoury Blues'') and the tricky time
signatures of ``Mexican Stomp,'' this collection is crafted with a
warm, funky spontaneity (it was recorded live in Nashville) and
assembled with a scholarly yet unfussy eye. Monroe, the project's
patron saint, is honored with no less than six covers, including
two very different arrangements of ``Blue Moon of Kentucky.'' 3

   ROBBIE WILLIAMS/``THE EGO HAS LANDED'' (Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Like George Michael, Williams has a U.K. teen-pop past and a
large adult following in the present tense. The ex-Take That member
sings forceful, well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that will surely
earn him a global audience. This U.S. debut, culle2zfrom two
British discs, is a winner, revealing an earthiness, depth and
sense of humor we frankly didn't expect. Among the better moments
are ``No Regrets'' and the biting ``Karma Killer,'' in which the
star lashes out at a former manager. 3 stars

   SNOOP DOGG/``TOP DOGG'' (NO LIMIT)
</P>
<P>
   While an obvious improvement over his previous effort for Master
P's gangsta-rap assembly line, Snoop's latest is still a far cry
from his glory days with Dr. Dre in the early '90s. The dull,
synthetic backing tracks and silly cameos from about a dozen of No
Limit's generic rap roster do little to give ``Top Dogg'' much
shelf life, although the album takes off briefly when Warren G.
lends a hand on ``Don't Tell.'' As is common with No Limit
releases, the CD booklet is packed with lurid ads for upcoming
releases, footwear and, most improbably, a Master P action figure.

   SOUNDTRACK/``FELICITY'' (Hollywood)
</P>
<P>
   TV's popular ``Felicity'' exposes an enormous amount of music
each week which in turn causes a surge in album sales. This witty
and adventurous collection offers 15 tracks from the popular show's
first season, most notably Heather Nova's poignant ``Heart and
Shoulder,'' Joe Henry's lively ``Angels'' and Joan Jones' lyrical
``Everyday Down.'' Of special note is ``Puddle of Grace'' by
``Felicity'' co-star Amy Jo Johnson as a tribute to her late mom.
This soundtrack proves TV tie-ins don't have to be numbingly
predictable. 3 stars

   CRANBERRIES/``BURY THE HATCHET'' (Island)
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year break, Ireland's Cranberries rebound with their
fourth album and the results are distinctive if disappointing.
Built around Delores O'Riordan's limited but recognizable vocals,
the band retains its jangly sound but can't come up with enough
memorable material to fill the album. Lyrically, there's not a lot
going on either _ in fact, nothing here comes close to the band's
past hits, ``Zombie,'' ``Linger'' and ``Ode to My Family.'' In the
end, ``Bury the Hatchet'' works best buried somewhere in the
background. 2 stars

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much has been made of the fact that British culture
has of late been flooding these shores with almost colonial aplomb.
Just look at Broadway, the argument goes: it's British; British;
British; ``Cats''; British, British. (Come to think of it, ``Cats''
is British, too.)
</P>
<P>
   British film, too, seems to be everywhere, from variations on
Shakespeare to ``The Winslow Boy,'' which though directed by David
Mamet, whom nobody would mistake for English, is a movie  &UR; all about
England &LR; . Paranoia sets in quickly: everywhere one looks there are
Young British Artists or old British television programs or new
British plays. Is that a cricket match? Are you in the mood for
steak and kidney pie? What, pray tell, is David Hare writing now?!?
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the hemming and hawing about the Anglofication
of American life, very few cultural connoisseurs have bothered
trying out all these dandy English imports.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, did.
</P>
<P>
   My mission was simple: to immerse myself during a mere 48 hours
in all things British, from food and drink (with an emphasis,
understandably, on the latter) to sports and sounds to theater and
art. It would take Bondian endurance (as in Bondian, James
Bondian), but I felt up to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   I cheated a bit by boning up on some of the current crop of
British theater and cinema before the weekend, enjoying showings of
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' and other film imports, as
well as most of the Broadway offerings. And to help in my endeavor,
I picked up a copy of that cheeky London import Time Out New York
hoping the magazine's writers and listings might divulge where
Brits in New York go to find things from home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I would have to dig a bit, and travel a lot. Despite the
hype, this supposed British invasion is far less overt, and far
more enjoyable, than the accounts might suggest. Indeed, the bits
of Anglia I found in New York were pleasant, polite and reserved,
just like a proper English gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   My weekend began at dusk on a recent Friday in the West West
End, or as New Yorkers still quaintly call it, the theater
district.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway has nine recent productions that arrived after passing
through London's West End: ``Amy's View,'' ``Art,'' ``Cabaret,''
``Closer,'' ``The Iceman Cometh,'' ``The Lonesome West,'' ``Not
About Nightingales'' ``Via Dolorosa'' and ``The Weir.'' Not all are
entirely British; ``The Iceman Cometh,'' by Eugene O'Neill, and
``Not About Nightingales,'' Tennessee Williams' recently discovered
first play, are by American playwrights. But much of the creative
talent that brought these productions to life speaks the Queen's
English.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the imports have drawn strong reviews. Even ones
receiving mixed reviews have a certain sociological value. Those
still laboring under the no-sex-please-we're-British myth might do
well to check out ``Closer,'' by Patrick Marber, which offers more
carnal knowledge than your average Times Square peep booth.
</P>
<P>
   I chose ``Amy's View,'' Hare's loving take on the life of that
stateliest of British creatures, the brilliant if aging actress.
Playing the lead role is Dame Judi Dench, who is typecast, albeit
terrifically. The play, set in a London suburb, passed by quickly
and only whetted my appetite for proper accents and strangely named
products. But one would have to wait until teatime for that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after the theater, I sought the British new wave's
latest swell, the electronic dance music known by names like trance
and techno and house, oh my. The British artists who make these
sounds are part of any self-respecting disk jockey's collection,
but some major New York nightclubs have devoted whole nights to the
music. Twilo, the cavernous club on West 27th Street in Chelsea, is
considered a hub for British beats. On my Friday night out, the
club featured a major London drum-'n'-bass act, Planet V.
</P>
<P>
   I also sampled an act that I had seen advertised, something
called Great British House, a weekly DJ party devoted to ``London
underground house'' music. An organizer, Tom Joseph, a Londoner,
described it thus: ``It's more funky and tuneful than just hard. We
try to have a very funky sound. It's more funky-tuneful house
rather than big-room house.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha.
</P>
<P>
   The party is usually held at Vanity on East 23rd Street, a
standard lounge scene with deep red curtains, $7 vodkas and cozy
low-slung couches. The crowd was in its mid-20s and dancing to the
beat in a medium-size back room. There didn't seem anything
particularly British to me, but I did have untrained ears.
Everybody seemed to be grooving in a funky, tuneful, decidedly
un-big room way. After a while, I was knackered and went home.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuppa With Class
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the high point was afternoon tea.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen hotels and teahouses in Manhattan offer a
proper British tea. I had never done tea, however, so when I
entered Lady Mendl's Tea Salon, on Irving Place, I'll admit I was a
bit nervous. Was there a protocol to be followed? Were you supposed
to drink as much tea as possible, or nurse a single cup? Would
there be multiple spoons?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I had brought a companion with a cool head. A nice
young man in a tie met us at the door and took our names. We waited
for a bit in a parlor, where I noticed I was the only man of about
a dozen nicely dressed women. That ratio would change a bit as tea
approached, but the event was a predominantly ladylike activity.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Mendl's is part of the Inn at Irving Place, an upscale bed
and breakfast with a decidedly English air. Light and airy, the tea
parlor is decorated in a genteel fashion, complete with dried
flowers, deep rugs and lamps with fringed shades. A bushel of
umbrellas sat in a basket by the door. I was only slightly
surprised to find a harpist playing while we took tea.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon tea usually includes finger sandwiches, scones with
jam and clotted cream in addition to all manner of delicious
amenities, from cookies to cake. Lady Mendl's was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Cucumber sandwiches?'' quipped my partner. ``That's what we
used to fix when there was nothing else in the fridge.'' (She would
be converted.)
</P>
<P>
   At Lady Mendl's, visitors are first offered a tea menu complete
with exotic blends and more commonplace selections like Earl Grey.
I chose the English breakfast tea, which was served in an antique
silver teapot from 1874.
</P>
<P>
   The first course was a small salad, a concession, I figured, to
the calorie explosion that was about to occur. While I nibbled I
perused ``The East India Company Book of Tea'' by Antony Wild
(HarperCollins, 1994), where I discovered that the world's most
expensive tea was Makaibari Flowery Tippy Golden Flowery Orange
Pekoe, or FTGFOP for short, an exotic blend that fetched $360 a
kilogram in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After courses of salmon, cucumber and mozzarella sandwiches;
scones, jam and clotted cream, and cookies, I was stuffed. We
passed on the final course, a chocolate mousse cake, determined to
work off the meal in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Our plan? To hit three British art exhibitions, visit a shop run
by and for British expatriates and pop by the British Open, a pub.
I had about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Completely Different
</P>
<P>
   Two exhibitions were on the same block, West 22nd Street in
Chelsea. The first, at the Brent Sikkema Gallery, showed the work
of Yinka Shonibare, a much-praised English-born, Nigerian-bred
artist. The show is anchored by two large photographs of Shonibare
in Victorian surroundings. The artist's message, critics say, is
partially about skewing perceptions of traditional Britain and its
aristocratic norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jolly good,'' I thought, and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street at the Dia Center for the Arts, the Scottish
video artist Douglas Gordon was apparently up to his usual tricks.
Gordon thrives on visual illusions, I discovered from the program.
This exhibition, called ``Left Is Right and Right Is Wrong and Left
Is Wrong and Right Is Right,'' consists of the same 1949 noir film
``Whirlpool'' shown on two side-by-side screens.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that one version includes only the odd-numbered
frames, the other only the even, leading to a subtle, hypnotic
flicker. Hypnotic flicker. Hypnotic flicker. Hypnotic flicker . . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking away from the movie, we headed south to Soho and the
Lehmann Maupin Gallery to see its show of Tracey Emin's work. Ms.
Emin, 36, is part of the school of artists known as YBA, or Young
British Artists, known for daring esthetic endeavors and a naughty
demeanor. Members of the group include provocateurs like Damien
Hirst, who exhibits dead animals in formaldehyde, and Marc Quinn,
who depicted a dead man's head made of frozen blood. These artists
are very much in vogue after a recent successful showcase at the
Royal Academy of Arts in London. Their exhibition will travel to
the Brooklyn Museum of Art in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Emin's first solo show in New York, ``Every Part of Me's
Bleeding,'' includes an ample supply of biography, including dozens
of crudely drawn self-portraits in various states of undress and
sexual contortion. It also includes an apparently well-used seaside
shanty and a confessional film about Ms. Emin's early sexual
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   After the YBA, I needed something fortifying. I needed to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a Visit to the Dentist
</P>
<P>
   Many British merchants and fashionistas have been laying down
roots in New York, from the wild mod designs of Paul Smith on Fifth
Avenue to Thomas Pink's esteemed Savile Row shirts on Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   For more minor needs, smart shoppers also know that many
Chinatown merchants carry British delicacies like chewy Fruit
Pastilles candies and Marmite spread.
</P>
<P>
   The mother lode of such treats is Myers of Keswick, a spiffy
English grocery on Hudson Street in the Village. Nearby on
Greenwich Avenue, Carry On Tea and Sympathy, in whose sister
restaurant I would later dine, also sells goodies. But Myers has
the range, from homemade Cumberland pork sausages to such fiendish
inventions as mushroom ketchup and Wheetabix. And the shop's
purveyor, Peter Myers, is as friendly as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Warm Beer, Strong Whiskey
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until I encountered the British Open that I began to
feel truly in the British mix.
</P>
<P>
   The pub, on East 59th Street, is a generally friendly
establishment attired with golf clubs, bobbies' hats and a giant
British flag over the bar. Soccer and politics are big topics of
conversation; British tabloids are often laid out on the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Once I had settled in comfortably, I noticed the large, blurry
bloke on me left.
</P>
<P>
   He was chest-to-chest with a glass of whiskey. Our repartee was
short and sweet: He asked if I were British. No, I said, American.
Then he inquired about whether I would like to buy him a drink. I
declined. Finally, he inquired if I had any nude pictures of my
sister. Not today, I said.
</P>
<P>
   He grumbled and stumbled out into the street. I've missed him
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender, a polite young man in a shirt and tie, apologized
profusely. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I was a bit
flattered. Only 24 hours on the job, I thought to myself, and
already people are mistaking me for British.
</P>
<P>
   Updated Downstairs
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was spent in front of the telly, tuned to Channel
13, a public television station that true Anglophiles know is a
secret outlet for the best of the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   I sat through the ``Vicar of Dibley,'' a British clergy-comedy,
before finally getting to ``Berkeley Square.'' (Pronounced Barkley
Square, thank you.)
</P>
<P>
   The show, about a group of nannies circa 1902, has a devoted
following in this country for good reason; it is a soap opera par
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to the teaser before the program began: ``Hannah
outshines Isabel at a luncheon, Tom snaps under pressure and causes
a shooting accident, and Lydia visits her family and receives an
ultimatum from Hugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Though I hadn't seen it before, midway through I was rapt. (Hugh
is such a cad.) With tired feet and a house full of nannies, I was
in good hands for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gooooaaaaal! Beer!  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was all about sport. So at 11:30 in the morning there I
was, shoulder to shoulder in a bar with 200 rabid soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   The locale was Nevada Smith's, an East Village bar with a
fraternity-friendly reputation. But on most Saturday and some
Sunday mornings, Nevada Smith's is transformed into a perfect place
to watch live soccer games beamed by satellite from Britain and
other points European.
</P>
<P>
   Eight televisions, including a giant screen, circle the bar.
With the windows blacked over (it is very dark) and the speakers
turned up high (it is very loud) the atmosphere is as close to an
actual game as you can get. Raucous cheers and club chants break
out at every goal. Club jerseys are common; conversation is not.
Eyes remained glued to the televisions.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived on this morning, the mood was tense. Manchester
United, the bar's official team, was losing its final game of the
season, a loss that could cost it the championship. Most people
were rooting for Manchester, though a few detractors were hunched
at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Though I understood the basics of soccer, I was uncertain about
the particulars: Was the red team winning? The white? Someone?
Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a player in red broke along the pitch's flank and
somehow curled a shot into the corner of the net. A roar of joy
exploded throughout the bar. Men jumped and screamed and hugged and
kissed. I still had no idea what was going on, but I got goose
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   As the game progressed, I became increasingly engrossed, getting
tips from the owner, Paddy McCarthy, and from a helpful English
customer, Garry Jones. Phrases like ``nice touch'' and ``good
ball'' took on new meaning. And when Manchester took the lead, I
cheered, too.
</P>
<P>
   I inched my way out of the bar after our glorious victory with
the sounds of the Manchester fight song ringing in my ears.
Luckily, my next athletic adventure would be significantly more
sedate.
</P>
<P>
   Organized Loafing
</P>
<P>
   Cricket, which is currently holding its world championships, is
exceedingly popular in Britain and in many of its former colonies,
except this one. Still, there are outposts of enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 teams compete regularly in New York and its
suburbs, said Paul DaSilva, president of the Nassau-New York
Cricket Association. They play on pitches, or cricket fields, in
Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, in Marine Park in Brooklyn and on
Randall's Island. The game requires a large circular pitch, which
DaSilva said limits where it can be played. Many local players are
of West Indian, Caribbean or Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   On DaSilva's recommendation, the match I chose to watch was just
outside the city, in East Rockaway on Long Island. He said the two
best teams in the area would be matched off. I took his word for
it.
</P>
<P>
   DaSilva and a group of other cricket officials patiently
explained the complex rules. What happened was essentially this:
There were two teams in fine, clean uniforms, and a ball, mallets
and collection of sticks known as wickets. Beyond that, I have no
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But what did penetrate my confusion was the grace and peace of
the scene. Players lounged and talked. A breeze blew in off the
Atlantic. Occasionally there would be a flurry of action, and then
peace would return.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed an hour or so; the match would continue another three.
On the drive back to Manhattan, I passed several other matches
under way in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. One was
wedged, rather symbolically I thought, between two baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   God Save Bangers and Mash
</P>
<P>
   To end my experiment, I chose the unofficial embassy of all
British expatriates: Tea and Sympathy. This tiny restaurant in the
Village is the city's best-known outpost for complexities of
British cuisine, from bangers and mash (sausage and potatoes) to
shepherd's pie (meat and potatoes).
</P>
<P>
   With only about 10 tables, the restaurant is almost always
packed. But at 6 p.m. I found a spot for myself and two friends,
near a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   We started with a delicious Stilton rarebit (melted cheese on
toast). My friends had shandy (ginger ale and beer), while I chose
Ribena (black-currant concentrate and water). Bangers, lamb and
chicken followed, all with a deep mushroom gravy and assisted by
products like Branston Original Pickle and Colman's Classic Mint
Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As the meal settled, I felt a wash of satisfaction. The weekend
had left me feeling full. I had only sampled the local British
fare, but it was a loverly taste.
</P>
<P>
   And as I pushed away from the table and into the night, I
realized the best part of enjoying England in New York: being able
to walk back home.

GROWING BIOTECH INDUSTRY IS DRIVEN BY EVOLUTION

   SEATTLE _ A child born today stands a good chance of living into
the 22nd century.
</P>
<P>
   As futuristic as it sounds, it's a reality. And it's owed, in
part, to a revolution in medical drug discovery that has taken
place over the plast 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   That revolution hasn't happened in big pharmaceutical companies.
It has taken a new type of organization _ one that combines
academic curiosity with entrepreneurial drive, creative thinking
and quick reaction times to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   And it's given rise to a whole new business sector: The
biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech companies are the research engines of drug
discovery,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology
Industry Organization, a Washington, D.C.-based trade organization
that is bringing 5,000 members of the industry to Seattle this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not looking for another aspirin, another me-too
drug.,'' Feldbaum said. ``They're seeking cures for diseases where
no therapies exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the life forms that spawned it, the biotechnology industry
in the Seattle area has grown by cell division.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have split apart, budding off new start-ups until
they've colonized a large and complex ecosystem, one that comprises
about 100 companies with more than $200 million in revenues and
more than 7,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   New companies are born at the rate of about six a year, more
than double the rate of a decade ago. About one-third of today's
biotech companies have started up in the past five years, and more
than half of them have either historical or current ties to the
University of Washinwt~9

   &UR; So, That's Who Kellerman Is! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to try to get this done 19 years ago, and now I can
hold it in my hand,'' said Herb Gardner. It's been a long wait for
the film with the endless title, but on Tuesday ``Who Is Harry
Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?''
will be released by Fox for the first time on tape.
</P>
<P>
   An original and surreal film about the unraveling of the world's
most famous rock composer, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman,
``Kellerman'' is directed by Ulu Grosbard and written by Gardner,
the playwright and director, who adapted it from his short story.
The music is by Shel Silverstein, the writer and cartoonist who
died this month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 the film opened to mixed reviews but it drew audiences
substantial enough to lead Gardner to believe that the run might be
extended. ``It belonged to Cinema Center, which was CBS's adventure
in making movies,'' he said. ``We called to find out what their
plans were, and there was no more Cinema Center.'' CBS had suddenly
left the movie business and somehow ``Kellerman,'' physically and
legally, got lost in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner started looking for it in earnest in 1981. ``Nobody knew
who owned it,'' he said. ``It had disappeared.'' He found that odd,
particularly for a film with a major star. Hoffman plays Georgie
Soloway, a man with multiple hit songs, his face on the cover of
Time magazine, all the women he wants (none of whom he can love), a
triplex on top of the General Motors Building and crushing attacks
of loneliness that in his hallucinations have him sailing off his
terrace into the void. ``Send me an overdose of anything,'' he
instructs his pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   Georgie's imagined plunges land him on the couch of his
psychiatrist (Jack Warden), a man constantly changing identities in
Soloway's fantasies, which include the notion that a man named
Kellerman is spreading vicious untruths about him. ``Picture going
into a studio today and saying we have this part where the analyst
sings like Ray Charles,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also stars Barbara Harris, who was nominated for an
Academy Award for her performance as the saddest and most
formidable of Georgie's women. ``For the several scenes she shares
with Hoffman,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ``
`Harry Kellerman' becomes as touching as it is funny. Otherwise
this collapse of identity in a man who apparently has everything
has a flat, tinny sound. But, then, that may be just what the end
of New York will sound like.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Gardner found the film (CBS had it all along). Last
year ``Kellerman'' played at the Film Forum as part of a double
bill with the acclaimed ``Thousand Clowns,'' adapted by Gardner
from his Broadway play. ``We're always looking for things that
haven't been out there,'' said Bruce Goldstein, the Film Forum's
programming director. ``They don't have to be masterpieces. Just
interesting work.''
</P>
<P>
   And now there is the video. ``We really liked this movie,''
Gardner said. ``We had a good time. We did a number of risky things
and we loved playing with the style and the cutting and the music.
For it to be lost was depressing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Saving Private Ryan &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Restoring passion and dignity to the war movie, Steven
Spielberg's film is nominally the story of a detail of soldiers led
by a captain (Tom Hanks, left) on a mission to find a private (Matt
Damon) and return him to a family that has already lost its three
other sons in combat. On a larger level, it salutes the generation
that fought the last great war by telling its story with no
received notions, dramatic or ideological.
</P>
<P>
   At either end are two stupendous battles. In the Normandy surf
and on the beaches, men are blown apart for a totally believable
and intensely uncomfortable half-hour. Between clashes the rhythms
of war and the natures of the men who fight are beautifully caught
by a screenplay that stands aside and lets impressions form
naturally in the hands of an indie-bred cast that includes Edward
Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies and
Adam Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he did in `Schindler's List,''' Janet Maslin wrote in The
New York Times, `` Spielberg uses his preternatural storytelling
gifts to personalize the unimaginable, to create instantly
empathetic characters and to hold an audience spellbound from the
moment the action starts.'' &QL;

Hearst columnist, Stanley Tucci nicely captures a sentimental tough
guy who favored his fans against the big shots he raced around
after. ``It's a busy show,'' Walter Goodman wrote in The New York

KEY DISCOVERIES IN BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH SPAWNED AN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The biotech industry evolved out of the primordial
soup of basic biological research in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, biologists made two key discoveries.
Scientists Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer
of the University of California-San Francisco, developed a
technique known as recombinant DNA, or gene splicing. For the first
time, researchers could take DNA out of one organism and insert it
into another. For example, they could take the gene for a human
protein, such as insulin, and insert it into the genome of a
bacterium. That new gene would direct the bacteria to produce the
foreign protein, turning the bacteria into tiny drug factories.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, scientist George Kohler developed the
technique for producing monoclonal antibodies _ highly purified
strains of antibodies that acted as molecular probes, letting
scientists fish out selected proteins in the body for study.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these new technologies _ recombinant DNA and monoclonal
antibodies _ were tools in search of applications. Scientists now
had a molecular hammer and saw. Now they had to figure out what to
build and where to build it.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1980, there was no way to capitalize on university
research since most basic scientific research was federally funded
and the government retained title to it. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980
changed that, giving universities the right to own and profit from
inventions that came out of their research. When the courts upheld
a patent on the Cohen-Boyer recombinant DNA technique _ a key
decision that permitted the patenting of biological molecules and
techniques for the first time _ all the pieces that would give rise
to the biotech industry were in place.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning that sparked these ingredients to life, however,
was the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, a little-known firm called Genentech in South San
Francisco went public.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock went out at $35 a share, shot to $89 a share 20
minutes later, and closed at $70 after ricocheting up and down like
a rock in a tumbler. That first day's trading would come to
symbolize the industry's volatile relationship with the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market gave biotech companies a way to get cash for
their discoveries. That gave venture capitalists an incentive to
finance startups, and universities a way to transfer their research
to the real world. The biotech industry was born.

NEW TREATMENT EASES THE PAIN FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SUFFERER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lisa Caswell was in pain. Excruciating, stabbing pain.
The kind that felt like ``someone taking a hunting knife and
sticking it in your wrist and moving it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times she went to the emergency room in the middle of the
night. She was told there was nothing wrong. She was referred to a
psychiatrist. She was taken aside and asked if she was being
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   It took nine months before she learned what was wrong with her.
Caswell, then 33, had rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to me,'' said Caswell, now 41. ``I, like most
other people, didn't realize the mean age of patients is 30 to 50
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   But rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 2.5 million in the
United States, can be a crippling, even fatal, disease. Traditional
drug therapies have focused on treating symptoms of the disease,
which causes pain, swelling and eventual deterioration of joints
and connective tissue.
</P>
<P>
   As scientists have begun dissecting the underlying disease
process, however, they've discovered new ways to intervene at a
molecular level in the inflammatory process.
</P>
<P>
   Several biotech companies, including Immunex Corp. in Seattle,
and Cypress Bioscience Inc., which has manufacturing facilities in
Redmond, Wash., have developed novel new approaches to treat the
disease based on this new understanding of how the body turns on
its own tissues.
</P>
<P>
   For Caswell, whose disease was particularly aggressive,
participating in clinical trials to test some of these new
arthritis therapies has made a huge difference in her quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Before trying experimental treatments, doctors tried every other
drug combination they could think of to help her. At one point, she
was taking high doses of six drugs at the same time, and the side
effects were worsening her physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile she was losing strength. She couldn't get out of the
bathtub by herself. Her wrists registered ``zero'' in strength
tests. She needed a wheelchair to get around.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after participating in a trial of the Prosorba
column, an innovative blood filtering treatment developed by a
small Redmond, Wash., company and later bought by Cypress
Bioscience. Prosorba was recently approved by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Mason Research Center in Seattle has been investigating
both how the filtration process appears to interrupt the disease
process, as well as its effects on patients.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment appeared to work for Caswell. After 12 weekly
blood filtration sessions, she felt stronger and was able to pare
back her other medications. Although she still has chronic pain,
she can walk, drive, grocery shop by herself and use a laptop
computer. In July she will defend her doctoral thesis in clinical
psychology with a specialization in helping patients adjust to
traumatic injury or chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life now is a lot closer to normal,'' she said. And she
plans to continue enrolling in research trials as long as she's
able. ``I'll keep doing it,'' she said. ``Until they find a cure.''

A SAVVY SCIENTIST GOT A HIT ON HIS FIRST CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Steve Gillis has a reason to look satisfied as he
leans back in the boardroom of Corixa Corp., a biotech company he
founded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, he worked at a lab bench on the seventh
floor of this same building when it belonged to the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Today Corixa, which is developing new cancer vaccines and other
therapeutic drugs, takes up four floors in the old Fred Hutchinson
building and last year brought in $18 million in research revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, 45, made his mark on Seattle's biotech community by
leaving the conventional academic research track to find a new way
to do science. In 1981, he co-founded Immunex Corp., now Seattle's
flagship biotech firm, a move that was considered ``heretical'' at
the time. He left Immunex in 1994 to start Corixa.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still doing things his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Corixa's boardroom, for example, is appointed like a mountain
cabin, complete with fireplace and moose antlers. It's a whimsical
reference to the name of the company, which Gillis, a frustrated
fisherman, named after a fishing fly.
</P>
<P>
   Like fishing, it takes concentration, honed skills and a little
luck to get a yield in the biotech world.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillis waded right in.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Gillis and his colleague, Chris Henney, left Fred
Hutchinson to start Immunex Corp., the biotech industry didn't even
exist.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, industry interest in immunology was running high,
but Fred Hutchinson wasn't used to taking corporate dollars. An
attorney suggested Gillis start his own company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Are you nuts?' '' he said. ``We'd worked so long and
hard to get where we were academically. If we went into industry,
we would be pariahs, second-class (research) citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought again. Federal grants were getting harder to
get. A few months later, he and Henney started Immunex with $1
million in seed capital. Immunex is now Seattle's largest biotech
company, with about $243 million in revenue and more than 1,000
employees. It has a variety of drugs in production or under
development for cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other
diseases, all bioengineered from molecules in the body's own immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started Immunex, we knew several things about science
and zip about business,'' said Gillis. ``We were pretty naive. We
had no idea of what it was like to run a company.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the science guys didn't know much about business, the
business guys they hired knew even less about science.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex's first chief executive officer ``didn't know a T-cell
from a bowling ball,' Gillis said. ``But that was OK back then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to invent things that had never been invented
before, and we couldn't prove existed,'' he said. ``No one had even
cloned a gene for an immune system hormone yet, but we were going
to use this knowledge to somehow make people better.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one had any idea what it was going to take to bring a
drug from the lab bench to the market.
</P>
<P>
   The early biotech companies wanted to become stand-alone drug
companies that discovered, developed, manufactured and marketed
their own products. That approach, however, required about $1
billion to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gillis started Corixa, investors were a lot more
sophisticated _ and realistic _ about the costs of running a
biotech business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused us to think about a different way to be a company.
We're going to discover things,'' he said. ``Then we're going to
license away (our technology) to other pharmaceutical companies.
That way we're not going to burn tremendous amounts of cash, so we
don't have to go to the (stock) market and raise $600 million.''
And there are other differences running a second-generation biotech
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far more competitive today _ far less room to make
mistakes,'' he said. But the goal is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tried to do at Immunex and still doing at Corixa is
trying to make products that will help people based on the science
of immunology.''

A MARRIAGE OF BIOLOGY AND COMPUTERS ON THRESHOLD OF NEW CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle scientists are aiming to grab the reins of one
of the hottest bandwagons in biotechnology and medicine _
bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a marriage of biology and computers. That's
bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates describes the vision this way:
``The two technologies that will dominate the 21st century
scientifically and industrially are biotechnology and information
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Its promise is to genetically assess individuals and tailor
drugs or therapy to best fit them. That's not yet possible, but the
history of medicine shows that benefits accrue en route.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading advocates of bioinformatics is the University
of Washington's Dr. Leroy Hood, recruited to Seattle from the
California Institute of Technology in 1991 after Gates donated $12
million to create a molecular biotechnology department at the UW
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, the UW's William Gates III professor of biomedical
sciences, is a pioneer of automated computerized gene sequencing _
a method for identifying genes. He's a grand vision guy with a
tendency to launch biotechnology companies and then move on to the
next interesting conceptual application.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the speakers at the international Bio '99
conference, talking about the ``Genomic Information Revolution.''
The conference this week was attended by 5,000 scientists and
industry representatives from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hood's latest endeavor is the UW's new Institute for
Quantitative Systems Biology, a public-private venture intended to
exploit the bioinformatics gold mine produced by increasing amounts
of genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biology today is really all about information,'' Hood said.
There are different kinds of data, he said, beginning with the
linear type represented by the DNA helix _ a long, twisted double
chain of units called nucleotide base pairs that make up the
genetic codes of living creatures.
</P>
<P>
   If computers are a two-unit, or digital, system of information,
DNA is a four-unit information system. All the genetic information
in our body is built from combinations of four units, chemical
bases called guanine, cytosine, thymine and adenine (aka G,C,T and
A).
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3 billion of these G,C,T and A bases in the
human genetic code and the nationwide Human Genome Project is a
massive federal effort aimed at identifying the sequence of all
these bases.
</P>
<P>
   But the linear, sequential way of thinking about genetic
information _ in which a string of thousands of G-C-T-A units make
a gene that then makes a protein which in turn makes something
happen biologically _ is becoming outdated, Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Bioinformatics, he said, is about thinking in terms of multiple
genes and proteins operating in networks and feedback loops _ with
each gene or protein seen in the context of a web of interaction.
It's about looking at biology in three dimensions, Hood said, or
even as a four-dimensional system that incorporates the element of
time into a new and more complex assessment of the workings of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a systems approach,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, but how's it done?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous puzzle,'' said Dr. Richard Karp, a UW
professor of computer science and an internationally known expert
in computational biology. Karp acknowledged that the scientific
community is venturing into uncharted waters in bioinformatics. The
exploration is guided by the assumption that powerful computational
tools applied to this massive amount of genetic information will
create an entirely new way of looking at the human body.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't quite glimpsed the new paradigm, Karp said. ``We
just don't have enough information yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Hartwell, president of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle, also thinks bioinformatics will provide
us a new way to look at the body. Hartwell is an internationally
known geneticist and also a genetic peculiarity.
</P>
<P>
   And so are you, he'd tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell's particular peculiarity is that he's
sucrose-intolerant. He self-diagnosed this rare intolerance to the
sugar found in beets or sorghum decades ago and now eats
accordingly. More importantly, he points to his peculiarity as
evidence for the need to ``individualize'' medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of activity right now trying to link genes to
disease,'' Hartwell said. ``But even though we all have the same
genes, they can come in different forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicine today is based on the clinical trial, he said, which
has been an effective tool used to find the best ``magic bullet''
or drug with the best therapeutic effect for the most people.
</P>
<P>
   The current effort to track down genes that cause disease is
also often a magic bullet approach and has been successful in cases
where disorders appear to be largely the result of one
malfunctioning gene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it now appears that most diseases or problems are the result
of many genes and proteins gone awry. Hartwell said medicine needs
to move beyond finding therapies that work for most people most of
the time and toward a a biological model that recognizes our
genetic individuality.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 100,000 genes operating in the human body,
Hartwell said, and each can differ slightly _ a usually benign
variation known as a ``polymorphism.'' If you consider all of the
polymorphic combinations, he said, ``it amounts to more than all
the atoms in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that each of us is absolutely unique,'' Hartwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Friend is one of those attempting to reap benefits
from bioinformatics. On leave from Fred Hutchinson, Friend is
president and chief scientific officer for Kirkland, Wash.-based
Rosetta Inpharmatics.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created to exploit one offspring of this
marriage between computers and biology _ the biochip. The biochip,
or the ``DNA microarray,'' is literally a silicon wafer with
hundreds or even thousands of DNA pieces embedded in it.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies, including Rosetta's California-based
partner Affymetrix, have manufactured these biochips, also known as
microarrays, for years. (Some prefer the term DNA microarray to
emphasize that the biochip isn't, like a computer chip, performing
a function. It's more like a chart allowing a simultaneous read on
thousands of genes or pieces of DNA.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosetta, Friend explained, is using the biochip approach to make
drug discovery more efficient. One way to do this, he said, is to
look at how a drug acts within a network of genes and proteins that
mimic the body's biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drugs work well in some patients and not so well in
others,'' he said. If a biochip can be constructed representing
each patient's complete genetic makeup, he said the drug can be
tested in each one and compared to determine how it affects any of
a hundred gene or protein products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any single gene that changes may or may not be that
significant,'' Friend said. It's the overall ``pattern of
expression'' of all the genes and proteins that can be used to
better identify drug targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Blanchard, formerly part of Hood's department at the UW,
invented the technology that allows Rosetta to look for these gene
or protein patterns.
</P>
<P>
   David Baker, an assistant professor of biochemistry and
bioengineering at the UW, also is digging deeply into
bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and his colleagues are trying to take genetic sequence
information and, with computational help, analyze it to try and
predict the shapes and functions of various proteins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proteins are basically the body's minimachines in the cell and
their structure is important to what they do,'' he said. It's a
three-dimensional structure, Baker said, where even minor changes _
or errors _ can profoundly affect function.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is a hotbed for all types of bioinformatics work, he
said. As evidence of this, he noted that the nation's top
post-doctoral fellowship program in computational biology _
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Sloan Foundation
_ awarded nine fellowships this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four of them were awarded here in Seattle,'' Baker said.
``This is a new area that's growing extremely fast nationally and
we're on top of it.''

THE BIOTECH PROMISE - CURES AND QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The next 50 years of biomedical research will bring
unprecedented advances in curing diseases as well as increasing
social questions about ethics and costs, a panel of biotech experts
said Monday at the opening of BIO '99.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 members of the biotech industry are meeting in
Seattle this week for the annual conference of biotech leaders from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in biomedical research will happen much more quickly in
the next 50 years because of new tools, especially those merging
computer sciences with genetics, said Lee Hartwell, president and
director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
``We will have drugs for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of computers will give scientists the ability to
predict the three-dimensional structures and functions of proteins
based on their genetic sequences, an ability that will help them
design better medications to intervene in disease processes. It
also will help reduce the dependence on animal testing, scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be enormous advances in public health,'' said
Kathryn Zoon, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ``How we pay for
it is a major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is how to make sure such advances are available
in developing countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and
others, cost the United States about $600 billion a year, said
George Rathmann, chairman of ICOS Corp. in Bothell and one of the
industry's early pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs and treatments will cut suffering and eliminate some
costs associated with diseases, but those costs will be replaced by
the cost of the drugs and treatments themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can eliminate suffering, then we ought to be prepared to
pay the price,'' Rathmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating diseases poses other societal problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 50 years will be mind boggling,'' said Dr. Edwin
Krebs, a University of Washington professor who won the Nobel Prize
for medicine in 1992. ``Life expectancy will greatly increase, and
we may start doing something with life span.''
</P>
<P>
   That poses a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is things wear out,'' said Michael Smith,
professor of biotechnology at the University of British Columbia.
``The spare parts issue is going to have to be dealt with. The
question is will it be with our own tissue, or tissue of other
animals?''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions will require public participation and debate, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   And that will require an increasing level of scientific
literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness of science is quite primitive,'' Rathmann said.
The industry has a ``huge responsibility over the next 50 years to
help get information to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell agreed that education is one of the top challenges for
the industry. To survive, the industry needs both a highly trained
labor force and a scientifically literate public, he said. ``Most
of the public has not even had a high school biology class.''
</P>
<P>
   People need to be able to sort out science fact from science
fiction to be able to make informed decisions about the uses of
technology, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   People can watch ``Star Wars'' and tell where real engineering
stops and fantasy engineering takes off, but they have less ability
to discriminate between reality and fantasy fears in biology, he
said. ``We need a scientifically literate citizenry.''

IRISH STYLE: A `STEPSON' GAINS FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Mich.)   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ireland seems to be entering a golden age. There is the promise
of peace. The country is in the midst of a boom: the so-called
Celtic Tiger's economy is growing at a faster rate than Europe's.
Many computer companies have large operations there, and Dublin has
a new International Financial Services Center, where banks like
Chase are congregating.
</P>
<P>
   The new prosperity is fueling the market for houses, especially
grand old mansions in the countryside, and the Irish art and
antiques to fill them. All of which has been great news for auction
houses and dealers in Irish antiques on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property market in Ireland is red hot,'' said Graham
Child, a furniture specialist at Sotheby's, which is holding an
``Irish Sale'' today in London. ``A lot of the old, decaying houses
are being pulled back. The economy has led to the creation of
wealth and a desire to spend the wealth on national things.''
</P>
<P>
   The 405-lot Irish sale has some large 18th- and 19th-century
mahogany dining tables, chairs and sideboards; a rare pair of oval
mirrors with borders decorated with facet-cut studs of blue and
clear glass (expected to sell for $8,000 to $11,200); a circa 1755
architect's table and a graceful mid-18th-century mahogany card
table with a drawer and a typically Irish carved shell on the front
(estimate: $3,200 to $4,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Irish furniture and pictures are going back to
Ireland,'' said Hugo Swire of Sotheby's London. ``The people who
are restoring the big Irish houses have limitless budgets. The
problem is there's not an enormous amount of supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The golden age of Irish furniture-making began about 1720, when
mahogany from the West Indies and South America reached Ireland,
and ended about 1840. The most popular pieces are 18th-century
Irish Georgian antiques. They can be distinguished by their
weathered patina, dense grain, quirky dimensions and deep carvings
of masks and hairy paw feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the furniture was blackened with polish to match the
very dark bog oak, native to Ireland, that was commonly used in
17th-century furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish furniture is often considered the slightly crazed
stepson of English furniture,'' said Clinton Howell, a Manhattan
dealer. ``I have Irish clients who fly over here every year looking
for Irish antiques. Right now I have only one piece left.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a George II mahogany console table with a breche violette
marble top. The apron has elegant gadroon molding and a carved
acanthus; the cabriole legs have carved knees. Its price tag,
$87,500, is hefty, but only last January Christie's New York sold
an Irish George II mahogany side table, circa 1740, with a large
lion mask for $96,000, against an estimate of $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all our Irish furniture is gone,'' said John Snead, of
John and Patricia Snead, private dealers in McLean, Va., who
specialize in Irish long-case clocks. ``I recently sold a fine
Dublin clock to an American collector for about $15,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But the surge in demand for Irish antiques is fairly recent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't sell Irish furniture for large sums five years
ago,'' said Desmond Guinness, an Irish author and connoisseur of
houses and antiques. ``Now it's being avidly collected.'' In 1958
Guinness co-founded the Irish Georgian Society with his fellow
Irishman Desmond FitzGerald, the 29th Knight of Glin, to rescue
decaying Irish houses.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday Guinness gave a party for Kindel Furniture of Grand
Rapids, Mich., at Leixlip Castle, his home in County Kildare. A
passionate patron of all things Irish, Guinness agreed to let
Kindel sell its reproductions of 22 fine Irish antiques in his
Gothic gate lodge as a way for his organization to raise money to
restore other Irish houses.
</P>
<P>
   Chantal O'Sullivan, an Irish dealer with galleries in New York,
Dublin and Kenmare, said: ``For a long time no one wanted Irish
antiques, and they were really collectible. When Irish things
became more fashionable, they became harder and harder to find.''
</P>
<P>
   She is partly responsible for that. An American magazine
recently photographed David Mlinaric, a top British decorator, at
her gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government gives tax breaks to artists of all kinds:
musicians, filmmakers, artists and writers. Ronnie Wood of the
Rolling Stones, members of the band Simple Minds and actors like
Jeremy Irons, Mia Farrow, Anjelica Huston, Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam
Neeson and Miranda Richardson all have houses in Ireland now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Sullivan, who has dined with President and Mrs. Clinton in
Dublin and Washington, sells mostly through New York designers like
Thierry Despont, Bunny Williams, Thomas Jayne, Mario Buatta, Scott
Salvator, Glenn Gissler and David Anthony Easton.
</P>
<P>
   She currently has for sale an Irish mantelpiece made of Italian
marble ($95,000), a 14-foot-by-5-foot mahogany library table (also
$95,000) and an Irish Georgian mahogany blanket chest with carved
shells and its original brasses, circa 1770 ($22,000).
</P>
<P>
   Several of her tables have carved shells or masks. ``The masks
were carved in the likeness of the absent landlords of the house,''
Ms. O'Sullivan said. ``That's why some have hairy faces. It meant
the owner had thick whiskers. If he were mean, the face would be
ugly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Paris dealer, Ariane Dandois, said: ``Everyone is
interested in Irish furniture now. It's English furniture with
fantasy. The shapes are extravagant. It's more macho than English
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dandois offers a rare set of eight Irish Regency giltwood
armchairs made in Dublin about 1820. The arched crest-rails are
carved with lions drinking from a fountain. The armrests have
eagle-head supports. She has attributed the chairs to a
furniture-maker from Italy, James Del Vecchio Sr., who immigrated
to Dublin in the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Dandois, who normally sells 18th-century palace
furniture to the richest clients on earth, starts selling Irish
antiques, it is a clear sign that Irish furniture has joined the
top ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Dillingham in San Francisco and two New York dealers, the Newel
Art Galleries and Philip Colleck, also sell Irish furniture.
</P>
<P>
   There are two unrelated indications of Irish chic. On May 7, the
actress Julia Roberts was one of about 250 people at a book party
at Christie's to celebrate ``West of Ireland Summers: Recipes and
Memories from an Irish Childhood'' (Roberts Rinehart, Boulder,
Colo.), a new book by Tamasin Day-Lewis, sister of the actor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts had such a good time with the Irish guests that she
was an hour late for dinner with a major fashion magazine editor.
</P>
<P>
   Clue No. 2: The Lower East Side Tenement Museum in Manhattan is
adding an Irish immigrant family apartment to its Jewish and
Italian ones. And this just six months after President Clinton
declared the museum's tenement building a National Historic Site.
Maybe he knew that the White House was designed in 1792 by an Irish
immigrant, James Hoban.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Scattered heavy thunderstorms will douse parts of the lower Ohio
and middle Mississippi Valleys as a weakening cold front, bolstered
by a trailing jet stream disturbance, lifts humid air from the Gulf
of Mexico. Severe weather is unlikely, but downpours from storms
could result in a quick inch or two of rain in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, funnel clouds were spotted over the Everglades
National Park in Monroe County in southwest Florida as intense
thunderstorms erupted along a boundary marking the leading edge of
the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico. Friday, these sea-breeze
fronts will again become active along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts
as widely separated thunderstorms produce downpours and frequent
cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thunderstorms will flare over the northern high
plains from western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming to the western
Dakotas and eastern Montana. Here, moist surface winds from the
south-southeast will ascend the westward sloping terrain and then
be further lifted by a compact but potent jet stream disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather is possible, with the greatest risk posed in
Montana and North Dakota near the path of the disturbance. Isolated
supercells, which are individual, massive thunderstorms, may spawn
a few tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty sprinkles or isolated light showers may develop across
parts of southern California as a pool of cold air 18,000 feet
aloft stalls over the region. Meanwhile, sunny, seasonably warm
weather will prevail across much of the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic Seaboards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Miami Ice
</P>
<P>
   Nickel-sized hailstones pelted parts of Miami on Wednesday as an
intense thunderstorm erupted over south Florida. Hail is rather
rare in Florida, particularly in southern counties. Hailstones
often form in the cold upper reaches of Florida thunderstorms where
they are suspended by strong updrafts of air. However, on descent
toward earth, hailstones typically melt before reaching the ground
as they pass warm tropical air at lower altitudes. On Wednesday,
however, a pocket of dry air aloft encouraged evaporation of
meltwater, allowing hailstones to cool and thereby survive to the
ground.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may or may not have anything to do with the
arrival of spring, but Manhattan has broken out in some superb
exhibitions of modern drawings _ arguably the most overtly
delectable of all art forms.
</P>
<P>
   What can compare?

   Drawings in general are like love letters. Personal in touch and
feeling, physically delicate, they reflect an artist's gifts, goals
and influences in the most intimate terms with a minimum of fuss,
muss and production costs. The irresistibility quotient of drawings
compares favorably with those of puppies, kittens or young
children; the instinct is to pick them up, stare at them intently
and ooh and aah. Which is not to say that well-made drawings can't
be imposing or even intimidating, but rather to suggest that they
encourage a kind of emotional liberty and desire for closeness that
paintings and sculptures may not.
</P>
<P>
   All this can go double for drawings made during the last 100
years or so, when the fall of the academy placed a new premium on
formal invention and personal expression. Drawing became as never
before a direct extension of an artist's signature and very nervous
system, and this freedom widened the perception of the medium
itself to include linear expressions of all kinds. Thus it was that
Indian miniatures, Chinese calligraphy and African textiles began
to exert an influence on modern drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Three large exhibitions of mostly 20th-century works form the
basis of this springtime drawing revel. These shows overlap at
regular intervals, creating an engrossing system of
cross-references, mutual illuminations and, at times, reciprocal
criticism. But even more notable are their differences, which stem
primarily from contrasting forms of ownership, connoisseurship and,
in a way, passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting in Depth: Drawings by Grosz, Schwitters, Ernst and
Klee'' at the Museum of Modern Art comes entirely from the museum's
own collection, formed over the years by successive generations of
drawing curators.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``New York Collects: Drawings and Watercolors,
1900-1950,'' at the Pierpont Morgan Library, culls more than 140
drawings from 73 private collections in a city where the building
of such collections can amount to a blood sport. Many of these have
not been exhibited in New York for years, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the Drawing Center in SoHo has taken the most unusual tack.
``Drawn From Artists' Collections'' presents 175 drawings and
paintings on paper, some of which date from the 19th century or
earlier or come from non-Western cultures (Tantric paintings and
Chinese calligraphy).
</P>
<P>
   All have been selected from the collections of 18 well-known
contemporary artists, among them Jasper Johns, Julian Schnabel,
Eric Fischl, Sol LeWitt, Terry Winters, Roy Lichtenstein and
Elizabeth Murray. It is possible to imagine a group of artists who
are less homogeneously rich, famous and from New York, but the
resulting show is one of the season's most thought provoking.
Museum of Modern Art
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting in Depth,'' at the Modern diverges courageously
from the museum's famous preference for French modernism, only to
demonstrate the pervasiveness of its influence. Featuring the
museum's holdings in work by four major German-speaking artists, it
manages to be both exemplary and a little muted and academic in
mood. It's hard to know what would have jazzed it up, perhaps other
works by these artists, or the inclusion of different artists, Max
Beckmann, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Still, basic principles that reverberate through all three shows
are laid out here. First, the modern drawing is established as a
site of endless experimentation and invention that result in its
self-sufficiency as an art form. Equally evident: modernism's
emphasis on form and physical process has provided a foundation
artists of every inclination could build on.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern's show features 14 to 26 works by each artist,
installed in separate galleries, in an order that creates a kind of
sandwich of contrasting sensibilities. First and last are the
drawings of George Grosz and Paul Klee, who explore the expressive
and physical possibilities of line and ground the gridlike
scaffolding of Cubism in realities of their own choosing. For Grosz
this reality was social and political.
</P>
<P>
   His fine insinuating lines repeatedly get at the heart of the
hypocrisy of life in the years following Germany's defeat in World
War I, mercilessly skewering the venality of bureaucrats, generals
and the well-to-do. In ``The End of the Day,'' the weight and
vibration of Grosz's line gives each of four exhausted factory
workers a distinct emotional character and contrasts their
silhouettes with the nearly abstract geometry of the factory
complex behind them.
</P>
<P>
   While remarkably close to Grosz's line in its fineness, Klee's
begins in the interior reality of fantasy and the unconscious,
progresses to some kind of legible sign or hieroglyph and then
lands with dazzling grace on paper to create a visual reality
unlike any other. Klee's arsenal of visual conjurings and physical
effects seems to have been inexhaustible. In ``Errand Boy,'' one of
the less familiar works here, a figure holding a package is
outlined in a heavy austere calligraphy of gray wash that is then
filled with irrepressible effusions of fine pastel stripes and
grids. It's sort of like watching Mozart embellish Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst take Cubist collage
and run with it, again in seemingly opposite directions. With
discarded ticket stubs, labels, buttons and other bits of detritus,
Schwitters' Merz collages invented a small-scale formalism that was
resolutely anchored in the real world. By recycling the most minute
ephemera of everyday life, his carefully composed surfaces
commemorate a touching array of human activities, exchanges and
points of contact _ the mail, movies, trains, cafe life.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst's appetite was more for found images than stray bits of
printed matter and colored paper. Pasting cutout parts of half-tone
images onto larger half-tone images, or drawing on
chromolithographs, he cobbled together a universe as fully imagined
as Klee's, and quite a bit scarier. Sometimes he evoked German
militarism with a bitterness only slightly more veiled than
Grosz's, as in the tanklike monument of ``Farewell My Beautiful
Land of Marie Laurencin,'' of 1919. More often, he evoked the
natural world in unnatural disorder, like the strung-together
organs of a small, colorful collage whose extravagant,
exquisite-corpse title reads: ``Stratified Rocks, Nature's Gift of
Gneiss Lava Iceland Moss 2 Kinds of Lungwort 2 Kinds of Ruptures of
the Perineum Growths of the Heart,'' of 1920.

   Pierpont Morgan Library
</P>
<P>
   Ravishing is a fitting sound bite for ``New York Collects,''
which was organized by William M. Griswold, head of the Department
of Drawings and Prints at the Morgan, and Carol Selle, a collector
and an independent curator. Sheet for sheet it is the strongest of
the three shows. It includes drawings of near legendary status,
like Dali's disturbing nude-as-furniture, ``City of Drawers'';
Willem de Kooning's ethereal 1940-41 portrait of his wife, Elaine
de Kooning, and Picasso's crystalline ``Man With a Pipe'' of 1912,
a charcoal in which Analytic Cubism readies itself for the collaged
planes of Synthetic Cubism. An example of the latter, Georges
Braque's ``Fruit Dish and Glass,'' also 1912, hangs next to it.
</P>
<P>
   There are also works that are virtually unknown, including a
Cubist gouache by Aleksandr Rodchenko that has been exhibited only
once, in Moscow in 1916, and a haunting self-portrait from 1945 by
Giorgio de Chirico that is making its public debut.
</P>
<P>
   This show skims across the surface of modernism like a train
whizzing past wondrous cities, and yet nearly every drawing can
prompt you to pull the emergency cord and shred your itinerary.
There are shimmering Cezanne watercolors, tour de force selections
of Matisse and Beckmann, a group of three small collages by Juan
Gris. Five magnificent works by Klee top off the Modern's group.
Especially striking is ``Snow Hens,'' whose glowing spots of color
and lines folding to form birds and landscape were last exhibited
in Munich in 1950. Debts are acknowledged: Picasso, Matisse and
Gris, for example all send love letters to Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   There are isolated wonders: Georges Rouault's ``Old Clown'' of
1904, with its dark, powerful stillness; a mad self-portrait by
Christian Schad and Oskar Kokoschka's circa 1913 '`Encounter,'' in
which the space between nude lovers is charged with dark lashing
strokes that suggest the intensity of their connection but also
recast the scene as an Expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some Morgan efforts, this exhibition does not peter out
in the back hallway on the way to `` Morgan's Study,'' as the floor
plan calls it. Its head of steam holds up until the end, a 1951
Pollock drawing in black and orange ink on rice paper in which the
marks resemble sputtering embers arranged in a subtle grid.
</P>
<P>
   Back here hang some of the best drawings you may ever see by
Theodore Roszak, Henry Moore, Lucian Freud, Jean Dubuffet and Wols.
Don't miss Roberto Matta's colorful 1937 drawing of Picassoid
figures in a landscape cloaked in a dense net of lines, or Otto
Dix's 1920 ``Skat Players,'' an acrid, velvety ink-and-pencil
drawing of three card-playing war veterans with barely four limbs
among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan has owned 20th-century works for nearly half the
century, but this is its first exhibition of the art of its own
time. To turn to 20th-century art in 1999 is to take a wait-and-see
attitude to the limit. Hopefully the second half of the century
will be tackled sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing Center
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have more interesting reasons for owning art than rich
people,'' was the way one person, an artist, bluntly characterized
the attractions of ``Drawn From Artists' Collections.'' Artists
acquire art almost as naturally as they make it. The work of other
artists provides them with guidance, sustenance, inspiration,
like-minded company, reflections of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When they're young and poor, they acquire work by trading with
other young, poor artists or by following their eyes to things that
cost little because no one else is interested in them. (In this
show, only Elizabeth Murray's drawings reflect such a prefame
collecting ritual.) When they can afford to buy what they want (or
trade with interested dealers), all kinds of other forces are set
in motion. Their acquisitions reflect ego, ambition and reverence
as well as tastes so particular that an artist's choosing can
change our understanding of the artist whose work is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   These factors make this show a highly charged, somewhat
voyeuristic affair. The works have been selected by Ann Philbin,
former director of the Drawing Center and director of the Hammer
Museum of Art at the University of California at Los Angeles, and
Jack Shear, an independent curator and artist, undoubtedly with
some input from the artists themselves. The works are grouped
according to owner, which creates the feeling of discrete, somewhat
competitive little exhibitions. One can, for example, move from
group to group, comparing one artist's Matisse or Picasso to
another's.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are very diverse. Johns' display, the exhibition's
most spectacular, includes astounding drawings by Gauguin, Cezanne,
Redon and Seurat but also a gnarly little self-portrait by Kim
Jones, a performance-sculptor whose alter ego is Mud Man.
</P>
<P>
   The works from Helen Frankenthaler's collection range from a
collage by Robert Motherwell, to whom she was once married, to a
highly finished sketch of horses' rumps by Theodore Gericault to a
relaxed charcoal of a tree by Corot that must be the closest the
French painter ever came to making a Frankenthaler.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, artists seem to repeatedly home in on
qualities basic to their own work. Thus drawings owned by Alex Katz
share an element of Katzian distillation and include a particularly
minimal landscape by Marsden Hartley. Most of the drawings owned by
Ellsworth Kelly emphasize a cool linearity, including an
uncharacteristic work by Ferdinand Hodler that repeats the form of
an embracing couple with almost line-for-line precision.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a single focus prevails. From the collection of the
painter Helen Marden come a series of 18th-century Tantric images
notable for their saturated colors and schematized depictions of
sexuality. Georg Baselitz lends 14 drawings by the German artist
Carl Fredrik Hill (1849-1911), whose small awkward landscapes have
a visionary intensity.
</P>
<P>
   This same intensity prevails in the 14 landscape drawings by the
self-taught American artist Joseph E. Yoakum (1886-1972), from the
collection that the Chicago Imagist Roger Brown bequeathed to the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago. One can imagine that Yoakum
and Hill would have found great comfort in each other's work and
maybe even arranged a trade.  &QL;

 &HT;      POLL: 61% FAVOR JUVENILE CRIME PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 19 -- Americans overwhelmingly believe the best
way to fight juvenile crime is to put resources into preventive
measures rather than punishment, according to a report done for the
Children's Court Centennial Committee (CCCC).
</P>
<P>
   CCCC is a Chicago-based coalition of juvenile justice
professionals, child welfare advocates and foundations formed to
commemorate the creation of the world's first juvenile court in
Cook County in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Senate debated juvenile justice legislation which
would increase the penalties for minors who commit violent crimes,
Judge Nancy Sidote Salyers, presiding judge of the Cook County
Juvenile Court's Child Protection Division, was on Capitol Hill to
present CCCC's report to Illinois lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of adults surveyed said prevention was the
best way to counter juvenile crime, compared to 21 percent who
favored rehabilitation for juvenile offenders and 12 percent who
favored harsher punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can stop it before it starts, there is no need for
other (measures),'' said one upscale suburban white male who was
surveyed. ``You have to stop them before they hit the criminal
path, and that's when they've got the best chance at making it in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The research was paid for by the Chicago Community Trust, the
William T. Grant Foundation and the Woods Fund of Chicago on behalf
of CCCC. Peter Hart Research Associates, a Democratic polling firm,
and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, conducted
telephone surveys with 1,059 adults nationwide from December 7-17,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume the public wants to lock up children in order to
get rid of these problems, but we found that is not the case,''
Salyers explained. ``People want to make sure that when laws are
passed and policies are enacted that they really help children.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found most adults to believe violent youth offenders
can be rehabilitated. Sixty-three percent agreed that ``all youth
are capable of recovery and redemption, because children are young
and constantly changing, so we should not give up even on those who
have committed violent crimes,'' while 27 percent agreed ``it is
too late to rehabilitate some youth who are more dangerous or
multiple offenders, and the best solution is prison, since
punishment is the only way to send them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent of adults said they support the death penalty
for extremely violent juvenile offenders, while 61 percent support
capital punishment for adults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the survey of adults, 522 Chicago-area high
school students were interviewed in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven percent of the teens said building more community
centers where kids could play sports and participate in other group
activities would make a really big difference to at-risk kids.
Fifty-seven percent said sending kids convicted of crimes to boot
camp would straighten them out.
</P>
<P>
   More teens found alcohol (55 percent) to be a serious problem
among their peers than drugs (44 percent), exposure to bad
influences (44 percent), being depressed (40 percent), violence in
schools (28 percent) abusive homes (26 percent) dangerous
neighborhoods (22 percent) or involvement with gangs (21 percent).

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just because Philip Johnson turns 93 in July doesn't
mean he's stopped dancing. Or designing. On the drawing board in
his Manhattan office are designs for everything from skyscrapers to
churches and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been spotted skulking around the P.S. 1 Center for
Contemporary Art in Long Island City, where he has designed a
multi-tiered disk jockey booth and dance pavilion for the museum's
central courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   When the temporary structure opens on June 20, it will be the
first project P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art have produced
together since announcing their intention to merge. The pavilion
has been designed for P.S. 1's second annual outdoor Warm Up, a
series of music and dancing from 4 to 9 p.m. every Saturday through
the summer. It will stay up through Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never went to Studio 54,'' Johnson said wistfully. ``This is
a disco for the 21st century. It's a medieval amphitheater with a
science-fiction feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the Modern and P.S. 1 said the choice of
Johnson as the architect was a natural. Not only was he the founder
of the Modern's architecture department but he is also a trustee at
the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that Philip was a symbol of the early years of the
Modern and a continuing force in architecture, the perfect person
for our first collaborative effort,'' said Alanna Heiss, director
of P.S. 1. ``This is all about fantasy, summer and youth.''
</P>
<P>
   But because he did not consider himself ``a man of the
theater,'' Johnson said, he teamed up with Robert Isabell, a
director of special events, who has coordinated the production of
the pavilion. Donald and Taffy Kaufman, the Manhattan-based color
specialists, were also asked to join the team. They created an
intricate color palette for the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion has a tower for the disk jockey that is suspended
over the stage. It is a unified structure combining a dance floor
and amphitheater-style steps for sitting or standing.
</P>
<P>
   Its four towers, constructed of galvanized steel and white
construction mesh, are as high as 48 feet and topped with silk
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman are using six highly contrasting colors _
chartreuse, chocolate, ultramarine, deep violet, acid green and
emerald green _ in a pattern of four-foot squares, set diagonally
across the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   The entire structure is a diamond shape, reflecting the shape of
P.S. 1's courtyard. The overall effect, Johnson said, is that of a
giant zigzag.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our youngest high-energy audience we felt it would only be
fitting for Philip to open the pavilion,'' Ms. Heiss said. ``He's
going to be the first guest D.J.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Fifteen years ago a group of American art patrons decided to
start the American Fund for the Tate Gallery. Its mission is to
insure that American artists are well represented at the Tate
Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Tate announced that the fund had helped buy David
Smith's ``Wagon II'' (1964) for $5.1 million. The sculpture was
sold to the Tate by Candida and Rebecca Smith, the artist's
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wagon II'' has been on loan to the museum since 1996 and joins
Smith's ``Cubi XIX,'' acquired by the Tate in 1964. ``This is one
of the most important works Smith ever made,'' said Nicholas
Serota, the Tate's director.
</P>
<P>
   The American Fund for the Tate Gallery is made up of collectors,
including Donald Bryant of St. Louis; Douglas S. Cramer, a
television producer and trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, and
John and Frances Bowes of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the fund has used its endowment to donate works
by Philip Guston, Louise Bourgeois, Ellsworth Kelly and Donald Judd
to the Tate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see American art on this side of the Atlantic,''
Serota said. ``Wagon II'' is on view as part of the museum's ``New
Displays, 1999'' exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made the sculpture in 1964, a year before his death, while
he was living at Bolton Landing in the Adirondacks. It incorporates
the techniques he used throughout his career, including forging,
welding, fabricating and the incorporation of found objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wagon II'' rests on four wheels and is made of black painted
steel. In the middle is an elongated, slightly curved figure.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is a welcome addition to the museum's growing
collection of 20th-century art, much of which will eventually be
displayed in its new building, the Tate Gallery of Modern Art, in
Bankside. It is scheduled to open in May 2000. &QL;

   The walls of the mini-museum at Bellagio, Steven A. Wynn's Las
Vegas hotel and casino, are getting more crowded. Just a few days
after Sotheby's May 10 sale of Impressionist and modern paintings,
drawings and sculptures from the estate of Betsey Cushing Whitney,
Wynn hung two paintings he bought there.
</P>
<P>
   One is Seurat's ``Landscape, Island of the Grande Jatte''
(1884), one of two large final studies for the famous ``Sunday on
the Grande Jatte,'' which hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago.
Wynn paid $35.2 million for the painting, 13 times the previous
Seurat record of $2.7 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I missed this one I knew I wouldn't get another chance,''
he said. ``By my count, there are only three left in private
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn also bought Mrs. Whitney's Berthe Morisot painting, ``Hide
and Seek'' (1873), a classic Impressionist scene of the artist's
sister and niece playing in a country landscape. He paid $3.85
million, well above its $2.2 million high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But for Wynn the purchase was irresistible. ``It hangs next to
her brother-in-law's painting,'' he said, referring to Manet's 1880
portrait of Suzette Lemaire, which Winn bought in 1996 for $2.9
million at Sotheby's sale of art from the Shelburne Museum in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seurat and the Morisot are the only recent additions
to the Bellagio galleries, they weren't the end of Wynn's shopping
trip. At Sotheby's auctions of Impressionist and modern art, on May
11 and May 12, he bought two Renoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The first evening Wynn paid $937,500 for ``The Sweeper'' (1889),
a portrait of a woman holding a broom. The next day he bought
``Woman in Blue,'' a portrait of a woman casually posed, clad in a
blue dress and hat. It had failed to sell at the auction, but Wynn
bought it afterward, for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to collect decorative Renoirs,'' he said.

TRUFFAUT'S FILMS MIRRORED HIS LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Watching all the hoopla surrounding ``Star Wars,''
it's interesting to note that the effects-laden extravaganza is so
much less cinematic than the works of Francois Truffaut.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The French film director made his life art.
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut, who died in 1984 at 52, created a world in film that
mirrored his own. Through his alter ego, Antoine Doinel (played
beautifully in five films by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Truffaut gave us
wonderfully complex human stories _ as entertaining as they are
resonant. With films like ``Jules and Jim'' and ``Day for Night,''
Truffaut examined complex interpersonal relationships deftly and
delicately while always maintaining a critical eye.
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut, who had been a critic before he became a filmmaker,
understood the language of cinema, studying the masters _ from
French directors like Jean Vigo and Jean Renoir to American greats
like Orson Welles and _ one of his personal favorites _ Alfred
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   That his first film, ``The 400 Blows,'' is a masterpiece is a
tribute to Truffaut artistry, though. He was able to take what he
had learned and create a lyrical style all his own, seamlessly
melding his humanism with a formal structuralism.
</P>
<P>
   The semi-autobiographical film tells the story of Doinel, who,
like Truffaut, comes from a dysfunctional home and eventually ends
up in a center for juvenile delinquents. ``The 400 Blows'' is, as
others have stated, the standard against which all films about
youths are judged. The title comes from a French idiom for the
amount of pain that anyone can bear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen ``The 400 Blows'' will be haunted by the
final freeze frame of the troubled Doinel after he has fled the
center. Truffaut has let the camera track Doinel to the ocean.
There he finds both hope and another trap. The sea offers a promise
of something more than his small life, but it also has stopped his
escape. He can go no farther, and he doesn't know what to do. It is
_ like life _ an ambiguous moment.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of ``The 400 Blows,'' Fox
Lorber Cinema has released six of his classic films on video and
DVD. In addition to the Cannes Film Festival winner ``The 400
Blows,'' the titles include ``Shoot the Piano Player,'' ``The Last
Metro,'' ``Confidentially Yours,'' ``Love on the Run'' and ``Two
English Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The six Truffaut classics have been restored fully with new
translation and subtitles, and are available on VHS for a suggested
retail price of either $29.98 or $19.98 and on DVD for $29.98. This
is the first time the Truffaut films, with the exception of ``The
400 Blows,'' have been available on DVD. Two of the DVD titles _
``The 400 Blows'' and ``Jules and Jim,'' which will come out in
August _ will have a running scene-by-scene commentary track. All
six titles also will be available in a VHS six-pack for a suggested
retail price of $119.98.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much celebration of Truffaut recently, including
a new book _ ``Truffaut: A Biography'' by Antoine De Baecque and
Serge Toubiana (Knopf; $30) _ as well as retrospective film series
in New York City and in Los Angeles at the Nuart. However, it's
been vastly overshadowed by the ``Star Wars'' hype.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain irony, though. Truffaut, along with other
influential French directors such as Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc
Godard, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer, was responsible for the
``New Wave.''  &UR; !ital! &LR; Novelle vague &UR; !off! &LR;  referred to a creative
burst of energy from these filmmakers, who through their films and
writings championed the auteur theory _ the idea that directors, in
essence, are the authors of their movies.
</P>
<P>
   It was through their efforts that Hollywood directors John Ford
and Howard Hawks became known as artists rather than hired hands,
paving the way for the adulation that we heap upon people like
Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I'll bet,
though, all of them would defer to the genius of Truffaut. &QL;

 &HT;    DELAWARE LEADS NATIONAL WAVE OF SWIFT, CHEAP MENTORING
 &HT;    700&AMP;adds. For release Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ The nationwide growth of mentoring programs
came home to Daryl Burton on a gusty morning this spring when the
sixth-grader convinced his mother he was too sick to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, a state trooper drove a dark silver van
onto Jefferson Street and parked in front of Daryl's home. Gov. Tom
Carper of Delaware hopped out, walked up onto the porch and
knocked.
</P>
<P>
   When Daryl answered the door, Carper looked down and asked,
``What are you doing here? You are supposed to be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Carper is part of a growing movement by supporters of
traditional mentoring programs to supplement them with new methods
that work more swiftly and cheaply. The movement is being largely
driven by the business community, partly to help assure a steady
future flow of well-educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, Daryl's mother let them clear off a corner of
the kitchen table and hold their weekly half-hour mentoring session
there, instead of in Daryl's middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl, 12, who had been a third-grader reading below the
first-grade level when Carper became his mentor three years ago,
put a biography of basketball legend Michael Jordan on the table,
and began to read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best he ever read,'' Carper said, as he shared that
moment with thousands of other cheering mentors Wednesday night at
the University of Delaware. Carper said that when Daryl walked him
back to the van, they were both ``walking on air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Carper, Delaware and its mentors have built a model
program for other states to follow,'' said retired Gen. Colin
Powell, a youth advocate who choppered in to congratulate them on
approaching the governor's goal of creating ``an army of 10,000
volunteer mentors'' in the state by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under traditional programs run by groups like Big Brothers and
Big Sisters, potential mentors undergo elaborate background checks,
are carefully matched with a particular child, and obtain guidance
throughout their mentorship from case workers and consultants.
Typically, a mentor and child meet for several hours a week for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   In most of today's programs, volunteers make a commitment for a
single school year. They promise to come to a school or a youth
club once a week to coach, tutor, chat with or play with a child
for 30 minutes to an hour. The only background check is to find out
whether they have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the big advantage is that the $1,000 average cost
of supporting a traditional mentorship drops under the lightweight
programs to somewhere between $350 and $600. On a practical level,
it is easier and quicker for the new programs to recruit
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, the tally is highest in California, with
209,000 mentors _ about one for every 27 public-school students.
</P>
<P>
   But with a ratio of about one mentor for every 11 public-school
students, Delaware now ``leads the nation on a per capita basis,''
Carper said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Connecticut also have
fast-growing programs with strong backing by businesses and civic
organizations, and many states are getting such efforts under way.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many children need one-to-one contact with a caring
adult, even Big Brothers/ Big Sisters of America is encouraging its
affiliates to test the lightweight alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans are scaling up all of our mentoring programs,''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the new approach, the mentors work under the watchful eye of
a coordinator from the school or club, rather than taking the child
somewhere. Training is minimal, sometimes half a day long, but
often little more than a pep talk before they are introduced to a
child selected by teachers or youth counselors. The child, more
often than not, comes from a single-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always kids who need attention so badly that they'll
act out badly in order to get it,'' said Guy Mazza, principal of
Warner Elementary School in Wilmington. ``Want to know what makes
it worth all the administrative burden, and the pull-out times from
class, and the cost? It's that these kids can get attention from
mentors for the opposite _ doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   David Hayden and Ravelle Porter, who work in the audit
department at Hercules Inc., pair up to mentor Artezz(cq) Finney.
Each spends a half hour of company-paid time with the fifth-grader
on a different day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Both are ``okay,'' said Artezz, who had come running in to greet
Hayden in Warner's mentoring room, where the child-sized tables are
thoughtfully equipped with low chairs wide enough to accommodate a
mentor's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelle and I can fill in for each other when schedules don't
work out,'' Hayden said. ``Our role is to tap into his potential,
showing Artezz how he can accomplish things.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive impact of the traditional weekend-mentoring program
of Big Sisters and Big Brothers was firmly established in a 1995
study frequently cited by supporters of all kinds of mentoring.
Comparing two similar batches of children with and without mentors,
the researchers found that after 18 months, the children with
mentors were far less likely to have started using drugs or
alcohol, hit someone, skipped a class or skipped a day of school
without an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been thorough evaluations of the lighter
versions yet,'' said Jean Grossman, vice president for research at
Philadelphia-based Public/Private Ventures, who helped conduct the
1995 study. She said the stripped-down programs might work if the
mentors keep their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think that a good-hearted volunteer could hurt
kids,'' she cautioned. ``But mentoring relationships that we
examined that broke up within three months definitely hurt the
kids, because the kids ended up thinking it must be their own
fault. You see self-esteem plummeting, and see the academic
reflection of that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The loudest applause at Wednesday's rally for mentors came when
Powell ran down a long list of how children can get into trouble,
and concluded, ``We can't just walk away from the problem. They're
all our children _ whether they are in our family or in our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those applauding was Kenyatta Charles, a third-grader at
MacClary Elementary School in Newark, Del., and her mentor, April
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play games, we walk in the woods near school and we play
outside on the swings,'' Kenyatta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do reading sometimes. But we're really into building
self-esteem,'' Hubbard added. A school mentor once a week, she
recently agreed to a longer-term commitment as Kenyatta's Big
Sister, which will involve three or four hours of contact weekly
all year round.
</P>
<P>
   She said she decided to switch because ``there's also a lot more
support, like having a case worker to consult with'' in moments of
uncertainty.

   SCHOOL-SHOOTING _ CONYERS, Ga. _ A suicidal, disgruntled high
school student, angry over breaking up with his girlfriend, turned
his anger on the world Thursday, shooting six of his classmates and
emotionally scarring countless others on the last day of classes in
this suburban Atlanta high school. J.T. Solomon came to Heritage
High School near Conyers with a broken heart, two guns, and a
terrible agenda. (Schneider, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). ETA: 7

<P>
   GOP-NRA _ ATLANTA _ As of Wednesday the NRA's Wayne LaPierre
still planned to speak Saturday at a state GOP convention in
Augusta. Checking back with outgoing state GOP chair Rusty Paul who
invited LaPierre, and also trying to reach NRA board member and
U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, who'll introduce LaPierre on Saturday, to ask
if they still want him to appear in light of Thursday's metro
Atlanta high school shooting. (Pruitt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING-OFFICIALREAX _ Official state and national reaction was
swift today to the Conyers shooting. President Clinton called the
incident ``deeply troubling'' in comments moments before leaving
for Littleton, Colo., the site of last month's fatal shooting. New
York Sen. Schummer mentioned today's shooting from the Senate floor
during debate on gun legislation. Also comments from Janet Reno and
Georgia officials. (Cumming-Pruitt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING-RESIDENTREAX _ CONYERS, Ga. _ People who live in the
middle-class area around Heritage High are not shocked the shooting
happened here, and many believe it signals the time to get God back
in the schools. (Stanford, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>

   SHOOTING-SHOOTER _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Trying to piece together what

   SHOOTING-LASTER _ CONYERS, Ga. _ The most seriously injured was
15-year-old Stephanie Laster, who was being treated at Grady for a
shot that hit her in the buttocks and passed through to her
intestines. Checking report that her family's house burned about a
year ago. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   SHOOTING-SECURITY _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Heritage High School is like
a lot of others where shootings have taken place in recent years:
suburban or small-town and with a student body that is middle- or
upper-middle class, mostly white, has high test scores, engages in
very little criminal activity and heads to college after
graduation. Heritage in particular is known for emphasizing a
traditional curriculum, heavy on the 3 Rs. It's the kind of place
where people move to the school district, despite the commute,
because they believe it will provide a safe and sound education for
their kids. Security, compared to some urban schools, is light,
with no metal detectors or cadres of armed guards in the hallways.

<P>
   SHOOTING-SENIORS _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Thursday was supposed to be a
day for seniors to say goodbye to friends and sign yearbooks,
wishing each other well before next Friday's graduation. Instead,
many kids spent the day watching their school on CNN. ``My last day
at Heritage has been robbed,'' said one senior. (Brett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING-FEARYEAR _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Will this school year ever
end? In the waning days of this school year, anxiety seems to be at
an all time high. We talk to parents, students, teachers,
sociologist/psychologists about the fear and tensions this
traumatic year has produced and the sense that we are grappling for
the finish line and possibly the relief of making it to the summer
break. (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   SHOOTING-HOWFAR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ How far should school
superintendents and principals go in putting clamps on students in
an effort to control potential problems in schools? Some local
schools have put in measures designed to curb potential problems
(can't wear long coats, can't talk about Columbine, for example)
but that only angers students and the ACLU, which look at such
measures as impinging in personal freedoms. School supers say
they're between a rock and hard place. (Smith, Dayton Daily News)

   GUNS _ WASHINGTON _ Propelled by school violence, the Senate
votes for fresh gun restrictions over the strong opposition of most

control measures. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   HILLARY-SENATE _ WASHINGTON - Is she or isn't she? As Hillary
Rodham Clinton plans for her fourth trip to New York in four weeks

   ISRAEL-SETTLERS _ ACHIYA, West Bank _ For Shmuel Kohen, in the
vanguard of right-wing Israel's efforts to control disputed land,
things still look pretty good. Below his hilltop mobile home are
olive orchards and a nearby Arab village. A new paved road snakes
its way up to his remote outpost and, next door, the Israeli
soldiers who protect his and the four other families here are
grilling hot dogs. ``It is important to build Israel,'' says the
affable Kohen, 28. While his daughter toddles around beneath the
posters of famous rabbis, he dismisses the chances of peace with
Arabs. ``They want to kill Jews only because we are Jews.'' But, an
hour's drive in Jerusalem, Kohen's political supply lines have been
damaged. Israel's elections Monday dealt a stunning blow to the
right-wing settler movement. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    We must say `no more'
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To many parents around the country, it had seemed
almost inevitable, like the rumble of far-off thunder signaling a
violent storm headed in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., Littleton, Colo. ...
</P>
<P>
   And now Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has hit home. The shootings at Heritage High School,
25 miles east of Atlanta, refreshed all of those emotions _ fear,
shock, outrage _ that had begun to ease a month after the tragedy
at Columbine High School. And today, or next week, it could happen
again at another school, in another region.
</P>
<P>
   But things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   As shots were being fired at Heritage High, senators in
Washington were preparing to debate whether to require background
checks on gun sales at firearms shows. Sen. Larry Craig, an Idaho
Republican and member of the board of the National Rifle
Association, had bragged just a day earlier that he and his
colleagues would make no more concessions to those advocating
tighter gun-safety laws. They were drawing the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate erased Craig's line, voting overwhelmingly for a
Republican measure requiring background checks on all transactions
at gun shows and at pawnshops. Craig was one of 21 senators, all
Republican, who voted against the measure. Sen. Paul Coverdell of
Georgia joined him in that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Senate approved an even stricter amendment, thanks to
a vote by Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 tie. Coverdell
voted against that bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have long understood the need for sane gun-safety
laws. But in a complex world, gun safety was only one of many
issues that demanded their attention. The numerical advantage of
that majority was more than offset by the intensity of the minority
that saw gun-safety legislation as a conspiracy to take their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, however, the political dynamic is changing. The majority
of Americans is coming to understand that the minority must be
confronted, that its power to squelch sane gun-safety legislation
must be ended. It's tragic that such progress is coming at the
price of children's blood, of parents' anguish, of a deepening
doubt about the fundamental decency of the world in which we are
raising our families. But it's apparently necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in the Conyers shooting, for example, was a
16-year-old high school sophomore armed with a rifle and a pistol.
For more than five years, state Sen. David Scott, an Atlanta
Democrat, and others in Georgia have tried to pass a law making it
a crime for an adult to allow unsupervised juveniles easy access to
firearms. Every year, their effort has been stymied by NRA
lobbyists, as if the Second Amendment guaranteed the right to leave
loaded handguns on the coffee table in front of children.
</P>
<P>
   That has to change.
</P>
<P>
   Delay is the NRA's best strategy. NRA officials understand that
as Americans, we have an incredibly high tolerance for gun-related
violence. What was once shocking too quickly becomes an accepted
part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the Conyers shooting, an 18-year-old was shot
to death in Gwinnett County. Early Tuesday morning, a motorist on
Interstate 75 was shot dead as he drove down the highway. Tuesday
afternoon, a body was found in DeKalb County with multiple gunshot
wounds. That same day, a young man in Atlanta was shot dead in an
argument over $10. On Sunday night, a wedding guest was shot and
killed in a parking lot in Fairburn.
</P>
<P>
   And the only thing remarkable about those deaths is how truly
unremarkable we find them. Someday, if we don't act responsibly,
the same could become true of schoolyard shootings.

BILL FRANCE SOLIDIFIES HIS CONTROL OF STOCK CAR RACING

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bruton Smith ever had any thoughts about challenging Bill
France for supremacy in stock car racing _ and many believe he did
_ he can forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, France made it virtually impossible for Smith or
anyone else to challenge his authority when International Speedway
Corp., of which France is chairman and chief executive officer,
announced it was buying out Roger Penske's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   That gives France control of 10 major racing facilities, nine of
which currently are sites of one or more Winston Cup events, He
also has controlling interests in new racing venues being built
near Kansas City, Chicago and New York and a proposed site close to
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of tracks France has up-and-running, under
construction or proposed, he will have enough major facilities to
schedule the entire Winston Cup tour at places he owns within the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   And, since he also owns and is president of NASCAR, the sport's
governing body, he is in position to do that if he has to.
</P>
<P>
   France's ISC will pay Penske Motorsports Inc. $705 million for
the California Speedway near Los Angeles; the Michigan Speedway
near Detroit; Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth, Pa., and North
Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, N.C.; plus Penske's 45 percent of
the Miami-Dade motorsports complex. France already owns 45 percent
of Miami-Dade.
</P>
<P>
   That list makes France unassailable when you couple it with
Daytona, Fla.; Talladega, Ala.; Darlington, S.C.; Watkins Glen,
N.Y., and Phoenix, Ariz., all operated by ISC, and add
Martinsville, Va., which France is believed to be involved with
although it is not listed as part of his ISC holdings.
</P>
<P>
   France now controls more racing sites than anybody, and even if
Smith, who runs six tracks himself through his Speedway Motorsports
Inc., decides to try to expand, France has shown a willingness to
compete with him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more importantly from a revenue standpoint, France
will eventually have tracks near the nation's three major
population centers _ New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ in
addition to Detroit, the hub of America's motorsports industry.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, through his association with Tony George, he also
has the two most famous American racing venues, Indianapolis and
Daytona,
</P>
<P>
   And he will have sites available for racing in almost every
geographic area of the country, while Smith is confined to the
South and West.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Smith or anyone else has any ideas about stepping out on
their own, they can forget it.
</P>
<P>
   They might be able to take the first step, but they'll never
take the second. France has just seen to that.

PETTY TEAM IS RED HOT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a quiet seventh-place finish, but it was significant.
</P>
<P>
   With his run at Richmond, Va., last Saturday, Kyle Petty
recorded his third and Petty Enterprises' sixth top 10 in the last
five races. That span of success began April 11 in Bristol. Tenn.,
when the Winston Cup cars started into the short track portion of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with John Andretti's three top 10s, which include a win
April 18 at Martinsville, Va., that gives Petty Enterprises a
record arguably equal to any and better than all but one multi-car
team.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jack Roush's five-car entry with drivers Johnny Benson,
Jeff Burton, Kevin Lepage, Chad Little and Mark Martin has more top
10s over this time _ a total of seven _ but the team has not won a
race.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Childress Racing, featuring drivers Dale Earnhardt and
Mike Skinner, has done as well, also with six top 10s including an
April 25 win by Earnhardt at Talladega, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates Racing, with drivers Kenny Irwin and Richmond
winner Dale Jarrett, have five top 10s, all by Jarrett, as does the
powerhouse three-car team of Rick Hendrick, led by Jeff Gordon with
teammates Terry Labonte and Wally Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs' two drivers, Bobby Labonte and rookie Tony Stewart,
also have five top 10s over the five-race span.
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance of Petty and Andretti seems to indicate
that the merging of their two teams, which took place this season,
is beginning to click.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, for example, has already doubled the number of top 10
finishes he had in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti has returned Petty Enterprises to the winner's circle
after he went winless in 1998, when he came back to drive for
Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Loomis, general manager of the two-car team and
Andretti's crew chief on race day, said one reason for the improved
performance of both cars is the fresh input provided by the
integration of Kyle Petty's operation with that of Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   That has also been aided by the addition of Doug Hewitt, who
signed on this season as Kyle Petty's crew chief after working with
Derrike Cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kyle and Doug came on board, they looked at our cars and
made some suggestions,'' Loomis said. ``They made us think about
the way we were doing things, and that helped speed up the learning
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kyle Petty struggled virtually all of 1998, Loomis and
Andretti had some success after Andretti left Cale Yarborough to
rejoin Petty Enterprises, where he had worked during part of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 11th in points, and that wasn't so bad, but I was
pretty disgusted that we didn't win a race,'' Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '90s, Loomis has pretty much been the one constant
at Petty Enterprises, serving as Richard Petty's crew chief is his
final seasons and carrying on after the king's retirement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never been in charge of a two-car team before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be Rick Hendrick here. We're not trying to
be Jack Roush,'' Loomis said, referring to perhaps the two most
prominent multi-car teams. ``What we're trying to do is get back to
being what Petty Enterprises was, a team that can consistently
compete and win.''
</P>
<P>
   For Loomis, that means learning how to use his time efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know when to get involved, help out with
something, and you have to know when you need to stand back,''
Loomis said. ``If you don't do that, you can hurt one team more
than you help the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially tricky area is keeping Andretti from feeling
he will eventually be squeezed out by the Pettys. With Kyle's son,
18-year-old Adam, showing promise in the Busch ranks, a non-Petty
could become odd man out on a family oriented team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't worry about it,'' Loomis said about Andretti.
``He's gone through a lot of the same thing with his family name.
It doesn't bother his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, judging from the last few weeks.

SCHERRER FAMILY TREE IS A VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM FISH   
 WINETODAY.COM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ Fred Scherrer has something he can look at
every day to remember his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   A vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the hunched and bent vines of his family's
Alexander Valley vineyard, Scherrer turns his mind back, to
harvests long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember not working in the vineyard,'' Scherrer says.
``When I'm working in the old vineyard, I think about my
grandfather. He was a great guy. He planted these vines in his 20s.
I don't think he could have imagined that people would come from
all around to get the wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is indeed getting out about Scherrer Winery zinfandels.
</P>
<P>
   After selling the grapes for generations to Gallo, Scherrer
brought some of his grapes to Greenwood Ridge Vineyards, where he
was winemaker, and the winery began bottling a Scherrer Vineyard
zinfandel in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as winemaker at Dehlinger Winery, Scherrer made his own
zinfandel beginning with the 1991 vintage. Today he produces about
2,000 cases, plus a little cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   His zins have a cult following in the San Francisco Bay Area and
for good reason. His 1997 Old &AMP; Mature Vines and 1997 Shale Terrace
were rated 4 stars in recent WineToday.com tastings.
</P>
<P>
   The style is classic: ripe, well-structured and powerful in a
way that's never less than elegant. The wines reveal an astute
understanding of the vineyard, of ``place,'' as well as a skilled
but subtle hand in the winery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred is an original and profound thinker about wine,'' Tom
Dehlinger says. ``He has an extremely personal commitment with his
wines and they're personal creations from the vines to the
bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer Vineyard is in the eastern benchland and as you look
west across Alexander Valley, Mount St. Helena is just over your
shoulder. To the south is Silver Oak's famed Alexander Valley
vineyard, and to the north is Sausal Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer's great-grandfather bought the property in 1899. In
1912, Scherrer's grandfather _ also named Fred Scherrer _ planted
the first zinfandel vines. About 3 1/2 acres of the original vines
remain and they are the base of the Old &AMP; Mature. More zinfandel
was planted in the '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   There's also cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay but most of it is
still sold to Gallo. Gone are the alicante bouschet and the
Imperial prune trees that Scherrer remembers from his youth. The
family once made its living from the intensively flavorful but
fragile Imperial prunes, but as the market faded, Scherrer's
grandfather slowly replaced the trees with vines.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a study of the vineyard over the years, a skill he
picked up during his decade at Dehlinger Winery, which is
well-known for extensively mapping the soils, grape clones and
microclimates of its Russian River Valley estate vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding what your vineyard wants to be is more than half
the battle,'' Scherrer says. ``You just give it what it needs and
stay out of its way.''
</P>
<P>
   His vineyard, Scherrer learned, is divided between two soil
types _ clay and shale _ each of which bring a different character
to wine. The newer vineyards tend to be planted on shale, which
lets the roots grow more freely and generally produces wines with
softer tannins.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the old vines are in clay soils, which don't allow for
vigorous growth and gives wines a tight structure. Scherrer is
particularly taken by the wines produced from the old vines.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer Winery is not on a busy wine tourist trail. It's down a
treacherously bumpy dirt road in west Sonoma County, a remote wing
of Wine Country that's still close to its rustic roots. There's no
sign on the road except for the address spray-painted on plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which isn't open to the public, is in a nondescript
white warehouse that used to be home to a Crema Winery, and
Scherrer shares the space with a medicinal herb company.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy it's not, but then that's not Scherrer's style. His hair
is dark and falls in waves to his shoulders, and like his beard,
it's freckled in gray. Sure, he makes great wine, but he's a farmer
and likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Scherrer is just happy to have a winery of his own.
Before February 1998, he made his wines at Dehlinger, but they
outgrew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer prefers a low-key approach to winemaking, which is a
good thing because he has limited space and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The zinfandels are fermented in open-top tanks and Scherrer
punches down the cap manually to improve color and extraction. Some
of the grapes are typically fermented in whole clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stems are really ripe, you end up with this beautiful
perfume,'' Scherrer says of the whole-cluster technique. ``If you
do it right, you end up with a silkiness and if you do it wrong,
you end up with a hardness, a greenness or an astringency in the
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scherrer admits his zinfandels have become increasingly
more ripe and higher in alcohol, he believes the change has been
subtle but an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons I haven't had as much trouble with
alcohol is because I've gotten good about getting rid of raisins,''
Scherrer says.
</P>
<P>
   Zinfandel grapes don't ripen evenly, and a single bunch may
include green grapes, ripe grapes and raisiny grapes. Scherrer
removes as many of the raisins as possible and even had his
destemmer rebuilt to make it easier to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wine is in the barrel, ``I leave it alone,'' Scherrer
says. ``I used to do things because that's what you were supposed
to do. I rack for a reason instead of because, `That's what you
do.' ''

 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It is a question that anyone who drives cars for a
living is asked over and over: What's the best car, or truck, to
buy? Well, it depends _ on your price range, on your driving style,
on the importance you place on quality, design, performance and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Two new quality surveys seem to be saying that, too. The
surveys, from J.D. Power &AMP; Associates and AutoPacific Inc.,
generally agree on the makes and models that fared the worst, but
often disagreed on those at the top. Indeed, the surveys, each of
which are based on interviews with more than 40,000 buyers of 1999
vehicles, differ in what they measure and how they measure it.
</P>
<P>
   The Initial Quality Study by J.D. Power, the big market research
firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., measures product quality in the first
three months of ownership. Vehicles are rated based on problems
reported for each 100 vehicles, covering 135 specific areas across
nine categories including vehicle interiors and exteriors, power
trains, features and controls, as well as ride, handling and
braking. All items _ whether a door won't close properly or an
engine fails completely _ carry the same weight. This survey does
not measure customers' satisfaction with the vehicle and the
dealership, though those factors are rated in other surveys by J.D.
Power.
</P>
<P>
   Also this month, AutoPacific released its 1999 Vehicle
Satisfaction Scores. AutoPacific, of Tustin, Calif., which conducts
studies for automakers, has been doing this survey for its
automotive clients since 1994 but has publicly announced the scores
only once before. AutoPacific measures owners' satisfaction with
vehicle quality, styling, performance and features, as well as
price and dealership experience. The study includes rankings by
manufacturers, brands and individual models.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents rated their 1999 vehicles on 51 attributes, 32 of
them related directly to their vehicles. From these responses,
AutoPacific calculated a Pure Product Satisfaction score. The
remaining 19 questions dealt with financial and dealership matters.
Added together, these make up the Vehicle Satisfaction Scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Products are getting better and better and better,'' said
George Peterson, president of AutoPacific. ``The difference between
the worst car and the best is pretty close. So rather than look at
things gone wrong, we try to bring in the emotional aspect and
importance aspect of 51 vehicle attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki and Kia held the last two places in both the J.D. Power
and AutoPacific surveys; Isuzu, Jeep and Mitsubishi were near the
bottom as well. Toyota and Lexus captured segment leadership in
multiple categories in both studies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the rankings at the top were all over the map. One
big surprise was J.D. Power's No. 1 ranking of Jaguar _ whose
infamous mechanical maladies had made it a punchline of car jokes
for decades. Not so surprisingly, AutoPacific had Lexus as No. 1;
Jaguar landed in a still-respectable seventh place in AutoPacific's
product quality survey.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable discrepancies between the two product-only
surveys were the positions of Nissan, Mazda and Saab. J.D. Power
put Nissan at No. 11, while AutoPacific's product survey rated it
below average at No. 24. J.D. Power put Mazda just above average at
No. 16, but AutoPacific put it near the bottom, at No. 32.
Similarly, Saab was ranked below average by J.D. Power and in the
top 10 by AutoPacific.
</P>
<P>
   While overall quality has improved sharply since J.D. Power's
first survey in 1987, gaps remain. ``There very definitely are
differences between quality within segments,'' said George Owens,
project director of J.D. Power's Initial Quality Study. ``That's
important information to give to the consumer. Releasing the top
three performers in each segment gives folks a good indication of
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although manufacturers buy complete results from J.D. Power, the
company does not publicly disclose its rankings below No. 3, making
it difficult for consumers to use the survey when shopping. (The
New York Times obtained the complete list from a J.D. Power
subscriber.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, these are by no means the only surveys of new-car
owners. Indeed, J.D. Power conducts several others that often come
up with quite different results. For instance, one study asks
consumers what they like and dislike about their vehicles in
general terms. Quite often, the top-rated brands in that survey do
not match those with the highest quality scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some vehicles have very good quality and very good appeal _
Lexus and BMW vehicles tend to do that,'' said Owens of J.D. Power.
``There are buyers who are looking for quality vehicles that don't
break down. They sometimes don't have much appeal. And there are
buyers who are willing to deal with product problems for an
exciting ride.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul MacDuffie, an associate management professor at the
Wharton School, said the quality studies served consumers in
another way. ``The surveys have had a tremendous impact on the
industry by prompting quality efforts, particularly with the Big
Three,'' he said. ``The effect on what the companies are doing is
as great as the impact on consumer purchasing decisions. And the
consumer ultimately benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Customer satisfaction with the buying experience is rated in a
separate J.D. Power survey, the Sales Satisfaction Index, which
will be released in July. Saturn, which ranked below average in
J.D. Power's Initial Quality Study, has scored high in the past in
customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   AutoPacific considers the sales experience crucial to buyers'
overall satisfaction and includes it in its annual study. ``The
consumer can look at our ratings and see overall how satisfied
their peers are with products they purchased and with the treatment
at the dealership,'' said Peterson of AutoPacific. The surveys show
that Saturn gets a boost from its dealers. ``Our study shows Saturn
is an adequate car sold by great dealers,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Porsche 911 and Chevrolet Corvette rank high in
product satisfaction but much lower in sales satisfaction. ``They
are great cars, but the dealers are abusing customers in some way _
maybe financially or in dealership courtesy,'' Peterson said.
``There is something that is not making the 911 and Corvette buyers
happy.''

SIDESHOW OUTSPARKLES MAIN EVENT AT CANNES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam'' arrived here
Thursday and shot off some sparks. It's a hot, sprawling New York
story rocked by the trends and events of 1977, and it centers on
the effects of David Berkowitz's ``Son of Sam'' killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   Finding pretexts for visiting tourist attractions from CBGB to
Plato's Retreat, it weaves its nostalgia into the tale of how an
insular Bronx neighborhood closes ranks against anyone different,
even though virtually everyone in the movie leads some kind of
double life.
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody, as a self-styled punk, and John Leguizamo and Mira
Sorvino, as restless young marrieds with a ``Saturday Night Fever''
dance habit, head a large cast of actors with a conspicuous common
trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``(italics)You(end italics) say it,'' Lee prompted, sitting on
the terrace at the Carlton Hotel here with the patient air of
someone who knows the Cannes International Film Festival well. (He
was unruffled by the festival-assigned bodyguard keeping an eye on
him from behind a nearby billboard.) OK: This is a white cast, his
first.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as Disney hopes, it fares better commercially than his
eminently worthy ``He Got Game'' of last year, Lee, who said his
next project will be ``pure Negroidal,'' said that could have
something to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' also has the kind of raunch that nearly landed
it an NC-17 rating, but the MPAA's eyebrows went up over steamy
sequences, not serial killing.
</P>
<P>
   Although this year's main competition features one American film
with strong opinions on social issues (Tim Robbins' WPA mural of a
movie, ``Cradle Will Rock'') and another about a black urban hero
surrounded by laughably bigoted white gangsters (Jim Jarmusch's
winningly insouciant ``Ghost Dog,'' which stars Forest Whitaker and
has the hippest score in town), there was mysteriously no room for
Lee. So ``Summer of Sam'' is in the ever-more-interesting
Directors' Fortnight sidebar in a year when the prestige of the
main event looks more arbitrary than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to put on a tux and walk up the red carpet,'' Lee
said. ``We just want the film to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did point out, with reference to Gilles Jacob, the
distinguished French official who oversees festival selections,
that even Michael Jordan retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow boat,'' acknowledged Dan Talbot, who runs New
Yorker films and the influential Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in
Manhattan, about the main selection of films this year. The flabby
two-and-a-half-hour running time predominates, and there are more
well-respected films than those that are widely liked.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is no popularity contest. One of the most
overwhelming films shown thus far is ``L'Humanite,'' directed by
Bruno Dumont (``The Life of Jesus'') with a slow, punishing
intensity that exerts a troubling fascination. Instinctively
religious, terse almost to the point of arrogance, his new film
leaves a powerful impression by immersing the viewer in the
stillness of a nearly uneventful story, with a wide-eyed central
character who silently registers the brutishness of life around
him.
</P>
<P>
   On a seriously different note, Takeshi Kitano's ``Kikujiro''
arrived Thursday trailing a lot more cute whimsy than might have
been expected. It's a road movie that casts this filmmaker as a
comically irascible loser traveling with a lonely little boy. Its
deadpan physical clowning has more charm than its sweeter touches,
though the flights of fancy can yield fringe benefits like a man
made up as a watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the main competition, another amusingly gruff patriarch
is played by Om Puri in ``East is East,'' a funny, ribald family
story about the culture clash between English and Pakistani
attitudes. It has Miramax behind it and good commercial prospects
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday night's awards ceremony, the festival has several
major entries yet to unveil. They include (out of competition)
``Dogma,'' in which Kevin Smith grapples with religion; ``An Ideal
Husband,'' Oliver Parker's enveloping version of the Oscar Wilde
play; David Lynch's ``Straight Story,'' eagerly anticipated
although it is about a man named Straight on a long tractor ride;
Peter Greenaway's ``8{ Women,'' and ``Rosetta,'' from the Belgian
brothers whose previous film was the haunting ``La Promesse.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot to change the fact that Pedro Almodovar's
``All About My Mother'' is the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar _ whose film presents a whirl of real and would-be
women in a sometimes tragic, mostly hilarious series of encounters
_ gives his age as ``40-muchos'' by way of explaining his
much-noted recent stylistic mellowing. He has made 12 other films
but, amazingly, has never had one play at Cannes. ``I prefer to
come for gossip, for parties and just to talk with the people,'' he
said at a group lunch on the beach the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen looks like his lucky number. But then this year at
Cannes spookiness is a good-luck charm. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez, the former University of Central Florida film students who
were this year's left-field heroes at Sundance, are here with ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' the horror movie they made with a clever
pseudo-documentary conceit and a tiny budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people here wearing more than the movie cost,'' said
Myrick a few nervous moments before heading to the film's official
evening screening.
</P>
<P>
   There have been long lines for this sleeper, which has had a
million hits at its Web site, www.blairwitch.com, and will spawn a
comic book and assorted other tie-ins. All that fuss is about what
purports to be the final scenes shot by three filmmakers lost in
the woods with a legendary witch on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Sanchez said, taking in the scene around him, ``is
scarier.''

ART REVIEW: MADE FOR A MEDIEVAL QUEEN, A TINY BOOK THAT CREATED A
STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city's four-star attractions come in every size.
Among the very smallest of them is the 14th-century prayer book
known as ``The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux'' in the collection of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The book is only 3 1/2 inches high, but in the story of Western
culture it looms large. Art historian Erwin Panofsky, in his
celebrated ``Early Netherlandish Painting,'' cited it as the
wellspring of the northern European painting tradition that
stretches from van Eyck to Bruegel, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1954, when the book was bought by the museum from the
Rothschild family, it has resided in a vitrine at the Cloisters,
the Met's branch museum at Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan.
To the passing eye, it probably didn't look like much, with its
ash-gray, pinpoint-fine images. And the chance of seeing any more
than a few of them, even in the course of repeated visits, has been
slim.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a facsimile of the book was produced, which entailed
removing the leaves from their binding. The Met has framed 32
folios, including all the full-page illuminations, and put them on
temporary display at its Fifth Avenue headquarters in an exhibition
titled ``Prayer Book for a Queen: The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux,''
along with a survey of medieval books and prints.
</P>
<P>
   The little prayer book is extraordinary for many reasons,
beginning with its august provenance. Attributed to the artist Jean
Pucelle, it was created in Paris in the 1320s as a gift from King
Charles IV to his wife, Jeanne d'Evereux, who may have been only 11
years old when they married in 1324. Their time together was brief.
Charles died four years later, and Jeanne, through her long
widowhood, was much admired for her unostentatious piety.
</P>
<P>
   She was also known for her interest in art, and the prayer book,
a standard accouterment of aristocratic life, was part of the
estate she bequeathed to the French crown. It quickly found its way
into the itchy hands of that rabid bibliophile, Jean, Duc de Berry,
who counted it among his singular treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Well he should have; it is exquisite, the choice product of a
master hand. Little is known about Pucelle, and the association of
his name with the book has been debated. (Barbara Drake Boehm, a
curator of medieval art at the Met and the organizer of the show,
supports the attribution.) But whoever made the book was a pioneer.
In its pages, one finds the earliest known merging of northern
Gothic style with the revolutionary naturalism of Italian art.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Pucelle ever set foot in Italy is anyone's guess. But
there is no question that he was familiar with Duccio's great
``Maesta'' altarpiece, completed in Siena in 1311. In fact,
Duccio's work is quoted almost verbatim in the book, shrewdly
edited and customized.
</P>
<P>
   This is evident right up front in the miniature of the
Annunciation. Here Pucelle adapts a specific scene from Duccio, but
gives it a new narrative meaning. And for the first time in
northern art, figures appear within an illusionary perspectival
space, in this case a narrow room with a receding ceiling, paneled
walls and a crowd of angels in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   The new realism was made possible, in part, by Pucelle's formal
approach to the miniature. He conceived his pictures as drawings or
tonal paintings, done in black and shades of gray, with minute
brushstrokes and calligraphic pen lines. The figures are modeled
with hatching; drapery is shaded with a couturier's eye to how it
clings and falls. Color is spare: a lavender wash on a background,
ocher for a stucco building, a blush of coral on a cheek.
</P>
<P>
   And the artist's sense of drama is acute. The visit of the Magi
to the infant Jesus has an excited buzz and flutter, with one king
raising his arm like an exclamation point. Paired scenes subtly
interact. In the facing images of the Annunciation and the Arrest
of Christ, Mary and Jesus share the same hip-slung stance, as if
they were being pulled by magnets toward their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes from the life of King Louis IX, the crusader-saint who
was Jeanne's great-grandfather, are set in a similarly lucid,
vacuum-packed world. Miracles occur, as in an episode when the
imprisoned King has a prayer book flown in by celestial special
delivery. Elsewhere, he is shown as an exemplum of the Christian
life, spoon-feeding a leprous monk as his squeamish courtiers back
away.
</P>
<P>
   Such images were intended as moral lessons. But the book is also
dense with secular incident, much of it confined to the bottoms of
pages or margins. Sheets devoted to the liturgical calender are
illustrated with scenes of the months of the year: in February, a
man hunkers down in a wicker chair before a fire, as his socks dry
out on the chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   Most inventive of all are the ornamental forms that surround and
emerge from the book's Latin text. In one case, a written line ends
with the reclining figure of a hooded man, nude to the waist and
holding a candle. Everywhere, humans, beasts, insects and flowers
are grafted together in ways as fantastic as any computer-generated
morphing. And in such images _ which may have operated as a kind of
free zone, where an art of rigidly controlled ideas could finally
stop making sense _ the phantasmagoric side of the Gothic north
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   It's great to be able to see all of this in a single sweep; the
show is probably a one-time-only opportunity to do so. (The
limited-edition facsimile, at something like $7,000 a copy, isn't
exactly a take-home item.) And the accompanying exhibition,
``Devotions and Diversions: Prints and Books From the Late Middle
Ages in Northern Europe,'' organized by Suzanne Boorsch and Nadine
Orenstein of the Met, does much to supply a context for Pucelle's
book.
</P>
<P>
   The work ranges from hand-colored block prints with a bumptious
folk art charm to polished designs from urban workshops. As the
curators point out, prints were so common in the Middle Ages that
they were little valued, and as a result few have survived. Many
exist now only as single copies pasted inside books or travel
cases. An example of such a case, with a print intact, is included
here, as is a carved woodblock, with a Crucifixion on one side and
a St. Christopher on the other, both superb examples of relief
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of local shows of medieval art, incidentally, doesn't
stop here. At the Met, both the Assisi trove and the acquisitions
showcase, ``Mirror of the Medieval World,'' are still on view. And
the Frick Collection is host to a major event: it has just opened
its presentation of the celebrated secular manuscript known as the
Medieval Housebook, a must-see this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Housebook is an honored visitor to New York from Germany.
Jeanne d'Evereux's Book of Hours is one of the city's own
mini-monuments. Once the show is over, it will be rebound and
returned to its home at the Cloisters. This is the chance to take a
long, close look _ the Met supplies the magnifying glasses, along
with elbow-friendly shelves to lean on _ at beauties unlikely to be
seen again in their entirety for a very long time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ Hampton Roads, the natural harbor where the James
River and several lesser streams meet Chesapeake Bay, has had a
balcony seat for history.
</P>
<P>
   It was into these waters that Captain John Smith and his
companions sailed in 1607 after their first landfall at Cape Henry,
on their way to establish Jamestown. It was near here that the
French admiral Francois de Grasse turned back a British relief
fleet in 1781, sealing the fate of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   Here Commodore Matthew Perry set sail for his voyage to Japan in
1853, here the Monitor fought the Merrimac, heralding the age of
the ironclad that revolutionized naval warfare, here the U.S.
invasion force set out for North Africa during World War II. Here
U.S. warships have been built and the powerful Atlantic Fleet has
long been based.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, much of Tidewater, as the locals call the
region, was a backwater. The writer William Styron grew up in
Tidewater, and in his early novel ``Lie Down in Darkness'' (1951),
he wrote feelingly of ``the low, sorrowful beauty of tideland
streams winding through marshes full of small, darting, frightened
noises and glistening and dead silent at noon, except for a
whistle, far off, and a distant rumble on the rails.''
</P>
<P>
   You still find such places. One is the little county seat of
Surry, across the river from Jamestown, where a Confederate
memorial bears the bittersweet inscription, ``Our Heroes.'' Life
there is lived legato.
</P>
<P>
   They are no longer typical, though. Hampton Roads _ composed,
for our purposes, of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia
Beach, Hampton and Newport News, plus the towns of Jamestown,
Yorktown and Williamsburg _ has long since overtaken Richmond as a
metropolitan area. Its population now exceeds 1.5 million, roughly
a quarter of the state's total, and Virginia Beach, of all unlikely
places, is the Old Dominion's largest city, with 393,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   On a long weekend here recently, my wife, Betsey, and I were
flabbergasted by the transformation. As a schoolgirl 40 years ago,
she used to take the train to Buckroe Beach in Hampton on swimming
outings, and as a draftee 40 years ago I was based at sleepy Fort
Monroe, nearby, writing speeches for Gen. Bruce Clarke, one of the
lions of the Battle of the Bulge, and sometimes for Gen. Maxwell
Taylor, a D-Day hero.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? I asked my brother-in-law St. George Pinckney, a
Richmond man through and through. Simple, he said: ``The foreigners
and the come-heres'' did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 25 years, Europeans at the NATO headquarters in
Norfolk, people at the military bases, civilians from all over the
country whose companies moved them into the area, all helped break
through the crust of insularity,'' he said. ``In Richmond, that
never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The benign climate helped. This may not exactly be the Sun Belt,
but snow is about as common in these parts as Russian submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet's Really In
</P>
<P>
   The military remains the economic prime mover, despite a lot of
recent diversification. People here work in a Ford assembly plant
and a Budweiser brewery, for the mail-order queen Lillian Vernon
and Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network.
</P>
<P>
   But one in every four workers in Hampton Roads _ like Los
Angeles County, it is politically subdivided but economically
united _ takes home a paycheck from Uncle Sam, and total defense
spending here in 1997 totaled $6.92 billion. In terms of
active-duty personnel, seven of the nation's 60 largest military
installations are located in Hampton Roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has Fort Eustis, its transportation center, and Fort
Monroe, the only moated installation still in active use, where
Jefferson Davis was imprisoned after the Civil War. The Air Force
has Langley Air Force Base, the oldest active air base in the
country. Near that is NASA's big Langley Research Center,
established in 1917, where the astronauts learned the Right Stuff
for the pioneering Mercury and Apollo space shots.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk, of course, is a Navy town par excellence. All along its
western flank rise the fearsome gray superstructures of aircraft
carriers, cruisers and other vessels _ fighting machines catching
their breath between missions. The Norfolk Naval Base is the
largest in the world, home to more than 100 major ships and 27
squadrons of aircraft. More than 75,000 people work there. More
than 25,000 other people work at the Little Creek amphibious base
and the Oceana Naval Air Station, both in Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But Norfolk is no longer the brawling liberty town of World War
II. It was once as disorderly and disreputable a place as you could
find on the East Coast, and Main Street, a young man we met there
told us, ``used to be nothing but bars, cathouses, tattoo parlors,
and more bars.'' Now it is lined with gleaming modern buildings,
including hotels, a world trade center and bank towers, as well as
Nauticus, a Disneyesque maritime museum.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk has yet to attract a big-league sports franchise; this
must be one of the largest metropolitan areas in the nation without
one. But the New York Mets' Triple-A farm team, the Norfolk Tides,
play their home games in Harbor Park, a spiffy stadium close to the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprisingly, perhaps, Norfolk's metamorphosis has included
its emergence as a cultural center of note, with the Chrysler
Museum of Art and Virginia Opera in the vanguard. Both rank among
the outstanding institutions of their size in the South and, for
that matter, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Walter P. Chrysler Jr., son of the founder of Chrysler
Corp., who enabled Norfolk to join the late 20th-century revolution
in which museums have helped to power the revival of struggling
cities. Married to a Norfolk native, he lifted a provincial
collection into the top rank in 1971 with the gift of 30,000
objects that ``any museum in the world would kill for,'' as John
Russell wrote on one occasion in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the museum was deftly enlarged, modernized and
reorganized by the Washington architects George Hartman and Warren
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A series of rooms just to the right of the main entrance
contains two of the museum's treasures. A collection of Art Nouveau
furniture by Majorelle and Colonna, accompanied by Tiffany and
Galle accessories, fills the first.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a feast of glass, unmatched on this continent except
in the glass-making towns of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, N.Y.: room
after room of Favrile vases and Tiffany lamps, dozens of major
pieces of Lalique, Steuben and Wiener Werkstette glass, Sandwich
glass, Amberina, Murano glass.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in the picture galleries, my eye was caught by a
precise profile portrait of a man in a red turban, attributed to
Domenico Veneziano, Piero della Francesca's teacher, whose
surviving works are exceedingly rare; Georges de la Tour's pensive
St. Philip; a brassy, recumbent blonde, ``Mlle. Monna Lils,'' by
the Dutch modernist Kees van Dongen, and a mural by Thomas Hart
Benton, painted for the original Whitney Museum of American Art in
New York, which vividly embodies the breakneck pace of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   An elaborate parcel-gilt silver cup in the shape of a pineapple,
made in London in 1610, testifies to the civilization the Jamestown
settlers left behind three years earlier for a rude life in the
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Until fall, in the largest of the Chrysler's galleries, a giant,
golden Dale Chihuly glass sculpture, ``Laguna Murano Chandelier,''
has joined Venetian masterpieces of another era by Veronese and
Tintoretto. At the far end of the room, Bernini's great, wide-eyed
``Bust of the Savior,'' which the Baroque master originally
intended for Queen Christina of Sweden, ``finally has something to
stare at,'' as a curator irreverently remarked to us.
</P>
<P>
   More Chihulys, some of them so dazzling they made me weak in the
knees, are on show for three months at the Contemporary Art Center
of Virginia in Virginia Beach, magnificently installed and
brilliantly lit.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Man
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Opera has had but one general director in its
quarter-century existence, a Brooklyn-born violist named Peter
Mark. He has put it on the musical map in not one but three
locations. The company's principal residence is the Harrison
Theater in Norfolk, a smashing post-modern conversion (by the
Boston architect Graham Gund) of a seedy former USO theater and
wrestling arena. Completed in 1993 on a budget of under $10
million, it eschews frou-frou to focus on comfort and capacity
(1,600 seats).
</P>
<P>
   Next season Virginia Opera will stage 46 performances of five
operas, including a Handel rarity, ``Rodelinda,'' here and in
Richmond and northern Virginia. In addition, it will take its shows
on the road, performing in various guises before a quarter-million
Virginia schoolchildren, an unmatched educational touring program.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, who also conducts, has given important early breaks to
singers as important as Renee Fleming. Two dozen of his alumni are
on the current roster at the New York Metropolitan Opera. The
company has done ``Don Pasquale'' as a spaghetti western, no less,
and it has presented acclaimed premieres of several works by Mark's
wife, the Scottish composer Thea Musgrave, most recently her eighth
opera, ``Simon Bolivar,'' in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like picking up a live wire,'' Mark said of his arrival
here. ``In New York and L.A., people take things for granted. Here,
people who want something better for their children realize they
have to roll up their sleeves and create it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old Virginia Symphony Orchestra, which plays for the
opera's performances, has begun to burnish its reputation under its
young conductor, JoAnn Faletta. This spring, the orchestra was
featured during the wide-ranging third annual Virginia Waterfront
International Arts Festival. The thoroughly professional Virginia
Stage Company plays in the handsome old Wells Theater downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk is a very old city, of course, and quite a few
handprints of history have survived the free-swinging wrecker's
ball of recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most notable are three grouped close together
downtown: St. Paul's Episcopal Church (1739), shaded by towering
magnolias, which has a Revolutionary cannonball lodged in its south
wall; the Federal-style Moses Myers House, built in 1793 by the
city's first Jewish family, who brought with them from New York
portraits by Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Sully, which still hang in
the house, and the gray-and-white Old Norfolk Academy (1840),
designed in a rigorous Greek Revival style by Thomas U. Walter, who
added the House and Senate wings and the cast-iron dome to the U.S.
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A General's Tomb
</P>
<P>
   Another of Walter's local buildings, the domed Old City Hall,
has been turned into a Napoleonic mausoleum for Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, a tomb almost as grandiose as his ego. No fan of his, I
gave it a pass and instead visited the Scope Arena, a soaring,
saucerlike dome of interlocking concrete triangles, supported only
by a system of massive buttresses outside. The work of the Italian
Pier Luigi Nervi, this is engineering become art.
</P>
<P>
   You have to climb into the car to see the three 17th-century
brick buildings that lie beyond the city's perimeter. So far as I
know, they are the only survivors of their kind in the country: the
simple, story-and-a-half Adam Thoroughgood House in Virginia Beach
(circa 1680), named for a man who came to Virginia as an indentured
servant and made a fortune in tobacco, an early example of American
upward mobility; Bacon's Castle (1665), near Surry, a two-story
Jacobean manor house with a pair of triple chimneys and curvilinear
gables, and the wonderful, cherry-pink St. Luke's Church (1632),
near Smithfield, probably the only truly Gothic (as against Gothic
Revival) structure remaining in America, with the stone buttresses,
pediment, crockets and finials of the old-country models faithfully
copied in brick.
</P>
<P>
   If you come to Hampton Roads in springtime, you will encounter
an intoxicating array of flowering shrubs and trees along most
streets _ Bradford pears, wisteria, camelias, magnolias and
azaleas. The very best show is at the excellent Norfolk Botanical
Gardens, created by the WPA.
</P>
<P>
   A Rolling Excursion
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute trip across the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel will
take you to Hampton, the oldest continuous English-speaking
community in America.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Monroe, once known as ``the Gibraltar of the Chesapeake,''
stands at its edge. Burned twice, in the War of 1812 and the Civil
War, the old town has little to show for its long history, with the
notable exceptions of Hampton University, founded in 1868 as
Hampton Institute to educate freed slaves, and St. John's Church,
the oldest Anglican parish in the Western Hemisphere, dating from
1610. The present church dates ``only'' from 1728, but its lovely
silver communion plate, made in England in 1618, is still in use
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Newport News, which lies to the west of Hampton, is more of a
19th-century phenomenon. Railroad baron Collis P. Huntington chose
it as the eastern terminus of his new Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio Railroad,
with which he linked his Western lines to the Atlantic. He also
established the gigantic Newport News Shipbuilding &AMP; Drydock Co.,
still the nation's biggest.
</P>
<P>
   It was Collis' son, Archer, who contributed to the city the
institution you're most likely to visit there, the Mariners'
Museum. It has fabulous collections of ship models, from 6 inches
to 6 feet long; ship's figureheads, including a 3,200-pound eagle
from the USS Lancaster, built in 1881, and artifacts associated
with the ill-fated liner Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the Virginia Peninsula, as the tongue of land between
the James and York rivers is known, two towns a few miles apart
witnessed the beginning and the end of Britain's colonial
experience in America.
</P>
<P>
   Yorktown is not nearly as interesting a battlefield as
Gettysburg or Antietam, frankly, and the recreated Jamestown
Settlement, despite impressive museums, has something of the theme
park about it. The site of the original village, administered by
the Colonial National Historical Park, includes the broken tower of
the settlers' fourth church, finished in 1647, which stands amid
lacy dogwoods _ ``God's perfect trees,'' Betsey calls them.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow neither the tower nor the reproduction huts at the
Settlement proved as evocative for us as other features of the
historic park, like the pitch swamp where the settlers struggled to
survive, now inhabited most visibly by herons, or the simple list
of the 104 settlers who stayed in 1607, and the 50 among them who
died within six months.
</P>
<P>
   It was fascinating, too, to put some flesh on the cardboard
figure of John Smith, the colony's gutsy, imperious leader. Long
before he reached the American wilderness, it turns out, he had
fought in Hungary, been taken in captivity to Turkey, been sold
into slavery in Russia, killed his master, escaped and made his way
home to Britain. I guess he must have sailed for Virginia to inject
some excitement into a humdrum life.
</P>
<P>
   The Lure of Williamsburg
</P>
<P>
   I have saved for last the area's premier attraction for
tourists, Colonial Williamsburg, the reconstituted capital of
Patrick Henry and George Washington, willed back into existence by
the millions of the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more need to describe it than to describe the Statue
of Liberty. Suffice it to say that I went there as a kid, visited
it often when I was at Fort Monroe and took my stepchildren there.
I have never tired of it, especially the restored Governor's
Palace, with its formal gardens, and the George Wythe House, which
belonged to Jefferson's law teacher. This time, Betsey and I
especially enjoyed a 10-minute midday prayer service at Bruton
Parish Church, sitting in a box pew that belonged to St. George
Tucker, whose descendant, another St. George Tucker, christened
her. Fond of continuity, these Virginians.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's the ensemble that counts in Williamsburg _ shops
and taverns, houses and gardens _ plus two amazing museums. One
houses Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's pioneering collection of American
folk art; a special show of Edward Hicks landscapes has been
mounted there this year. The other, designed by Kevin Roche and
named for DeWitt Wallace, a co-founder of The Reader's Digest,
houses a world-class decorative arts collection.
</P>
<P>
   And more, always more: just down the road stands Carter's Grove,
the Georgian plantation often described as ``the most beautiful
house in America,'' and all over Williamsburg there are daily
re-enactments of turning points in colonial history, designed to
involve visitors in the past.
</P>
<P>
   These last were part of the recipe for Williamsburg's rebound
after an attendance slump in the late 1980s and early '90s, caused
partly by theme parks and science centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to create a more compelling environment to tell
the story of our country's ideals and values,'' explained Robert C.
Wilburn, Williamsburg's outgoing president. ``We needed more than
antiques and gardens. This is no longer your mother's Colonial
Williamsburg, and we're back to the busiest we've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting the Hampton Roads area around
Norfolk, Va.:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   COLONIAL HOUSES, 302 E. Francis St., Williamsburg, (757)
565-8440. This is Williamsburg's best-kept secret. It's hard to
imagine a more charming place to spend a night or a weekend than
one of the 18th-century houses or taverns in the colonial capital,
with authentically creaking floors, fetchingly time-worn antiques,
working fireplaces and modern plumbing. Ours, once occupied by Cary
Grant, came with a quartet of well-mannered sheep across the
street. Double room: $99 to $200 a night.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIOTT WATERSIDE, 235 E. Main St., Norfolk, (757) 627-4200. An
unusually well-managed chain hotel, Norfolk's best, with
fascinating views over the ship-filled harbor from rooms on the
upper stories. Right in the middle of the downtown area, near
Waterside Marketplace, yet close to freeways. The 405 rooms are
bright and immaculate if not luxurious. The good-humored clerks and
bellmen act as if they enjoy what they do. Double room: $159 to
$179 a night.
</P>
<P>
   PAGE HOUSE INN, 313 Fairfax Ave., Norfolk, (757) 625-5033. Four
rooms, two suites, in a superbly refurbished Georgian Revival brick
mansion, built in 1898, with the leafy streets of the Ghent
district on the doorstep. This urban, urbane bed-and-breakfast is
so close to the Chrysler Museum of Art that you could come back at
midday to rest your feet for an hour or so if need be. Up-to-date
gear, including cable TV, modems and in-room fridges. Double room:
$116 to $185 a night.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG INN, Francis Street, Williamsburg, (757) 229-1000.
The region's premier establishment, owned by Colonial Williamsburg,
is sedate and agreeably old-fashioned. The decor is pure 1930s,
with quilted sateen bedspreads, swag curtains and flowered
wallpaper, but the bathrooms and air-conditioning are 1990's and
the sheets and towels are to die for. The staff is remarkably
friendly and accommodating. Killer breakfasts. Double room: $365 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   What to Eat
</P>
<P>
   FORD'S COLONY, 240 Ford's Colony Drive, Williamsburg, (757)
258-4100. Among his peers, David Everett is considered one of the
South's standout chefs. No wonder. In a formal dining room
overlooking a suburban golf course, he serves delicious,
technically accomplished dishes like a four-story tower of
tomatoes, blackened and spiced crabmeat and chopped cured salmon.
The wines are superb; the service, alas, is a little pompous.
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY STAR, 1608 Pleasure House Road, Virginia Beach, (757)
363-8410. Decorated with 1940s flea-market finds, this congenial
spot is tucked into a strip mall halfway between downtown Norfolk
and the beach. Butch Butt, once a fisherman, knows where to find
the best local, seasonal raw materials, and his partner, Amy
Brandt, cooks them simply and skillfully _ prime soft-shell crabs,
from the Atlantic, not the Bay; wild rockfish, cherrystone clams
from their place of origin, Cherrystone Creek on the Eastern Shore.

   PIERCE'S PITT BAR-B-QUE, 137 Rochambeau Drive, Lightfoot, (757)
565-2955. You won't miss it on the highway near Williamsburg, not
with its orange and red Day-Glo paint job. Pierce's is expanding
again. But the pitmaster sticks to tradition: succulent ribs and
pork shoulder, slow-cooked over oak and hickory logs. Pitt? A
sign-painter's mistake that stuck.

   SURREY HOUSE, Route 31, Surry, (757) 294-3389. A '50s roadhouse
in a little courthouse town near the James River ferry, serving
authentic, unadorned regional food: peanut soup, proper crab cakes,
dynamite country ham cured by S. Wallace Edwards &AMP; Sons, just down
the road, and lemon chess pie with a featherweight crust. Wanda,
the waitress, has the sweetest smile and softest voice this side of
heaven.

   TODD JURICH'S BISTRO, 210 W. York St., Norfolk, (757) 622-3210.
Norfolk's standout, an unpretentious room with paper tablecloths.
Jurich is a wizard with Eastern Shore shellfish; try his
mouthwateringly plump, juicy fried oysters or the irresistible
oyster stew, flavored with slivers of country bacon. Some dishes
have too many ingredients, but the wine list is exemplary and the
prices are minuscule (no starter above $8).

desserts. The main courses taste better than they read, especially
the pan-fried chicken. More than a dozen Virginia wines, plus
plenty of others; the wait staff is overstretched.

ENVOYS OF SOUTH ASIAN RIVALS SAY TENSION IS EASING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One-year after tit-for-tat atomic weapons testing
in South Asia, two diplomats from India and Pakistan said Thursday
that tension between the rival countries had diminished along with
the threat of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a joint news conference, Riaz Khokhar, the Pakistani
ambassador to Washington, said ``the tension has certainly gone
down,'' adding, ``there is no reason for us to believe that there
is an imminent threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Naresh Chandra, India's ambassador to the United States, said,
``I don't think that tensions have gone up'' and noted that the two
countries signed an agreement in February to improve cooperation
and relations.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947, conducted a series of
nuclear tests last May and only last month test fired ballistic
missiles that can carry nuclear warheads and reach well into the
other's territory. The tests have sparked concerns of a nuclear
arms race on the volatile subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Both ambassadors said their countries seek to avoid an arms
race, although it remains uncertain whether either nation will sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, an international agreement that
forbids nuclear weapons tests, by the September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan does not want a nuclear war. Pakistan is not looking
for an arms race. Pakistan is interested in revolving problems,''
Khokhar said. ``I hope that we ... could find solutions to our
problems so that we could get rid of the scourge of nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   India backs nuclear disarmament if simmering issues over
contested territory can be resolved, said Chandra, who added that
his country was ``perfectly willing'' to give up its nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism, the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, a nonpartisan think tank here, warned that the ballistic
missile tests and atomic detonations ``raise the specter of a
slowly developing regional arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   China, a traditional ally of Pakistan, might be drawn into a
regional arms race because it might feel threatened by India's
nuclear missiles that can reach Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will likely reassess its nuclear force structure and
posture towards India,'' the Carnegie Endowment said.
</P>
<P>
   India, with a population of nearly 1 billion people, and
Pakistan, with 133 million people, have been at odds over
territorial disputes, national boundaries and restive ethnic groups
for decades.

A `LESSON' WE COULD ALL LEARN FROM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Lesson Before Dying'' begins and ends with murder _ the
murder of a shopkeeper and the murder of the man accused of pumping
bullets into the shopkeeper's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The accused is innocent, but no matter. He's strapped to a
chair, electrical currents ripping through his body until it no
longer moves.
</P>
<P>
   Being there _ in the shop, watching the shopkeeper go down _
cripples his defense. The location of his hands _ inside the cash
register _ seals his fate.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1947, rural Louisiana. The accused man is black, the dead
shopkeeper white. Quick trial. Quick sentence. Quick death.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't much time to set things in order.
</P>
<P>
   Like dying with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' airing at 9:30 p.m. EDT Saturday on
HBO, is based on Ernest J. Gaines' captivating novel about death
and despair, courage and triumph, dreams and inner
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither junky nor clunky, puffed nor gimmicky, ``A Lesson Before
Dying'' arrives at just the right time in this month of bloated
silliness. It's subtle and moving, eloquent and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   You watch it and wonder why the networks, with their legions of
captive viewers, refuse to offer such movies free of sludgy
self-promotion and importance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they feed us ``Cleopatra'' and ``Noah's Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Lesson Before Dying'' focuses on Grant Wiggins (Don Cheadle,
certainly one of the most skilled actors today) who has returned to
teach in the small town where he was raised. Bitterly resigned to
racial injustice in the South, he is saddled with anger and
ambition, which fuel his dreams of escaping the second-class life
of a black man in a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   He's realistic in his wants and needs and goals: He's no messiah
in the tiny town that has need of his composure and strength and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   When Jefferson _ his only name _ (Mekhi Phifer) is sentenced to
die, Grant is asked to visit the jail cell, to give him hope.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was a poor lad with little schooling. He spent most of
his time fishing and trying to stay out of trouble. Trouble came
looking for him in the form of two buddies who gave him a lift to
his favorite watering hole. They stopped off at the shop where
things get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   When the shopkeeper pulls a gun, the two men pull theirs. All go
down in a flurry of bullets. Jefferson goes for the cash register,
just as a crowd of men bursts in. White men. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan for Jefferson's defense: He's a brainless,
subhuman mutant unable to think. He was bred to work in the fields,
nothing more. Killing him would be akin to slaying a hog.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decides to slay the hog.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Lesson Before Dying'' also stars Cicely Tyson, Lisa
Arrindell Anderson and Irma P. Hall, in a dead-on performance as
Jefferson's suffering guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Director Joseph Sargent crafts this film with a sensitive hand.
But what's best about the production is its subtle nudging about
education and life's affirmations and God's place in all this.
Meeting with Jefferson in the tiny jail cell, Grant learns the most
lessons. About race, about friendship, about courage. Scenes are
played out with understated restraint and yet with so much tension.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines' more complex literary themes are woven into the fabric,
illuminating situations that often seem rather simple on the
surface. And ``A Lesson Before Dying'' manages to reflect the
book's issues _ issues that take place within a community of
African-Americans. Issues rarely talked about.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel journeys undertaken by the two key figures make for
a fascinating exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a sample. Then shelve ``A Lesson Before Dying'' _ the
book and the movie _ right up there with ``Sounder'' and other
classics examining the black condition.

LAWMAKERS LAMENT RADIOACTIVE DETOUR THROUGH CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May. 23)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the protests of California's two senators,
trucks bearing tons of low-level radioactive waste from around the
country may start rumbling through the Golden State's desert near
Death Valley next month on a circuitous path to a dump site in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Energy Department plan, truckers hauling waste
generated in the East and Midwest can select from four routes to a
government repository for spent radioactive material called the
Nevada Test Site, about 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Two routes
approach the facility from the east, while the other two detour
through eastern California.
</P>
<P>
   While the government says that thousands of shipments of such
waste using specially lined containers have been transferred from
facility to facility without incident since 1961, environmental
groups are questioning the safety of nuclear waste in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both California
Democrats, have raised the issue by noting that the detours involve
roads that are not as good as the interstate highways that the
waste trucks usually take.
</P>
<P>
   The waste that could cross into California includes contaminated
debris, soil, sludge, concrete, wood and lab equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Energy Department asked 15 government
and private plants around the country that generate the waste _
mainly the byproduct of nuclear weapons manufacturing _ to avoid
current truck-shipping routes through Las Vegas and over the Hoover
Dam, where massive road construction is under way and delays are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on May 12,
Feinstein and Boxer wrote, ``As 90 percent of these shipments are
from defense facilities to the east, we do not understand the
rationale for diverting shipments into California, only then to
reverse direction and proceed east to the Nevada Test Site.''
</P>
<P>
   The two paths through California would put truckers on rural
roadways that are not as well maintained and as safe as the
interstates.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the waste shipments ``have traveled on more direct
routes for many years,'' the senators insisted that ``the current
interstate highway routes are most appropriate'' for them. They
added, ``There is no supportable reason for moving these
transportation routes into California, or for using roads of lesser
quality for these shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   They particularly objected to the proposed use of State Route
127, which they said ``is a primary access route for tourist
traffic to Death Valley National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hasn't responded to the lawmakers but in a statement
to the Hearst Newspapers said, ``We will continue to work with the
senators, the state of California and the counties of Inyo and San
Bernardino on this issue.'' The counties contain the proposed
alternate routes.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for a route change to bypass Las Vegas grew after a
1997 incident in which a truck hauling some radioactive waste from
an Ohio nuclear weapons plant leaked some of its liquid cargo in
Kingman, Ariz., 110 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid itself was not radioactive, but the incident sparked
a safety review and a 16-month moratorium of shipments to Nevada
from the facility, the Fernald Enviornmental Management Project
outside Cincinatti.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for shipping waste rests with the 15 individual
weapons plants, four of which are in California, which select
private companies for the task. The routes taken to the Nevada Test
Site are determined by the shipping companies. They take into
consideration the Energy Department's suggested routes but are not
required to travel them.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Morgan, an Energy Department spokesman in Las Vegas, said
that so far no low-level radioactive waste generated outside
California has crossed the state en route to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also considering possible train shipments to
Nevada and is conducting a environmental assessment of the idea,
said Michael Giblin, an Energy Department environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Fernald already has begun rail shipments of radioactive dirt to
a Utah landfill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Environmental groups are concerned that an accident involving
nuclear waste in transit could have terrible consequences. Large
swaths of land could be contaminated, said Diane D'Arrigo,
radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service.
</P>
<P>
   A rail accident could be even more dangerous, said the Safe
Energy Communication Council in Washington, D.C. ``With
approximately 3.7 accidents per million train miles each year, an
accident involving a train carrying nuclear waste is more than just
a statistical probability,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan noted the good safety record of transporting such
waste and said the material from the 15 plants has such a low level
of radioactivity that workers aren't required to wear special
clothing when handling it.
</P>
<P>
   Local fire departments and state police already are versed in
how to handle such a clean up, Morgan added. ``In almost all cases,
it's a simple as coming in with shovels and front end loaders and
putting it back in boxes,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Energy Department's plan for alternative routes around
Las Vegas, trucks zig-zagging over one would travel on 53 miles of
California roads. Vehicles approaching Las Vegas from the south in
Nevada would turn west into California on Interstate 40 for 20
miles then head north on U.S. 95 just past Needles for another 20
miles. They would cross back into Nevada for 20 miles, then turn
west on Route 164 only to return to California and connect to
Interstate 15 heading north for 13 miles and cross back again into
Nevada for another 100 miles to the test site.
</P>
<P>
   In another circuitous path, trucks would travel on the same 53
miles of California roads. But at Interstate 15, near Nipton,
Calif., they would head 40 miles southwest toward the interior of
the state before turning north for 80 miles on Route 127 in a
region known as the Devil's Playground until they reach the Nevada
border. The Nevada Test Site is 35 miles from that point.

SENATE EYES LAW TO BLOCK CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO INTERNET SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Type in the words ``teen jobs'' into an Internet
search engine and it will lead you to a list of sites about careers
_ and to sites that feature pictures of nude teenagers and graphic
sex acts, as was demonstrated Thursday at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee also saw how easily
an Internet site advocating hatred of Jews could be pulled up by
simply putting in the name of a Chicago newspaper World Wide Web
site incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel's chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen.
Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., have their way, many schools and libraries
will be required to place Internet filters on their computers so
students cannot access Web sites dealing in sex, violence and
illegal drugs simply by typing in seemingly innocuous words like
``teen jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators are pushing legislation that would require those
schools and libraries receiving federal subsidies for Internet
service to block access to sites that each local school and library
deem inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 schools, 13,000 school districts and 5,000
libraries receiving federal Internet subsidies would come under the
law. Thousands more schools and libraries could be affected if they
seek and receive the federal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also wants access banned to other sites that provide
detailed instructions on how to make bombs and drugs as well as to
a myriad of so-called ``hate'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neo-Nazi propaganda, images of burning crosses, racist
literature, religious bigotry, messages and images of unimaginable
hatred and cruelty are just one click away from our children's eyes
and mind,'' McCain told a committee hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Howard P. Berkowitz, chairman of the Anti-Defamation League, an
organization that combats racism and prejudice, testified that the
search for the word ``Holocaust'' will yield serious historical
articles along with some ``hate'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   His organization has designed Internet filters that block access
to the hate messages but allow access to the historical material.
He said the anti-hate filtering software could be downloaded free
of charge from his group's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While Berkowitz said he supported the thrust of McCain's bill,
he said he didn't think the courts would uphold the mandatory use
of filtering by schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Education Association criticized the bill as too broad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would impose a one-size-fits-all federal solution on
communities throughout the country,'' said Barry Steinhardt,
associate director of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents and libraries should remain free to consider
other approaches to Internet safety, including parental supervision
of Internet use by minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Center For Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group
working to protect free speech on the Internet, points to
``kid-oriented'' search engines as another option. For example, if
a kid-oriented search engine, such as the one available at
www.edview.com, is used to search ``teen jobs,'' it will not pull
up any sex sites.
</P>
<P>
   McCain agreed that parental supervision is important but said
much of the time children spend on the Internet is spent outside
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nickerson, the chief executive officer of Seattle-based
N2H2, a maker of Internet filters, said many schools and public
libraries with computers already use filtering software.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some libraries are opposed to filtering on First
Amendment grounds that it inhibits free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require libraries to put the software on
one computer but not all of them so adults have free access to
information.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson said filtering software has dramatically improved
since it was first introduced a few years ago. Early filters would
block access to medical sites containing information about breast
cancer along with sex sites when the word ``breast'' was typed into
a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Newer filters block access to specific World Wide Web sites.
Nickerson's firm has 75 people researching new sites to see what
type of information they contain so they can keep their Internet
filtering programs up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson admitted that many teenagers and technically-savvy
children could find ways to get around the filtering programs. He
argued that filters block access to sex and other Web sites that
are inadvertently accessed by the majority of children who are
simply trying to do homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the Internet filtering legislation last
year, but the House didn't consider the bill.

 &HT;    BIPARTISAN SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM PLAN UNVEILED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan proposal to reform Social Security by
using a portion of payroll taxes to finance individual savings
accounts from birth to retirement was unveiled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have moved the debate past the argument of
whether there should be private investment to how private
investment should be done,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. ``There
is a growing consensus that we can strengthen the safety net
provided by Social Security while at the same time providing
Americans with more investment opportunities and retirement
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux offered the plan -- which would divert 2 percentage
points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax into individual investment
accounts -- as a ``mainstream'' alternative to ones offered by the
Clinton administration and Republican leaders of the House Ways and
Means Committee, and as one that could ``build support from the
center out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would use the projected federal surplus to supplement
voluntary contributions workers could make to their retirement
accounts. Workers would receive a $100 supplement from the
government for their first dollar voluntarily contributed and then
a dollar-for-dollar match on contributions up to 1 percent of the
taxable wage base for Social Security -- $726 in 1999. Workers
could contribute up to $2,000 to their individual accounts
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Children born after 1995 (CQ) would receive a Social Security
account worth $1,000 at birth. Another $500 a year would be added
for the next five years, for a total of $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other plans being offered in Congress, the proposal
by Breaux and Sen. Gregg Judd, R-N.H., would eliminate the
``earnings test'' that reduces Social Security benefits for workers
aged 65-to-69.
</P>
<P>
   It also would accelerate an increase in the eligibility age to
67 for full benefits, from the year 2027 to 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, after meeting President Clinton, House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer said he would hold hearings
this summer on proposals to strengthen Social Security.

   &UR; RIVERDANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A southern minister was completing a temperance sermon. With
great expression he said, `If I had all the beer in the world, I'd
take it and pour it into the river.`
</P>
<P>
   With even greater emphasis he said, `And if I had all the wine
in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river.`
</P>
<P>
   And then finally, he said, `And if I had all the whiskey in the
world, I'd take it and pour it into the river.` Sermon complete, he
then sat down.
</P>
<P>
   The song leader stood very cautiously and announced with a
smile, `For our closing song, let us sing Hymn (NU)365: 'Shall We
Gather at the River'.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECOND TIME AROUND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A prospective juror in a Dallas District Court was surprised by
the definition of voluntary manslaughter given the panel...`an
intentional killing that occurs while the defendant is under the
immediate influence of sudden passion arising from an adequate
cause, such as when a spouse's mate is found in a 'compromising
position.'`
</P>
<P>
   `See, I have a problem with that passion business,` responded
the jury candidate. `During my first marriage, I came in and found
my husband in bed with my neighbor. All I did was divorce him. I
had no idea that I could have shot him.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WINE, WOMEN AND FOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man is walking down the beach and comes across an old bottle.
He picks it up, pulls out the cork and out pops a genie.
</P>
<P>
   The genie says, `Thank you for freeing me from the bottle. In
return I will grant you three wishes.`
</P>
<P>
   The man says `Great! I always dreamed of this and I know exactly
what I want. First, I want one billion dollars in a Swiss bank
account.` Poof! There is a flash of light and a piece of paper with
account numbers appears in his hand. He continues, `Next, I want a
brand new red Ferrari right here.` Poof! There is a flash of light
and a bright red brand-new Ferrari appears right next to him. He
continues, `Finally, I want to be irresistible to women.` Poof!
</P>
<P>
   There is a flash of light and he turns into a box of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH AND THE JEWISH MOTHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mothers come in all shapes and sizes. For example, an Italian
Mother might chastise her offspring for not eating by saying, `Eat
your dinner, or I'll kill you.`
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish Mother on the other hand would say, `Eat your dinner,
or I'll kill myself.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADVICE FROM GEORGE CARLIN &LR;

   If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have
monkeys and apes?

<P>
   The main reason Santa is so jolly is because he knows where all
the bad girls live.
</P>
<P>
   I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, `Where's the
self-help section?` She said if she told me, it would defeat the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that all those trick-or-treaters wearing sheets
aren't going as ghosts but as mattresses?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do
`practice?`
</P>
<P>
   Where do forest rangers go to `get away from it all?`
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when you see an endangered animal eating an
endangered plant?
</P>
<P>
   Would a fly without wings be called a walk?
</P>
<P>
   Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone
will clean them?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?

<P>
   How do they get the deer to cross at that yellow road sign?

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Very early one recent morning I left a West Side coffee shop and
was greeted by an attractive woman with an exuberant ``Hi, honey!''
Recovering my composure, I responded that I had always dreamed of
being greeted so warmly by a beautiful woman first thing in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was only then I realized that she had been speaking to her
dog, which she had tethered outside the coffee shop and which, in
the 10 or so seconds in which this had all transpired, had walked
several circles around me, effectively trapping me within its
leash. The woman said with a smile, ``Was being tied up part of
your dream?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered. ``That's probably a West Side thing. I live
in New Jersey.''
</P>

   Sign of the times: Fred Ehrman was walking along 55th Street
recently when he noticed four burly constuction workers sitting on
the sidewalk, eating their breakfast and deep in conversation. An
attractive woman passed in front of them but none of the men looked
her way. As Mr. Ehrman passed by the men he overheard the following
exchange:
</P>
<P>
   First worker: ``So what happened last week?''
</P>
<P>
   Second worker: ``Telephone and the Internets had big drops but I
made up that decline with my cyclicals and financials.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ehrman's postscript: ``I found myself ironically nostalgic
for those old leering whistles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 86th Street crosstown bus recently, a passenger picked up
something from the floor and gave it to the driver. The driver then
announced: ``Someone just found a clip-on earring. Everyone check
to see if it's yours. That goes for both men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers laughed and checked their ears. But the
perfectly groomed woman seated next to me declared in an
exasperated tone, ``Men don't wear clip-ons.'' _ DONALD J.

   A grandmother of three boys, I was standing on a bus, crowded
with schoolchildren, going to meet my pregnant daughter. I was
holding a book that I was planning to give her, ``What to Name Your
Baby Girl.'' A boy about 10 years old, who was sitting in front of
me, obviously noticed the title of the book. He looked at me and
asked, ``Would you like to sit down?''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't take him up on his offer because I was getting off
soon, but when I did alight it was with a wide grin on my face and
a more sprightly spring to my grandmotherly step.

   Marjorie J. Witherspoon, who recently moved to Manhattan, was
interested to observe the difference between the freedom her
children enjoyed growing up in Vermont and the routine enjoyed, or
at least employed, by some youngsters here. She noticed a boy about
10 or 11 leaving a store on the West Side, walkie-talkie in hand,
reporting, ``I'm the leaving the store now.'' Walking behind him as
they came to the first crossing, she heard him call again, ``I'm at
109th.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next corner, the boy apparently couldn't get a response _
there was an anxious query of ``Dad, Dad.'' An exasperated voice
responded, ``Give it a rest, Greg.'' The youngster ignored the
advice _ at the next block he again reported his location. How long
the two-way communication went on isn't known _ Ms. Witherspoon
veered off.
</P>
<P>
   Elly Elliott wondered whether it was a slip of the tongue or a
sign of the times. She recently heard the announcer on a classical
music program say that the next composition to be played would be
``a work by Smetana _ the overture to `The Battered Bride.'''

   Fifty years ago, with my Army discharge and brand new N.Y.U.
degree in finance, I was hired as a trainee at one of the large
prestigious banks on Wall Street. The president, a tall,
distinguished- looking former Ivy League football player,
occasionally descended from his aerie and spoke to the trainees.
His talk went something like this: ``You men are the future of this
bank _ you will be calling on the General Electrics and I.B.M.'s of
the nation. When a man from our bank steps into a meeting, I expect
that his bearing and demeanor will be such that a hush will come
over the room.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, flush with the image of myself as a corporate
leader, I looked in the mirror at the East Side tenement in which I
had grown up. What I saw was a 130-pound, 5 foot 5 inch,
24-year-old with a receding chin who looked closer to 16. I said to
myself, ``That son of agun was not talking about me.'' Right then
I decided to resign. Many years later, I became president of a
much, much smaller bank. And what kind of young men did I hire to
represent it? Yes, football-player types with a firm handshake who
could enter a room and be noticed.

   I was avoiding the abandoned umbrellas and pleas for a quarter
on the Bowery when I looked up to see a rainbow stretching over the
East Village. In front of the Jean Cocteau Theater, I stopped and
stood with half-a-dozen early playgoers, admiring the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that, a rainbow in New York,'' an elderly woman
remarked. Further up the block, I exchanged smiles with a man
hurrying along.
</P>
<P>
   By Cooper Union, I looked up and the rainbow had dissipated into
pink, blue and orange blotches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least we had it with us for a little while,'' a
stranger who noticed me looking up commented.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks later at an intersection,. a car tried to jump the
light and honked at me. Walking past his fender, I gave him my best
city scowl and looked up to see the sky gray once again.

   One day, Elayne Rosen's 85-year-old mother had instant recall
about a year-old incident. Later the same day, though, Ms. Rosen
asked about something that had happened a few hours earlier. Her
motherenid doesn't have name. replied, ``I can remember last year
but you'd better call me next year about today's question.''

YEARS AGO. WE REPEAT IT ON REQUEST) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Every year, I get the itch to do it again. &QL; 
It doesn't last long. All I have to go is go down to the field, and
 &QL; 
stick around for one inning. After the first crying tantrum, thrown
helmet, misplaced glove, `Coach, when do I go in,' and `Hey, why
isn't my kid playing,' I get back in the car, drive home, let the
dog out to chase squirrels,  &QL; 
open a beer, turn on the TV and feel sorry for anyone who has to
deal with  &QL; 
10-year-old prima donnas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Some tips to Little League coaches: &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Do not draft any kid who has a father, mother, grandparents, or
lives with any adults who might come to watch him play. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. The neater the kid, the cleaner the shoes, the newer the glove,
the worse the kid plays. There are no exceptions to this rule. Only
dirty kids with torn shoes and old gloves have any talent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Never offer to drive a kid home. The ones who need rides never
live near &QL; 
you and they never know how to get to their house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Tell the fattest kid on the team that he is the catcher. This is
how we keep the stereotype alive. You have an obligation to do so. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Ask at the first practice who wants to be catcher. Then,
announce  &QL; 
that the catcher will always get to be first in line for pizza or
ice cream after the game. Then offer ten bucks a game. No one will
have volunteered. &QL; 
Then tell the fat kid he's the one. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Basic phrase for keeping fathers away from the fence: ``I can
always tell which father is here for more than just to watch his
own kid. The one who's always going to be there to help when I need
him. The one who has time for all the kids, not just his own.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. Kids don't get hurt. They're kids. They only twist their ankle
when they get picked off base. They only hurt their arm after one
of their throws lands in the refreshment stand. They only have
stomach aches when they are in the on-deck circle in the last
inning with the bases loaded. Don't panic. Walk over to the
stricken kid, carrying the water jug subtly under your arm. Tell
him to get up, get on with the game, or you'll pour water on him
and announce that he wet his pants.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. Never coach third base. Put someone there you really hate. And
then practice screaming, ``How could you send him in that
situation, you just cost us the game!''and ``Why did you hold him
up, they never could have thrown him out!''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. There will be kids you can't stand. Here's how to have fun with
them. Ask them if they are wearing protective cups, like they are
supposed to. These are the kind of kids who never do, but tell you
they are. Pick up a bat and jab them in the crotch. They will
collapse in pain. You'll feel better and they will have learned a
lesson in why to wear a cup and why not to tell a lie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
10. Practice rotating your clipboard 180 degrees with one hand.
This will come in handy when a parent complains about your
coaching. And then, look him  &QL; 
straight in the face, stare into his eyes, flip the clipboard and
say, `Here, you take over, I'm going home.' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TIPS TO LITTLE LEAGUE COACHES ON HOW TO BEAT THEIR OPPONENT'S
BUTT. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Forget the 9-man lineups you see on television. You only have
three kids who can really play. Bat them 1-2-3 in the lineup. They
get up more, the team scores more, you win more. You're a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup? An interesting concept. People with concepts rake the
field after the game.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remember the neighborhood game running bases? Same principle.
The way to beat 10-year-olds is to make them throw the ball and
catch it. Most of them don't do either very well. If a kid gets a
hit, tell him to keep running.
</P>
<P>
   The fielder has to throw the ball to the next base where someone
has to catch it and make the tag while keeping the ball securely in
the glove. Guess the odds of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Some sourpuss will whine that this strategy is not in the spirit
of the game. Tell him the spirit of the game went out with the
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pretend you feel sorry for the opposing pitcher when he walks
six batters in a row. Try not to laugh when you tell him to `relax,
take your time, and just get it over.'
</P>
<P>
   Want to see a kid walk TEN batters in a row? Tell him to relax,
take his time, and just get it over.'
</P>
<P>
   4. Chances are, the umpires will be high-school age kids out to
make a buck. When the other coach yells at him over a call get up
and say `It doesn't matter how young you are, YOU'RE in charge
here!'
</P>
<P>
   When he tells you to shut up later in the game for challenging a
call, walk out on the field and tell him for all to hear, `Don't
you EVER talk to an adult like that!' His spirit is now broken. You
should get every call from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   5. Just like you have only three hitters (if you are lucky), you
only have three kids who can catch the ball _ usually your
shortstop (your kid, since you're the coach,) your pitcher (thereby
costing you a fielder) and your firstbaseman (maybe). Remember who
is in the outfield and why you put them out there in the first
place. In other words, anything your shortstop, pitcher or first
baseman can reach is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   6. If the outfielder MUST try to make a catch, (he won't) send
your shortstop, first baseman and yes, even your pitcher, out to
get the ball as fast as possible. You can try to train your
outfielders to move to the ball quickly by constantly yelling at
them to `GET IT IN,' but the season will be almost over before they
realize you aren't telling them that their fly is open. 7. The
worst brats in the world are little league pitchers. They are prima
donnas who have been told by their fathers and grandmothers that
they are great. They are crybabies who think the umpire is out to
get them and there hasn't ever been a ball hit that a little league
pitcher didn't think someone should have caught.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to drive him nuts. Runner on third, next batter
walks. There is nothing in the rules that says the batter has to
stop at first. Tell him to keep running. The pitcher, being the
little superstar he is, will try to get the runner at second. The
runner on third will romp home with an easy run. The pitcher will
literally stomp his feet and look around everywhere to find someone
to blame. He will then walk at least six batters in a row,
particularly after you tell him to relax and just get it over.
</P>
<P>
   8. Select a good-looking mother to keep the scorebook during the
long, lonely season. Oh, you would rather share the bench with
someone who has a knowledge of the game. Good concept.
</P>
<P>
   9. Oh, no, the umpire didn't show up!

   This is a real gift! Walk over to the other side, put on your
best poker face and ask the other team's parents if someone would
like to call the game. The idiots on your side will go nuts,
thinking you really blew it this time. But you know better. As he
takes the field, tell the volunteer that even though everyone
thinks he is going to cheat, you know better. You will get every
close call all day.

   10. After the game, divide the equipment bags by putting one bat
in one bag and the other 50 pounds of bats, balls, helmets, etc.,
in the other. When `dad' approaches to ask why Jason only played
two innings, stop and pretend you really want to discuss it with
him. Ask him to help you carry the gear to the car, giving him the
heavy one. Walk to the car as fast as you can while 'dad' drags the
load, trying to keep up with you. When you get to the car, take off
for home. Don't worry, he'll bring the gear to the next game or
Jason won't play at all.

BUSH VISITS TEXAS SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With virtually all of Gov. George W. Bush's
legislative agenda still pending while the clock rapidly winds
down, Bush on Thursday paid his first visit to the Texas Senate in
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since I've been in the chamber,'' Bush said.
``The reason I came by today is that we're heading toward the end
of the session and it's a chance to make my presence felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that critics have said he has spent too little time on
state matters and has been preoccupied with his likely presidential
run, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be people who figure out ways if something
doesn't go their way or something's not perfect, they all blame
presidential politics,'' he said. ``I said at my state-of-the-state
(address), let's not let the speculation get in the way of us
having a successful session, and I believe we're going to have a
successful session.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was merely coincidental his visit occurred the same
day Republican members were trying to rally sufficient support to
amend a controversial voucher program to a House bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware the voucher bill was coming up until the
lieutenant governor informed me,'' Bush said. ``I'm not here to
lobby for a piece of legislation. I'm here to make my presence
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the lieutenant governor and asked him if it would be
appropriate for me to come and say `hello' to some of the senators
on the floor,'' Bush added. ``We've got less than two weeks to go
to get the session over with, and I think it's good for me to be
saying hello to people. A lot of the senators have been coming to
my office; some of them haven't and I need to visit with them.``
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that talk of the voucher bill arose as
he greeted senators on the floor and that he encouraged them ``to
vote for my agenda and for Lt. Gov. Perry's agenda.``
</P>
<P>
   And he gave Perry, the first Republican to serve in that post
since Reconstruction, high marks for his first session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a very good job,'' Bush said. ``I think any
objective observer will give him good very good marks for running a
good session.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who accuse Bush of ignoring what's been happening
in the Capitol, the governor said they don't know what they're
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people must not be paying attention to what I'm doing,''
he said. ``I meet with people all the time from both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the state budget hammered out by a conference
committee has yet to be approved, and the school finance bill _
which contains components for his key property tax cut proposals _
did not make it out of &UR;  &LR; the House Education Committee until
Thursday afternoon. Bush's proposal to end social promotion also is
hung in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the session is going well,'' Bush added. ``I'm pleased
with much of the progress that's being made. ... I think the key is
going to be what happens at the end of the session as to determine
how effective we have all been in doing what's right for Texas.``

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFTER LIFE,' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda.
Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118
minutes). Much of this transcendently compassionate, gently
humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where
courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients. The place
turns out not to be a social service agency but a metaphysical way
station where the newcomers are people of all ages and types who
have just died and have three days to select one memory to take
with them into eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be
filmed. As they tell their stories and make their choices (those
who can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers),
the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value
and the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `COOKIE'S FORTUNE,' starring Charles Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert
Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and
guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic
return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and
completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a
wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel
niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest
friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and
appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman
makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,' starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with
English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EDGE OF 17,' starring Chris Stafford and Tina Holmes. Directed
by David Moreton (not rated, 100 minutes). It's 1984 in Sandusky,
Ohio, and Eric (Chris Stafford), a skinny, fresh-faced high school
student who worships the Eurythmics and Culture Club, has his first
homosexual experiences. This is not boy-meets-boy (Romeo meets
Romeo and they fall madly in love) but boy is used and confused and
tries to go straight by sleeping with his former girlfriend. The
teen-age coming-out story is realistic but warmhearted, the best
among the recent gay coming-out films (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ELECTION,' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically
funny director of `Citizen Ruth' comes this caustic satire of the
American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading
candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a
mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and
Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who
thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the
hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a
style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ENTRAPMENT,' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper
summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice
among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: As the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the
outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma
to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action
sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's
largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a
nice bonus: Nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LEILA,' starring Leila Hatami, Ali Mosaffa and Jamileh Sheikhi.
Directed by Dariush Mehrjui (not rated, 129 minutes). The
devastating drama of a happy marriage destroyed by a monstrous
mother-in-law is the latest cinematic gem from Iran. Think of it as
a contemporary Islamic `Now Voyager' skimmed of suds, in which the
tyrannical matriarch gets her way. On learning that Leila (Ms.
Hatami), the wife of her only son, Reza (Mosaffa), is infertile,
Leila's mother-in-law (Ms. Sheikhi) embarks on a campaign of
intimidation to convince her daughter-in-law to let Reza take a
second wife who might bear him a child. Although Reza claims not to
want a child, the mother-in-law shames Leila into being her
collaborator in the scheme. Minutely observed, beautifully acted,
relentless (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the
film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with
a big debt to `The X-Files' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: While the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,' starring Kevin Kline, Rupert
Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista Flockhart. Directed by
Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is potluck Shakespeare,
with a wildly uneven range of performances and no clear style
holding them together. Rather than wonder why the actors are
wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a setting used
much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's best to focus
on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances and not wonder
what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Kline makes a perfect Bottom,
Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role and Ms. Pfeiffer
makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The younger cast
members are largely used as window dressing for the Leo-Does-Romeo
set (Maslin).

   `THE MUMMY,' starring Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo
and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134 minutes).
More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent spoof (very
loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror classic), overloaded
with cheesy special effects, suggests an unwieldy hybrid of
`Raiders of the Lost Ark' and `Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'
via `Night of the Living Dead.' The intrepid adventurers who
disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that carries a fearful curse are
Fraser (playing a swashbuckling American in the Foreign Legion),
Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed English librarian) and John
Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's all played for laughs.
The only scary moments involve swarming scarabs who burrow under
the skin and do awful `Alien'-like things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner) and Judi Dench (best supporting actress).
Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily
literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only
gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as
Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into
razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his `Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of `Romeo and Juliet,'
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
`Jurassic Park.' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The `Star Wars' franchise was funnier and
scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,' starring Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright,
Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli (PG,
117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Maggie Smith) who give
`Tea With Mussolini' a patina of class obviously relish chewing the
scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted from a chapter of
Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of English expatriate
women living in Florence on the eve of World War II. Ms. Smith, a
quintessential British snob, is the leader of the pack, nicknamed
the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are shattered when the
Fascists rise to power and they find themselves carted off to
another city where they are held under house arrest. Cher is her
usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving wealthy American
heiress and art collector who befriends the group (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THIS IS MY FATHER,' starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and
James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with
obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (
Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears ( Quinn)
involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's
cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale
featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm
Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a
lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous
family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements
and keep it moving (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and
Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully
lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets
the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin).

<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `ALFRED HITCHCOCK.' Alfred Hitchcock's birthday doesn't arrive
until Aug. 13, but that isn't stopping anyone from celebrating the
centennial of the master of suspense (1899-1980). The tributes are
already in progress. At the Museum of Modern Art, `Alfred
Hitchcock,' with more than 50 features, shorts and documentaries,
as well as an exhibition of posters, photographs and papers, is
trumpeted as the most comprehensive Hitchcock film retrospective
ever mounted in the United States. At 2:30 p.m. Friday and 5:45
p.m. Saturday, the attraction is `Notorious' (1946), with a cast
including Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Claude Rains. Francois
Truffaut said, `In my opinion, `Notorious' is the very quintessence
of Hitchcock.' Continuing through June 15 at the museum, at 11 West
53rd St., Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission:
$9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students and the elderly; free for
those under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay-what-you-wish on
Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Information: (212) 708-9400
(Lawrence Van Gelder).

COMMENTARY: PENIS ENVY? NOT IN THIS CROWD. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, May 27)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture this: an auditorium of mostly women, students,
grandmothers, management types, teachers, plus a few men, listening
to six women in black dresses talk about the V-word. Reading about
vaginas from notebooks held in their laps, they are as poised as a
choral group. Elegant women with private smiles on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, all use the taboo word, the one seldom
spoken aloud in public, more commonly heard in coarse slang terms,
but which in other languages takes poetic names like ``golden
gate,'' ``doorway of life,'' ``lotus.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happening here is a performance of ``The Vagina
Monologues,'' the title of a little red book published a year ago
based on a wildly successful off-Broadway show by author-playwright
Eve Ensler.
</P>
<P>
   The title itself is fun to repeat, just because it's almost
guaranteed to startle. ``The What?''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there have been readings from the book by the likes
of Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder and Lily Tomlin. Now it's a road
show, performed by local women in different parts of the country,
to benefit women's organizations, this particular night in Santa
Rosa for Women Against Rape.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Susan, Lily and Winona would do amazing renditions but
there's greater delight in hearing your neighbors, who in this case
include the administrator of a child care center, an acupuncturist
and a midwife, be so articulate and uninhibited on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some might react, ``Is nothing sacred?'' for which the answer is
``Haven't you been reading the front page lately?'''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the vagina has always attracted more profane than
sacred attention. As a defining detail of female sexuality, it's
never gotten much respect.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have a lovely antidote to locker room jokes, a salve
against the ongoing brutality and disregard for women's bodies in
our own community and around the world and a reprieve from the
embarrassment, guilt and ambivalence women have over being sexual.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that women haven't been a party to keeping the subject
under wraps. Ensler has a piece on ``down there,'' a common
euphemism used by an earlier generation of women who wanted to get
as much distance from their own vaginas as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in recent years we've become more enlightened about
women's body parts. We boldly speak of PMS, menstruation and
menopause. TV commercials whisper of solutions for certain feminine
problems.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is not a clinical or hygienic discussion but
sexual politics in the most basic sense. And the mood is more
pajama party than bachelorette night. Do not confuse this laughter
with what accompanies tucking dollar bills into male strippers'
G-strings.
</P>
<P>
   We are laughing out loud about ourselves, about experiences we
all have but seldom voice. We are laughing with relief to finally
be talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend told me about the book I remember wondering how
much can a person write about a single body part, even one this
versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there are worlds to say.
</P>
<P>
   Ensler got 200 women to talk about their vaginas, an amazing
reporting feat in itself. They were old and young women, lesbian,
straight, from many cultures, brazen and shy, ones who flaunted
their sexuality and ones still fearful of it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stories are tough. You cannot talk about women's
bodies without acknowledging the offenses and crimes committed on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the audience is quiet, barely able to breathe, afraid
of what they know is coming next. Some women have to leave the room
and go sit in the lobby for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   But if they come back inside the mood switches again and they'll
be there to hear the moans. The good moans. Don't miss the part
about the good moans.
</P>
<P>
   This is sex ed for grown-ups, a tender, respectful primer on
women's sexuality. Pass it on.
</P>

 &HT;    FIRST LADY WILL MAKE SENATE RUN, MANY DEMOCRATS BELIEVE
 &HT;    Eds: This story, originally scheduled for Sunday release, is now
available for immediate use.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will she or won't she? Here and in New York, more
and more political pulse-takers are convinced that First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton does indeed plan to run for the Senate in
New York next year.
</P>
<P>
   If so, her race is likely to have far-flung consequences,
affecting the 2000 presidential contest and fund-raising by both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me that she wants to do this,'' said state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope. ``She has been trying it on for
size, and so far it's been a real good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to run, I really do,'' said state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, one of the numerous New York Democrats
with whom Mrs. Clinton has consulted about seeking the seat of
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs are she is going to do it,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York.
``She seems to be crossing the line a little bit more,'' he said,
amid acknowledgement by her office that she is weighing the
formation of an exploratory committee that could pay for her travel
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, reported
Thursday the first lady would take such a step within weeks of
returning from a Florida vacation later this month with President
Clinton and Chelsea, the couple's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation did not startle anyone in New York who has
followed Mrs. Clinton's activities since the trial balloon of a
possible campaign was floated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four weeks, Mrs. Clinton has visited New York four
times. And she will visit again Monday, attending an arts event, a
book signing for Matilda Cuomo, wife of former Gov. Mario Cuomo,
and a fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
the group that leads the effort to increase Democrats' numbers in
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be ``the first Hillary Clinton fund-raiser,''
predicts Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the
DSCC.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also reportedly plans to visit incoming Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in Israel next month, a trip interpreted as an
attempt to reassure the large and politically active Jewish vote in
New York. Though a strong supporter of Israel, Mrs. Clinton has
made controversial statements supporting an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves reinforce the widespread belief that ``she wants to
do this in the worst way,'' said Erie County Democratic Chairman
Steve Pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the double-digit lead Mrs. Clinton initially recorded
in hypothetical polling match-ups with Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New
York City has disappeared. The race, if held today, would be a
toss-up, according to Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to have hurt Mrs. Clinton most is the
``carpetbagger issue'' _ the fact that she is not from New York.
However, on this issue, she has at least one advantage over the
late Bobby Kennedy, who moved from Virginia to New York to get
elected to the Senate in 1966, according to Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't from anywhere. She's from TV, so she's not quite as
much a carpetbagger,'' he said. ``She's a celebrity. But the
difficulty will be moving from celebrity to candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the reasons to form an exploratory committee is
to avoid legal complications over traveling so frequently to New
York at taxpayer expense. Some watchdog groups have already hinted
at possible lawsuits challenging Mrs. Clinton's travels to New
York, and forming an exploratory committee would allow her to raise
money to help finance the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy would clearly energize the state
Democratic Party, especially women and minorities, said Celinda
Lake, a noted Democratic pollster. And there would be ``tremendous
synergy'' between the first lady's campaign and the presidential
campaign of Vice President Al Gore, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally likely to energize the entire Republican
Party, said Jack Pitney, a former Republican National Committee
official who now teaches political science at Claremont McKenna
College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary is the new Newt Gingrich _ a cash cow for both
parties,'' he said. ``Her side will give because they hate her
opponents, who in turn will step up their donations because they
hate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Running for the Senate will dredge up all the scandals of the
Clinton administration, something Gore wants to avoid, Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every corner of her life and record is potential ammunition
for the Republicans,'' he said. ``But what people forget is that
she is as tough and as nasty as any New York pol, and she will
answer every attack on her with an attack on her enemies.''

   MIAMI _ The explorers battled fat leeches and cliffsides so
steep and slippery, one false step could mean a plunge of thousands
of feet.
</P>
<P>
   They navigated a raging, treacherous river. They even heard
rumors of the Dugmas, a cult of females who attack outsiders with
snake venom concealed beneath their fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an Indiana Jones-style adventure, but it was
real.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition, sponsored by the National Geographic Society
last November, took four Americans into the inner gorge of the
Tsangpo River, the world's deepest canyon, in a remote part of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-day undertaking was a lesson in endurance, but the reward
was extraordinary: the sight of a thundering, 100-foot-high
cascade, dubbed ``Hidden Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's equally extraordinary is that a giant waterfall on a
major river had yet to be recorded. Indeed, on the eve of the 21st
century, there are lots of unexplored spots on the planet _ even in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we mapped every single inch of the globe? Certainly, we
have not,'' said Rebecca Martin, director of the National
Geographic Society's Expeditions Board. ``There are nooks and
crannies in the Grand Canyon no one has gotten to.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society's name is
synonymous with the exploration of exotic places. It publishes the
magazines National Geographic and National Geographic Traveler, and
recently launched National Geographic Adventure, designed to tell
readers ``where to get once-in-a-lifetime experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the world seems to have grown a lot smaller over the
last two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1806 that two American explorers, Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark, became the first people to traipse across
North America and reach the Pacific. In the early part of this
century, many large patches of jungle in Asia and Africa had not
been visited by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, explorers have reached the highest mountain (Everest,
29,029 feet), the deepest ocean (Mariana Trench in the Pacific,
35,839 feet), and the coldest ice field (Polyus Nedostupnosti,
Antarctica, minus 72 F annual mean).
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades it has seemed as though every far-off locale
has been charted, visited, or analyzed ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they've even been decimated. As more and more people
explore the Amazon, scientists estimate that up to 16 percent of
the original million-square-mile rain forest has been ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   These days, adventure travel is the rage. Growing numbers of
tourists trek through the Himalayas, while 10,000 tourists visited
Antarctica, the most isolated place on the planet, between November
and March. This year alone, National Geographic Expeditions will
escort travelers to sites as far-flung as the peaks of Nepal and
the Yangtze River in China.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this, hundreds, if not thousands, of peaks and
mountain passes are still waiting to be mapped.
</P>
<P>
   From Tibet to New Guinea, to central Greenland and remote
reaches of Nahanni National Park in Canada's Northwest Territories,
to the Arctic and Antarctica, there are a host of sites that have
been accessible only to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, explorers haven't completely roamed the Ndoki forest,
on the border of Congo and Cameroon. They haven't fully surveyed
New Guinea, the world's second-largest island after Greenland. And
they haven't scaled all the mountains in the Antarctic, half as big
as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Holy Grail of exploration is perhaps the ocean. The sea
covers 70 percent of the Earth's surface, and 80 percent of it _
packed with little-known plant and animal life _ remains
undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can draw a parallel between the ocean and outer space,
because there's so much we still don't know about them,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on land _ or beneath it _ underwater caves hold a wealth of
opportunities for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The world's longest underwater cave is Nohoch Nah Chich, located
in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. So far, only 32 miles have been
charted. Divers believe there's much more to be documented, but the
pitch-black labyrinth can be deadly for a diver who becomes lost
and confused.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a National Geographic team is creating a
three-dimensional computer map of tens of thousands of feet of
submerged caves at Wakulla Springs, about 15 miles south of
Tallahassee, Fla. The vast network of caverns and grottoes is
believed to be the third largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This digital mapping is wonderful, and it's going to help
people figure out how groundwater travels throughout Florida,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mountaintops symbolize the spirit of exploration. All 14 of the
world's mountains higher than 8,000 meters, or 26,250 feet, have
been scaled.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest was conquered in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and
his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay. The famous mountain has been
climbed so many times that today's challenge comes in trying to
break the endurance record. The current record was set this month
by a Nepali Sherpa, Babu Chiri Sherpa, 33, who spent 21 hours on
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   But mountaineers shouldn't be disheartened, because there are
still plenty of peaks waiting to be mastered.
</P>
<P>
   An abundance of unclimbed summits rise above 25,000 feet
throughout the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan, near the
borders with Afghanistan and China. Other unclimbed peaks are
Ganghar Puensum in northern Tibet and Lhotse Middle in the Lhotse
massif near Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The higher the mountain, the more discoveries explorers seem to
reap.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, National Geographic announced the discovery of
three children found sacrificed atop Argentina's Mount
Llullaillaco, the world's highest archaeological site at 22,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Located under about five feet of rock and earth, the perfectly
preserved bodies apparently had been frozen for more than 500
years, leaving them to appear as though they had just been buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear the best preserved of any mummy I've seen,'' said
archaeologist Johan Reinhard, co-leader of the team that discovered
them. ``Their arms looked perfect, even down to visible hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most uncharted places is the island of New
Guinea, north of Australia. The eastern part of the island is
occupied by the nation of Papua New Guinea, while the western part
is Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia where up to 800 languages
are spoken by primitive tribes living on jungle-choked terrain.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher who has roamed Papua New Guinea is Bill Thomas,
an anthropologist who grew up in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   When he's there, he lives among the Hewa, eating mostly bananas
and sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am over there, sometimes I forget what a privilege it
is to be in a place like that,'' said Thomas, 44, who's been
studying the effect of human activities on conservation. ``But when
I'm dead and gone, I'll have done something you only dream about
when you're a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While enthusiasm for exploration certainly hasn't diminished
through the years, what has changed is the nature of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the main goal was to find remote places that had
never before been walked on by a human foot. The emphasis now is on
being the first to examine and document sites, even those that have
been visited before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of explorers who've been in the most incredibly dense
rain forests in South America and hostile desert in Asia where they
couldn't imagine any human had ever walked before, but how can we
be sure?'' Martin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important now is that people go out and record what
they see, and to share that with others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After National Geographic announced November's discovery of
Hidden Falls, explorers from Arizona claimed that they had already
visited the lush, subtropical oasis reminiscent of the paradise
depicted in the 1937 Frank Capra movie classic, ``Lost Horizon,''
which made Shangri-la a household word.
</P>
<P>
   China didn't open the area to Westerners until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic officials have never denied that other
explorers had been in the gorge, but insist their expedition was
meant to conclusively document the legendary waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Barbara Moffet said dueling discoveries are nothing
new, pointing out that Christopher Columbus didn't really discover
America, although he's often credited for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one spot no one will ever fight over is Mount Kailas in
southwestern Tibet, a 4-mile-high pyramid of ice and rock.
</P>
<P>
   The peak is regarded as the home of Shiva, god of destruction
and rebirth, and is the most sacred summit on Earth for both Hindus
and Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   For now, climbing the mountain is forbidden.

LAWMAKERS LAMENT RADIOACTIVE DETOUR THROUGH CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Sunday, May. 23)   (EDs: ADDS tagline at end of story.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the protests of California's two senators,
trucks bearing tons of low-level radioactive waste from around the
country may start rumbling through the Golden State's desert near
Death Valley next month on a circuitous path to a dump site in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Energy Department plan, truckers hauling waste
generated in the East and Midwest can select from four routes to a
government repository for spent radioactive material called the
Nevada Test Site, about 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Two routes
approach the facility from the east, while the other two detour
through eastern California.
</P>
<P>
   While the government says that thousands of shipments of such
waste using specially lined containers have been transferred from
facility to facility without incident since 1961, environmental
groups are questioning the safety of nuclear waste in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both California
Democrats, have raised the issue by noting that the detours involve
roads that are not as good as the interstate highways that the
waste trucks usually take.
</P>
<P>
   The waste that could cross into California includes contaminated
debris, soil, sludge, concrete, wood and lab equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Energy Department asked 15 government
and private plants around the country that generate the waste _
mainly the byproduct of nuclear weapons manufacturing _ to avoid
current truck-shipping routes through Las Vegas and over the Hoover
Dam, where massive road construction is under way and delays are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on May 12,
Feinstein and Boxer wrote, ``As 90 percent of these shipments are
from defense facilities to the east, we do not understand the
rationale for diverting shipments into California, only then to
reverse direction and proceed east to the Nevada Test Site.''
</P>
<P>
   The two paths through California would put truckers on rural
roadways that are not as well maintained and as safe as the
interstates.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the waste shipments ``have traveled on more direct
routes for many years,'' the senators insisted that ``the current
interstate highway routes are most appropriate'' for them. They
added, ``There is no supportable reason for moving these
transportation routes into California, or for using roads of lesser
quality for these shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   They particularly objected to the proposed use of State Route
127, which they said ``is a primary access route for tourist
traffic to Death Valley National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hasn't responded to the lawmakers but in a statement
to the Hearst Newspapers said, ``We will continue to work with the
senators, the state of California and the counties of Inyo and San
Bernardino on this issue.'' The counties contain the proposed
alternate routes.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for a route change to bypass Las Vegas grew after a
1997 incident in which a truck hauling some radioactive waste from
an Ohio nuclear weapons plant leaked some of its liquid cargo in
Kingman, Ariz., 110 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid itself was not radioactive, but the incident sparked
a safety review and a 16-month moratorium of shipments to Nevada
from the facility, the Fernald Enviornmental Management Project
outside Cincinatti.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for shipping waste rests with the 15 individual
weapons plants, four of which are in California, which select
private companies for the task. The routes taken to the Nevada Test
Site are determined by the shipping companies. They take into
consideration the Energy Department's suggested routes but are not
required to travel them.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Morgan, an Energy Department spokesman in Las Vegas, said
that so far no low-level radioactive waste generated outside
California has crossed the state en route to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also considering possible train shipments to
Nevada and is conducting a environmental assessment of the idea,
said Michael Giblin, an Energy Department environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Fernald already has begun rail shipments of radioactive dirt to
a Utah landfill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Environmental groups are concerned that an accident involving
nuclear waste in transit could have terrible consequences. Large
swaths of land could be contaminated, said Diane D'Arrigo,
radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service.
</P>
<P>
   A rail accident could be even more dangerous, said the Safe
Energy Communication Council in Washington, D.C. ``With
approximately 3.7 accidents per million train miles each year, an
accident involving a train carrying nuclear waste is more than just
a statistical probability,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan noted the good safety record of transporting such
waste and said the material from the 15 plants has such a low level
of radioactivity that workers aren't required to wear special
clothing when handling it.
</P>
<P>
   Local fire departments and state police already are versed in
how to handle such a clean up, Morgan added. ``In almost all cases,
it's a simple as coming in with shovels and front end loaders and
putting it back in boxes,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Energy Department's plan for alternative routes around
Las Vegas, trucks zig-zagging over one would travel on 53 miles of
California roads. Vehicles approaching Las Vegas from the south in
Nevada would turn west into California on Interstate 40 for 20
miles then head north on U.S. 95 just past Needles for another 20
miles. They would cross back into Nevada for 20 miles, then turn
west on Route 164 only to return to California and connect to
Interstate 15 heading north for 13 miles and cross back again into
Nevada for another 100 miles to the test site.
</P>
<P>
   In another circuitous path, trucks would travel on the same 53
miles of California roads. But at Interstate 15, near Nipton,
Calif., they would head 40 miles southwest toward the interior of
the state before turning north for 80 miles on Route 127 in a
region known as the Devil's Playground until they reach the Nevada
border. The Nevada Test Site is 35 miles from that point.

 &HT;    FIRST LADY WILL MAKE SENATE RUN, MANY DEMOCRATS BELIEVE
 &HT;    Eds: This story, originally scheduled for Sunday release, is now
available for immediate use.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will she or won't she? Here and in New York, more
and more political pulse-takers are convinced that First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton does indeed plan to run for the Senate in
New York next year.
</P>
<P>
   If so, her race is likely to have far-flung consequences,
affecting the 2000 presidential contest and fund-raising by both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me that she wants to do this,'' said state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope. ``She has been trying it on for
size, and so far it's been a real good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to run, I really do,'' said state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, one of the numerous New York Democrats
with whom Mrs. Clinton has consulted about seeking the seat of
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs are she is going to do it,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York.
``She seems to be crossing the line a little bit more,'' he said,
amid acknowledgement by her office that she is weighing the
formation of an exploratory committee that could pay for her travel
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, reported
Thursday the first lady would take such a step within weeks of
returning from a Florida vacation later this month with President
Clinton and Chelsea, the couple's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation did not startle anyone in New York who has
followed Mrs. Clinton's activities since the trial balloon of a
possible campaign was floated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four weeks, Mrs. Clinton has visited New York four
times. And she will visit again Monday, attending an arts event, a
book signing for Matilda Cuomo, wife of former Gov. Mario Cuomo,
and a fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
the group that leads the effort to increase Democrats' numbers in
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be ``the first Hillary Clinton fund-raiser,''
predicts Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the
DSCC.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also reportedly plans to visit incoming Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in Israel next month, a trip interpreted as an
attempt to reassure the large and politically active Jewish vote in
New York. Though a strong supporter of Israel, Mrs. Clinton has
made controversial statements supporting an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves reinforce the widespread belief that ``she wants to
do this in the worst way,'' said Erie County Democratic Chairman
Steve Pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the double-digit lead Mrs. Clinton initially recorded
in hypothetical polling match-ups with Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New
York City has disappeared. The race, if held today, would be a
toss-up, according to Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to have hurt Mrs. Clinton most is the
``carpetbagger issue'' _ the fact that she is not from New York.
However, on this issue, she has at least one advantage over the
late Bobby Kennedy, who moved from Virginia to New York to get
elected to the Senate in 1966, according to Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't from anywhere. She's from TV, so she's not quite as
much a carpetbagger,'' he said. ``She's a celebrity. But the
difficulty will be moving from celebrity to candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the reasons to form an exploratory committee is
to avoid legal complications over traveling so frequently to New
York at taxpayer expense. Some watchdog groups have already hinted
at possible lawsuits challenging Mrs. Clinton's travels to New
York, and forming an exploratory committee would allow her to raise
money to help finance the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy would clearly energize the state
Democratic Party, especially women and minorities, said Celinda
Lake, a noted Democratic pollster. And there would be ``tremendous
synergy'' between the first lady's campaign and the presidential
campaign of Vice President Al Gore, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally likely to energize the entire Republican
Party, said Jack Pitney, a former Republican National Committee
official who now teaches political science at Claremont McKenna
College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary is the new Newt Gingrich _ a cash cow for both
parties,'' he said. ``Her side will give because they hate her
opponents, who in turn will step up their donations because they
hate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Running for the Senate will dredge up all the scandals of the
Clinton administration, something Gore wants to avoid, Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every corner of her life and record is potential ammunition
for the Republicans,'' he said. ``But what people forget is that
she is as tough and as nasty as any New York pol, and she will
answer every attack on her with an attack on her enemies.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Richard Curtis, the British screenwriter for ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' has had a persistent fantasy for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive across the bridge to Battersea to have dinner
with my friends and I would always think, `What would happen if I
turned up with the most famous woman in the world _ say Princess Di
or Madonna or someone like that?''' said Curtis , who is 42. ``One
of my friends would have screamed and enjoyed every moment of it;
one would pretend not to be affected, and the third would have no
idea who these women were.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``It was, of course, sort of a fairy tale
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this fantasy, Curtis wrote ``Notting Hill,'' a romantic
comedy in which Julia Roberts stars as a movie star (not much of a
stretch) who meets a bookshop owner, played by Hugh Grant, in the
Notting Hill section of London. Despite their differences in style,
money and status, the two have a romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fame thing isn't real, you know,'' says the Roberts
character, named Anna Scott, in the movie. ``Don't forget, I'm also
just a girl. Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her.''
</P>
<P>
   A reverse Cinderella story, the film, directed by Roger Michell
(``Persuasion''), is scheduled to open on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Although not a sequel to the highly successful ``Four Weddings
and a Funeral,'' the new film has a similar pedigree. It
reassembles a team with Grant, who starred in ``Four Weddings,''
Curtis, and Duncan Kenworthy, who produced the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said he had been working on the script off and on for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very slow writer,'' he said. ``It was interrupted by,
among other things, the birth of two children as well as this other
job I have working for charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is co-founder and vice chairman of British Comic Relief,
for which he works four months a year. The organization raises
money through comedy performances to help the poor and disabled in
Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said Grant was the actor everyone wanted for the role of
the charming bookshop owner. ``It was Hugh or someone no one had
ever heard of. We couldn't think of anyone else for the part,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts was also the first choice for her role, but the
producers were not sure she would accept. The actress read the
script and promptly agreed, asking only for a few changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted it a bit funnier,'' Curtis said. ``Julia said we
should lighten her character up. She wanted to crack a few jokes
about herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dazzling to work with a female movie star of that kind
because her relationship with the camera is simply extraordinary,''
Curtis added.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Notting Hill, in which most of the film takes place,
because he lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic, strange and mischievous area,'' he said.
``There's an extraordinary mix of cultures, rich and poor; it's a
melting pot of Portuguese and Jamaicans and English; there are very
expensive flats with private gardens and quite scuzzy flats, all
within a thousand yards from each other. It seemed like a realistic
place where two people from two worlds could coexist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``I live there so I didn't have to wake
up early every morning when we were making the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Flight Again
</P>
<P>
   After his directing debut in ``Con Air,'' a successful but
critically drubbed action film, Simon West yearned to prove to
Hollywood, and perhaps to himself, that he was not merely a
filmmaker specializing in guns and explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read endless scripts,'' West said. ``I wanted something
dramatic and I wanted to find something that was rather more
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Along came Paramount and Mace Neufeld, a producer of such films
as ``The Hunt for Red October'' and ``Patriot Games.'' They sent
West the screenplay of the Nelson DeMille best seller ``The
General's Daughter,'' and he was immediately interested.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of the murder of a general's daughter,
herself an Army officer, against a backdrop of long-hidden secrets
that a tenacious Army investigator seeks to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the screenplay and then read the book,'' West said. ``I
knew there was more in the book. I went back and found a lot of
things that should go into the screenplay. The book itself is very
visual and was almost like a screenplay; it had all the elements of
a Hollywood movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic but dark story involving betrayal and honor and
conspiracy,'' he said, adding: ``It has sexual tension. It has a
decidedly Shakespearean feel to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is scheduled to open on June 18, stars John
Travolta as the Army investigator, who joins another officer,
played by Madeleine Stowe, to look into the murder. The film's cast
includes Leslie Stefanson, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton, James
Woods and Clarence Williams 3rd.
</P>
<P>
   As a Briton, West said he knew little about the U.S. military,
but he soon found that he could understand the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the Army is a feudal system and, being English, I
could relate to that,'' he said. ``In so many ways the military,
and not just the American military, is similar to the class system.
Everyone knows exactly what position they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   West began his career in 1981 as an apprentice film editor at
the BBC in London and worked on a number of award-winning
documentaries during his four years at the network. By the late
1980s he had emerged as a successful creator of television
commercials, which led, finally, to the job on ``Con Air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, my directing career took off after that,'' West said.
``There's nothing quite like having a hit. It saved me years of
struggling in this business.''

</P>
<P>
   Although Harvey Keitel has appeared in more than 50 films since
his 1968 acting debut in Martin Scorsese's ``Who's That Knocking at
My Door?,'' he says that few have stirred him the way Tony Bui's
``Three Seasons'' did.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has received generally positive reviews in
recent weeks and has played modestly around the nation, is the
first American movie shot in Vietnam since the war. It deals with
the lives of several disparate people in Ho Chi Minh City, the
beautiful old Saigon, now in the grip of change. Keitel plays a
former soldier who returns to Vietnam to the daughter he fathered
and left behind during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the script and it took me someplace I had never been
before,'' Keitel said. ``I had a similar reaction when I read
`Reservoir Dogs.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the script had a personal resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the struggle of a human being seeking self-esteem;
it's about reconciliation between daughters and fathers. I identify
with that,'' he said. Keitel has a 13-year-old daughter with his
former wife, actress Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel, whose credits include ``Mean Streets,'' ``Taxi Driver,''
``Bugsy'' and ``Pulp Fiction,'' has usually played tough guys in
films. He credits Jane Campion, director of ``The Piano,'' for
helping alter his screen persona in that film, in which he played
Holly Hunter's lover.
</P>
<P>
   In Keitel's newest film, ``Holy Smoke,'' also directed by Ms.
Campion, the actor plays a counselor involved in helping people who
want to leave religious cults. He described the film, which opens
later in the year, as a black comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel speaks with a religious ardor about acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being typecast is a struggle, yes, but the struggle is
welcome,'' he said. ``Actors should welcome the struggle. That's
part of the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lucky guy and I have no regrets about anything,''
he continued. ``It's all part of the path. It would be dumb of me
to say all the good things were wonderful and the bad things were
just a waste of time. It's not true. Each one informs the other.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Keitel is fortunate because he is a gifted
character actor who never seems to stop working. Although he lives
in New York, he is often abroad. Now he is filming ``U-571,'' a
submarine drama directed by Jonathan Mostow. The film is being made
in Italy and Malta.
</P>
<P>
   He also will be in ``My West,'' in which he plays a retired
gunfighter. The movie, made by Giovanni Veronese, was also shot in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel, a Brooklyn-born former marine, laughed when asked about
being typecast as a tough guy. No matter how hard he tries, he
said, the tough guy scripts keep coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say one more word about me being a tough guy,'' he
said, ``I'll beat you up.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS PASSES KOSOVO SPENDING BILL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress completed action Thursday on a nearly $15
billion emergency spending bill that includes money to pay for the
Balkan war, provides relief to last year's hurricane victims and
protects states' tobacco settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Senate voted 64-36 in favor of the measure,
President Clinton indicated he would reluctantly sign it. The House
approved the bill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chided lawmakers for adding measures that were not
considered emergencies and was sharply critical of the provision
protecting the states' tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were it not for the pressing needs in Kosovo, Central America,
the Middle East and America's heartland, I would have rejected
several of these measures that reward special interests, weaken
environmental protection, and undermine our campaign to stop teen
smoking,'' Clinton said. ``This is no way to do the people's
business, and I will not tolerate this kind of special-interest
meddling as we complete the annual budget process.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill included roughly $12 billion to pay for the war effort
against Yugoslavia -- including higher pay for the military and
$1.1 billion in humanitarian assistance to the Kosovar refugees --
plus $2.9 billion to assist Central American victims of Hurricanes
Mitch and George and the recent Midwest tornado victims.
</P>
<P>
   The bill cut about $2 billion in already appropriated spending
for food stamps, housing subsidies and community development block
grants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's passage ends a dispute between the administration and
the states over how tobacco settlement money will be divided. The
administration had indicated the federal government should receive
roughly 55 percent of the $250 billion the states will get from
cigarette manufacturers over the next 25 years. The administration
also sought to place restrictions on how states could spend their
tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``extremely disappointed,'' that Congress
prevented the federal government from sharing in the tobacco
settlements and did not ``require states to use even a portion of
those funds to prevent youth smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham, one of the co-sponsors of the provision, said ``I'm
pleased that we have struck a blow for federalism and the right of
states ... to make decisions for their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, sponsor of the
provision, said it was crucial to allowing states to ``spend the
money that they so rightly earned from the tobacco companies to
benefit the citizens of their state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a fight to the finish,'' Hutchison said. ``There were
a lot of people who either wanted to mandate expenditures,'' or
require states to have their spending plans approved by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said the provision ``recognizes
that this money was not (federal) money. It was state money that
the states aggressively pursued...We're saying (to the states):
'It's your money and you do what you want with it.' ``

BARCLAYS PLC TO CUT NEARLY 10 PERCENT OF ITS BRITISH STAFF IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Struggling against bloated costs and increased
competition, Britain's second-largest bank, Barclays PLC announced
Thursday that it would cut almost 10 percent of its 65,000-member
British work force this year.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction, aimed at saving an annual $320 million, was one
of the biggest reductions of jobs in British banking.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after months of uncertainty and seesawing stock prices,
Thursday's announcement lifted the price of Barclays shares nearly
4 percent, to 18.87 pounds, or $30.33, carrying other banking
stocks with them.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Barclays said it would record an accounting
charge of $646 million this year to reflect the cost of reducing
its staff, mainly in retail financial services, which employ 55,000
people, and in corporate banking, with about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, which will be made through attrition, voluntary
retirements and layoffs, follow staff reductions at the bank's
Barclaycard credit card division and at Barclays Capital, the
investment arm that had heavy losses in the Russian debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While the job reductions announced Thursday were limited to
Barclays in Britain, executives did not rule out further cuts in
the bank's widespread overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement is very sad, but on a business level this is
absolutely essential,'' said Sir Peter Middleton, the Barclays
chairman and acting chief executive. ``This is to produce a simpler
structure for people to bank with us and reduce costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Middleton has been running the bank since the last full-time
chief executive, Martin Taylor, quit last November in a board-room
row over the losses at Barclays Capital. His American replacement,
former Bank of America executive Michael O'Neill, resigned because
of a heart problem on the day he was supposed to start work in
London in mid-April. His replacement has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the bank's emerging-markets losses and rising
costs, O'Neill's withdrawal from the top job contributed to a sense
among some market analysts that the bank was drifting and ripe for
a takeover. Others, however, say that Barclays and its management
remain essentially sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without a CEO, this is still a major bank with a major
market share and it's going to remain a major player,'' said Alan
Reid, a credit-rating analyst with Moody's Investors Service.
``There's more to an organization than a single person, and that's
very much illustrated by what the bank announced today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Barclays has acknowledged that its costs were
spiraling and promised to contain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of costs, this has been a bit of an Achilles' heel
year after year,'' said Nick Collier, an analyst with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``This announcement provides more tangible
evidence that they are a little bit more determined on costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Trippett, an analyst at Schroders Investment, said the
savings would bring Barclays closer into line with the most
cost-efficient British banks. But, he said, the balance-sheet
benefits would not show until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Barclays' problems stem from its slow response to a
revolution in British retail banking over a decade that has seen
150,000 jobs disappear as some 4,000 bank and savings and loan
branches closed.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of traditional mortgage companies into
full-fledged banks, and a rush into the retail financial services
market by supermarkets and other nonbanking concerns, has magnified
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, technological advances _ first in automated
teller machines, then in telephone, computer and Internet banking _
have forced banks to devise ways to reduce costs without losing
customers.

UPN ADDS WRESTLING TO FALL LINEUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The madcap mayhem of pro wrestling has invaded broadcast
television. UPN announced Thursday that it would give its two hours
of Thursday night prime-time to ``WWF Smackdown,'' a production of
the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling shows already dominate cable television, routinely
taking six or seven of the top 10 places on the Nielsen list of
most-watched cable shows each week. The federation has shows on USA
on Sunday and Monday nights. Two Turner networks, TBS and TNT,
feature shows of a rival group, World Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it the way another network looks at football or
basketball,'' said Dean Valentine, UPN's president. ``If you want
to reach an audience of young guys, this is what they're
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   He described it as ``comedic soap opera for men,'' adding that
Vince McMahon, federation chief executive, had agreed to tone down
the violence and vulgarity ``somewhat'' for UPN.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is also bringing back the comic actor Jaleel White (``Family
Matters'') in ``The Grown-Ups,'' a new sitcom about young adults
that the network says is different from those of other networks
because its cast is interracial.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be broadcast on Monday nights, after the network's
popular family comedy ``Moesha,'' starring Brandy, and a spinoff,
``Mo'Nique,'' featuring Moesha's best friend, Kim, played by
Sountess Vaughan, and her mother, played by the stand-up comedian
Mo'Nique.
</P>
<P>
   The animated ``Dilbert'' will move to Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; the
rest of Tuesday and Wednesday are intended to attract young male
viewers. Tuesday's ``Shasta McNasty,'' about three hip-hop singers
living the cool life in Venice Beach, Calif., and ``Secret Agent
Man,'' an updated spy series, also both have interracial casts. On
Wednesdays, ``Seven Days'' and ``Star Trek: Voyager'' return.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the UPN schedule:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: 8 p.m., ``Moesha''; 8:30, ``Mo'Nique''; 9, ``The
Grown-Ups''; 9:30, ``Malcolm and Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Dilbert''; 8:30, ``Shasta McNasty''; 9,
``Secret Agent Man.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Seven Days''; 9, ``Star Trek: Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: 8 p.m., ``WWF Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: 8 p.m., ``Blockbuster Video's Shockwave Cinema.''

OVITZ INVESTS IN INTERNET ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Ovitz, the talent manager once known as
the most powerful man in Hollywood, is trying to extend his reach
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz is an investor in and co-founder of Checkout.com, a
company that will offer information about entertainment and also
sell compact disks, videos and games through a Web site of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   The other major investor, it was announced Thursday, is Yucaipa
Cos., the group run by Ronald Burkle, the billionaire supermarket
magnate. Last year, Burkle orchestrated the sale of Fred Meyer
Inc., which he controlled, to Kroger Co., thereby becoming the
largest shareholder of the nation's largest supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   The Checkout Web site is being developed by Richard Wolpert, the
head of Yucaipa's Internet ventures and also a partner in the new
company. He was formerly the president of Disney Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet is the greatest thing that ever happened
to the entertainment industry, to the artistic community,'' Ovitz
said, explaining that artists can now present their material
directly to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Checkout's site, which is expected to be in operation this
summer, will not immediately offer consumers the ability to
download music, games or video, though that will come, Ovitz and
Wolpert said.
</P>
<P>
   They described their site as a Web portal for entertainment.
Type in a request, say, for the actor Jim Carrey, and a Web page
about Carrey will be instantly created with information about him,
offers for videos of his movies and links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Wolpert said they would start many other Internet
ventures. They declined to discuss how much each partner had
invested.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency, is trying
to resurrect his career after being ousted from the No. 2 position

   Since then he has made an ill-founded investment in Livent Inc.,
the troubled Broadway production company, and has tried to bring a
National Football League team back to Los Angeles. He also started
a new talent management company, Artists Management Group, which

MAZDA PREDICTS RECORD PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Mazda Motor Corp., the Japanese carmaker controlled by
Ford Motor Co., reported its first annual profit in six years
Thursday and its best results in 14 years, the clearest sign that
Ford's efforts to turn the company around are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company predicted it would set record profits
and increase sales in the fiscal year that ends next March, a
period during which other Japanese car companies are expecting
their profits to slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that Mazda is on the right track for a complete
turnaround,'' said James Miller, Mazda's president. ``Various
initiatives and approaches we have been implementing over the past
several years are clearly showing unequivocal results.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Ford, which owns a 33.4 percent stake in
the company, Mazda has moved to sharply cut costs, focus its brand
image and reduce debts. ``There's absolutely no question that the
last four years has been a steady improvement of the overall
structure and business at Mazda,'' said Steve Usher, an automotive
analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ``Quite simply,
they have done a tremendous job of turning the company around.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been impressed but say Mazda must now prove that
it can sell more cars and fix the financial and operational
problems of its heavily indebted dealers and parts manufacturers,
whose performance will be more fully reflected at the end of this
fiscal year under new Japanese accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Japan's fifth-largest automaker, said it earned
38.7 billion yen, or about $321 million at the exchange rate that
prevailed on March 31, the end of its fiscal year, compared with a
loss of 6.8 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose less than 1
percent, to 2.06 trillion yen, or $17.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in the company's earnings reflected lower costs,
increased market share in Japan and better profitability in North
America and Europe. The company said favorable currency movements
were ``more than offset'' by slower sales in Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's debt fell by $56.4 million, to slightly more than $6
billion. Usher said the company's targets for this fiscal year _ to
increase earnings to 40 billion yen and sales to 2.6 trillion yen _
were reasonable, although its plans to raise sales in Europe by 13
percent might be a bit aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ford, Mazda has been restructuring since the mid-1990s
after stumbling badly because of aggressive expansion during
Japan's speculative bubble economy years when demand for vehicles
was strong. Ford sent a four-member management team to Tokyo in
1994 and increased its stake in the company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprisingly strong results released Thursday, Mazda
shares slipped 1 percent in Tokyo to 560 yen, but dealers said the
decline reflected profit taking from a recent run-up in the price.

FORD'S CFO RETIRES AT 55 TO FIND ANOTHER COMPANY TO RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story was previously skedded as FORD-APPOINT) 
(DW) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Eager to be a chief executive someday, John
Devine, Ford Motor Co.'s chief financial officer and executive vice
president, announced Thursday that he would retire at the end of
September and intended to pursue ``wider responsibilities''
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, who was passed over last year to become Ford's president
and chief executive, said that turning 55 last week had made him
realize that he had to move to another company soon, if at all.
``It certainly caused me to think over the last several months
about where I am and what I want to be,'' he said in a telephone
conference call with reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think I could be a CEO. I think I could do that
job very well. It doesn't have to be a large company.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine is the latest in a long series of departures of the
allies of Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, chief executive and
president until the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   William Ford Jr., 42, a great-grandson of Henry Ford, became
chairman at the start of this year while Jacques Nasser, 51, became
the president and chief executive. But while many Trotman loyalists
were pushed out late last year, Devine is leaving voluntarily, Ford
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because virtually all of Devine's experience was on the
financial side, rather than in Ford's core automotive business, he
was always a long-shot candidate for the top job. From 1988 until
1994, for example, he ran First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco, a
Ford subsidiary then, serving first as president and later as
chairman and chief executive. He was widely credited with restoring
the troubled bank to financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement prompted immediate discussion in the
auto industry that Devine might move to California, where he is
building a house south of Los Angeles. Devine said that he had not
talked with other companies and did not want another job as chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford announced that Devine's broad responsibilities would be
divided up between the company's two vice chairmen. W. Wayne
Booker, 64, Nasser's mentor for many years, will replace Devine as
chief financial officer. He recently handed control of Ford's Asian
operations to Henry Wallace, a group vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pestillo, 61, Ford's chief of staff, will replace Devine
in overseeing Ford's auto parts operations, real estate division
and its 80.9 percent stake in Hertz Corp., the nation's biggest
rental car company. He will continue to run Ford's departments for
labor relations, legal issues, government affairs and public
relations.

   CHOEUNG EK, Cambodia _ With a pyramid of bleached skulls seeming
to stare directly at them Thursday morning, a choir of young women
sang a horrifying dirge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hit with spades, they were bound and thrown into
wells, without pity,'' the women sang. ``Small babies were dragged
from their mothers' arms and stabbed, spitted together on sticks,
smashed against trees, without pity. Young women were raped as if
in a game, without pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``O Cambodia, do you remember? Do you remember your bitter
history?''
</P>
<P>
   A thousand mourners listened in grief and silence. ``I think my
head is going to burst,'' a man said.
</P>
<P>
   No one here forgets. This is a country drowning in its bitter
history.
</P>
<P>
   But the manner of remembering has become a subject of dispute
almost as debilitating as the history itself. Punish the Khmer
Rouge leaders _ the authors of Cambodia's tragedy _ or leave them
to age and fade quietly like the bones of their victims? It is not
morality or healing that governs the debate, but political
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in the midst of this dispiriting wrangle, Cambodia's
leaders have revived for their own reasons one of their country's
most painful rituals, the Day of Hate.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years after the Khmer Rouge were ousted in 1979 by
a Vietnamese invasion, this was a day for anger and remembrance
when in villages and schoolrooms around the country people told
their stories and wept. Then in 1991, as the nation tried to move
toward a democratic future, the rite was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ceremony was held on the grounds of Cambodia's most
famous killing field, where 20,000 people died, a lovely swath of
glowing green rice fields dotted with spiky sugar palms and
bone-thin white cows.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist monks in their brown and orange robes sat under a
tamarind tree on lavender plastic chairs as hundreds of cicadas
buzzed wildly in the branches above them. Small, dirty children
wandered past, chewing sticks of sugar cane and holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   Coups, killings and do-or-die politics have transformed Cambodia
since 1991, and the convocation Thursday was very much a ceremony
for its time, a convulsion of memory mixed with the pragmatic
agendas of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember forever the criminal acts of the genocidal Pol Pot
regime,'' a black banner said, referring to the late leader of the
Khmer Rouge, the brutal communist movement responsible for more
than a million deaths from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a pale blue banner proclaimed, ``Long live the Cambodian
People's Party,'' the ruling party of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who
after years of trying has finally bludgeoned his way to absolute
dominance of this exhausted country.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the ceremony from under a large red-and-blue Angkor Beer
umbrella was the deputy governor of Phnom Penh, Chea Sophea. He
brought the day's language firmly down to earth with a few words
addressed directly to the people who were killed here, nine miles
south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today,'' he said, ``to inform all of you who died
that owing to the win-win policy of Prime Minister Hun Sen all
Khmer people have reconciled and united. The Khmer people are now
at peace, and the Kingdom of Cambodia has become a full member of
ASEAN,'' the Southeast Asian regional association.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as mourners knelt on the damp grass, the monks clustered
around the pyramid of skulls to chant a Buddhist prayer for the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement only two days ago that the ceremony was to be
revived took most people by surprise and seemed to run counter to
Hun Sen's apparent policy of ``national reconciliation'' and de
facto amnesties for the Khmer Rouge killers.
</P>
<P>
   Though two top Khmer Rouge officials, Ta Mok and Duch, have been
imprisoned this year and are awaiting trial, several of their
senior comrades have been allowed to ``defect'' and live as free
men.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat suggested that the ceremony might be a
gesture aimed at placating the United Nations and some Western
countries, whose call for the arrest and international trial of
Khmer Rouge leaders Hun Sen has been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in
1977, might be trying to say, ``Look, we really do hate the Khmer
Rouge.'' As if in confirmation, most newspapers Thursday obediently
replaced their usual front-page photographs of gruesome crimes with
photographs of piles of skulls.
</P>
<P>
   But what Hun Sen has actually said is: ``We should dig a hole
and bury the past.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is his real intent, the Choeung Ek killing field offers
its own reply: the past does not always stay buried.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9,000 skulls have been excavated and put on display in a
glass-walled shrine here, but at least as many still lie buried in
shallow graves in the surrounding fields. Bits of bone still poke
up from the earth along with scraps of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   And in the monsoon season, people here say, the flood-soaked
earth sometimes shifts and regurgitates some of the buried bones
and skulls.

 &HT;    AirTran announces new route, recovery during shareholders
meeting
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran plans to start Atlanta-Newark, N.J., flights
July 1, giving the airline service to the two biggest New York City
area airports.
</P>
<P>
   The discount carrier, which already serves La Guardia Airport
from Atlanta, plans an additional five daily roundtrips to Newark
International, Chief Executive Joe Leonard said Thursday after a
quiet annual shareholders meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has long sought to fly to Newark but lacked gates at the
congested airport. Leonard said the carrier recently negotiated the
use of gates controlled by Northwest Airlines _ with help from
public officials who want to encourage low-fare competition.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran will join Delta and Continental on the route and
essentially replace Kiwi, which withdrew last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a discounter in that market to keep fares down,''
business travel expert Chris McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard disclosed the new route after the shareholders meeting,
attended by about 75 people. He spent the meeting touting Orlando,
Fla.-based AirTran's recent signs of financial recovery after two
years of mostly red ink, dating to when it was ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also noted a new ``buy'' recommendation on AirTran stock
by veteran analyst Julius Maldutis of CIBC Oppenheimer. AirTran
shares closed Thursday at $5, up 18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, one shareholder noted that the carrier has
about $230 million in debt coming due in early 2001 that will have
to be refinanced. He wondered whether the carrier will really have
the cash flow to finance new Boeing 717 jets as it plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we will,'' Leonard answered, adding the planes' up-front
cost will be offset by lower operating expenses, compared with the
old jets they'll replace. Meanwhile, he said, the company is
already talking with lenders about debt refinancing.
</P>
<P>
   Another shareholder asked whether the company would consider a
stock split while shares are cheap ``as an incentive for those who
have stood by the airline.'' As ValuJet, the airline's shares once
traded above $30 but plummeted after the carrier's 1996 crash in
Florida and safety grounding. Leonard said no split is planned.
</P>
<P>
   He also said an AirTran damages lawsuit against SabreTech, a
contractor whose mistakes led to the ValuJet crash, is scheduled
for trial in St. Louis next week.
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet co-founder Lewis Jordan, who remains an AirTran director
and its biggest stockholder, attended the meeting and said
afterward he believes the company will slowly gain strength under
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one step at a time,'' Jordan said.

 &HT;    Officials question whether NRA address appropriate
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stunned by a school shooting in their own backyards,
some Georgia Republicans were wavering Thursday over whether to
allow a National Rifle Association executive to address their state
convention Saturday in Augusta as planned.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Rusty Paul, who had refused to revoke the
invitation to NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, said
late Thursday that he now wants to consult with party leaders about
the appearance after a student opened fire in a Rockdale County
high school, injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make this decision by myself,'' Paul said.
``We don't want the whole convention to be about this issue. We
obviously want to be sensitive to the feelings and emotions of
everybody out there, particularly the feelings of the folks in
Rockdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Although several Republican leaders are urging the cancellation
of LaPierre's five-minute address to about 2,000 party delegates,
an NRA spokesman said LaPierre still planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with us,'' NRA spokesman Bill
Powers said of the shooting. Earlier in the week, LaPierre said his
message for Saturday is one that everyone concerned about
minimizing youth violence should listen to. ``Our message is the
one that will make people safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who call the appearance ill-advised quibble more
with the timing than with the NRA's pro-gun position.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's appearance would come about 48 hours after the
Rockdale shooting, a month after a shooting rampage in Littleton,
Colo., left 15 dead, and six months after the NRA irritated many
Georgia Republicans by endorsing Democrats in races for governor
and attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good judgment, at a time like this, and out of respect to
those who've been injured, would be to say this probably wouldn't
be a good thing to do,'' said U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.), who will chair the convention
in his hometown, is prepared to recommend to Paul that the speech,
one of the first by a lobbyist at the state convention, be
canceled, said spokesman John Stone.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), whose district includes Rockdale
County, also objects to the appearance _ albeit more on principle _
because he doesn't think lobbyists should be given the convention
floor, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the state's most conservative Republicans _
including U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, an NRA board member _ insist that the
speech should go on as planned. To do otherwise, they said, would
lend credence to arguments that guns, not people, cause the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about sensitivity issues,'' Barr said
Thursday when asked about the timing of LaPierre's appearance. ``We
need to look for solutions, not at whether something is politically
correct or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including at least two of the three candidates to
succeed Paul as state chairman, agree with Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with guns,'' said candidate Linda
Herren. ``It's unfortunate timing, but his speech at the convention
has nothing to do with the fact that an angry young man in Conyers
shot some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least a few Republicans won't be in their chairs
Saturday, mainly because of the anticipated fallout from an NRA
speech that will be heavily covered by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disastrous timing,'' said Rep. Mark Burkhalter
(R-Alpharetta), who plans to stay away. ``I don't know how, with
this happening today, we can, two days from now, wave the flag and
rah-rah the Second Amendment without ever touching on the
availability of guns.''

`CLEOPATRA' A ROYAL MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``Cleopatra'' as bad as ``Noah's Ark''?
</P>
<P>
   No. Of course not. But ABC's late entry will finish a close next
to last in the May sweeps miniseries disappointment derby to NBC's
awful ``Ark,'' a laugh-out-loud disaster that opened the current
ratings-intensive onslaught of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Margaret George's hefty novel ``The Memoirs of
Cleopatra,'' this mini dies of a weak heart: ABC has commited
Nile-ism in the extreme by casting Leonor Varela in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   A dynastic dish in any era, the young actress evidently got lost
somewhere between the wardrobe tent and whatever lavish set she was
led to next. According to this script, Cleopatra was a conniving
temptress who influenced the fate of nations. As played by Varela,
it's doubtful she could influence the drive-thru dude to supersize
a No. 3 meal deal.
</P>
<P>
   About that wardrobe tent: The gauzy getups that Varela wears
throughout this four-hour pageant, airing Sunday and Monday, seem
calculated to keep male viewers interested between the big battles.
Her cleavage, in fact, is so accentuated by Cleopatra's toga-based
couture that it should get its own mention in the closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a complaint or criticism. But it is a warning to any
parents of preteens who've been looking forward to a couple of
evenings of gala tele-history for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Cleopatra'' has its share of spectacle _ not to
mention a cast of thousands wearing George Clooney haircuts and USC
marching band costumes _ it is, at base, a soapy romance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's enough torch-lit lust here to fill Fox's fall
schedule. The fall of 51 B.C., that is.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``The Luuuuuuv Barge.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, as such, does Varela no favors. At one point,
Cleopatra seduces Julius Caesar by saying, ``I am Egypt. Egypt is
yours, for one night only.''
</P>
<P>
   At another (unrelated) juncture, Cleopatra's evil sister,
Arsinoe (played by Kassandra Voyagis), turns to her chariot driver
and says, ``C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pretty good actors in the cast get dialog that sounds
like the old Adam West ``Batman'' series.
</P>
<P>
   The two marquee men in Cleopatra's life, Julius Caesar and Marc
Antony, are played by Timothy Dalton (``License to Kill'') and
Billy Zane (``Titanic''), respectively. Both deliver performances
that won't do too much harm to their careers.
</P>
<P>
   A special surprise, Dalton manages to humanize his character
without turning him into a lovesick sap. Dalton has played gods
(James Bond, Rhett Butler) among men before, so this oversize role
is well within his grasp. Handsome devil, too.
</P>
<P>
   Zane tackles an equally challenging acting task, waging manly
war as well as making love to Cleo (while accompanied by frenzied
bongo music). Cool job.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other male players in this cast get to toss around
quite a bit of clipped Patrick Stewart diction. The most
interesting part of all is Octavian, whom Rupert Graves plays as a
scheming punk.
</P>
<P>
   The picturesque leads and extravagant supporting cast included,
this ``Cleopatra'' has got to be one of the prettiest four hours
ever filmed for TV. From sweeping establishing shots early in
Sunday night's installment to Monday's concluding sea battle, every
pre-Y0K setting appears appropriately costly. Exteriors were done
in Morocco, studio stuff in London.
</P>
<P>
   Through far too many of these sumptuous settings, Varela is
forced to wear royal headgear that resembles an oversize barbecue
tool.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the network and this miniseries' producer (Robert
Halmi Sr., the same guy who added a pirate attack to the story of
Noah) really believe that we peasants, given glitter and gilt and
some very fancy hats, might not notice a completely hollow
performance occuring beneath those giant head-tongs.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Cleo's bad sis: C'mon. &QL;

 &HT;    WebMD, Healtheon announce merger
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD and Healtheon announced their much-anticipated
merger Thursday, creating a $19.8 billion company that will lead
the pack of Web sites hoping to be home to health information on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Microsoft said it will buy about a 10 percent stake in the
new company for about $250 million. Microsoft will guarantee
another $250 million in advertising revenue and WebMD subscriptions
for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The new 1,300-employee company, to be called Healtheon/WebMD,
will base its marketing and sales operations in Atlanta. The
software engineering staff will stay in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about leadership and winning,'' said Jeff Arnold,
chief executive of WebMD and of the new company. ``With this
merger, health has a home page.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company would be traded under Healtheon's ticker symbol,
HLTH.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon will issue 1.815 of its shares for each of WebMD's 54
million shares. That places WebMD's value at $9.9 billion, based on
Thursday's closing price a $100.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon shares closed up $20.37 1/2 Thursday. The stock has
climbed 114 percent the past five days on talk of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Excite, Intel, Softbank, Covad and Superior
Consultant announced a combined $110 million investment in the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger values the companies equally. The deal will be
accounted for as a purchase. It is expected to close late in the
third quarter or early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The deal places an enormous value on two companies that have yet
to earn a profit. WebMD lost $7.8 million in the first nine months
of 1998. Healtheon reported a $18.6 million net loss for the first
three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of Internet companies are less about short-term
than they are future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   David Restrepo, a research analyst with Jupiter Communications,
attributes the enormous money spent on an emerging market to
potential and track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concept investment more than anything. Lots of
companies offer deeper content than what WebMD does. I chalk it up
to two things,'' he said. ``Health care spending is a trillion
dollar industry, 14 percent of the gross domestic product and big
enough to get Bill Gates' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the efficiencies of the Internet have been applied
successfully in travel and stocks; now it's health's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a doctor, WebMD wants to be your home page on the Web,
the place you turn to read news, trade stocks, book hotel and plane
reservations and earn continuing education credits.
</P>
<P>
   If you run a doctor's office, WebMD wants to be the place where
insurance coverage is verified and claims are processed, where lab
orders are placed and received and medical supplies are ordered.
</P>
<P>
   For individuals, WebMD wants to be the place people turn to read
up on new treatments for illnesses or to share information and
experiences via online discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said two-thirds of the combined company's revenue will
come from the physician side. Half of the physician-side revenue
would come from subscriptions, half from advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo said that while the consumer side of the business is
smaller, it could have an intangible value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer side is smaller overall, but they help create the
brand,'' he said. ``In a way, consumers could be the best
salespeople for WebMD. Increasingly patients are coming to doctor's
offices with printouts from the Web. Doctors are reluctant to pay
attention, but you can't fight the Internet. Its a losing battle.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 64 percent of the searches conducted online are for
health-related information, Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more than 49 million people online, anytime you get
two-thirds of people looking for something online, that's a big
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is free for individuals, but doctors are charged a
monthly fee of $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the subscriptions are paid by hospital groups. Microsoft
and DuPont have paid for 11 million months of physician
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Arnold said it isn't important who pays the fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is about speed and scale,'' Arnold said. ``It
doesn't matter who pays. It's central to get doctors enrolled and
get to market first. We expect they will pay eventually. But we
also expect to move to a transaction business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said doctors influence 80 percent of the $1 trillion
spent on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of a physician goes way beyond the $29.95
subscription,'' he said. ``To capture a relationship with that
physician is enormously attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has been in business since September. The company grew out
of Endeavor Technologies, which faxed cardiac test results to
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he decided to put the test results on the Web, but
was told by physicians that getting to the Web to find results from
one test took too much time.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of WebMD came when Arnold decided to make physicians'
visits to the Web more worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions with Healtheon started in early April, when
Arnold was entertaining clients at the Masters golf tournament.
Over dinner at the Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta, Arnold and Michael
Long, Healtheon chief executive officer, decided to pursue the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD launched in September after raising about $40 million,
including $10 million from HBO &AMP; Co., now McKessonHBOC.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, WebMD announced partnerships with high-profile
companies, including CNN, Lycos and DuPont, which agreed to pay
$220 million over five years to help develop WebMD's physician
network.

GTE BIDDERS SEEK INDIVIDUAL UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several bidders for GTE Corp.'s defense-electronics units in
Needham, Mass. are interested in buying fragments of the company
rather than the division as a whole, say people familiar with the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-based GTE announced in January it would auction its
Government Systems unit, which has 7,300 employees worldwide
including 1,800 in Massachusetts. Initial bids were due several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   GTE won't comment on its sale process, but trade press articles
have reported interest in the assets from General Dynamics Corp.,
Boeing Co., and Northrop-Grumman Corp., among others. All three
declined to comment, though people familiar with the thinking of
some potential buyers confirm those companies have expressed
interest.
</P>
<P>
   However, a group of potential bidders hasn't expressed any
interest in buying the assets as a whole, these sources say,
meaning the final total value of Government Systems could be less
than the unit's revenue of $1.4 billion last year. Also,
Lexington-based Raytheon Co. recently declined to submit a bid,
these people say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the auction has gone as well as (GTE) hoped in
terms of the numbers of potential bidders,'' who have made formal
bids, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   A GTE spokesman said the company couldn't comment because of
confidentiality agreements. A Raytheon spokesman declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   GTE plans the sale as it prepares to be purchased by Bell
Atlantic Corp. for about $81 billion in stock. If approved by
various regulatory agencies, the purchase would make Bell Atlantic
the country's largest phone company.
</P>
<P>
   GTE's other major unit in the state, GTE Internetworking, and
its 2,000 employees will become part of Bell Atlantic following the
transaction. The unit, formerly Bolt, Beranek &AMP; Newman Inc., was
purchased by GTE in 1997 for $616 million.
</P>
<P>
   GTE Government Systems focuses on military and public-sector
projects, with many divisions in the Washington, D.C. area. Typical
projects include a $110 million program to install a new high-speed
Internet backbone for the Pentagon and new desktop software at the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of another agreement with the Air Force, worth
$115 million, GTE will design a battlefield-imaging system. Other
units focus on imaging and mapping applications, telecommunications
networks, and secure communications-encryption systems.

FIDELITY SEES TURN TOWARD SMALLER COMPANIES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. JAFFE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fidelity Investments, which may be the ultimate
shop for large-company and growth investing, apparently sees the
stock market turning in favor of smaller, less-pricey companies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday in formal presentations to the Investment
Company Institute general membership meeting here, Fidelity
Management &AMP; Research Co. president Robert Pozen and vice chairman
Peter Lynch both indicated the stock markets may be ready to turn
in favor of smaller companies and value stocks. ``In April, we had
the sharpest rotations we have seen yet from growth to value,''
said Pozen. ``All of our go-anywhere funds will be moving toward
small-caps and mid-cap stocks, and maybe toward more value.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's continued boom _ up 50 percent since last
fall _ has been based on sharp increases in a small number of
stocks. These companies fall under the general heading of ``growth
companies'' because they have been posting consistently rising
sales and/or profits. So-called ``value stocks'' are those of
companies seen as being underpriced, but with the potential to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, of the largest 1,000 companies, the top 100 were up
an average of 42 percent,'' said Lynch, best known for having
managed Fidelity's Magellan fund. ``The next 900 were up 4 percent.
There will be some values in those 900 stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity is best known for its investments in large growth
companies, Pozen and Lynch produced a ream of statistics showing
that the firm has been strong in all investment environments.
According to those statistics, Fidelity's equity funds have
outperformed peers 71 percent of the time over the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers get even better in bond funds _ Fidelity bested its
peers 76 percent of the time _ and in money market funds, in which
Fidelity outgained more than 80 percent of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Fidelity executive gave much indication of the company's
future. Pozen said the company has been besieged with requests to
open an Internet fund _ but Fidelity will stick with its broader
sector funds.

BOGLE TO OPERATE HIS OWN MANAGEMENT FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. JAFFE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As if his presence at the primary meeting of fund
industry's leaders was not enough of a message, the nametags and
business cards were a dead giveaway. John Bogle Jr. is about to get
back into the fund business.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, who was instrumental in the growth and development of two
Boston fund firms, plans to open Bogle Investment Management in
Wellesley, Mass. He expects to open two or three mutual funds in
September, raising $200 million to $400 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle may be best known as the son of Vanguard Group chairman
Jack Bogle, but he earned his reputation by successfully managing
money first at Quantitative Group and then with n/i Funds. Bogle
abruptly left n/i last winter, essentially because he wanted a more
prominent long-term leadership role in the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his departure, Bogle did not say what he planned
to do next. Thursday at the Investment Company Institute general
membership meeting here, he left no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked a lot at what I want to do, and whether I wanted
to be with an established big company or to join a small firm, but
I felt there were too many interpersonal risks getting involved
with existing enterprises,'' Bogle said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle said he has already made one of the key hires for his new
firm, and was closing in on another top executive, but he declined
to provide names.

 &HT;    MCCAIN LASHES OUT AT CLINTON FOREIGN POLICIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) political categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain
offered his broadest criticism yet Thursday of President Clinton's
conduct of foreign and trade issues, calling the war in Kosovo
``yet another failure in ... the generally inept foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., has been outspoken in the past about Clinton's
declaration that he would not use ground troops in combat in
Yugoslavia. But in a speech at the National Press Club, the former
Vietnam prisoner of war said Clinton's foreign policies have
``badly injured our nation's stature and influence abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who earlier this month unsuccessfully offered a Senate
resolution to authorize whatever force might be necessary to
resolve the Balkan crisis, said he was particularly concerned
Clinton might accept an end to the situation that was less than the
goal he previously set forth. The president has said he wants the
Kosovar refugees to return to their homes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days we are perceived by our enemies as an uncertain
foe, and by our friends as an unreliable ally,'' he said. ``Both
perceptions will be worsened if we should, as I strongly suspect we
will, settle for less in the Balkans than what we went to war to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain claimed that Clinton had relinquished American leadership
in world affairs to multinational organizations such as NATO and
pursued ``foreign policies that are little more than international
variants of pork barrel politics, without regard for the long-term
interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator was particularly critical of Clinton for failing to
pursue so-called ``fast track'' trade authority in the face of
opposition within the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton went to Africa, preached the blessings of
free markets, but he never lifted a finger to push for trade
agreements when he came home,'' McCain said. ``Of course, it's
easier to challenge Third World reservations about free markets
than it is to challenge the 19th century views that America's labor
bosses hold about trade.''

SLOWER GROWTH SEEN FOR NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Breakneck growth across New England should slow this
year and next, creating a soft landing for an economy that has been
virtually unstoppable for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That was the consensus among a group of economists who make up
the New England Economic Project, which met Thursday to discuss the
future of the region's sizzling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of increasing concern is that Massachusetts' economy is in
danger of overheating after year upon year of strong growth.
Continued high demand for housing and workers, if it keeps pushing
up prices and wages, would cause precipitous declines in key
industries, such as high technology and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep growing as fast as we are now, what we have is a
boom-bust scenario,'' said Daphne Kenyon, president of the New
England Economic Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the odd reason that continued growth at a slower rate
is viewed not only as the most likely scenario but also as good
news,'' said Kenyon, who is also chairwoman of the economics
department at Simmons College in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although their forecast may be proved wrong by events, it is
becoming increasingly clear to economists that the Massachusetts
and regional economies are entering less certain times after a long
run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was introduced this week that could choke off
growth, particularly in Massachusetts: Federal Open Market
Committee members who met this week said they were leaning toward
raising interest rates. In Massachusetts, where growth has been
propelled by the financial and high-tech industries, the economy is
sensitive to rates and the stock market's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect job growth in Massachusetts to slow to 1.3
percent this year, compared with 2.2 percent in 1998, because of a
natural slowdown that follows periods of expansion. But, economists
said, the state ``is flirting dangerously with overheating.''
</P>
<P>
   New England's future, added Jeffrey Carr, vice president of
Economic &AMP; Policy Resources Inc. in Vermont, is ``fraught with
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Carr said, the challenges presented by the current
prosperity are preferable to ``obstacles all of the states faced
back at the beginning of this decade,'' when recession was gripping
the region.
</P>
<P>
   A separate forecast by Regional Financial Associates found that
the Boston area faces ``heightening downside risk'' because of its
reliance on a stock market many analysts believe is becoming more
precarious.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average Thursday closed down 20.65 at
10,866.74.
</P>
<P>
   But, RFA said Boston is somewhat ``insulated'' from a stock
market correction, because much of the city's financial industry is
centered on mutual funds, which are less cyclical than other stock
investments.
</P>
<P>
   For the six New England states, the New England Economic Project
predicted employment growth of 1.4 percent in 1999, down sharply
from 2.3 percent growth last year. Manufacturers are expected to
continue cutting payrolls, though other industries are expected to
remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Rhode Island will slow the most, while New Hampshire
would be least affected, the economists said.

   In the days after Ehud Barak's landslide election victory over
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the future for Jewish settlers,
like Kohen, is more uncertain than ever.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak makes good on campaign promises to move forward on the
peace process, he will have to put a stop to settlement activity in
the West Bank, political observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's government gave some tacit support to the settlers'
view that the West Bank, where about 150,000 Jewish settlers have
staked a claim among 1.2 million Palestinians, is part of ``eretz
Israel, or the biblical land of Israel, and that the Jewish right
to that land is ordained in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a tough-talking former general, is also an unorthodox
Labor politician. He pull won the largest margin of victory for any
prime minister in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say he comes to the office with less ideological
baggage on peace talks than did Netanyahu, and with a more
practical approach to security for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The public, right and left alike, appears to trust him on the
issue. Barak won about 25 percent of the vote among settlers in the
West Bank, a traditionally nationalist crowd that viewed Labor's
previous leaders as mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Kohen, a hard-line settler with a knitted kippah and the long
side curls of the strictly observant Orthodox, said he had voted
for Netanyahu, but reluctantly. When asked about Barak, he said:
``Barak knows the importance of us being here. He knows that we are
here for the security of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohen admitted that the far right had suffered a terrible defeat
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the settlers had led indirectly to Netanyahu's
defeat. They felt he had betrayed them by moving forward on the
peace agreement hammered out last fall at the Wye River Plantation
in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the mosque minarets and stone homes of Palestinian
villages, Kohen's encampment is what he calls a satellite of the
Shilo settlement two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hilltop where the five trailers lie has been named
``Achia,''which Kohen says refers to a biblical prophet who hailed
from these hills. The trailers ring a water tower next to which a
one-room synogogue is being built.
</P>
<P>
   Six Israeli soldiers were also camped out in a nearby steel
bunker, shouldering automatic rifles and listening to Janis Joplin
belt out ``Take A Piece of My Heart.'' The Netanyahu government
says that the soldiers had been put there to protect the settlers,
and that their presence becomes an example of how the settlements
``create facts on the ground,'' as the settlers put it.
</P>
<P>
   The area falls within a swath of land that is under shared
Palestinian and Israeli control, and one of the areas that would be
likely to shift to full Palestinian control in troop withdrawals
outlined in the Wye agreement, which became deadlocked under
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   This small settlement is one of more than two dozen that sprang
up in the West Bank in the final months of Netanyahu's government.
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon went as far as to urge settlers to
``occupy every hilltop'' before Israel moved any further in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements effectively break the contiguity of Palestinian
villages and become Israeli security outposts in the middle of the
small circles of full Palestinian control that dot roughly 10
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Galia Golan, a spokeswoman for Peace Now, which is lobbying
Barak to remove settlers like Kohen, also has faith that Barak will
understand the peace camp's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settler movement lost in these elections,'' said Golan,
whose group is made of Israelis and Palestinians who support the
peace process. ``We think Barak understands these settlements are
illegal and that for the peace process to move forward they'll have
to be dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   People as far apart politically as Kohen and Golan, unfocused as
they seem, appear to show that for now, Israelis can view Barak as
they want to. This is possible because Barak took a tough but vague
line on security issues in the campaign, and the Israeli media did
not make him define his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Barak, who is preparing to take office within six
weeks, seems to have momentum to forge ahead, not only in the
Palestinian peace process, but on the Syrian track as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to pull Israeli troops out of the security zone
they occupy in South Lebanon. Such a move would help to pave the
way to a peace agreement with Syria. Some Israeli political
observers have even advanced the idea that Barak could possibly
return the Golan Heights, the region that Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first interviews as prime minister-elect, Barak
responded to a question about the future of West Bank settlements
by saying: ``There are places which I know we will have to make
hard decisions about. That is one of the reasons why I need a broad
government. Then the public can more easily accept the decisions,
and the other side expects to get less.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked more generally about his view of peace, Barak told the
Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, ``I feel like I am a sober
person, a realist, a person who reaches peace not by studying the
visions of the later days of the prophets, but through confronting
reality. I believe in peace from a position of strength, not
fear.''

SITTING PRETTY WITH SIERRA  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's a bumper sticker we're all familiar with,
usually found plastered on the back of a battered pickup truck:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboy Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message that's both mocking and self-effacing, that the
wrangler behind the wheel has his own notion of success and little
need for the usual trappings of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's the Cowboy Cadillac for the next millennium, a
fully loaded GMC Sierra, equipped for heavy hauling and fitted with
enough luxury appointments to make Tex Ritter blush.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra is a cosmetic variation on the Chevrolet Silverado,
which has been lauded for its carlike driveability and solid
construction. This duo is all new for '99, their first major
makeover in 10 years, and represent an evolutionary progression for
General Motors trucks as they vie for supremacy over the perennial
bestseller, Ford F-series.
</P>
<P>
   GMC was once the workingman's truck source, with heavy-duty
versions of Chevrolet trucks and other, bigger haulers. Now linked
with Pontiac at dealerships across the nation, GMC has a different
mission.
</P>
<P>
   GM's game plan for the Sierra and other GMC trucks is to be the
upscale version of their Chevy counterparts. So where a Silverado
can be bought in pretty much stripped-down trim, the Sierra starts
out laden with features as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra test truck, an extended-cab half-ton SLE, came with a
hedonistic level of comfort and convenience amenities, including
leather seating and trim, power everything, a decent back seat and
a fabulous stereo. It's the prestige setup for the gentleman
farmer, the successful contractor or a cowboy who's hit the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of features shows on the bottom line. The SLE's
starting price is already fairly steep, and the options add on
about $5,000. These include a package of interior upgrades, for
nearly $2,400; another $565 for power seats and stereo upgrade;
$700 for the 5.3-liter engine; and $285 for heavy-duty towing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The least-expensive Sierra, with a V-6 engine and stick shift,
starts at about $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Sierra and Silverado differ greatly is in body
styling, with the GMC bearing its own set of fenders and
headlights, as well as the characteristic big-rig grille and red
GMC lettering. The Sierra styling is more distinctive and
interesting than the Silverado's, which looks like a carry-over
from past design.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its lush comfort features, the Sierra is really a
good-driving pickup, with responsive steering, decent cornering and
an excellent set of standard four-wheel disc brakes. The suspension
of the test truck, a four-wheel drive equipped with an off-road
suspension package, was jouncy but never harsh or punishing.
</P>
<P>
   On a short trip from Phoenix to Wickenburg, the Sierra was
supremely comfortable. The cab with its new interior is spacious
and accommodating. At highway speeds, the truck feels competent and
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that sensation of security and serenity that
big-truck drivers crave: sitting up high, reigning over the
highway. This is part of the appeal of a full-size pickup. The
marketers call it ``bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Silverado, the extended-cab Sierra is available as a
three-door, allowing entry to the rear seat from the right side.
With the competition offering four-door stretch cabs, this is a
flaw, but I don't think it's any big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rear seating has been improved greatly, with enough space for
life-size humans to sit in reasonable comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra's ride is solid and rattle-free, tracking straight
over road irregularities, the body feeling solid and
well-constructed. GMC touts its truck's modular frame, stronger
body and new suspension system for the improvements in ride and
handling over previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Four new-for-'99 Vortec engines are available for the Sierra
(same as the Silverado): a 4.3 V-6 for economical driving, a
4.8-liter 255-horse unit, the 5.3-liter version on our test truck,
and a 6-liter behemoth that cranks out 300 horsepower and 355
pound-feet of torque. The big engine is available only on the
three-quarter ton.
</P>
<P>
   A 6.5-liter turbo diesel also can be ordered for the
three-quarter ton. This is the ticket for serious towing, mustering
440 pound-feet of torque starting at a low 1,800 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.3 is strong and smooth, with only a bit of roar under
acceleration. The truck is a gas hog, though, with an EPA rating of
just 15 city and 18 highway. I ran through a 26-gallon gas tank in
short order.
</P>
<P>
   The brawny engine is linked to a well-tuned four-speed automatic
that is seamless and responsive. It includes a setting for towing
and hauling, which holds each gear longer to let the engine wind
out and downshifts more quickly. Towing capacity for this setup is
rated at 8,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size-pickup market is a tough playground. Ford sold
about 800,000 F-series trucks last calendar year, with
Silverado/Sierra coming out as runner-up. And Dodge Ram, with its
popular tough-as-nails styling, has moved up from the back,
stealing from the leaders.
</P>
<P>

ACADEMIC-INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIPS OFTEN THE RULE, NOT THE
EXCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Lawrence Loeb is a nationally recognized molecular
biologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine who
directs the biomedical scientist training program _ the prestigious
M.D.-Ph.D. track.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb and his colleague Dr. James Mullins also are helping launch
a new biotechnology company in Seattle, Koronis Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Both scientists and the UW have been given Koronis stock in
return for their expert assistance in developing drugs to combat
viral resistance. It's a private extension of their publicly funded
work at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be a confusing situation because academic scientists
also have the public responsibility of performing independent
evaluations of new drugs or therapies. Yet here they are launching
a private company whose ultimate goal is to sell these drugs. Isn't
that a potential conflict of interest?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Loeb said, but it's manageable and this is the only way to
advance the research and turn an idea into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reality today,'' Loeb said. ``There are potential
conflicts in this arrangement, but it allows me to develop a
high-risk project that I don't have the facilities or time to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb is not unusual. Such academic-industrial partnerships are
rapidly becoming the rule rather than the exception in biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology is fueling this transformation like never before.
The strong need for cutting-edge basic science in this industry has
made for intimate partnerships with academia. It's a transformation
that has some people worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly complicated situation,'' said Dr. Robert
Cook-Deegan, director of the National Academy of Science's National
Cancer Policy Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academic research institutions need to be real careful about
conflicts of interest and also about preserving their educational
mission,'' Cook-Deegan said. The economic benefits of these
academic-industrial partnerships cannot be the only yardstick by
which success is measured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science depends upon the free and open exchange of
information,'' said Irving Lerch, chairman of the Scientific
Freedom and Responsibility committee for the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Lerch said the association launched a study committee in 1997 to
take a hard look at academic-industrial partnerships in
biotechnology because of several incidents raising concerns. Some
of the high-profile examples:
</P>
<P>
   _University of California-San Francisco researcher Dr. Betty
Dong fought for six years before she was able to publish, in 1997,
the results of her study that found a new thyroid drug was no
better than generic version of the drug. Lawsuits by the company
sponsor, Knoll Pharmaceuticals, had claimed publication violated
their proprietary rights on the data.
</P>
<P>
   _Early this year, Dr. Nancy Olivieri of the University of
Toronto was reinstated to her hospital position. Olivieri had been
removed after a drug company, Apotex, sued her for publishing
negative findings about their drug.
</P>
<P>
   _The University of California-San Francisco is suing the biotech
giant Genentech in federal court for $400 million. The university
claims that the firm in 1978 knowingly used a bacterial clone
stolen from a university lab to develop its synthetic human growth
hormone. Genentech claims the researcher legally brought the clone
over from his lab, but that it wasn't used to synthesize their
product anyway and so doesn't violate the UCSF patent.
</P>
<P>
   _Last year, the Swiss drug and agribusiness company Novartis and
the University of California-Berkeley announced they had formed an
unprecedented kind of academic-industrial partnership. Novartis
paid $25 million to the university's department of plant and
microbiology in return for first crack at commercializing any
discoveries over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But such dramatic controversies are rare. Advocates of
academic-industrial partnerships note that concerns over conflict
of interest and suppression of data are not the only issues that
should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Public-private benefits
</P>
<P>
   Back when the biotechnology industry was in its infancy,
Congress passed the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act. It not only encouraged
academic-industrial partnerships; it required any institutions
receiving federal money to create ``technology transfer'' offices
to help move discoveries toward commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the premise that innovations were languishing in labs
because of a lack of financial incentives, the act allowed
scientists and institutions to be rewarded financially for getting
drugs or technologies to market.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Loeb say he's clearly not entering into
partnership with Koronis for the money (his founder's stock is
worth about $40 right now). He and Mullins are in it because
industry can do something the UW can't do _ scale up production of
the UW team's unique anti-viral approach so it can be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interests are complementary,'' said Dr. Richard Daifuku,
chief executive officer at Koronis and a UW M.D.-Ph.D. graduate.
``We can move their work farther down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond facilitating larger-scale biomedical research projects,
these academic-industrial partnerships can work to the taxpayer's
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we help the company get off the ground, we'd like to make
sure the public gets some benefit,'' said Dr. Alvin Kwiram, UW's
vice provost for research. The public benefits, Kwiram said,
because the private money that comes back to the UW _ in the form
of licensing agreements or royalties _ helps defray the taxpayer's
burden in supporting academic research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, scientists say partnerships with industry are their
only access to promising drugs or research materials held by
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the biotechnology industry was first launched in Seattle in
the early 1980s _ ``spinning off'' out of labs at the UW and Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle _ most academic
scientists were told it was taboo to work with industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was considered an unacceptable conflict,'' said Catherine
Hennings, director of technology transfer at Fred Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the UW and Fred Hutchinson saw some of their best
scientists leave academia for industry, taking with them the fruits
of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   John Des Rosier, director of industrial relations at the UW
Medical School, said partnering with industry allows universities
to retain the best academic scientists. But that doesn't mean the
UW allows academics to do whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build firewalls,'' Des Rosier said. Rules minimize
potential conflicts of interest, he said, and protect academic
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate culture is different than the academic
culture,'' Des Rosier said. ``And they are going to stay
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems subtle, invisible
</P>
<P>
   One world-renowned scientist urges caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an academic scientist, I think it's very important to
define at what point it makes sense to have a public-private
partnership,'' said Dr. Mary-Claire King, who researches breast
cancer genetics at the UW. King is also known for her work using
science to identify victims of political killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that this is great because it will bring
in a lot of money for them to do their research without strings
attached,'' King said. ``That's naive ... I don't think money ever
comes without strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb's project is an example of the kind of academic-industrial
partnership that can work for both parties, she said, in part
because he's an established scientist who doesn't have to depend on
the partnership for financial support of his research.
</P>
<P>
   For other scientists, especially younger researchers who may be
more dependent on industry support, problems can arise. And there
are warning signs out there.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in 1997 by David Blumenthal of Massachusetts
General Hospital found that 20 percent of some 2,000 biomedical
researchers surveyed had delayed publication of their results for
more than six months, or had not published them at all, because of
concerns from private sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond Rennie, an editor at the Journal of the American
Medical Association, recently noted that the vast majority of drug
studies published today show positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indicates a publication bias,'' Rennie said. It raises
the question of whether negative results are being withheld from
publication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hennings at the Fred Hutchinson and Des Rosier at the UW
said their institutions strictly protect the right to publish all
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to ever agree to keep our researchers'
results confidential,'' Hennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Future is in private hands
</P>
<P>
   Most academic research remains taxpayer-supported through
federal research grants. The UW is one of the top recipients of
federal research dollars, receiving $422 million in 1998, 76
percent of its total research budget. Industry funds accounted for
only about 11 percent percent of the UW Medical School's total
research budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hutchinson received $103 million in federal research
support in 1998, 88 percent of its total research budget. Industry
money accounted for 4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at in this way, private funding of academic research is
still way behind publicly financing of academic science. Even so,
private funding in academia has increased by more than 20 percent
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   And if private dollars spent by drug companies and others in the
biomedical industry for their own corporate research is added to
what industry spends on research in academia, Cook-Deegan said,
private industry surpassed public funding on medical research
sometime in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes worrisome, he said, if both academia and private
industry start treating scientific information as proprietary
material. The influence of industry on research institutions cannot
only be measured in terms of dollars spent, Cook-Deegan said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other influences not measured by dollars spent.
</P>
<P>
   Though only a small number of academics actually help start new
companies, an increasing number of faculty at both the UW and Fred
Hutchinson have entered into other types of relationships with
private companies. These include negotiated consulting work,
exchange of information or proprietary materials and how or when to
disclose sponsored research findings.
</P>
<P>
   Of 1,400 faculty at the UW medical school, about half do outside
consulting work for private companies.
</P>
<P>
   At Fred Hutchinson, about half of the 189 faculty do outside
consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of interactions between academia and industry have
certainly become more prevalent,'' Hennings said.

   BOSTON -- Harry Sinden said he wasn't surprised at the furor his
post-series comments generated among his players and the public
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' president/general manager said he meant it when he
pointedly criticized forwards Jason Allison and Dmitri Khristich
for their ineffective performances against the Sabres that led to
Boston's ouster in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   However, while Sinden didn't back off on his comments on
Khristich, he wanted to elaborate on why he singled out Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only problem with Jason was that after a superb performance
here on Sunday by him, my expectations were the same that Byron
(Dafoe), Raymond (Bourque), and Jason, three players who are
absolutely necessary to us in order to win a game in Buffalo in
which we faced elimination, had to play almost to their utmost
potential,'' said Sinden. ``That's probably what pushed me to vent
myself on Jason more than anything, was his Sunday performance. My
expectations were, `Wow, if we get that again, we'll beat them in
Buffalo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said it's important for Allison to become more
consistent. After Game 6 Tuesday, he cited Bourque as someone to
emulate. Sinden said by no means did he expect his players to be
Bourque. He was holding up Bourque's attitude, consistency, and
commitment as something to strive for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Bourque's not the only one,'' said Sinden. ``Don Sweeney
is another one. In all the years they've been here, they don't play
game by game. They play shift by shift. They're not all good ones,
but they're all played with exactly the same attitude. Sometimes
they don't play as well. Sometimes they give the puck away.
Sometimes they fall down, sometimes they do some terrible things,
but their attitude never, ever changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are others, too. I think Rob DiMaio is one. I think Joe
Thornton is starting to learn that. That's what I point to, not to
expect anybody to be as good as Ray but your mental attitude has to
be as developed as well as your skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden acknowledged that Allison was hampered by Khristich as a
linemate and by Sergei Samsonov's struggle because of injury and
youth. However, he said based on Sunday's game, he knows Allison
can do more and therefore he expects more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't getting any help, that's for sure,'' said Sinden.
``I'm a champion of Jason Allison throughout the league and in the
organization. The guy's got a tremendous talent and he's creative.
But there are nights when it doesn't seem important to Jason. After
Sunday, I was so caught by surprise that we didn't get a similar
performance (Tuesday). I suppose I was out of line in picking on
him for that one particular game but it did eliminate us.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Sinden made it sound Thursday, the situation is very
unresolved with regard to Khristich's future in Boston. When asked
if he wanted Khristich back next season, Sinden paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think a lot of things have to be straightened out with
Dmitri and the team and coach (Pat Burns), too. I don't want to
speak for the coach but he wasn't any happier than I was. It's just
that I'm stupid enough to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich is regarded by management and the coach as an enigma.
Sinden said he hasn't worked at trying to figure Khristich out but
he does pass along his thoughts to the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just shakes his head, too,'' said Sinden. ``As a coach,
you've got to be careful because he's got to work with these guys
all the time so his feelings and frustrations can't be brought out
perhaps the way mine are. I think Pat would like to solve the
riddle because he can see the skill of the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison spends his offseason in Ontario and Sinden said he would
like to talk to him to smooth things over before he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do something,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to leave it
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about him,'' said Sinden. ``I might want to leave
it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to see defenseman Jonathan Girard make an
appearance in the playoffs in Providence. Sinden said the talented
blue liner, who started the season in Boston before being sent back
to his junior team in Laval of the Quebec League, is about to be
eliminated from the Memorial Cup tournament, which would pave the
way for him to join the Baby B's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's an outstanding talent,'' said Sinden.
``There are things he hasn't perfected yet and he has to get into
the pro game to realize what it's all about here, like Joe Thornton
did. He is an outstanding talent in terms of his creativity, his
skating ability, his shooting, his passing. He's reasonably
good-sized, 6-foot or 6-1 and 195 pounds. He's very sturdy. He has
a good chance to make the team next season. All reports indicate
he's the closest player outside Boston and Providence to making the
team. When he was here before, he wanted to give the puck to Ray
all the time. He didn't want to do anything that might open him up
to error. He was cautious. The way he played in juniors was
anything but that.''

   Pop quiz:
</P>
<P>
   Think back to your junior high and high school days. What movie,
TV show, song, video game and/or book influenced you the most?
Which pop culture experience affected your thought process, guided
your behavior, and left the most lasting impression on you?
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You can't really think of one?
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, that's the correct answer. Oh sure, you might
remember imitating James Dean or dancing like John Travolta, or
perhaps you dressed like Cyndi Lauper or you steeped yourself in
the grunge culture _ but those were passing fads indigenous to your
particular teen era. Nothing you read or watched or listened to had
that much of an impact on you.
</P>
<P>
   All right, time for question No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Describe the most humiliating and hurtful experience of your
teen years. The episode, or series of episodes, that wounded you to
the core and made you ache inside so much that you wished you were
dead. The kind of trauma that left permanent psychic scars.
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You'll need extra sheets of paper to accommodate
all you have to say about this matter?
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there either. Unless you were a zitless homecoming
queen or an all-state jock _ and maybe even then _ you no doubt
went through a period when you were ostracized, mocked, embarrassed
or ignored by the coolest, hippest groups in school. You have
painfully vivid memories of the time you didn't get asked to prom
or you were beaten up in the locker room or someone slapped a
``LOSER'' sign on your back and you walked around for an hour
before anyone told you.
</P>
<P>
   Kids can be meaner and tougher than junkyard dogs. They'll tease
and bully and psychologically torture their supposed weaker or
weirder peers, for the sheer rotten fun of it. Nowhere is the class
system more clearly defined than in the hallways of an American
high school.
</P>
<P>
   One month since the shootings at Columbine High, we have yet
another nightmare in the news from Conyers, Ga., and the adult
world continues its effort to find some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Special sessions in Washington have focused on the role of the
entertainment industry in shaping the mindset of today's youth. The
president scolded Hollywood _ then zipped to Beverly Hills for a $2
million fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   On the cable news networks, the experts blather endlessly about
cultural influences. Nearly all of the Y2K presidential candidates
are offering their own opinions on video games, R-rated movies,
Marilyn Manson, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'm wondering what really has the most negative
impact on the twisted minds of school shooters. In the case of Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, was it the Internet and Marilyn Manson
and KMFDM and ``The Matrix'' _ or was it the cumulative effect of
getting slammed against lockers by the baseball players and
wrestlers, of being called ``fags,'' of the daily hallway taunting
at the hands of the privileged jockocracy at Columbine?
</P>
<P>
   What do you think.
</P>
<P>
   We all know this stuff goes on. Every day in high schools across
this country, elite members of the goodlooking, strong, popular
crowd pick on the freaks and the weirdos and the losers _ often
with the encouragement, or at least the tacit approval, of teachers
and administrators. I can remember jocks at my high school
tormenting the kids in gym classes, as coaches looked on and just
laughed. And that ain't unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are...Columbine! We are...Columbine!'' Students exhorted
the community to make that group-statement at a number of memorial
services for their slain friends. It was a statement of resilience,
of pride, of family.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sports cheer. The kind of 1950s, rah-rah,
we've-got-spirit-yes-we-do chant that would have elicited the scorn
of the Trench Coat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say excellence in academics, and in sports,
should not be encouraged and rewarded _ but the value systems in
most learning institutions are completely out of whack. We don't
live in Pleasantville any more and it's not always the coolest
thing to be on the cheerleading squad or the football team _ but
don't kid yourself, the star athletes and the attractive kids still
get the best deal in school. Teachers aren't giving special breaks
to Goths.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but who's going to convene a panel on peer pressure, on
decency, on emphasizing tolerance in high schools? It's much easier
to focus on Doom and ``Natural Born Killers'' and teen-Nazi chic.
</P>
<P>
   I still believe nobody other than Harris and Klebold is
responsible for the massacre in Littleton _ but I have a feeling
that in the aftermath of the shootings, more than a few of the
surviving ``cool kids'' at Columbine have had long nights when they
remembered picking on those two and their friends, taunting them
and treating them like dirt because they were different.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet they wish they had those moments back.

ERRANT BOMB HITS HOSPITAL IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Radan Dusanka fought back tears Thursday, standing in
the rubble of what used to be her hospital, of what used to be her
ward, the neurological unit at Dragisa Misovic Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been me,'' she said, looking at the shell of a
building, its three floors collapsed on top of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Dusanka, a nurse, was supposed to work the midnight shift but
changed her schedule at the last moment. It was a decision that
probably saved her life. At least four people died when a missile
that NATO said went astray early Thursday and landed short of a
military barracks here in the Yugoslav capital, crashing into the
hospital's neurological intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the errant NATO bomb kill and injure civilians, it
damaged the nearby homes of several European ambassadors. It was
another embarrassing mistake for NATO, another propaganda coup for
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But for people like Dusanka and Dr. Miodrag Lazic, who work at
the hospital, it was more than another move in the ongoing game of
war between NATO and Milosevic. It was a desecration of a place
that should be a refuge for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Lazic, a urologist and deputy director of the hospital, said he
and other medical staff rushed to the scene around 1 a.m. after
hearing what he called a tremendous explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nurses were trapped on the third floor, cut off,'' he
said, standing next to a huge crater and the twisted wreckage of
wrought iron bed frames. ``We had to improvise to bring them down.
But the very sight of the killed people, the corpses, was
abhorrent.''
</P>
<P>
   While the neurological ward took a direct hit, several other
hospital buildings were badly damaged by the blast. Among the
injured were two women who were hit by flying glass after giving
birth in the maternity ward.
</P>
<P>
   Lazic said other patients were moved to other hospitals,
including a baby that was born 10 minutes before the bomb struck.
Asked whether the baby was a boy or a girl, an exhausted Lazic,
sweating profusely under a hot midday sun and a leather jacket that
covered his green surgical scrubs, just shrugged and said, ``I
don't know. I'm just a urologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were given a guided tour of the bomb site by Yugoslav
Army officials, who quickly ended the tour when reporters began
picking up live and spent bullet casings on the access road that
leads to the adjacent military facility. The bullets appeared to be
machine gun ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical staff at the scene said military vehicles routinely
park on the access road, which is fenced off but right next to the
neurological unit, one of 24 separate buildings on the hospital
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Leposava Milicevic, the Yugoslav health minister, insisted no
military vehicles or personnel are allowed on hospital grounds. But
NATO officials said their pilots were targeting the military
facility, whose gates are less than 200 yards down the access road
from where the hospital building was destroyed. NATO said the
errant bomb fell about 500 yards short of its target, but said it
could not confirm its bomb hit a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Yugoslav officials, Milicevic said the hospital
bombing was not a mistake, but a deliberate targeting of ``helpless
civilians.'' She also accused NATO of purposely dropping a second
bomb near the hospital 15 minutes after the initial bomb, in an
effort to kill rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called allegations that the hospital
was bombed on purpose ``completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Local residents said they heard up to eight separate explosions
early Thursday, during what was the heaviest bombing in the
Yugoslav capital in about two weeks. One woman resident said she
assumed the bombs were aimed at the nearby home of Zeljko
Raznatovic, the Serb paramilitary leader known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   That the bombing began less than a half-hour after the Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin took off from Belgrade after seven hours
of meetings with Milosevic fed local cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO officials acknowledged that its pilots had
dropped seven bombs on the military barracks in the Dedinje area,
an exclusive neighborhood that includes ambassador's row. Among the
residences hit was one belonging to the ambassador of Spain, whose
country is the home of NATO secretary general Javier Solana. The
Spanish government was one of several that scolded NATO, asking it
to use more care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish government considers it to be of the utmost
importance to ensure that military activities are carried out with
the greatest caution in order to avoid victims in the civilian
population and damage to buildings that are not considered
strategic targets,'' the communique from Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the patients at Dragisa Misovic Medical Center who were
jolted from their beds when the bomb struck was the hospital's
director, Dr. Radisav Scepanovic. Scepanovic had been working
100-hour weeks since the bombing began March 24 and had been
admitted to the hospital's cardiac care unit earlier after
suffering what appeared to be a heart attack, fellow staff members
said.
</P>
<P>
   Milicevic said three patients, two women and a man, and a night
watchman were killed by the bomb. She said the death toll could
rise, because it remains unclear how many people were in the
neurological ward when it got hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals will be targeted again,'' she predicted, saying that
Dragisa Misovic had suffered ``collateral damage'' three times
before, but that this was the first direct hit taken by a hospital
building.
</P>
<P>
   Radan Dusanka, the nurse who worked in the neurological unit,
could only contemplate her good fortune, and the bad luck of those
who were in a hospital ward when the euphemism ``collateral
damage'' became tragically human.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an old woman under all that,'' she said, pointing to
the twisted debris, as water hissed from broken pipes. ``When all
you leave, they will start digging for her again.''

NATO PLEDGES MILITARY AID TO ALBANIA, MACEDONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Over a mid-afternoon beer Thursday, career
soldier and Army 1st Capt. Albert Mullai was making a wish-list of
what NATO could do to repay Albania for its cooperation during the
Yugoslavian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even before dusk, the Albanian army's chief spokesman would
learn that more than a few of his wishes had been granted. In
Brussels, NATO announced that it would supply Albania and Macedonia
with long-term aid, and help both Balkan nations meet the
alliance's entry requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That most likely means modernizing their armed forces _ a big
wish of his _ and providing two of Europe's poorest countries with
cash assistance. Representatives of Albania and Macedonia were in
Brussels to discuss those improvements as well as both countries'
current security needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This of course is military assistance which is long term, but
which is also directly linked to their particular needs stemming
from the crisis in the region,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told
reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time in downtown Tirana, Mullai was dreaming
aloud of roads without missing manhole covers, camouflage uniforms
that do not need mending, and tanks that do not belch exhaust
fumes. NATO's next potential member has no more than 15,000 regular
Army troops, most of them draftees, few willing to serve beyond the
one-year requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves equals with the other armies now here,''
said Mullai, sometimes speaking in adequate English, other times
relying on an interpreter. ``Our help to them is very important. We
give them our airports, our roads, anything they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mullai did admit to some pangs of jealousy when he saw
the military equipment brought into Albania by heavy transport
aircraft, another item the country lacks. He conceded much of the
army's own equipment is outdated, some of it more than 50 years
old. But he insisted the Kalashnikovs that soldiers carry _ and
that one soldier was spotted using to play air guitar while in
uniform _ are the finest rifles available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between my army and their army is that they
have the equipment to fight; we didn't have uniforms, sometimes no
weapons,'' said Kadri Sadik, a World War II veteran who was at the
Defense Ministry to pick up his monthly $18.50 benefits check.
``But Albanian soldiers are like lions when they have to defend the
homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   From all appearances, however, Albanian soldiers appear to lack
the discipline that western armies insist upon in their troops. At
Tuesday's appearance by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, few
soldiers bothered to stand at attention and at Thursday's arrival
of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, many of the
soldiers standing in sloppy formation also had empty sidearm
holsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to be jealous of what other people have, but in
terms of knowledge and training, we do not feel inferior...,''
Mullai said. ``It's true that our weapons are previous generation,
but we have enough arms, enough munitions, more than enough....One
good result of communism is that we have a lot of weapons to choose
from, even if they are old.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania, however, has no intention of using those weapons in
close combat against Serbian troops. While Mullai insisted again
and again that the Albanian army has earned worldwide respect as a
fighting force, he also stressed that it was doing everything
possible to avoid provoking Serbian forces who regularly violate
Albania's border. He also denied that Albania was training the
Kosovo Liberation Army to do that job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the Army is responsible for defending the
integrity and freedom of the country, but normally it's not
responsible for the border line,'' he said. ``In the current
conditions, the army is acting just in the cases where it's needed,
when the border police call for us because what the Serbs are doing
is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian army did respond to Serbian incursions with an
unexpected show of force this week. It sent a convoy of nine tanks,
an armored personnel carrier and a truckload of soldiers to the
Albania-Yugoslavia border, where army tanks returned Serbian fire.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, after the Serbs attacked four border villages,
killing two civilians and wounding numerous others, the Albanian
army also responded with force, Mullai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four months ago, the provocations started and have continued
nearly every day, but the Army is involved in only two cases,'' he
said. ``We were following this logic: Avoiding provocation is our
goal. That's why the whole time the army was present but did not
get involved with fighting them.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one respect, Albania has long been ready for an
assault on its sovereignty. The country is dotted with
mushroom-shaped bunkers, more than 600,000 in all, although no one
knows the exact number. The leftover from the communist era also
includes underground shelters which can house thousands of soldiers
at a time. One in the north, in Kukes, descends seven levels and
opens into a cavern that once held everything from weapons to
hospitals to bread-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bunker mentality is the previous generation's, not ours,''
said Mullai. ``Bunkers are one form of fortification. They're not
too modern, but they're strong. If used by educated soldiers, they
can be very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the useful old while obtaining the essential new was
another of Mullai's wishes. He spoke of a program to persuade at
least 25 percent of army troops to become career soldiers,
reenlisting for five-year stretches. He boasted of the
multi-lingual capabilities of the army's 2,000 officers, among
which were 1,400 who received part of their military education in
Turkey, England, Germany or the United States. Even now, he said,
his troops train using the same methods as their would-be NATO
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't help in NATO's attack because our equipment is
different,'' said Mullai, who supports the introduction of NATO or
US ground troops into Serb territory. ``We support them as much as
we can. That is what we can do for the moment.''

OLIVETTI EDGES CLOSER TO TELECOM TAKEOVER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Olivetti inched closer Thursday to possible victory in a
$65 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia by amassing nearly 20
percent of the shares in its larger rival, roughly twice the stake
it held 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With only a day to go before Olivetti's tender offer for Telecom
Italia expires, it was still unclear whether the challenger would
get the minimum 35 percent of the huge utility's shares required to
keep the bid alive. But the surge in the number of shares offered
over 24 hours was interpreted by some market analysts as a sign of
impending success.
</P>
<P>
   If Olivetti amassed at least 35 percent of Telecom Italia, it
would delay, if not wreck, Telecom Italia's friendly merger with
Deutsche Telekom. If Olivetti ultimately acquired Telecom Italia,
it would be one of the largest successful hostile takeovers ever.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's stock market said Thursday night that equity holders in
Telecom Italia had tendered 1.04 billion common shares to Olivetti,
or 19.89 percent of the total, compared with less than 10 percent
as of Wednesday night. But many large investors have said that they
will wait until Friday to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti had indicated earlier Thursday that it had firm
commitments through its banks to get 42 percent to 47 percent of
Telecom Italia shares. Telecom Italia protested that such
disclosures were improper and asked the nation's stock market
regulator to suspend the bid. The regulatory agency denied the
request but cautioned Olivetti about spreading unverifiable
information.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia shares fell 2.4 percent Thursday to 9.69 euros,
or $10.29, after surging Wednesday on expectations of an Olivetti
takeover; Olivetti's share price also dropped, by 1.7 percent, to
3.30 euros.

 &HT;    Breakup precedes shooting of students at Georgia high school
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Exactly one month after the fatal shootings in
Littleton, Colo., a suicidal high school student, angry over
breaking up with his girlfriend, turned his anger on the world
Thursday, shooting six of his classmates and emotionally scarring
countless others.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, a
middle-class community about 20 miles east of Atlanta. Five victims
suffered minor injuries, and a 15-year-old, Stephanie Laster,
underwent surgery after a bullet struck her in the buttocks and
entered her intestines.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old, known to talk big about his guns, started
shooting at about 8 a.m. into a crowd of about 300 students in the
lobby near the cafeteria. Authorities say he was looking to shoot
the boy who had stolen his girl, though that person was not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   As the rapid-fire shots ruptured the morning calm, panicked
students dropped to the floor, leaped behind tables, or ran out the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole school, everybody, was just roaring out of the
school,'' said Amy Ladd, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' added Kylie Forrester, a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school, the breathless students hugged one another
for comfort. A half dozen linked hands in a circle and bowed their
heads in prayer. Some said they thought it was a prank, coming on
the last day of senior class. The day before someone released 2,000
crickets in the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Deeter recalled chatting with the teen 10 minutes
before he started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you had broken up with your girlfriend,'' Deeter had
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm real mad about it,'' the student responded.
</P>
<P>
   The teen looked distant and removed as he spoke of the failed
relationship, a romance of two years that ended this week. ``He
looked like he was thinking about something else,'' said Deeter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bullets. ``He shot the kid next to me in the
foot,'' Deeter said. ``It was as though he was looking right
through people.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooter, who was wearing jeans and a baggy, blue pullover,
seemed to be firing quickly and at at random. Deeter screamed,
``What are you doing!''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Rosa, a junior, was shot in the right ankle. Jason Cheek
and Brian Barnhardt were shot in the buttocks. Cania Collins was
shot in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Hoy thought the first shot was a firecracker. The second
sounded real enough, and the third shot sliced into his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to run, but it started hurting pretty bad,'' said
Hoy, 18. ``I took off my boot and blood was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and parents got him and the other injured students to
the front lawn, from where they were rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished shooting, the former Boy Scout dropped his
rifle and backed his way outside the building. He pulled out a
handgun and put it in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant principal approached him, saying, ``Let me have the
gun,'' said senior Joe Watts, who watched from a window. The teen
handed the revolver to him. If any doubt remains that school
shootings have become a trend, this incident ended the debate. That
the shootings happened in metro Atlanta, in a school known for
parental involvement and good academics, has aroused fear in many
parents, students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are no longer immune to guns, drugs and violence,''
said Pam Riley, executive director of the Center for the Prevention
of School Violence in North Carolina. ``But I don't think that all
schools should panic and close. Then the terrorism will win out.
What we need to do is provide ways for kids to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Heritage High School was named one of the top 10 schools in the
metro area by U.S. News and World Report. About 80 percent of
Heritage graduates go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   After the carnage at Columbine, Heritage was among many metro
Atlanta schools who felt the reverberations. Letters were sent out
to parents assuring them the school was safe. But, like many
schools, Heritage has seen numerous bomb threats in recent weeks.
The school has video surveillance cameras in the hallways and an
armed sheriff's deputy on duty.
</P>
<P>
   With TV crews broadcasting the frightened faces of Heritage
students, a collective angst swept across many schools and
households. Principals scrambled to figure out what to do next and
how to prevent a similar occurrence before the end of the school
year. Some parents, already in a heightened state of concern since
Columbine, have suggested simply canceling the rest of the school
year, bringing down the curtain on a year brimming with fear.
Others called for metal detectors and more police in the schools,
outcries that have been echoed for weeks following Columbine and
the spate of bomb threats.

JAPAN'S FINANCIAL WATCHDOG EXAMINES FOREIGN FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial
watchdog, has begun taking a serious look at the foreign financial
community here after having scrutinized the books of Japan's major
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials swooped into the Tokyo offices of Lehman
Brothers in a sudden raid on Wednesday. The agency has also been
investigating some of Credit Suisse First Boston's activities here
for the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly what the agency has been investigating at
Credit Suisse First Boston. The agency and the firm have declined
to comment on the nature of the inquiry. Thursday the agency
declined to comment on its sweep of Lehman, first reported Thursday
in Japanese newspapers. Lehman said through a spokesman that it
believed the action was a routine audit and declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisory agency has been working hard to establish its
credentials as a tough, fair-minded regulator of a financial
community that had grown accustomed to lenient treatment from the
Ministry of Finance, its former overseer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unusual for Finance Ministry inspectors to call
financial institutions ahead of an inspection to announce their
estimated time of arrival and request documents.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the foreign financial community here believe that the
Financial Supervisory Agency is looking into whether some firms
used transactions involving derivative securities to help clients
conceal losses. Those clients included the bankrupt Long-Term
Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Credit Suisse First Boston, the agency also
appears to be examining whether the firm's employees sought to
impede its investigation by shredding and hiding documents and
asking colleagues to withhold information.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston has suspended with pay its global
head of compliance, Anthony Blunden, and Shinji Yamada, head of
Credit Suisse Financial Products in Japan, and it has held back
bonuses for several other employees in Tokyo, pending the results
of its own internal investigation and the agency's inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Lehman, which has a large derivatives business
here, is suspected of similarly aiding Japanese companies and
financial institutions in dressing up their income statements and
balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign financial services firms have been anticipating tougher
inspections for some time. The Financial Supervisory Agency has
conducted a sweeping review of Japanese banks and brokerage firms
over the last year, so it was only logical to assume the agency
would examine foreign firms as well, at least to give the
impression of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   After news broke of the agency's investigation into Credit
Suisse First Boston, the investment banking arm of the big Swiss
bank Credit Suisse Group, American firms went on alert, virtually
certain that the agency would not single out a European firm
without also aiming at an American one.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, bankers said Thursday, Lehman's name had
arisen as the likely target, largely because of its extensive
operations in derivatives, which are complex securities that derive
value from something else, such as stocks, bonds, currencies or
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign bankers have reacted to the agency's searches with mild
interest partly because they hope the process will provide some
clarity to what they regard as substantial gray areas in Japanese
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will turn into a learning experience for all
of us,'' said an executive at one foreign firm.

DENTS, DINGS ARE FEW IN THIS CARR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oba Carr is the latest in a lengthy line of Oscar De
La Hoya foils, a 9-to-1 underdog considered to be nothing more than
a footnote to De La Hoya's planned September showdown with Felix
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are some vital differences between Carr and so many
of those hapless De La Hoya victims in recent years who were
preordained losers before the opening-round bell even rang.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike a Jorge Paez, or a James Leija, or a
Genaro Hernandez, or a Rafael Ruelas, Carr isn't an undersized
target with a brittle jaw. He's 5-9, has a 72-inch reach, and has
campaigned as a welterweight since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For another, unlike a Hector (Macho) Camacho or a Julio Cesar
Chavez, Carr hasn't celebrated too many birthdays for his violent
sport. He's a mere 27.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, unlike a Patrick Charpentier, or a David Kamau, or
a Giorgio Campanella, Carr actually can fight. He has a 48-2-1
record with 28 knockouts that includes victories over such noble
men as Frankie Randall, Livingstone Bramble and Derrell Coley.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are a couple of negatives about Carr, or you can be
sure De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, would never have allowed him
to face his biggest money-maker in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was stopped by Felix Trinidad in eight rounds five years
ago and lost a majority decision to Ike Quartey in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr did dispatch Trinidad to the mat and, anyway, who other
than Pernell Whitaker and Macho Camacho doesn't get knocked out by
Trinidad? Carr also decked Quartey, and their rumble was so close
that one judge called it a draw.
</P>
<P>
   So, while nobody the fight aficionados, the oddsmakers and the
media is giving Carr even a modest chance of upsetting De La Hoya
Saturday night in the first major event ever staged at the new
Mandalay Bay Events Center, Oba Carr himself naturally envisions a
stunning outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at me as being a peon,'' says Carr with
emotion. ``They treat me with total disrespect. A lot of people are
talking more about De La Hoya's fight with Trinidad than about his
fight with me. And that's a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind at all that I'm going to beat
Oscar. I'm definitely in the best shape of my life both spiritually
and physically. I've gone through some trials and tribulations
during my career, but those are over with. My head is clear, and
I've had the best eight weeks of training that I've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel my speed and elusiveness are superior to
Oscar's. I don't think he's ever faced anyone as quick as me, or
even could hit as hard as me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike Quartey hits you with one punch at a time, but I can hit
you in bunches, three, four at a time. Oscar has never been
attacked the way I will attack him. I have great respect for Oscar
De La Hoya. But I have even greater respect for Oba Carr.''
</P>
<P>
   As do so many fighters, Oba Carr has endured his share of
promotional and managerial miseries, having fought under the banner
of Don King Productions for most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, King forced Oba's father, Eddie Carr, out
of the picture as Oba's trainer,'' relates Tom Loeffler, Carr's Los
Angeles-based manager whose Mouthpiece Productions landed Carr a
K-Swiss TV commercial. ``I know most father-son relationships don't
work in boxing, but Oba definitely has been a better fighter during
his career when trained by his father. And his father is training
him once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a bachelor who still lives in his native Detroit, will
earn a mere $350,000 for endangering his health against De La Hoya,
whose purse is expected to exceed $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big money will come to me after I beat De La Hoya,'' says
Carr, whose fistic inspiration came from having his bike stolen
when he was 6. ``You know, to be honest with you, I find it
insulting the way some people are looking at this fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are some people out there who feel I have what it
takes to win, but there are others who think this fight already has
been settled. No fight is settled until you get in the ring and
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe Oscar De La Hoya's wily promoter,
Bob Arum, would never match De La Hoya against someone capable of
scoring an upset with the multi-million dollar match with Trinidad
looming on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that Carr's fiercest fighting days
were left behind in those punishing brawls he had with Bramble and
Trinidad and Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that Carr will crumble the first
time De La Hoya catches him with one of his wicked left hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Oba Carr admits such unflattering rhetoric has been grating on
his nerves in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I have anything to prove as a fighter,'' he says.
``I've fought the best welterweights in the world, and held my own
against them all. I'm a much better fighter now than I was when I
fought Trinidad and Quartey. Much more experienced, much more
dedicated to my craft. Like I said, I have nothing to prove, but I
will prove after I beat Oscar De La Hoya that a lot of people don't
know what they're talking about.''

HUMAN GENOME PURSUIT IS BIOLOGY'S MANHATTAN PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Behind the hoopla about genes, biotechnology and the
coming revolution in medicine, is a labor-intensive, massive and
contentious scientific effort that is building the foundation for
all the hopes and promises.
</P>
<P>
   It's been called biology's Manhattan Project or the equivalent
of humankind's race to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Human Genome Project. And the goal is to
identify the 100,000 or so genes that reside somewhere within the 3
billion ``letters'' of DNA in the human body _ the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Launched nearly a decade ago by the National Institutes of
Health and the U.S. Department of Energy, the goal was to create a
public database of the human genome for all of science _ a
periodical table for biology.
</P>
<P>
   That's still the aim, but times change. Today, the public effort
has competition from the private sector. There's money in them
genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to create an extremely complicated situation in
which there's a risk the public sector will start to lose control
over this information,'' said Dr. Maynard Olson, a world-renowned
molecular biologist and head of the University of Washington's
genome center.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's team at the UW is one of eight centers designated by the
National Institutes of Health to work on the public effort, which
is also aided by Britain's Sanger Center and the Wellcome Trust of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with the public side is Dr. J. Craig Venter and his
company, Celera Corp., backed by scientific instrument maker Perkin
Elmer. Perkin Elmer makes some of the machines used to perform
rapid, automated DNA ``sequencing'' operations. The Human Genome
Project depends on such machines to identify the linear sequence of
all 3 billion units _ called ``bases'' _ of human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, in turn, depend upon Dr. Philip Green, a UW expert
in computational biology who collaborates with Olson. Green and his
colleagues wrote the software, called Phred, which is crucial to
distinguishing one base from another.
</P>
<P>
   While the UW's team is among the smaller of the NIH centers
working to decode the human genome, Olson and Green are widely
recognized as leaders in emphasizing sequencing accuracy and data
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, especially at some of these bioinformatic
companies, are looking to exploit this stuff based on existing
technologies,'' Green said. ``To me, the most interesting task is
in analyzing the sequence information.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter is a former NIH researcher who moved to the private
sector in 1992 to pursue genome sequencing free of government
restraints he thought were impeding progress.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with hundreds of automated sequencers, Venter and Perkin
Elmer announced a year ago that Celera would complete the genome
privately by the year 2001 _ well before the public project's
expected completion date of 2005. Venter claimed that he was doing
this for the sake of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sequence information provides a starting point from which
the real research into thousands of diseases that have a genetic
basis can begin,'' he told Congress last year. ``The sooner we can
get to this starting point, the sooner we can begin to see a payoff
in ultimately improving human health.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is a financial payoff. If Celera and Perkin Elmer are
first to identify a gene sequence with implications for drug
development, they can file a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Venter initially promised to make the private genome data
available immediately but is now saying Celera will release it
quarterly. He also said that the company will charge a fee for
access to the data and market its database commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who testified at the same hearing in May 1998, has become
Venter's foil, arguing that his frantic private effort to claim
genetic turf is contrary to the purpose of the project and will
result in poor quality data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to spend the next 20 years sorting out problems
in the genome or are we going to do the job right the first time?''
Olson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has certainly spurred the NIH to speed up its efforts, he
said. The question, Olson said, is if speeding things up is in the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk here for the publicly funded program is one of
overreaction,'' Olson told Congress. Infuriating Venter, he
testified that he would stake his reputation on the prediction that
the hasty Celera-Perkin Elmer approach would produce ``low quality
data'' with garbled sequences and more than ``100,000 serious
gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter, asked about Olson's complaint, responded that it was
``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at Celera have recently complained about a delay in getting
an updated version of Phred, Green's program, suggesting the delay
may be aimed at hurting Venter's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Green, however, has said this is because of technical
constraints and noted that the delay will affect the public effort
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Manhattan Project or NASA's moon shot, the Human
Genome Project is often portrayed as a public-private partnership.
Olson said he's concerned it's now become more of a public-private
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, research in biology is being funded by the
private sector,'' he said. ``I'm not against that. I actually
advocated, early on in the genome project, that the federal
government pay the private sector to do much of this research.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to efficiency and large-scale production, Olson
said, the private sector is better than universities or government.
But when the private sector both pays for and does the research, he
said, they expect to own the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why we have publicly supported science,''
Olson said.

GOVERNING PARTY IN NEPAL GAINS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal _ Political stability may have finally come to
this small Himalayan nation after elections that concluded this
week. The governing Nepali Congress seems on its way to a
parliamentary majority, ending 4 and a half years of fractious
coalitions that brought five governments to one of the world's
youngest democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Nepal is a landlocked kingdom of 23 million people between two
giant neighbors, China and India. In 1990, King Birendra gave up
absolute power in favor of a constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But multiparty elections since then have failed to provide a
clear winner that could maintain power. Instead, oddly assembled,
ill-starred alliances became routine.
</P>
<P>
   The latest election, held in two stages on May 3 and May 17, was
needed after the Nepali Congress, made up of social democrats, had
a falling out with the Marxist-Leninists.
</P>
<P>
   The Marxist-Leninists are a splinter group, broken free from the
United Marxist-Leninists, who were deemed to be insufficiently
anti-Indian and anti-American.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, victors were declared for 173 of the Parliament's 205
seats. The Nepali Congress has won 96 and leads in at least six
others, according to the Election Commission. The United
Marxist-Leninists have won 60 seats, the Marxist-Leninists zero and
various other parties 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results show that people are becoming more politically
mature,'' said Bishwa Nath Upadhyay, a retired chief justice of the
Supreme Court and the main framer of the constitution. ``They
realize that a hung Parliament can't be an effective government.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before the vote, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
said he would step aside and allow his ally Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai to take over. The two men, both in their 70s, have been
rivals and the move was seen as a display of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Vote tabulations will continue for a few more days. The process
is arduous. Some ballot boxes must be hand-carried across mountain
paths in two-day journeys.
</P>
<P>
   At district counting centers, every paper ballot is unfolded as
officials of each party look on. Only 40 percent of Nepalese adults
are literate. Voters put a stamp of ink next to symbols on the
ballot. Officials commonly quarrel over every smudged mark.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the election has gone smoothly and honestly,
according to U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   Maoist insurgents had demanded a boycott of the vote, but the
turnout exceeded 60 percent, with many people willing to spend
hours in line.

<P>
   At graduation Friday night (May 21) at Hobbton High School in
rural North Carolina, Principal Stewart Hobbs will wear a
bulletproof vest. He will be guarded by a sheriff's deputy, and an
expert marksman will be posted on the water tower that overlooks
the football field where the seniors will receive their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the ceremony will have to pass through a metal
detector, and the crowd will be peppered with plainclothes officers
on the lookout for a potential killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt anything will happen, but right now, the way things
are, you just can't take any chances,'' Hobbs said in an interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs's precautions _ taken in response to a death threat
telephoned to the local sheriff's department on Monday _ seem a
fitting punctuation mark to a school year that can't end soon
enough for students, teachers, administrators and parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., a sense of foreboding has enveloped schools
across the country. There are nagging fears and whispered worries
that the angry kid, or the outcast kid, or the quiet kid, or the
heartbroken kid, or the kid no one would ever expect, might
suddenly erupt in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Just such an event happened Thursday in Conyers, Ga., 25 miles
east of Atlanta, where a 15-year-old sophomore who reportedly had
recently broken up with his girlfriend shot six fellow students
then surrendered his gun and cried. None of the injuries appeared
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the one-month anniversary of the Columbine High School
shootings that ended 15 lives, the incident reinforced the growing
_ some would say exaggerated _ perception that schools must now be
considered danger zones.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's shootings, those fears had been fueled
primarily by a rash of bomb threats that emptied schools and
attracted widespread media attention, which by some accounts
created a cycle of even more copycat threats.
</P>
<P>
   Before Columbine _ where the two killers came armed with more
than 50 explosives _ school bomb threats were usually ignored by
the media in the belief that publicizing such events only
encourages more. There is no way to tell whether such threats have
increased since the April 20 massacre, or whether the public is
simply learning how frequently they occur. But authorities on
school violence said Thursday that the perception of greater risk
seems to reflect a troubling reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're all wrestling with is the question of
where did all these crazies come from at one time? There's a
feeling among some people that they were always out there, and were
just waiting for a psychological release like Columbine so they
could carry out their plans,'' said Peter Blauvelt, president of
the National Alliance for Safe Schools in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are going to need to spend this summer trying to
develop strategies to take a hard look at their populations,
because they clearly need additional help,'' Blauvelt added.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, authorities say, they have no doubt the Colorado
shootings unleashed a murderous plan. The incident involved four
boys arrested last week in Port Huron, Mich., for allegedly
plotting to kill dozens of their schoolmates. Afterward, a
prosecutor said the investigation showed the youths' goal was ``to
kill more people than in Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing, the local school board president, David
Devendorf, pleaded for two of the suspects, both 13, to be kept in
custody. ``You can't believe the fear out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations from Columbine also have been felt in Allen,
Texas, where school administrators in the Dallas suburb went so far
as to cancel the last two weeks of classes after a dozen bomb
threats in a single week. Criticized by some parents for
capitulating to terror, school officials rescinded the closure and
decided to hold some classes. Still, some parents were steaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got overly alarmed and sent a message to kids that they
couldn't control what happens in school,'' said Al Burke, whose
twin daughters Jackie and Jessica are seniors at Allen High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the overreaction can do as much damage as the
threat itself,'' said Burke, who runs a sports ticket agency. ``I
don't think we should be sending our kids to school in the morning
and telling them to watch out for the bomb that might get dropped
on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   No part of the country has remained untouched. In Lake County,
Fla., the school board said a dog trained to sniff out guns and
bombs would roam school hallways next year. A bomb threat in
Phoenix kept 1,700 students home on a test day; a student who
allegedly bragged about the feat was suspended. Maryland schools
were paralyzed by a rumor that May 10 would be a day of violence.
And in the nation's capital, all but one of the city's 17 high
schools were evacuated on April 26 because of a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts schools also have been beset by numerous bomb and
massacre threats. In Cohasset, for instance, someone scrawled ``May
6 you will die'' on a boys' bathroom wall; nothing happened, but a
quarter of the middle and high school students stayed home that
day. Boston schools responded by establishing an anonymous tip line
for students to report fears of impending violence.
</P>
<P>
   Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses
by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the
wake of Columbine. They said the Colorado killings ratcheted up
fears because of the amount of firepower and planning that went
into the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Littleton, with the mass destruction involved and the
knowledge that such materials are available to students, the stakes
were raised,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the
National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had felt like schools in the suburbs were insulated, and
the message now is that it can and does happen where we least
expect it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears, authorities hasten to note that schools are
extremely safe. Historically, fewer than 1 percent of homicides
involving school-age children have occurred in or around schools,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. Since 1992, the
annual death toll from school shootings has ranged from 20 to 55,
according to the National School Safety Center, including suicides.
There have been 24 school shooting deaths so far this year,
including the 15 in Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne McDaniel, research director at the Center for the
Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., said the overall
knowledge that schools are safe might have led to a sense of
complacency before Columbine, despite past school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become good at identifying warning signs, but I think in
some cases we're still too slow to respond. That's a sign of
complacency,'' she said. However, McDaniel added, the response to
Columbine makes it unlikely schools will take danger signals
lightly anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Yoxall, spokeswoman for the National PTA, said her
organization intends to use that attention to focus resources and
energy on the problem before the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to keep this issue at the forefront of concern
for all of American society. Until we are really willing to address
the problems of school violence as a society, we're not going to be
able to effect lasting change,'' Yoxall said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hobbs, the North Carolina principal targetted by an
anonymous death threat, he said the precautions he takes will not
end when the last diploma is handed out.
</P>
<P>
   A new policy at his school calls for all doors to be locked
except for the main entrance; all bathrooms have been closed off
except for one; more lights have been installed outside the school;
and a wooded area behind the school is being cleared, to prevent
potential attacks from being lauched from the dense cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like every day I walk into this school I put my life on
the line, and sometimes I sit there and wonder why I do that,''
Hobbs said. ``But it's the good days and it's these kids who come
back down the road and thank you, and that's when you know why you
keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a group of about 20 high-spirited seniors crowded
around him, begging for extra tickets to the graduation.

CLINTON STRESSES NATO'S DETERMINATION IN OUSTING YUGOSLAV FORCES
FROM KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton insisted Thursday that NATO
remained ``united in our determination to persist as long as it
takes,'' to oust Slobodan Milosevic's forces from Kosovo and return
ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials projected a portrait of unity, despite
signs of division, as Russian-led diplomatic efforts intensified
along with the air raids over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who received a briefing from his national security team
at the White House, said the military campaign ``is working'' and
Milosevic has no choice but to accept terms set by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day we hear reports of desertion in the Serbian army,
dissension in Belgrade, unrest in Serbian communities. President
Milosevic should know that he cannot change the fundamental terms
that we have outlined because they are simply what is required for
the Kosovars to go home and live in peace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether `ethnic cleansing' will be
reversed, but how much of the military will be destroyed because of
his intransigence along the way, how much damage will be done to
Serbia because of his delays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came as envoys from Russia, Finland and the
United States gathered in Moscow to review reports that Milosevic
was prepared to accept the peace terms but wanted to negotiate with
the United Nations. Also, allied war planes stepped up their
bombing raids despite reports that a stray missile struck a
Belgrade hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke briefly about Kosovo when he announced his
intention to nominate Gen. Hugh Shelton to a second term as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president failed to clarify comments made earlier
this week that the use of NATO ground troops remained an option if
the air campaign failed.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of using ground troops or pausing the bombing have
been divisive ones for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook met with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in a display of solidarity and said there was no
division.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has pressed the United States to join its call for an
invasion force into Kosovo. Germany and Italy oppose ground troops,
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder this week said there would
be no ground invasion. And Italy called for a halt to the bombing
while negotiations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook told reporters ``there is absolutely no strain between
Washington and London'' on the issue of troops. ``We agree totally
on the objectives. We are totally behind the campaign,'' Cook said,
prior to meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cook pressed for preparations to begin for a security
force that would ensure the safety of 1.6 million Kosovar refugees
on their return home. NATO has insisted that Milosevic accept an
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo as one of the peace
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said it was vital to build on the success of the air
campaign. ``We have to prepare so that we are ready to take
advantage of that success and take the refugees home. As the
president (Clinton) said, no option is off the table and that
planning goes ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright appeared earlier in the day on Capitol Hill where she
told members of a Senate appropriation panel, ``We all want this
confrontation to end, but we should have the patience and spine to
ensure that it does so on the right terms.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the NATO position remains that all Serb forces must
withdraw from Kosovo although she added that there has been a
discussion of allowing some Serb forces to remain around the
Orthodox Christian holy sites in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She said the alliance ``is united in its goals'' against an
isolated and unjust regime. ``We are making progress, and we will
persist and we will prevail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared before the panel bearing a videotape made by a
Kosovar Albanian who recorded the aftermath of a massacre by Serb
troops. She also said the NATO air campaign has destroyed one-third
of Yugoslavia's military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded the objectives may be simply stated but ``not
easily achieved.'' She said the removal of Milosevic from power is
not one of the objectives although the United States believes
Yugoslavia would be better off with him gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to stay very focused on what the objective of
this campaign is, and that is to break the back of his military,
the grip that they have over Kosovo can be ended,'' she said.
</P>

RUSSIAN ENVOY HINTS AT PROGRESS IN KOSOVO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Negotiations toward a political settlement over Serbia
seemed to inch forward Thursday when Russian mediator Victor
Chernomyrdin met outside Moscow with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Russia registered its unhappiness with
NATO by breaking off its military contacts with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The parties to the talks here have disclosed nothing about their
details. But when Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister, was asked
earlier Thursday whether there was news, he replied, ``Yes, good
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had just returned from Belgrade, where he spent
seven hours in talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia. He and Talbott had been in Helsinki before that,
talking for two days with Ahtisaari, the European Union's envoy to
the Kosovo talks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have also said that the talks are making
progress, but that the sides are at odds over the makeup of an
armed international force that would be sent to Kosovo to enforce
any political agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news service Thursday quoted Russian officials as
saying that Milosevic and the envoys also disagree over the scope
of any mandate to be given the international bodies and envoys who
will negotiate the political future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (In Belgrade, Yugoslav officials said the talks with
Chernomyrdin had gone well. Goran Matic, an influential minister
without portfolio, said in an interview, ``I think we can expect a
political settlement in the next week.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops and paramilitary forces have driven hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo, and there
are reports of mass killings and rapes. NATO has pledged to
continue bombing Yugoslavia until the troops withdraw and Kosovar
Albanians are allowed to return under protection of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected those conditions, but aside from
insisting that Kosovo remain a part of Yugoslavia, his precise
demands are not publicly known. In recent days, Western officials
have suggested that he is increasingly willing to agree to a
political settlement, as long as it does not brand Yugoslavia the
``loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has called NATO the aggressor and demanded an end to the
bombing as a condition for any agreement. Thursday the Foreign
Ministry accused the Western allies of ``the most blatant violation
of the Geneva Convention on the protection of victims of war'' in
connection with reports of the accidental bombing of a Belgrade
hospital overnight. Serbia says four civilians died in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Defense Ministry said Thursday that it had suspended
all military contacts with NATO, recalled all Russian forces from
military training in NATO countries and reduced other exchanges
with the alliance and its members until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Moscow seems to have gained a central role in
fashioning an end to the conflict. President Boris Yeltsin talked
by telephone with Ahtisaari on Thursday; a spokesman said Yeltsin
had called for an end to the ``barbarous'' air attacks on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also met in Moscow with a
United Nations special envoy on Kosovo, Slovakian Foreign Minister
Eduard Kukan. Ivanov is to meet Friday with another U.N. envoy,
former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who had an active role in
ending the fighting in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Russian officials are to fly to Bonn, where
another session of officials from the seven major industrial powers
and Russia _ the so-called Group of 8 _ will try to narrow
differences over Kosovo. Those talks are to focus on drafting a
proposal for a Kosovo settlement that can be presented to the U.N.
Security Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already drafted its version of a resolution, Ivanov
said Thursday, but he added that it did not cover a number of
differences among the negotiators.

 &HT;    Bound pages up to challenges of the cyber age?
 &HT;    EDs: Embaroged For Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1900, even the best science-fiction writers couldn't have
envisioned the incredible changes that would transform the book
world in the next 100 years. Surely few would have predicted
mass-produced paperbacks so inexpensive that anyone could afford
them. Or books on tape. Or books that could be read on hand-held
computers. Or instant books or Internet bookstores or mega-best
sellers by authors who are paid millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After so many changes in the 20th century, what can we expect in
the 21st? Will books as we know them become as obsolete as
Babylonian clay tablets?
</P>
<P>
   Author Tom Wolfe, a keen observer of social trends, doesn't
think so. From his home in New York, Wolfe says he simply cannot
imagine a world in which readers peruse a best-selling novel on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to scroll the pages,'' Wolfe says. ``People got over
scrolls 2,000 years ago. Or you have to download the pages from a
computer. With a book, you don't need to plug it in, and the pages
are already downloaded. The technology of the book is fabulous.
Just because it doesn't have a wire attached to it doesn't affect
its power. The book will continue to be a paramount medium of the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Books will always be important, Wolfe says, because they provide
a view that television and films cannot duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films are very clumsy about notation of status,'' he says. ``A
Gucci loafer can look the same as an ordinary loafer. Unless a
character stops and says, `Look at these Gucci loafers,' the
audience is not going to get it. The movies can only show decadence
in broad strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Books indeed will be around next century, agrees Larry Ashmead,
a senior editor at HarperCollins in New York, but the kind of books
being published is likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious fiction and literary fiction are going to be more
important than what we now call commercial fiction,'' Ashmead says.
``I think literary fiction is going to become commercial fiction.
People are raising their standards and buying good writing. Some of
the old standbys like the Danielle Steels and Tom Clancys are going
to be considered old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more movie and television tie-ins to books, he
predicts, and more books sold online. Not only are Internet
companies such as Amazon.com helping sell new books _ 2 percent of
total sales last year, according to a recent study _ but they're
also increasing the sales of older books by suggesting other titles
the buyer might like to try.
</P>
<P>
   Other trends Ashmead foresees are an increase in sales of
serious nonfiction books and electronic books and the growth of
regional publishers. Because of mergers, he says, there may be only
five or six major publishers left in New York in the first part of
the next century. The void may well be filled by smaller, regional
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Perry, president of Marietta's Longstreet Press and of the
Publishers Association of the South, agrees with Ashmead that small
to midsize publishers will continue to see a higher quality of
material than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is cracking the market that is being dominated by
chain bookstores,'' Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   Perry envisions a day when bookstores will follow the example of
furniture retailers and stock only one or two copies of each book
as samples. Next-day delivery will be made from warehouses in the
suburbs where the rent per square foot is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage to small and midsize publishers is not going to
be so much an increased advantage in retail outlets but an
increased advantage in Internet sales. On the Internet, we can't
get cut out of the game because of a shortage of floor space.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the next century likely will be more books on
demand, and more books published in smaller numbers for a niche
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we can't print less than 4,000 or 5,000 books and
price them competitively,'' Perry says. ``But with the new
technology, we can publish 500 copies of a book and charge $35 for
the book because the people who want it are not price-sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing almost everyone in the industry agrees on is the
challenge facing nonchain bookstores. According to Richard Howorth,
owner of Square Books in Oxford, Miss., and president of the
American Booksellers Association, the number of independent
booksellers has declined 45 percent since 1991. What does that mean
to consumers? Despite some publishers' predictions of more interest
in ``serious'' literary books, Howorth worries that less
independent competition will mean even more celebrity-written books
and blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more publishing firms merge or purchase each other, and
more bookselling firms integrate with publishers and wholesalers,
and the book business grows more removed from those who care about
books beyond their function as commodity, the more a healthy
reading society, and democracy, are endangered,'' Howorth says.
</P>
<P>
   To help counteract their dwindling numbers, independent
booksellers are launching a national campaign called Book Sense.
The effort will include an Internet site, BookSense.com, that will
enable customers to buy books at competitive prices from
independent bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Not all independent booksellers foresee a situation where
everyone buys their books on the Internet as salvation in the next
century. Some insist there will always be browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer-related book business is going to be there, but
there will always be people who want to be out there with other
book lovers,'' says Barbara Babbitt Kaufman, who owns several
Chapter 11 bookstores. ``Some experts predicted the movie business
would suffer with videos and pay-per-view. Instead, the movie
business is better than ever. Why? Because people want to be with
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Headline goes right here for 30'' story for books page
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology of the book is fabulous. Just because it
doesn't have a wire attached to it doesn't affect its power. The
book will continue to be a paramount medium of the 21st century.''

FIRST COMMERCIAL LAUNCH PAD DEBUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. _ In one giant leap for
private enterprise, the nation's first commercially owned and
operated space launch pad has opened here.
</P>
<P>
   The first nonmilitary, non-NASA launching operation will allow
small companies, universities and even the Air Force to book
passage for their payloads with a private outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The pad, which is at Vandenberg Air Force Base, was built by
Lompoc-based Spaceport Systems International and ITT Industries. It
has exhaust ducts resembling a skateboard ramp and a surprisingly
low-tech steel ring comprising the nucleus of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The launch pad stands as one of several emerging public-private
facilities around the nation, all poised to launch the estimated
2,000 new satellites needing rides into space during the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The launch site, which was unveiled Tuesday along Vandenberg's
rugged windswept coastline, was heralded as a milestone for the
nation's emerging commercial space industry.
</P>
<P>
   For two men in particular, Earl Severo and Don Smith, the day
was the culmination of more than seven years of dreams, deals and
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   As an Air Force officer in the 1980s, Severo was in charge of
Vandenberg's doomed West Coast space shuttle project. Its home at
the massive Space Launch Complex-6 stands abandoned as a
multibillion-dollar remnant within sight of the new SSI pad.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who now champions space education, was once in charge of
the Lompoc-based Western Commercial Space Center, the prime
advocate during the days when Santa Barbara County was trying to
build its reputation as a commercial space hub. In 1995, Smith was
a crucial player during the seven-month negotiation of the 25-year
lease for the 100-acre piece of Air Force property containing the
launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, both men expected their venture would bring up to
24 launches a year by now. But the project was delayed by various
problems _ with personalities, funding and finding customers.
</P>
<P>
   Severo presided over the ceremony Tuesday. ``It's a great day,''
Severo said, speaking of the venture as a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was in the audience, said, ``I'm very, very happy
that it is finished to the point it can sustain a launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although SSI touts itself as the first commercial launch pad, it
was financed by some funding from the state and federal government.
But the bulk of the estimated $20 million needed to build the
facility came from SSI and ITT, which formed a limited partnership
in the project. SSI is responsible for bringing customers and their
projects to the site at Vandenberg and putting the satellites into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As government budgets decline, commercial launch facilities
can play a crucial role,'' in providing the government with
``reliable, safe and cost-effective'' launch services, said Marv
Sambur, president of ITT Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sambur estimated that by about 2003 the site could accommodate
two launches a month.
</P>
<P>
   For SSI, the test of its future viability comes in the September
launch of an Air Force Minotaur rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Minotaur takes its name from the mythological creature that
has the torso of a man and the head of a bull. In the rocket's
case, it is created from the lower stages of a Minuteman 2
intercontinental ballistic missile and the upper half of a Pegasus
rocket. The Minotaur will carry into orbit two satellites, built by
the U.S. Air Force Academy and Weber State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the greatest confidence in this launch site,'' said Jim
Ford, director of Space and Missile Test and Evaluation, who is in
charge of the Minotaur launch. ``I have no doubt it will be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minotaur is one of several rockets under development
designed to lower the cost of putting a satellite into orbit. Such
advances mean the likelihood of more users, especially now that
there's a commercial launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   The Minotaur is expected to be able to put a satellite into
orbit for about $12 million, considerably less than other types of
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Coleman Jr., president of the Universities Space
Research Association, praised the site Tuesday as the potential
home for numerous university-built satellites. He, like other
customers, will be closely watching the September launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the ride is still the all-important thing,'' said
Coleman, who is based at UCLA's Institute of Geophysics and
Planetary Physics.

 &HT;    `Phantom Menace' breaks one-day record at box office
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's $28.542 million and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' set a one-day box
office record Wednesday, topping the previous single-day high of
$26.1 million set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997.
George Lucas' film could be on track to set a new five-day record.
Some say the film could earn $100 million to $140 million by
weekend's end.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 metro Atlantans saw ``Phantom Menace'' on Wednesday
at Regal Cinemas' new Hollywood 24 megaplex, making it the chain's
No. 6 theater in the nation. (Regal is also the largest theater
chain in the world.) In Cobb County (Ga.), General Cinemas' Parkway
Pointe finished in that theater chain's top eight in the nation in
attendance for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' fanatics are already deep in new trivia:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the movie's big Senate scene, for instance, fans have
spotted a group of Spielberg-like E.T.s in the screen's lower left
corner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Massachusetts, General Cinemas' Framingham 14 megaplex near
Boston had multiple prints of ``Phantom Menace,'' but one was
different than what the rest of the nation's moviegoers saw.
Instead of one character getting cut in half by a light saber and
falling, this particular print showed the character falling intact.
The print was screened five times Wednesday before 20th Century Fox
replaced it Thursday morning, said Zvi Cole, General Cinemas'
Northeast marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans paid to see the film more than once so they could see
that scene both ways, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Internet's www.jedinet
</P>
<P>
   .com, run by John Benson, of Dallas, Ga., was likely the first
Web site in the world to post a new clock on its prequel page
counting down in days, hours, minutes and seconds that there are
now 1,093 days to go _ until ``Episode 2.''

 &HT;    Film's mission: To seek out Trekkies
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They stand in line for hours, dress up as their favorite
characters and spend fortunes on the collectible tie-in products.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking ``Star Wars'' fanatics, but that alter-
</P>
<P>
   nate-universe fan base known as ``Trekkies.'' That's the name of
Roger Nygard's documentary, which looks at the TV franchise's
ardent followers with a tone that fuses affection and deadpan
satire. Most of the time, Nygard and game narrator-interviewer
Denise Crosby (from ``The Next Generation'') let the fans speak for
themselves, often with unintentionally hilarious results.
</P>
<P>
   Such as fussy, 14-year-old Gabriel Koerner, a Trek convention
veteran, who rolls his eyes at the shoddy needlework of the friend
who stitched his uniform. Or the Florida dentist and his wife whose
practice is completely Trek-themed. Or Barbara Adams, the Arkansas
woman who made headlines as a Whitewater juror who wore her Star
Fleet uniform to court.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who dress up their children in Star Fleet
clothes, as well as their pets. For some, ``Star Trek'' is a true
obsession. For others, you get the sense that it's just a
convenient rack to hang their kinks on. Such as the woman whose
devotion to actor Brent Spiner borders on stalking, as she walks
out onto her deck to stare in the direction of his Los Angeles
home. (She calls these timeouts ``Brent-breaks.'')
</P>
<P>
   A little of this goes a long way. If you're not a Trekkie
yourself (or find the species amusing), you might be like the
several viewers who fled the theater early during a preview
screening. But besides nutty character studies, ``Trekkies''
includes some interesting factoids, revealing interviews with cast
members from the various versions of the show, and a perspective on
the series' role as social commentary, not just science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``the Force'' entered our vocabulary, this show
popularized the catch phrase ``Live long and prosper.'' Those words
seem to be the lucky mantra of the ``Star Trek'' franchise, which
just keeps on trekkin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trekkies''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Roger Nygard, with Denise Crosby, ``Star Trek''
stars, and lots of people in costume. Rated PG for mild sexual and
drug references. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Star Trek'' groupies get a tribute and a
roasting, all in the same movie.

   FICTION: FORM, FUNCTION
</P>
<P>
   If it is the names that change, it is also the forms. The
naturalistic novel flourished, then waned, then flourished anew.
The psychological novel, introduced almost single-handedly in
English by Henry James, took new forms _ some of which would seem
mutations that might better have been aborted _ and the novel we
always apologized for reading, the detective mystery, achieved
something of an apogee. The works of Raymond Chandler are
memorialized in the Library of America series, and a handful of
other mystery novelists, notably Dashiell Hammett, are recognized
as genuine writers and not slightly disreputable hacks pounding out
pulp fiction in a seedy hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of such writers, the paperback came into its own.
What had once been the dime novel, and later the detective novel,
today is the handsomely packaged choice of readers of every stripe.
Indeed, if the century can be called anything, it's the Century of
the Paperback.
</P>
<P>
   But this is largely a commercial index. A more thoroughgoing
study would reveal not only who writes fiction but who reads it. By
the last quarter of the century, women were writing as many novels
as men, and, whatever the cause and effect, they were also reading
more novels than men.
</P>
<P>
   And a generation after Ellison's ``Invisible Man,'' Americans
lengthened their shelves to admit the works of black writers,
beginning with James Baldwin but eventually including Morrison,
James Alan McPherson and others.
</P>
<P>
   What's significant about this is that black writers are read not
solely by blacks. By the 1990s, to paraphrase Henry Louis Gates,
the literature of black Americans had become a coherent body of
work unto itself and, at the same time, part of the larger, white
tradition. It had achieved both racial identity and integration.
</P>
<P>
   The flowering worked in other ways as well. American readers
became acquainted with literature in translation. From South
America came writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorge Borges
and Mario Vargas Llosa, all standbys in every Barnes &AMP; Noble, every
Borders, any independent bookstore. In the years before and after
the fall of the Soviet Union, they found Czech and Russian, Italian
and German writers as well as American, the requisite British and
the occasional French.
</P>
<P>
   Bookselling is commerce, which means it could not be isolated
from the world even if it wanted to. If some did not realize this
before, they came face to face with it _ and with chasms of
cultural difference _ when Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses''
became more an event in international politics than in literature.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, even so, begins to define the character of
literature in the century that saw the atom split, the bomb
dropped, the moon reached and the globe (despite those seemingly
unbridgeable differences) downsized to a mere village.
</P>
<P>
   If any question could divide writers in our century into one
camp or another, it would be whether they were engaged with the
great issues of their times, like Solzhenitsyn or Nadine Gordimer,
or whether, like Vladimir Nabokov and James Joyce, they believed
the writer's obligation was first to his imagination and not social
realism. On one side might lay moral responsibility, but not
infrequently a preacherly tedium as well; on the other might lay
artistic freedom, but the self-indulgent freedom, sometimes, of the
dilettante.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, a segregation of one from the other is not possible,
as the stories of Eudora Welty, an apolitical writer, subtly show.
In the end, the books that survived in our century have been ones
that somehow reached above their times, sometimes above their
readers' heads, and secured themselves a firm footing on whatever
Olympus stands amid the rubble of a century no writer (unless it
was Orwell) had predicted but many have mined for human meaning.
</P>
<P>
   And even that can take years, maybe a century, to fix in time.
When the New York Public Library, as part of a centennial
celebration in 1995, invited its 175 professional librarians to
nominate books that had had a ``a significant influence,
consequence or resonance'' during its first 100 years, nominations
poured in. W.E.B. Du Bois' ``The Souls of Black Folk,'' published
three years after the century began, anticipated the racial
dilemmas with which it would end. Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring''
(1962) sounded the concerns that would give rise to the
environmental movement. Albert Einstein's ``The Meaning of
Relativity'' (1923) revolutionized our understanding of space and
time. James D. Watson's ``The Double Helix'' (1968) revealed
something even more individual than genes and chromosomes in the
microbiology of life. In 1922, T.S. Eliot (``a trim anti-Bohemian
with black bowler and umbrella ... ushering us to our seats in
hell,'' V.S. Pritchett wrote) set the century's moral tone of
dislocation and devastation in his poem ``The Waste Land.''
</P>
<P>
   And what need be said about Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' except that
it was available in a special bridal edition?
</P>
<P>
   But not even the Fuhrer could compete with Freud. No book
received more nominations than ``The Interpretation of Dreams,''
evidence that, if nothing else, it's meaning we forever seek, when
we're asleep as much as when we're awake.

 &HT;    The first in an occasional series on how the arts have reflected
and defined our times _ and what lies ahead
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May of 1895, when the New York Public Library was founded,
horse-drawn carriages ferried people up and down Manhattan island,
no one could have told you who Albert Einstein or James Joyce might
be, and the literate class looked across the Atlantic for
enlightenment. In a nation of immigrants, the New York Public
Library would become both schoolhouse and citadel, symbolic of an
unshakable faith in human progress. But at the time there was
nothing much on this side of the ocean to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain was an unrefined humorist, too American (and too
popular) to be really respectable. At the most, there was Henry
James, and he had packed his bags and moved to England.
</P>
<P>
   American literature, a century ago, consisted of a handful of
names, some of them already gathering dust _ Washington Irving,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, William
Dean Howells. It was a hand-me-down affair, without tradition or
standing in the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10 years from 1895 to 1905 would be the seedbed for a
new century, one in which American literature variously reflected
the ascension of everything else American. It was during this
fertile period that Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and F. Scott
Fitzgerald, today a holy trinity in the American pantheon, were
born. Thomas Wolfe, forgotten today but larger than any of them for
a few brief years, was born in the same span of time, as was Edmund
Wilson, who not only taught Americans what William Butler Yeats,
Joyce and the Symbolists were up to but also gave them an
appreciation for their home-grown literature.
</P>
<P>
   Labels obscure more than they reveal, and yet pundits have no
hesitation in calling it an American century. Trite as it might be,
it is not entirely inaccurate. By any measure, the overriding
characteristic of the hundred years whose hours are ticking away
has been _ for good or ill _ the centrality of American technology,
American power and American art. In 1895, while patents were
pending for such contraptions as automobiles, telephone systems and
moving pictures, no one would have imagined it.
</P>
<P>
   A FATAL SHOT
</P>
<P>
   But when did the century really begin? On the first day of
January 1900? A year to the day later? The calendar would suggest
one or the other and yet all of us know that neither experience nor
memory conforms to the arbitrary demarcation of months, years and
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A customary, if debatable, answer to the question is that it
began in a place far from American shores, although one becoming
darkly familiar. When the shots rang out in Sarajevo in 1914, one
world died and another was born.
</P>
<P>
   The world that died went out, to reverse T.S. Eliot's famous
words, not with a whimper but with a bang. The bullet that entered
Archduke Franz Ferdinand's throat ricocheted on for 37 days, and in
the 51 months that followed, almost 9 million were killed and 21
million injured. Millions more were left homeless. The Great War
was the upheaval that introduced the 20th century, and was the
first of the great dislocations from which literature in this
country and others has arisen.
</P>
<P>
   Every century has seen faiths shaken and secular institutions
left in shambles. But none, surely, has seen what ours has, from
the collapse of imperial empires to the global spread of technology
and terror. None has, in quite so paradoxical a way, seen the
sanctity of the
</P>
<P>
   individual at once affirmed and denied. The richest profusion of
poetry and prose the West has yet produced cannot claim to fully
record or reflect the depth of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the literature of the 20th century nonetheless captures the
sharper discontinuities, the more grievous horrors and psychic
migrations that have marked our time and that of our parents and
grandparents. No one would call it romantic. Even in a writer like
Fitzgerald, revelry and exuberance foreshadow decadence. And
whatever heroism the 20th century can claim is darkened by the
realization of suffering on vast scales. Witness the angry defiance
of Solzhenitsyn, the lonely tragedy of Pasternak, each in his own
way standing up to brute force. Hear the elegiac lamentation of
Ralph Ellison, writing of his invisibility in white America.
</P>
<P>
   Topology came easier in centuries past. English literature since
Chaucer's time has been marked by the magisterial Ages, often
overlapping: the Age of Shakespeare, the Age of Donne and Dryden,
the Age of Johnson and Swift, the Age of Dickens. No such bookend
categories are at hand as the 20th century closes. Large as they
have loomed in our own time, it would sound ludicrous to speak to
the Age of Faulkner or the Age of Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Not even fiction's mass producers have achieved last-name-only
status. People speak of ``John Grisham,'' not just ``Grisham.'' And
notice how they pronounce ``Stephen King'' as if it were one word,
a case of commercial success producing a kind of unitized
construction. Likewise, even a Nobel Prize has not made
``Morrison'' sufficient without the ``Toni.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the century, the times are more fluid, and change,
the only constant, is not observant of reputation. Anne Bernays,
who has spent 30 years in publishing as both a novelist and an
editor, thinks Katherine Anne Porter's ``Pale Horse, Pale Rider''
is ``just about the best short story in American literature.'' But
how many people under the age of 40 have heard of it? How many have
even heard of its author?
</P>
<P>
   Reputations rise and fall, but more often they drift into the
oblivion of indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago,'' Bernays says, ``Kurt Vonnegut was the
most widely read writer on colleges campuses. Now he's a little
irrelevant. I don't know anyone who reads him. I always thought he
took shortcuts. He was very clever but never got beneath the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of any number of novelists who caught the
tempo and spirit of their times _ or at least that corner in which
they lived. During the 1940s and '50s, John O'Hara was an
acknowledged master of the American short story, a sharp and acidic
sketcher of middle-class life and a fixture on the pages of The New
Yorker. Today he is unread if not unremembered.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction itself has seen its stock erode. Although opinions
differ, many would tell you that novels became less important to
ordinary readers when they sacrificed narrative for
experimentation. Justin Kaplan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer
of Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, points to the 1930s as one
watershed and to the late 1960s and '70s as another. If the fiction
of the '30s was a golden age of rendering familiar human experience
in story form, by the '70s novelists seemed to have forgotten
common life altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s and '70s,'' Kaplan says, ``you had a degradation _
a deliberate degradation _ of the old forms. And that's when
biography began to take the place of fiction _ not entirely, but
seriously _ as a form of vicarious experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century novels of Balzac and Dickens were newsreels as
fiction. Social milieu was inseparable from character and plot. In
the postmodern period of the late 20th century, you can read any
number of novels _ not just American but also, and especially,
French _ without a clue to what a character does for a living, how
he grew up, what goes on in the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the society we live in, one built on capitalism,''
Kaplan says, ``you wonder that so little (fiction) has been written
on business. It's a model for human competition. Business and
moneymaking are the preoccupations of American life, and yet they
are not a part of our fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The view that fiction has lost ground is widely accepted, but
far from universal. Reynolds Price, for one, believes American
fiction is ``healthier than it ever has been.'' He is no fan of
experimentalism _ ``I thought if I saw one more story by Donald
Barthelme, I'd scream'' _ but the productivity and intelligence of
American fiction at the end of the century, he believes, are in
full flower.
</P>
<P>
   It is an assertion always accompanied by a balancing disclaimer.
``I don't think Americans ever read very much, except practical
handbooks on how to fix your Model T or how to groom your dog,''
Price says. ``One of the interesting things about (Charles
Frazier's) `Cold Mountain' _ which I liked very much _ is that you
heard so many women who bought it later saying it was the first
novel their husbands had read since college.''

AS TIANANMEN ANNIVERSARY NEARS, SOME DISSIDENTS DETAINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Two weeks before the 10th anniversary of the massacre
of democracy demonstrators near Tiananmen Square, Chinese
authorities have detained several dissidents and heightened
surveillance of many others.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have documented the detention of at least
seven dissidents since May 13, though some believe the number may
be considerably higher. Three have been released, according to the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movements in China, but some are not likely to be freed until after
the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing _ capitalizing on NATO's errant bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade _ has condemned Western governments for
preaching human rights while bombing innocent civilians. Drawing on
embarrassment over the mistaken bombing, China may feel embolded to
muzzle dissent without fear of global condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   China has allowed broad economic and social liberties in the
decade since the crackdown _ but does not brook any challenge to
the primacy of the Communist Party. China has never tolerated
commemorations of the massacre of hundreds, or perhaps thousands,
of unarmed democracy protesters on June 4, 1989; relatives of
victims are harassed when visiting gravesites, and arresting
dissidents before the anniversary has become an annual event.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights monitors worry repression may be worse this
year, not only because of the 10-year anniversary, but also because
the Communist Party leaders feel pressured both by disgruntled
groups at home and by perceived holier-than-thou Western powers
lobbying for greater freedoms in China.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several dissidents interviewed say they are
determined to honor the memories of the dead, even if it means
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   One dissident detained this week, Jiang Qisheng, 50, is a former
graduate student leader who served 1 1/2 years in prison without
trial following his involvement in the 1989 movement at People's
University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before his latest arrest, in an interview with the
Globe during which he was photographed and followed, Jiang said
that ``anybody should be allowed to tell the truth, but it is not
allowed in this society. ... Ten years ago...I had hoped the
government would hear the voice of the people and do political
reform. I didn't want to bring down the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said he planned to light candles at his home on June 3 and
4, and would try to walk to Tiananmen Square to hold a silent
vigil.
</P>
<P>
   But late Tuesday night, police arrested Jiang, searched his
Beijing home and seized his computer, fax machine, documents and
articles he had written for Beijing Spring, a New York-based
dissident publication. His wife, Zhang Hong, said Thursday night
that police will not tell her where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Others arrested include Li Bagen, a member of the outlawed China
Democracy Party in Hangzhou; Yu Zhenbin, a Beijing intellectual,
and Cao Jiahe, a Beijing magazine editor. Caowas blindfolded, tied
and beaten for four days, according to New York-based Human Rights
in China, after circulating a petition to commemorate the dead. He
had apparently collected the signatures of the former chief editor
and deputy chief editor of the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Activists annually plead for a reassessment of the June 4th
movement. But on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
said the government had ``made a correct and historical conclusion
on the political turmoil'' and ``it will never be changed...All
Chinese people support this conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the anniversary of the government's declaration
of martial law in Beijing following weeks of student-led protests
for greater political freedoms and an end to corruption. The
protests drew 1 million people to the streets of Beijing, plus
millions more in other cities, before tanks were ordered to clear
the square.
</P>
<P>
   The roundup of dissenters this week came as China's top
prosecutor, in a national conference call Wednesday, urged
vigilance against ``an extremely small number of people with
ulterior motives trying to use sensitive issues to incite
disturbances and sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   Han Zhubin warned against ``enemy forces at home and abroad,''
and called for a crackdown on ``all criminal activities that
endanger state security,'' according to the Communist Party
newspaper, the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh rhetoric starkly contrasts an earlier statement by
Premier Zhu Rongji, who recently told Communist Party cadres not to
use ``dictatorial means against the people'' when dealing with
social unrest. Zhu is seen as a pro-US reformer, and analysts say
he may have been sidelined by conservative hawks since the embassy
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on dissidents comes after vitriolic protests
against Western embassies and consulates here in which Chinese
authorities demonstrated their control _ both in mobilizing crowds
and in dispersing them after four days.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders may have been pleased to have a whipping boy to channel
societal discontent and divert attention from the sensitive 10-year
anniversary. But authorities also likely feared that the
demonstrations could have evolved into protests against an
incompetent government, as have countless anti-foreigner movements
in Chinese history. Police had warned dissidents to stay away from
the anti-NATO protests, and the decision to halt the protests
seemed partly aimed to prevent frustrated masses _ from political
activists to millions made jobless by economic reforms _ from
having a public forum to air grievances.
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine Baber of Amnesty International argued that ``in
the long term, stability is better achieved by allowing people to
express their grievances rather than repressing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty has documented 241 cases of June 4th protesters still
imprisoned since 1989, but says they are a fraction of the whole.
The Information Center on Human Rights and Democratic Movements
estimates the total at nearly 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   With people still in jail and the government refusing to reverse
its verdict on the event, Lu said dissidents and relatives will
find ways to stage protests. One option, he said, is hunger strikes
in private homes by one or several individuals. Hunger strikes are
a powerful symbol in Chinese culture, and private commemorations
are naturally harder for police to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reassessing the Tiananmen massacre is still viewed as a threat
to stability,'' Lu acknowledged, ``but I think some in the
government realize that they eventually have to do it if they want
the issue to go away.''

 &HT;    Author's a far cry from red ink of school days
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beginning writers quickly become familiar with
rejections, but few start collecting them as early as Janet Fitch
did. The Los Angeles writer was 8 when she got her first. Actually,
it was for a school paper, but the effect was just as hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch had written what she considered a beautiful long story,
complete with illustrations, and proudly presented it to her
elementary school teacher. Instead of commenting on the story, the
teacher corrected her grammar and spelling with red ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't write again for 10 years,'' Fitch told one
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   When she did start again, there was no red ink. ``White
Oleander'' (Little Brown, $24), Fitch's debut novel, was accepted
by the first editor to whom she sent it. Before it even hit the
stores, the novel was selected for Oprah Winfrey's book club and
snapped up by Warner Bros. and John Wells Productions for a feature
film. The publisher increased the printing from 20,000 to 700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now No. 2 on Amazon.com's best-seller list, the novel tells the
story of Astrid, a teenage girl whose beautiful and brilliant
mother is sent to jail for murdering her ex-lover. Astrid is left
to be raised in a series of foster homes until the day she is asked
to give false testimony at a trial that could set her mother free.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch, who was never in foster care herself, drew on the
experiences of childhood friends to write ``White Oleander.'' She
got the idea for the book after reading ``The Pillow Book of Sei
Shonagon,'' a diary by a lady-in-waiting to a Heian empress in
11th-century Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find remarkable about the Heian court is the noticeable
absence of anything we could call conventional morality or
ethics,'' Fitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Beheadings did not bother Shonagon, for example, but seeing
someone wearing the wrong combination of colored robes would upset
her for days.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch wanted ``to see what would happen if someone with that
extreme aesthetic of the Heian court were forced to live in the
brutal climate of late 20th-century Los Angeles, with a crummy job,
having to do the laundry and whatever,'' Fitch said. ``And so I
wrote the first little short story about this monster, Ingrid
Magnussen, who then got a daughter and became a bigger short story,
which became a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NEW POET LAUREATE: Andrew Motion, a 47-year-old London
professor of creative writing, was chosen Wednesday to become
Britain's poet laureate, succeeding Ted Hughes. His selection put
to rest rumors that Prime Minister Tony Blair might bypass known
writers in favor of a ``people's poet.'' Sir Paul McCartney was one
name mentioned in that context. Hughes held the post for 14 years
until his death in October.
</P>
<P>
   The job has in the past been a lifetime appointment underwritten
by a case of sherry and 100 pounds ($162) a year, but in a
departure from custom, Wednesday's statement from 10 Downing St.
said that Motion's appointment would be for 10 years and that there
would be an annual payment of 5,000 pounds ($8,100).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RICHEST PRIZE: British author Andrew Miller is the winner of
the $150,000 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award for his
novel ``Ingenious Pain.'' The international panel of judges chose
the novel over eight nominees that included Don DeLillo
(``Underworld''), Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan (``Enduring
Love''), Bernhard Schlink(``The Reader'') and Cynthia Ozick (``The
Puttermesser Papers''). Published in the United States in 1997,
``Ingenious Pain'' tells of the rise, fall and redemption of James
Dyer, an extraordinary man who cannot feel pain. Dyer becomes a
brilliant surgeon who travels across Europe to Russia, where he
meets a mysterious woman who becomes his savior. Miller, whose
second novel, ``Casanova in Love,'' was published last year, will
receive the literary award _ the richest in the world _ at a June
12 ceremony in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BETWEEN THE PAGES: Authors Kaye Gibbons, Anne Lamott and Bret
Easton Ellis are interviewed in the May/June issue of the fledgling
Book ($4.95) magazine. The six-times-a-year publication also
features reviews and the last short story that Andre Dubus wrote
before he died. In the cover story interview, Gibbons, whose novel
``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon'' has just been published in
paperback, talks about her next project, a memoir/biography of her
mother, who committed suicide when Gibbons was 10. ``I want to find
out who my mother was as a woman,'' says Gibbons, who lives in
North Carolina. ``I have very few memories of her. I want to find
out how she operated as a woman, find out what she liked, what
jokes she thought were funny.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WINNERS: British writer P.D. James was given the prestigious
Grand Master award, and Robert Clark's whodunit ``Mr. White's
Confession'' was named the year's best mystery at the annual Edgar
Allan Poe Awards ceremonies recently in New York. Steve Hamilton's
``A Cold Day in Paradise'' won best first mystery novel, and
Alabama writer Tom Franklin's debut collection of stories,
``Poachers,'' won for best short fiction.

 &HT;    Cheever confident Infiniti engine can bring Indy victory
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ All season the skeptics had been asking defending
Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever Jr. why he changed from an
Oldsmobile Aurora engine to an Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were even more legitimate when his new motor blew
Wednesday during practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But
Cheever isn't overly concerned, though it was with an Olds Aurora
that he beat Buddy Lazier by three seconds at Indy last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this engine, we're way ahead of where we were last
year,'' Cheever said. ``But I'm reluctant to say we're where we
need to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd say we made a lot of progress. The only problem is we
haven't had enough endurance runs with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever isn't the first Indy Racing League driver to use
Infiniti, but he is the most renowned. Though no driver had used an
Infiniti engine at Indy before 1997 and no one has won the race
with it, Cheever announced in April that he was switching.
</P>
<P>
   He believes it gives him a ``competitive edge,'' but that's
still to be determined. Cheever's speed with the new engine has
been similar to that with the Olds; during the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway test session April 12, Cheever posted the fifth fastest
lap of 23 participants (223.292 mph).
</P>
<P>
   Though the Aurora is the engine of choice at Indy (75 of the 84
entries use it), Infiniti appears to be closing the gap. Its 720
horsepower is comparable to Aurora's, and engineers have reduced
the Infiniti's weight by 55 pounds to 340 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chances for victory are vastly superior to what they were
this time last year,'' Cheever said. ``We have a much stronger
relationship with our supporting manufacturers and, in my opinion,
that can make a big difference in performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a much deeper database now and a better relationship
with Goodyear and Infiniti. We didn't have that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Cheever became the first owner/driver to win Indy
since A.J. Foyt (1977), though it wasn't a smooth ride. Team
Cheever had hired chief mechanic Owen Snyder III just months before
the race and it took time for the two to mesh. Also, Cheever feared
sponsorship might dry up if he didn't have a strong showing,
considering all his tough luck in IRL races.
</P>
<P>
   The low point came when Cheever ran out of engines and had to
borrow one from A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I blew the engine, would I pay for it,'' Cheever
said. ``I said I would.''
</P>
<P>
   He never had to. It was a good race all around for Team Cheever
as teammate Robby Unser finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Unser has moved on to Team Pelfrey of Huber Heights and has been
replaced by Belgian Wim Eyckmans, who has spent the past week
conferring with Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running on ovals is very different from what I am used to
driving in Europe,'' Eyckmans said. ``You must be so much smoother
and it is a completely different style of driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting the hang of it, and it's a big help having Eddie
there, who understands the European way of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever _ born in Phoenix, but raised in Rome _ drove Formula
One from 1978-89 and has driven more Grand Prix races (132) than
any other U.S. driver.
</P>
<P>
   He said winning the Indianapolis 500 gave him a bigger rush than
any of those Grand Prix events. He hopes to recapture that feeling
on May 30.

 &HT;    Fire up that grill, but don't skip safety
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Last week we talked about getting your grill
ready for cooking. This week we'll talk about using your grill
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information in today's column comes from the
Barbecue Industry Association, a trade group representing grill
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Check the association's Internet site at bbqind.org for other
safety tips or look in the ``What's Hot'' section for recipes and
cooking suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to safety, some things are basic. You're dealing
with flammable gases, lighter fuels, hot surfaces and toxic fumes,
and you're handling food outdoors, where you're adding potential
contaminants you don't have to deal with in your kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   So read the owner's manual for your grill and use a little
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   General tips
</P>
<P>
   _ Grills produce carbon monoxide that can accumulate and kill
you and your family. Never barbecue in your trailer, tent, house,
garage or any enclosed area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set up the grill in an open area away from anything flammable,
such as dry leaves or brush. Be aware of the windblown sparks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place the grill on a level surface. Be sure the legs are all
sound and the feet or wheels are all firmly on the ground. Don't
put the grill in a high-traffic area where it's likely to be
bumped, or where people may brush against the hot grill body.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your grill has electrical accessories such as rotisseries,
be sure they are plugged into properly grounded receptacles. Keep
electrical cords away from walkways.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use long-handled barbecue utensils to avoid burns and
splatters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear clothing that does not have hanging shirttails, frills or
apron strings. If you need to adjust hot vents, wear
flame-retardant mitts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use baking soda to control a grease fire and have a fire
extinguisher handy. A bucket of sand or a garden hose should be
near if you don't have a commercial extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never leave a grill unattended after it is lit, and never
attempt to move a hot grill.
</P>
<P>
   Gas grills
</P>
<P>
   _ If a burner doesn't ignite, turn off the gas. Keep the grill's
lid open and wait five minutes before trying to light it again. If
the burners go out during operation, turn all gas valves to off.
Open the lid and wait five minutes before attempting to relight,
using the lighting instructions.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you get flare-ups on a gas grill, lower the temperature and
raise the grid holding the food.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are limits on how much propane can be put into a
liquid-propane cylinder. Don't overfill the cylinder or ask a
propane supplier to do so. The air space in the propane cylinder is
needed to allow the liquid propane to enter its gaseous state.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the cylinder is connected, the grill must be kept outside
in a well-ventilated space. When not in use, the cylinder valve
must be turned to the ``off'' position.
</P>
<P>
   _ If storing the gas grill indoors, the propane cylinder must be
disconnected, removed and stored outdoors. Never store a
liquid-propane cylinder indoors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always store propane cylinders upright and in areas where
temperatures won't exceed 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Never store a
spare cylinder on or near a grill.
</P>
<P>
   Charcoal grills
</P>
<P>
   _ To put out flare-ups, raise the grid the food is on and spread
the coals out. If you must douse the flames with a light spritz of
water, first remove the food from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   _ When using charcoal briquets or wood chunks, form a pyramid
and douse the briquets or chunks with lighter fluid. Wait until the
fluid has soaked in before lighting. Before lighting, cap the
lighter fluid and move it a safe distance from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never add lighter fluid to existing hot or warm coals. Never
use gasoline, kerosene or any other highly volatile fluid as a
starter. They can explode.
</P>
<P>
   _ As an alternative to lighter fluid, use an electric, solid or
other starter specifically made for lighting charcoal briquets or
wood chunks. After unplugging an electric starter, remove it
cautiously and be careful where you put it. Always cool the starter
completely before storing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never use an electric starter in the rain or when standing on
wet ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ When using instant-light briquets, do not use lighter fluid or
electric, solid or other starters. Do not add more instant-light
briquets once the fire has been lit; add regular charcoal briquets
if more are needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow coals to burn out completely and let the ashes cool for
48 hours before disposing of them. Dispose of cold ashes by
wrapping them in heavy-duty aluminum foil and putting them in a
noncombustible container.
</P>
<P>
   Food handling
</P>
<P>
   _ When shopping for meat, fish and poultry, put them in your
grocery cart last. Never buy a package that's damaged or torn and
check ``sell-by'' and ``use-by'' dates. Put packaged raw meat in
plastic bags so that leaking juices cannot cross-contaminate other
food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Load grocery bags with meat and other refrigerated foods in
the air-conditioned section of the car, not in the trunk.
Refrigerate meats as soon as possible. Keep them chilled until
you're ready to grill them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator or by immersing it in
cold water _ never on the counter. Allow sufficient defrosting
time. If you're in a hurry, thaw meat in the microwave just before
grilling it. Also, marinate meats in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash your hands in hot, soapy water before preparing food,
after each time you touch raw meat and after any interruptions,
such as using the bathroom or handling pets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep raw meat, poultry and fish and their juices away from
other food. That means thoroughly washing cutting boards, knives,
platters, etc., before letting them come in contact with other
foods you're preparing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use the plate or container you use to carry meat to the
grill to carry cooked meat away. Cooking kills bacteria that could
be reintroduced from a plate contaminated by meat juices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sanitize cutting boards and countertops with chlorine bleach.
Pour on a small amount and let it stand several minutes, then rinse
thoroughly and air-dry or dry with clean paper towels. Soak sponges
and dishcloths in hot, soapy water to which you've added chlorine
bleach.

 &HT;    Model offers clothing tips for petites
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``The biggest mistake a woman makes is that she
tries to wear the same style that she wore when she felt the
thinnest or youngest,'' says Tori Hartman. ``Often our fashion
sense ends in our late 20s and early 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, petite model and author, will share fashion advice at a
series of free petite fashion events for Elder-Beerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game,'' Hartman says, ``is not to look taller
or thinner, it's about looking terrific no matter what your size.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, who began her fashion career as a petite model for Liz
Claiborne, is the author of ``Fabulous You! Unlock Your Perfect
Personal Style.'' She has appeared on ``All My Children,'' written
for ``Another World,'' is editor of Petite Week News and serves as
a TV commentator on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman says times have changed for petite women. When she was
growing up (she's 5-foot-3) she spent many frustrating and
disappointing hours shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant finding styles in magazines that I loved, only to
discover they didn't make that in my size,'' she recalls. ``I spent
most of my early years as an outsider, hoping there would be
something in the junior department that would work on me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was fine for a teen-ager, but what about an adult?
</P>
<P>
   Hartman is happy to say things are different now. In addition to
petite shops, more vendors are including petite lines and
department stores are boasting bigger and better petite
departments. Manufacturers are finally addressing the mature petite
figure as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Elder-Beerman stores this week, Hartman says she'll cover
trends, teach customers how to update their wardrobes and give tips
on what to pull out of the closet to wear again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A petite can wear capri pants, but it's all about body
proportion,'' she explains. ``The silhouette is really suited for
the more evenly proportioned petite woman or long-waisted or
long-legged women. Shorter-waisted women can try it on but should
make sure they find an overblouse that works with it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big news is white, so I'll be showing that, too,'' she
says. ``And after a fashion show, I always work on the floor with
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Her best advice? ``Try it on! Don't rely on your eye to tell you
if it won't fit or work on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tori Hartman's fashion tips for petites
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintain as much of a solid color line up and down as
possible. If you're wearing a black skirt, for instance, wear black
hose and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A long jacket and long skirt used to be a no-no, but if the
garments are petites they can be worn together. If the look
overpowers you, pair a long skirt with a twin set instead.
</P>
<P>
   _ Floral prints are fine, just try to stay to one color to
accessorize. A good measure of the correct size in a floral print
for a petite is hand size. If it's bigger than your hand, the print
will probably overpower you.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're mixing two prints, make certain one is smaller than
the other. If you put the larger print on top it will draw the
attention up.
</P>
<P>
   _ The detailing this season is wonderful for petites, and
wearing a pin on your lapel or a scarf around your neck draws
attention to your face.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't beat yourself up for those extra inches on your hips.
Proportion wise, it's perfectly normal for petites to be three to
five inches bigger in the hip than the average missy size. So have
that Twinkie and wear your shoulder pads!

REPORT SAYS BORDER PATROL DRIVING ALIENS TO REMOTE SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The U.S. Border Patrol has put so much pressure
on the border that illegal immigration has shifted from traditional
hot spots to the more remote areas of the U.S.-Mexico boundary,
where more people are dying, according to a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear if billions of dollars and thousands of new
agents have dented the number of people illegally entering the
country, the General Accounting Office said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, which is the investigative arm of the Congress, also
found that an unintended result of a new patrol strategy is that
more illegal immigrants are dying in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it does not appear there has been an increase in the
overall number of migrant deaths, some evidence exists that deaths
resulting from attempted crossings in remote areas are
increasing,'' the study's summary says without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stana, associate director of GAO, said, ``There is
evidence the flows are shifting. What we are not seeing is people
being discouraged from even trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Border Strategy, which was announced in 1994,
started by using unprecedented numbers of agents, fences and buried
sensors to reduce illegal crossings near El Paso and San Diego,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to push crossers into more remote areas, and as
officials expected, it led to an increase in the number of people
caught in more open stretches of South Texas and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Chulick, a spokeswoman for the Border Patrol headquarters
in Washington, declined to comment on the GAO's findings until she
could review the report.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants were
apprehended trying to sneak north over the U.S.-Mexico border,
according to the Border Patrol. That compares to 1.4 million in
1997 and 1.5 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration-rights groups criticized the patrol, saying the
agency has long known pushing people into remote and dangerous
areas would lead to more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what we have been maintaining for five years. It is
causing an increase in the number of fatalities,'' said Nathan
Selzer, a spokesman for Proyecto Libertad, a Harlingen, Texas-based
immigration-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Webb County became the deadliest place on the
border for illegal immigrants. Laredo is the seat of Webb County.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people died of dehydration while trying to sneak
past agents.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO re-urged a 1997 recommendation that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which oversees the Border Patrol, to do a
better job figuring out what works and what does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do not know,'' Stana said by phone from Washington.
``You can talk about people you arrest, but you do not know how
many you are not arresting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rey Garza, an assistant chief with the patrol's McAllen Sector,
which includes most of deep South Texas, said it is getting more
difficult to sneak into the country as the agency closes off
additional areas.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Rio Grande, which started near Brownsville, stationed
more agents, boats, and high-powered flood lights along the river
to force would-be immigrants to cross farther up stream, near
Laredo or Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them (immigrants) to take the message back: it is
difficult to cross here, and we have the manpower and resources to
do the job,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also found that smugglers are charging more money to
sneak people into the United States, and more illegal immigrants
are being caught at the border with fake immigration papers.

COMMENTARY: AWAITING EHUD BARAK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a day in Israel in June 1992 I talked separately with the
four men I considered most important to their country. I asked them
all the same question, most important to its people and future.
</P>
<P>
   What was their thinking about the statement of President George
Bush that for Israel security was not in land or geography but in
peace with the Palestinians? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister
Moshe Arens, both of Likud; Yitzhak Rabin of Labor, who soon would
defeat Likud in a national election; and the chief of staff of
Israel's armed forces, respected nationally as a particularly brave
commander. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the men from the acridly contesting parties and
the non-political chief of staff all agreed with each other _ none
with Bush. They said Palestinians would never rest with a slice of
Israel but were targeted at defeating it altogether. They said a
Palestinian state would fight a war of terrorism from their
sanctuary, constantly reinforced by Arab allies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Ehud Barak, the chief of staff, said day by day the Israeli
military had watched U.S. strategy in the Gulf War. He said smart
weapons were not as important to the victory over Iraq as smart
strategy. He said the United States had taken advantage of great
reaches of space and the wealth of maneuver time to pummel the
Iraqis where and when it would do most military damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Israel had so little space and time, said Barak,
made what it did have critical to its survival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day I talked with Avraham Burg, of Labor's powerful
left wing. I said he sure did sound softer than Rabin about peace
and security. Rabin, said he, would be the ``propellent'' for
Labor's rocket. Then it would be dropped and the rocket would zoom
off on its own way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after Israeli withdrawal obligations had been
negotiated at Oslo by the Rabin government, Barak was one of the
Israeli generals furious that the military had not been consulted.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is prime minister-elect, various commentators and
the Clinton administration drip with ecstasy. That's preferable to
the poisoned daggers they kept sending Benjamin Netanyahu. But
these folk are waylaying Barak. The message is ``rush to peace, or
failure will be called your fault.'' The truth is he won't be able
to do anything unless his minority party constructs a coalition
that allows him to rule, and not be Burgered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu killed himself politically by his talent of turning
members of his Cabinet into devoted enemies. But one day, I think,
Barak will say what so many Israelis, including ex-friends of
Netanyahu, admit privately: By the political guts he showed, the
former prime minister has helped the just-elected one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He infuriated hard-line Likudniks by accepting Oslo's untested
premise of land for peace. He returned Hebron, bitterly contested
by religious Jews and Muslims. He told Yasser Arafat that from then
on Palestinians would have to show progress on dismantling their
terrorist structure, not just putting it in the cooler during
negotiations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton folk were terribly upset by how stubborn he was about
Israel's security _ terribly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barak was elected not just by Netanyahu's faults, but by his own
reputation for honesty and strength. Now he will face the same
problems as his predecessor _ like Palestinian expectations raised
by Arafat, the nasty Clintonian tilt against Israel, and the
anti-Israeli campaign by the European Union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much more mobilization time and space can Israel surrender
without risk to its safety? What concessions to make on Jerusalem?
Answer from both men: Virtually none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to keep other Arab states from sending arms, terrorists and
disguised soldiers to swell the illegally large Palestinian
``police'' army? How to limit civilian Arab immigration into
Palestine when Israel's doors are open to any Jew? Concrete answer
to both question: Who knows?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My wife sometimes tells me not to seem so politically gloomy.
All right, get ready for joy: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am not at all gloomy about Israel. One good man has replaced
another, in a way terrifying to every Arab ruler. It's called
election, and for friends of Israel it is powerful anti-gloom, for
all Israel's years ahead.

THE FALL OF EGYPT: SCANTILY CLAD CLEOPATRA CAN'T SAVE MINISERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Egypt, it's hot and clingy, and air conditioning won't be
invented for another 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``Cleopatra,'' an ABC miniseries that consumed 1,000
Moroccan extras, 600 horses, a ton of copper, 300 wigs and enough
cotton and silk to stretch 1.8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't the horses, the copper, the wigs or the Moroccan
extras you'll notice. And certainly not the cotton and silk.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's Cleopatra (Leonor Varela) unplugged and undressed.
</P>
<P>
   The great Julius Caesar (Timothy Dalton) is introduced to her
when she unrolls from a gift rug and gives him that unmistakable
look. It's the look that says: Let us now render unto Caesar what
is his.
</P>
<P>
   One scene later, she's writhing her way up a bed and cooing to
him, ``I am Egypt. Indeed it is yours, for one night only.''
</P>
<P>
   And man, this Caesar is salad.
</P>
<P>
   It seems churlish to point out that Varela, a Chilean import, is
one of television's all-time bad actresses.
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``I am queen of Egypt'' four or five hundred times in
the miniseries, which airs Sunday and Monday, and still she reduces
the Egyptian temptress to absolute ordinariness.
</P>
<P>
   Other than her figure, that is. She's forever getting out of
baths. Or into and out of her see-through, papyrus-thin duds.
</P>
<P>
   As Cleopatra, Varela is moody and vainglorious in a ``Don't Cry
for Me, Alexandria'' sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that everybody loves her. She flies into irksome
rages. She listens to no one. Worst of all, she squeaks so much
about helping ``my people'' that you'd think Cleopatra was a
liberal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   It has to say something about Varela's abilities that I
realized, late on, that ``Cleopatra'' was dullest when Cleopatra
was on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton's Caesar puts up with all this in bemused fashion, as if
he's not so secretly finding the whole florid production to be
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the sultry queen in his arms, looks toward the camera
and declares, as lovers will, ``I will not leave crumbling stones
behind, but a new world order that will change the present and
shape the lives of history to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The lives of history to come?
</P>
<P>
   Well, anyway, Caesar's enemies slice him up soon enough, leaving
Cleopatra to start all over again with Caesar's good buddy Marc
Antony (Billy Zane).
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of Caesarian, Cleopatra's son by Julius
Caesar. Between Julius and Marc, the miniseries pauses briefly for
a Caesarian section.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleopatra'' is a big-budget Halmi production _ the Robert
Halmis senior and junior _ and shows plenty of flashy spectacle
along with its panoramic views of Varela's bare back.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't add up to excitement. Zane's Marc Antony teams
with Cleopatra to make war against mighty Rome and its new dictator
Octavius (Rupert Graves, in the show's best performance).
</P>
<P>
   He's defeated at sea in about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Marc Antony grovels, gets drunk, decides he still
loves Cleopatra, rallies and marches off to fight Rome anew, on
land.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he's routed in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra does her Xena bit in there somewhere, sword-fighting a
couple of legionnaires, before she finally gets her asp in gear.

CLINTON URGES ALLIES TO STAY THE COURSE ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH AND KEVIN CULLEN AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with increasing calls for a halt in
NATO's air campaign following the accidental bombing of a Belgrade
hospital, President Clinton appealed to his European counterparts
Thursday to remain tough, vowing to carry on the conflict until
Yugoslavia meets all NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came as Belgrade suffered the heaviest NATO
bombardment in two weeks, on the same day thousands turned out for
the commemoration of Saints' Day to pray for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue our military campaign until the conditions
are met,'' Clinton said in apparent attempt to stiffen resolve
after the latest mistaken bombing, which killed four people in the
hospital and hit a number of European diplomatic buildings.
``President Milosevic should know that he cannot change the
fundamental terms that we have outlined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stay focused and patient,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The President's remark follow an announcement by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema Thursday that NATO should suspend its air
war once Belgrade agrees to a UN-sponsored peace settlement. And it
comes as Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who favors a
48-hour cease-fire, announced plans to travel to Moscow, Beijing
and Washington to press for a diplomatic end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pause in the bombing can occur the moment when we have an
agreement for a draft resolution that can be adopted as a
resolution of the UN Security Council,'' D'Alema said during a
visit to NATO headquarters Thursday. If Belgrade reneges on the
deal, he added, ``military action should then restart.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for a cease fire reflected growing concern among
European leaders that NATO's frequently errant missiles could
weaken public support for the war, which is entering its third
month. In the latest mishap, NATO missiles swerved out of control
in a suburb of Belgrade, striking a hospital, slightly damaging the
Spanish and Swedish ambassadors' residences, and raising calls from
some NATO members to exhibit greater caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be great care to avoid tragic errors that would
increase the sense of uneasiness and incomprehension among the
public,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began bombing Belgrade earlier than usual Thursday night,
just at dusk. At least two bombs struck the New Belgrade section of
the city, where NATO had been targeting fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's Beta news agency said the attack blew out windows
at the nearby residence of the Swiss ambassador, who was hosting a
reception. Guests included the Swedish ambassador, whose own
residence was damaged in the earlier attack. No casualties were
reported at the Swiss residence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic,
accused Belgrade of plotting a coup following the Yugoslav army's
seizure of the republic's main border crossing into Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regime in Belgrade wants to install the Yugoslav army as a
dictatorship power in Montenegro,'' Djukanovic told the local
Montena-fax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a dacha outside Moscow, representatives from the United
States, Russia and the European Union met to assess the latest
diplomatic developments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's acting foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said
representatives from the Group of 8, which includes Russia and the
seven leading industrial countries, have agreed to a basic peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that a draft resolution containing the shape
of a post-war Balkan peace ``contains a number of contentious
points.'' Diplomats from those countries are expected to try to
narrow the gaps in Bonn Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we have quite some distance to cover in bridging
the gaps in the G8, primarily between NATO and Russia,'' said
former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, who is acting as UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan's personal envoy. ``That must be
healed and this is not yet done.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the diplomatic stalemate is a dispute over the
composition of an international force to oversee the return of more
than 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees driven out of Kosovo by Serb
authorities. Clinton said Thursday that NATO forces must be at the
``core'' of any such force. Russia and Belgrade want the United
Nations to be at the heart of any peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the diplomats are far
from getting a formal peace settlement approved by the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Annan pledged Thursday to bring the refugees home during a tour
of Kukes, the largest refugee camp in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Martti Athisaari, the Finnish president who is emerging as a key
mediator, expressed frustration at the wave of diplomatic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we don't need now is more proposals,'' he said
before traveling to Moscow to meet with former Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and US Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott. ``What we are doing now is measuring how ready the
Yugoslav leadership is for a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright assured Congress
Thursday that Milosevic will have to agree to withdraw ``all'' of
the 40,000 soldiers, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo
before the NATO air war will end. But she left open the possibility
of a bombing pause if an undertermined ``amount'' of forces leave
the area.
</P>
<P>
   She also warned that Washington is committed to driving
Milosevic from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal here is to try to get as strong an isolation of the
regime as possible in order to show the people that their future
does not lie with Milosevic,'' Albright said. ``We believe that
Serbia would be better off without him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade Thursday, a senior Yugoslav official dismissed as
propaganda claims by the US State Department on Wednesday that it
had firm evidence of Serb troops summarily executing more than 100
ethnic Albanian men in a Kosovo village.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a minister without portfolio, said the claims about
massacres by Serb forces were meant to deflect attention from
``NATO's crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic also denied reports that there had been between 500 to
2,000 desertions by Yugoslav soldiers who returned to their homes
in southern Serbia, and that there had been antiwar demonstrations
in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said NATO, not the Serb forces, wants to rid Kosovo of all
its people so that it can bomb the province to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and human rights organizations have said that some
100,000 men are unaccounted for in Kosovo, and refugees report that
men of fighting age were separated from them by Serb troops, Matic
said the ethnic Albanian men are being treated no differently than
other Yugoslav citizens. He said no men under the age of 65 are
being allowed to leave Yugoslavia because they may be needed for
military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about disappearances,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   To buttress his argument, Matic showed reporters here a
videotape of a farmer in whose potato field an alleged mass grave
was purportedly spotted by US spy planes. The elderly farmer
insisted there were no graves on his land.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian TV reported that the Yugoslav government would establish
a ministry for refugees if NATO ended its bombing campaign. It also
said that Milosevic and the Russia's Chernomyrdin would hold talks
in Belgrade again on Monday or Tuesday.

ADVERTISING: MINOLTA CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON INSPIRATION INSTEAD OF
HARDWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Minolta Corp., the Japanese maker of copiers and
cameras, is counting on a new ad campaign using photographs by a
number of highly acclaimed artists to buoy its brand in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the first major work done for Minolta, the U.S.
subsidiary of Minolta Co. Ltd. of Japan, by the New York office of
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary, which generates one-third of its parent's global
sales and is based in Ramsey, N.J., hired the agency, a unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos., last summer after a four-year
collaboration with Lois/EJL, a unit of Lois/USA. The work is
budgeted through September 2000 at $10 million to $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Holiday's task, said Chuck Kushell, president of the New
York unit, is to reposition the Minolta brand, promoted for years
with the tag line ``Only from the mind of Minolta.'' He said the
agency's strategy was to develop a campaign that would ``celebrate
how important Minolta's cameras and office systems are to specific
groups of people,'' rather than promote the equipment's
technological features, which he called the traditional approach
for such products.
</P>
<P>
   All new advertising, both print and broadcast, contains the tag
line ``Do something important'' and, not surprisingly, striking
photography, in many cases by well-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   One group of ads for Minolta's office products, which generated
approximately three-quarters of the company's $1.2 billion total
U.S. sales in its 1998 fiscal year, verge on the inspirational,
though they avoid being saccharine; they are in publications like
Business 2.0, Fortune and The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad, a black-and-white photograph by Elliott Erwitt of the
Magnum photo agency, a woman is striding through Grand Central
Station, surrounded by a crowd of people. The copy asks: ``If not
you, who will write a presentation that grows business, will help
another person succeed, will crack a joke in a meeting that
desperately needs one. Your ideas give you a chance. We'll do
everything humanly possible to help you present those ideas more
powerfully and cost efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Other, more humorous ads for office products, running in
technical publications, include a William Wegman color photo of a
dog in a wedding dress, and a 1950s black-and-white photo by Erwitt
of a father carving a Thanksgiving turkey under the watchful eyes
of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the campaign is devoted to ads for Minolta's camera
equipment, which generated the remaining quarter of the company's
total U.S. sales in its last fiscal year. In an ad running in
photography magazines for the Maxxum 9, a 35-mm single-lens reflex
professional camera, a male photographer shown from neck to waist
holds a picture of a young Cambodian girl injured by land mines.
The copy asks: ``Can a photograph stop a war? Can it save a life?
Pray that it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the right hands, this camera could change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Minolta also hired Janusz Kaminski, the cinematographer who won
Oscars for his work on ``Schindler's List'' and ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' to create television advertising for its camera equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Holiday is testing Kaminski's two 30-second spots in
several markets this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One spot contains the sounds of girls giggling and a hose
running as a woman steps down from a porch and takes a picture. Her
subjects _ whom the viewer never sees directly _ are her two
daughters, slathered in mud; they appear in her photograph, shown
at the end of the commercial, which asks, ``Who will take the
photographs that show us the meaning of family?''
</P>
<P>
   The other spot is somewhat of an in-joke: It re-creates a famous
1957 photograph by Erwitt of a crusty old woman encountering a dog
in the driver's seat of a car parked on a city street. The
commercial shows Erwitt reshooting his original photograph and
asks, ``Who will take the photographs that capture life?'' Both
commercials end by asking, ``Will it be you?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Minolta's new advertising budget significantly exceeds
recent expenditures _ according to Competitive Media Reporting, it
spent $4.6 million on camera and copier advertising in 1997 and
$7.6 million in 1998 _ whether the ads help it increase market
share remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dataquest, a research company in San Jose, Calif.,
Minolta generated 4.4 percent of all U.S. copier sales in 1998,
tied for fifth with Ricoh Co., behind the giants Canon Inc., Xerox
Corp., Sharp Corp. and Mita Industrial Co.
</P>
<P>
   Intelect ASW, a market research company in Port Washington,
N.Y., said Minolta generated 18 percent of U.S. sales for
single-lens reflex cameras last year, third behind Canon and Nikon
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Minolta's competitors have spent far more than it
has. For example, Canon's 1998 camera and copier advertising
expenditures were $73.6 million, according to Competitive Media
Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminski, for one, predicts the emotional appeal of Minolta's
advertising will help it win over buyers. ``The campaign is set in
a very realistic scenario,'' he said. ``It doesn't emphasize the
heroic. These are ordinary people. By deglamorizing the
advertising, Minolta's getting closer to consumers, helping them
think, `This product was created for me.'''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A body lay curled up under the broken
masonry of what had been the neurology clinic. Under the
monochromatic gray dust that covers everything after an explosion,
amid the broken tiles, filthy blankets and scattered bed rails, one
could slowly make out the curve of the buttocks and thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin left
Belgrade after peace talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, NATO bombed a hospital Thursday morning. Four people
were killed and dozens wounded, including medical staff and two
women who suffered cuts and facial injuries from broken glass while
they were giving birth. At least 70 other pregnant women were moved
to another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dejan Sumrak, the chief of the neurology department of the
Dragisa Misovic Hospital, could barely control his disgust. Three
of his patients had died and five more were wounded when an errant
missile aimed at a nearby (and empty) military barracks in this
wealthy Belgrade district of Dedinje landed on this hospital
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they were aiming at,'' Sumrak said. ``This
is a hospital. This is an utterly cynical act by NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   His associate, Dr. Branislava Mrsulja, said: ``We thought we
were safer here than at home. And why are these patients guilty of
anything?'' One of the dead, Branka Boskovic, had celebrated her
75th birthday in the ward the day before, said Dr. Mrsulja, who
asked that the names of the other two dead patients, Radoslav
Novakovic, 47, and Zora Brkic, 72, be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that one of
seven laser-guided missiles ``failed to guide correctly'' and fell
500 yards from the barracks, striking a building. Shea, apparently
unaware or skeptical of Western news agency reports that NATO had
hit a hospital, said he had no details of the kind of building that
was hit.
</P>
<P>
   As he has after other NATO accidents, Shea said: ``We will
continue our practice of striking those military targets with great
accuracy and precision and we will continue to take every
conceivable measure to avoid damage to civilian property and harm
to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming at targets 500 yards from a hospital, said Sumrak, was
not taking every conceivable measure to avoid damage, ``at least in
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth to die here Thursday morning was a security guard,
whose name was not immediately available because of the need to
notify his family.
</P>
<P>
   He became an interesting aspect of this story, because reporters
brought to the scene by the Yugoslav army press center discovered
some 50 rounds of AK-47 ammunition scattered along an oily, muddy
road not 20 yards from the missile crater, which was full of
sewage, ground water and floating bits of wood, some of them green.
And there was one small piece of camouflage cloth visible.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rounds, once cleaned of mud and oil, were perfect.
Some were exploded, but the bullets showed no rifling, indicating
that they had not been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Shown the rounds, army officers at the scene had no comment.
Asked later at a press conference if there had been any storage of
ammunition on the grounds of the hospital, or in trucks parked
along the road, Serbian Health Minister Leposava Milicevic said
there had been none. ``No medical facility is used by the army or
the police,'' she said. ``It is strictly forbidden, and I checked
this myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the ammunition, she said, ``I suggest this was the
remains of the security guard who was killed. I can't explain
ammunition used by security officials guarding the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In her view, she said, NATO intended to target the hospital,
having also dropped a cluster bomb on the grounds of another
hospital two weeks ago, in Nis.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a minister without portfolio who often speaks for
the government, said in an interview that the security guard might
have had a clip of cartridges in his Kalashnikov assault rifle and
another three clips on his person, totaling some 120 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The oil on the road, he said, came from a firetruck kept near
the barracks, which the government knew were a potential target,
and which he said had been empty for two months. He denied, also in
strong terms, that any military equipment or ammunition was stored
on the grounds of any Yugoslav hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Five military buildings appeared damaged badly, with one of
them, originally four stories, collapsed to one, looking something
like a millefeuille. The nearby residences of the Spanish and
Norwegian ambassadors were also damaged, as was that of the Swedish
ambassador, who said nine windows were blown out and a door
damaged. Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said in Stockholm that
``it is unacceptable that right in the center of a large city,
these kinds of large explosives are used, causing this kind of
damages and injuries.'' Ms. Lindh, said, ``The strike on the
hospital underscores the need for a political solution.''
</P>
<P>
   One Serb who spoke on condition of anonymity said that nothing
NATO did would any longer surprise her. ``This is of course a
military target if you just take the longer view,'' she said
bitterly. ``In 20 years or so, these babies will be soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any sudden storm of violence, there were bizarre moments
of heroism and chance. Dr. Miodrag Lazic, the director of the
hospital, described how two nurses on the second floor had been
caught in the explosion, and how the staff rigged a pipe to get
them down.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse described to Serbian radio how she was in the maternity
ward with a woman in labor. ``She began smashing things around her
and crossing herself,'' the nurse said. ``We could barely manage to
move her downstairs to the basement, where she finally gave birth.
We are full of dust. It was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazic described another baby born by caesarean section minutes
before the explosion, and how both mother and child were covered
with dirt and dust, and how offended he had been as a doctor.

A SPLINTERED OPPOSITION BEGINS THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ War fatigue is growing here as casualties
mount in the fight with NATO, prompting a circumspect political
debate and encouraging the splintered opposition to think about
what Yugoslavia could look like after the war, and even after
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   These stirrings remain faint. Milosevic's allies have been
branding all opposition leaders as ``fifth columnists'' and ``open
traitors'' and keep them from responding on state television or in
the main newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is weak and fractured and is likely to remain so,
with a great divide emerging between those who fled Serbia, like
the Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, a favorite of the West,
and those who remained behind under the double threat of government
repression and NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States wants to get rid of Milosevic, it is not
clear who would replace him. And there is a strong feeling here
that it is for the Serbs, not outsiders, to make that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders are thus jockeying for postwar prominence as
reports reach Belgrade of rallies in badly bombed cities like
Krusevac and Cacak, demanding an end to the war and the return of
reservists from Kosovo. There have also been reports of the
desertion of several hundred Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations this week by soldiers' mothers in Krusevac and
nearby Aleksandrovac were apparently sparked by the deaths of 10
local reservists in Kosovo and the lack of real information about
the war. The theme of the demonstrations, which took on a political
character, was expressed by the slogan ``We want sons, not
coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the mayors of Nis and Cacak both issued statements
calling for Milosevic to negotiate a quick end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear how Serbia's divided democrats will
capitalize on such unhappiness, which was voiced occasionally in
earlier wars in Bosnia and Croatia, and last year as the conflict
built in Kosovo. The demonstrations appear more related to the
length of the war than to Milosevic himself.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, whose comments calling for Milosevic's replacement
have endeared him to the West, has caused the biggest uproar.
Fearing for his life, he fled to Montenegro, where he sought the
protection of its anti-Milosevic leader, Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear quest for support once the bombs stop falling, the
two men have been traveling around Europe and even wrote an Op-Ed
article together for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's air war put democratic leaders here in a terrible
quandary, torn between their patriotism and their opposition to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Their contacts with Kosovo's Albanians have been weak, since the
Albanians largely absented themselves from Serbia's political life
for the last decade. The Albanian boycott of Serbian and Yugoslav
elections, the opposition feels, was one reason why Milosevic and
his allies won such elections, winning votes in Kosovo where
anti-Milosevic Albanian candidates could have won, had Albanians
voted.
</P>
<P>
   And Albanians have resented the failure of democratic Serbs to
speak out more strongly against police repression and, now, ethnic
purging in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For Serbia's opposition leaders, supporting NATO's air war
against their country would be a form of political suicide. Fearing
repression or even murder, most have shied away from criticizing
the Milosevic government too strongly.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of an independent publisher, Slavko Curuvija,
on April 11 further chilled political expression already limited by
wartime censorship. Opposition journalists and politicians
understood Curuvija's killing, after state media accused him of
being unpatriotic, as a clear message to them all.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, in an interview this week with the Bosnian Serb
magazine Reporter, said twice: ``I do not want to be Slavko
Curuvija.'' He explained that while in Belgrade, it was impossible
to get his views out to the public, saying: ``I can do more in
Montenegro regarding foreign contacts and preparing for an
after-war strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Djindjic may have done his political future enormous harm by
leaving Serbia, in contrast to a less popular opposition leader,
Vuk Obradovic, a former general and leader of the Social Democracy
party, who has remained in Belgrade while calling for Milosevic to
resign or to call new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Obradovic, in an interview, said the tires of his car have been
slashed and his top party officials threatened by police officers,
including a series of midnight visits to their apartments. But he
insists that ``Milosevic has more to fear from us than we have to
fear from him'' and that Milosevic must go ``not because the West
wants it, but because we want it.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior journalist here, reflecting the disillusioned mood of
even anti-Milosevic Serbs, said, ``If Djindjic is going to come
back now, it had better be in a NATO tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party itself is already split, with one of its
former vice presidents, Miodrag Perisic, accusing Djindjic of
``engaging in politics abroad'' against the party's charter and
suggesting that he will not be party president much longer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For two days straight, following the official attacks on
Djindjic's patriotism, the Democratic Party's downtown headquarters
were vandalized. Red paint spattered the facade, some windows were
broken and some slogans daubed, such as: ``Fifth column'' and
``This is your blood, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic's flight has also benefited his erstwhile partner in a
democratic alliance and his sharpest rival, Vuk Draskovic, who was
fired from the Milosevic government some weeks into the war, just
in time to keep some of his democratic credentials intact.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and Djindjic were leaders of the democratic alliance,
Zajedno, or Together, which demonstrated against Milosevic in the
winter of 1996-97 and won control of a number of cities, including
Belgrade, Nis and Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic won applause for speaking out against the killing of
Curuvija, and against censorship and the manipulation of war
patriotism by the political parties of Milosevic and his wife,
Mirjana Markovic, and of the ultranationalist, Vojislav Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic, regarded by many as a political opportunist, has
attacked Djindjic in fierce terms for being a coward. ``I am in
Serbia, under the bombs,'' he said last week. ``Zoran Djindjic has
fled the bombs, has fled the people and has fled his party. I do
not think that is honorable. I will not comment on anything
Djindjic says while he is out of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men split over Draskovic's ambitions to run for
president, and he has continued to prevent both Djindjic and
Obradovic from having access to Belgrade's television station,
Studio B, controlled by Draskovic's party.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Draskovic joined the Milosevic government,
contending that a unity government was needed to face the Kosovo
crisis and insisting that he would advocate change from inside.
Many people criticized him for naked ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But as a deputy prime minister, Draskovic used his access to the
news media, especially to Studio B, and his outspokenness helped
many to overcome the fear engendered by the killing of Curuvija.
</P>
<P>
   Given Milosevic's continuing political strength, some analysts
here believe that succession will be most easily accomplished by
someone perceived as transitional, who is not regarded as an enemy
of the Milosevic government. That is likely to be a younger member
of an allied party, such as the Yugoslav United Left.
</P>
<P>
   But among the opposition, Obradovic, the former general, could
be such a person, or the former mayor of Belgrade, Nebojsa Covic, a
Milosevic loyalist who broke with him on an issue of conscience.
Draskovic, for all his critics, is still thought to have strong
chances among a weak crew of democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Dragos Ivanovic, writing in Republika, a small independent
political monthly, sees Draskovic positioning himself to be the
compromise, transitional figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to his own rather confusing statements, Draskovic
will continue to stand for the same policies now as he did in the
government,'' Ivanovic wrote. ``Therefore he is neither in power
nor in the opposition _ neither fish nor fowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deciphering his moves can be understood as a kind of
speculative politics, which is careful not to be too close to the
opposition nor to distance himself too far from the ruling
circle.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ One month after the deadly shooting spree at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., a 15-year-old student
armed with two guns walked casually into the commons area of
Heritage High School here Thursday morning and opened fire,
wounding six students before surrendering to an assistant
principal, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the students remained hospitalized Thursday evening, and
none were considered to have life-threatening injuries. Three were
listed in good condition after suffering superficial gunshot wounds
to the lower extremities. One was listed in satisfactory condition
after a bullet lodged in her abdomen. Two others sustained minor
wounds and were released from a hospital in this middle-class exurb
about 30 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not publicly identified the suspect, who apparently
was disarmed and restrained by school officials after he fell to
his knees and placed a handgun in his mouth. But a large number of
students, including several of the estimated 150 students in the
commons area at the time of the shooting, said he is a quiet,
utterly average sophomore named T.J. Solomon who plays baseball in
a county league, attends church regularly, and participates in his
Boy Scout troop.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Cecil T. Brinkley, an assistant principal,
confronted the youngster as he had the gun in his mouth and asked
him to hand over the weapon. The student complied and began to sob:
``Oh my God, I'm so scared, I'm so scared,'' the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just doing my job,'' Brinkley said Thursday evening in
brief remarks at a news conference. ``I did what needed to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not identify the suspect because he is a
juvenile and is, for the time being, under the jurisdiction of the
juvenile courts. But Richard Reed, the Rockdale County district
attorney, said he would move next week to transfer the case to
Superior Court and to charge the suspect with multiple counts of
aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have yet to describe any possible motive for the
shootings, the sixth seemingly random assault at an American school
in the last 20 months. But two friends of Solomon's said in
interviews that he was distraught over recent troubles with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   One of Solomon's friends, Nathaniel B. Deeter, also a sophomore,
said that as recently as Wednesday Solomon had told him he was
going to kill himself. ``He said, `I really don't have a reason to
live anymore,''' Deeter said. ``I told him he was crazy. I mean, a
lot of kids say stuff like that and never do anything.'' Deeter
said he did not report the incident to anyone. Nor did he report
Solomon's remark to him a week ago that he had a lot of guns and
planned to bring one to school.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's friends said he had ready access to a large collection
of guns kept by his stepfather, Robert W. Daniele, in their
four-bedroom house on a more than one-acre lot in an impeccably
manicured, upper-middle class neighborhood not far from the school.
Skip Morgan, a 16-year-old neighbor who lives two doors away from
Solomon and was a regular visitor to the house, said that Solomon's
stepfather stored 12 to 15 rifles in a locked wood and glass
armoire in the basement, but that said Solomon knew how to open it.
He also said a drawer of the armoire was stocked with ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched the house and left with a personal computer,
among other items. They also searched Solomon's locker at the high
school. They said they were tracing the manufacturer and ownership
path of the weapons, which Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff T.
Wigington identified as a .22 caliber rifle and a revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Wigington said that part of the rifle's stock had been removed.
He said the suspect rode a school bus to Heritage High Thursday
morning, but he did not speculate when the student brought the
weapons to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Solomon, Donald A. Peccia, the superintendent of
the Rockdale County public schools, said that school records
revealed no warning signs about the suspect. ``The disciplinary
record would not indicate he had been any significant trouble,''
Peccia said. ``We had no reason to suspect this student at all.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton heard about the latest school shooting as he
was about to depart for Littleton to memorialize the victims of the
April 20 massacre at Columbine High, where a teacher and 14
students, including the two shooters, were killed. He said the news
``is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all Americans. We thank
God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be
life-threatening.''

COMMENTARY: THE PRICE OF ADMISSION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overwhelming sense coming out of Israel Thursday, in the
wake of the landslide victory of Ehud Barak over Benjamin
Netanyahu, is that of a national nightmare having ended. While
Netanyahu helped to create the new center in Israel, by breaking
down the divide over peace with the Palestinians, he was reluctant
to lead that new center forward. Instead he actually tried to
divide it and run against it, and in the end that center not only
defeated him but evicted him from Israeli politics. Israelis
declared that they wanted peace at home and peace abroad, they
wanted differences healed, not exploited, and they wanted to get on
with it already.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to be easy for Barak to achieve these lofty
goals. But the good news is that Israel will now be led by a
statesman who, when he confronts the still-formidable bumps in the
road, will not use them as an excuse for doubling back, will not
try to turn those bumps into mountains, but will actually try to
surmount them. Some of these bumps, such as the Golan Heights, are
very high. Success is not guaranteed. But I am convinced that with
Barak we will at least have an honest effort to get over them.
</P>
<P>
   His first test will be in the formation of his governing
coalition. Which parties will join, and on what terms? His
challenge, notes the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen, ``is to
bring the different parties into a national consensus with very
clear parameters _ rather than making the consensus include
everything and its opposite. His challenge will be to create a
government that is pluralistic in the parties it includes, but
unified in the policies it will pursue. That means that there
should be a real price of admission into the Barak government _
people will have to accept some things that are hard for them _ but
he has a mandate now to charge that admission price.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should pay what?
</P>
<P>
   Here's an early tout sheet of what Barak might charge. He will
try to bring into a national unity coalition either the Likud or
the Shas Party, which is made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic Jews, and possibly both. It would be politically
dangerous to leave both out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the Likud coming in will be that it drop its
insistence that no Israeli settlements in Gaza and the West Bank be
uprooted as part of a peace agreement _ otherwise no deal with the
Palestinians or Syria is possible. The price for Shas should be
twofold. One, Shas, whose leader, Aryeh Deri, was convicted on
corruption charges, will have to cease its attacks on the Israeli
supreme court and secular law. Second, Shas will have to start
taking steps to ensure that its youth, if they don't serve in the
army, at least contribute some form of national service.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's majority clearly declared in this election that the
ultra-Orthodox cannot expect to claim ever-larger slices of the
national budget, to which they contribute so little, while their
youths are wards of the state and avoid army service.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will want the Palestinians and surrounding Arab states as
silent coalition partners as well. The Arabs need to read the
message of this election too. It says to them: ``The peace process
now belongs to the center of Israeli society, and it's time for you
Arabs to bring it into the center of your societies as well. Stop
threatening us with what happens if there is no peace and start
doing what's necessary (like visiting Israel) to nurture it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Barak's own Labor Party, the price of a successful coalition
is also twofold. It too is going to have to clearly decide just how
much land to hold for Israeli security in the West Bank and Golan.
At the same time, Barak's party will have to start thinking more
seriously about taking Judaism more seriously. The old
Ben-Gurionite division of labor, where the ultra-Orthodox get to
decide what it means to be Jewish in Israel, while the secularites
get to run everything else, has collapsed. Barak doesn't want to go
from Bibi's extreme _ which was kowtowing to the ultra-Orthodox _
to the other extreme of treating them with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing we have learned from the past few years it
is that without a measure of peace at home, based on some real
shared principles, it is impossible for any Israeli cabinet to hang
together for the even tougher decisions needed for peace abroad.

 &HT;    Senate votes to require background checks on gun show sales
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Vice President Al Gore casting the
tie-breaking vote, the Senate voted Thursday to require background
checks on the sale of all firearms at gun shows, dealing a stinging
defeat to the powerful gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The background check provision, part of a $1 billion juvenile
crime bill, would affect some 2.5 million gun sales, roughly half
of all guns sold in the United States every year. The Senate was
moving toward final passage of the entire juvenile justice bill
late Thursday night after more than a week of tumultuous debate
over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-50 vote requiring background checks at gun shows was a
setback for Senate Republicans, who sought to derail the
Democratic-sponsored initiative with a less restrictive proposal of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists on both sides of the aisle said Thursday's shooting
in Conyers, Ga., didn't influence votes. But the latest incidence
of school violence, coming on the one-month anniversary of the
deadly school shootings in Littleton, Colo., hung heavy in the
Senate chamber as senators prepared to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone woke up this morning wavering ... they got a huge
wake up call in Georgia,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
``This morning's news was yet another reminder of gun violence in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the wavering senators was Georgia's Max Cleland, who
reversed his opposition to the gun show provision after the
sponsor, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), made some minor changes
dealing with the definition of gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the shooting in Conyers, occurring in the ``back
yard'' of his native Lithonia, reinforced his decision that gun
shows should be more tightly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the icing on the cake,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebullient after their victory, Democrats called Thursday's vote
the biggest defeat for the National Rifle Association and other gun
interests since Republicans regained control of the Congress in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw is the NRA loosing its grip on the U.S.
Senate at long last,'' declared Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the
minority leader. ``This is a huge victory today.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre issued a terse
statement following the vote, calling the Senate's action
``made-for-television lawmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our schools,''
LaPierre said. ``The American people want existing gun laws
enforced and their Second Amendment freedoms protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates, meanwhile, hailed the decision as a
long-overdue change needed to keep guns out of the hands of
children and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one week, the Senate has closed the gun show loophole,
mandated the sale of trigger locks, prohibited further import of
military-style, large ammunition clips and prohibited violent
juveniles from ever owning a firearm,'' said Sarah Brady,
chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc. ``It has taken five years and
far too many dead children for Congress to break the gun lobby's
stranglehold on common-sense gun regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who number 45 in the Senate, lost only one of their
members in voting for the gun show provision, Sen. Max Baucus
(D-Mont.). Six Republicans crossed party lines to vote for the
measure, setting up the opportunity for Gore to cast the dramatic,
tie-breaking vote. Gore, who serves as president of the Senate, has
broken only three other ties in his seven years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's tie vote also gave Gore, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination for president, an opportunity to step to the
forefront of an issue that concerns many voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just elated over this victory,'' Gore said after the
vote, making a special mention of the shooting in Georgia. ``Until
we get more control in a sensible way on the easy availability of
guns in our society ... these tragedies will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week ago, Republicans pushed through a measure that
would have made background checks at gun shows voluntary. In an
abrupt turnaround, they offered another proposal that required some
checks, but created some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In a final bid to head off the Democratic initiative, Sens. Jim
Jeffords (R-Vt.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) offered a proposal that
would close some of the loopholes for gun show sales and require
anyone purchasing a firearm at a pawn shop to undergo a background
check.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment passed by a wide margin, 79 to 21, but failed to
draw enough Republicans away from also supporting Lautenberg's
stricter provisions. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) voted against both
gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats were quick to see political fallout
from the votes. Coverdell said Gore's close association with gun
control would not help him win support among independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), the Senate Democratic campaign
chair, called the gun votes ``the principal defining issue between
Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very costly week for Republicans in the Senate,''
he said. ``And it will cost them some seats in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the GOP campaign chairman, said
each Republican cast a vote that was right for the member's state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've all voted in a way that will work for them,''
McConnell said.

 &HT;    Georgia senator changes vote to support gun control, fellow
official firmly against measure
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By Wednesday afternoon, Democratic leaders in the
Senate were cautiously optimistic that they had sealed up the votes
to pass a restrictive gun control measure requiring background
checks for all gun sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) was a key figure in their last-minute
vote tallies. Cleland had voted against the first gun show
amendment, part of the multibillion dollar juvenile justice bill,
the week before.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland's staff and staff members from the office of Sen.
Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), the gun show amendment's sponsor, had
been negotiating for several days to secure Cleland's support.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg agreed to tighten the definition of gun shows to make
clear that sales between neighbors wouldn't be affected, one of
Cleland's demands, and received Cleland's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   We ``were talking and he said, 'I think we've got a deal,'''
Lautenberg said. ``I think we satisfied him by reducing the edge on
a couple of things we had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The original concern I had was that if you cracked down on the
gun shows, you are going to force this out into the street, the
black market and onto the Internet, where there is no regulation at
all,'' said Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleland's vote locked up, Lautenberg and other Democratic
leaders called Vice President Gore to inform him that he should be
on hand for Thursday's vote to break a potential tie. Lautenberg
was counting on at least six Republicans to help push the gun show
measure over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg also took into account the voting of Sen. Paul
Coverdell (R-Ga.). Coverdell, who voted against all of the more
restrictive gun control proposals, views Lautenberg as one of the
Senate's most strident gun control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell decided early on that he wouldn't be on the same side
of any initiative offered by the New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lautenberg is a gun control, anti-Second Amendment
enthusiast,'' Coverdell said after Thursday's votes. ``There is no
chance I would view Lautenberg as creating a balanced, concrete
agenda. He's the guru of the idea that you can manage these events
by controlling guns, skipping over what people do who have either
guns or bombs. He just doesn't have any credibility on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who has received $14,635 from gun interests in direct
contributions in the past six years, said no one from the National
Rifle Association lobbied him to vote against any of the gun
control measures adopted as part of the juvenile justice bill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the restrictions on gun shows, the Senate also
voted over the past week to require child safety locks or lock
boxes to be sold with any hand gun, and to require background
checks for guns bought at pawn shops. Coverdell voted against both
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly think that most of our schools are quite safe and
that drugs are the major threat, not weapons,'' Coverdell said.
``There were 22 laws broken in Littleton. Does anybody think that
if we had 35 of them ... it would have made a difference? The
answer is obvious, no. But I guess politics being of the sound bite
nature that it is, it just can't restrain itself. Every time
something happens, 50 people stand up and say we're going to solve
it because we write something down on a piece of paper.''

ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIP WITH WEB CUSTOMER WAVE OF FUTURE, AUTHOR
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (Repeating for all needing) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a world where companies asked for your ``permission''
before slapping a billboard alongside the highway or piping a
television commercial into your living room.
</P>
<P>
   While such strategies would never fly on Madison Avenue, such an
approach might represent the secret to effective marketing in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument put forward by Web entrepreneur Seth Godin
in a book published this month, ``Permission Marketing: Turning
Strangers Into Friends and Friends Into Customers'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $24, 255 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Godin, who started the Web marketing firm Yoyodyne, which last
year was purchased by Web search engine parent Yahoo!, makes the
case that consumers suffering from media overload have little time
to pay attention to anything and, hence, are increasingly tuning
out many of the mostly irrelevant TV commercials, billboards and
newspaper advertising that bombard them daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's infoglut, people are more selfish than ever,''
Godin writes. ``And they're most selfish about their time and
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What consumers will pay attention to, Godin says, are
personalized messages from marketers with advertising that touches
issues they are interested in. The consumers most likely to be
receptive to these messages are those who have asked to be placed
on a marketer's electronic mailing list, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   For companies, the idea is to give consumers incentives for
initiating an ongoing dialogue. A marketer, for exmple, may offer a
coupon or gift certificate to a consumer signing up to an
electronic mailing list. The marketer then sends follow-up e-mail
messages to the consumer at regular intervals offering more
coupons, highlighting special deals or simply providing
newsletter-style information to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must find a reason for the prospect to pay attention,''
Godin writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to offer an explicit reward-information, education,
entertainment or even cold hard cash to get the consumer to opt in
to the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a process may sound difficult and expensive. But it may be
more efficient to focus marketing efforts on building a small set
of good customers rather than using the shotgun approach of
mass-market advertising to deliver a message to thousands of people
who couldn't care less about your product or service, Godin writes.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to build lasting relationships with consumers. And
with the cost of sending e-mail small, the expense of sending
frequent messages that can build customer loyalty and future sales
is negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permission marketing cuts through the clutter and allows a
marketer to speak to prospects as friends, not strangers,'' Godin
writes. ``The personalized, anticipated, frequent and relevant
communication has infinitely more impact than a random message
displayed in a random place at a random moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Godin's book is more than a primer on Web-based direct
marketing. It reminds marketers of some fundamentals that can help
transform a wayward shopper into a customer for life.
</P>
<P>
   The author weaves a variety of examples from outside the realm
of cyberspace to illustrate the power that ``permission marketing''
can wield in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the best-known permission marketing campaigns of
all time is American Airlines' frequent-flyer rewards program.
Customers hand over key personal information to the airline in
exchange for rewards that ultimately make them more loyal customers
of the airline. American Airlines then takes the information
collected from its reward program to offer users sets of coupons
and services tailored to match their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the one-to-one communication power of the Web,
consumers may expect more companies to begin offering rewards to
shoppers who will spend the time listening to their sales pitches
and share information.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies that are most aggressive in forging these
bonds with consumers will have the inside track on selling to users
_ perhaps for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every industry, just a few companies will end up with the
permission to market to a huge number of qualified customers,''
Godin writes. ``And when that happens, these companies _
gatekeepers _ will start to exert power.''
</P>

RAYTHEON MOVES TO END SUIT OVER CHAT-BOARD POSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Raytheon Co. ended a controversial lawsuit against 21
people it alleged had disclosed inside company information on an
Internet chat board.
</P>
<P>
   In a court filing Thursday attorneys for Raytheon moved to
dismiss the suit charging a group of computer users had revealed
financial secrets on a World Wide Web chat board operated by Yahoo
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Four employees identified in the suit have since left the
company, and Raytheon said it has now done enough to protect its
private financial information.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by the Lexington, Mass. defense contractor, filed in
February, was one of the widest-ranging to date as companies seek
to clamp down on individuals' chat about them posted on line. It
also drew attention to the ease with which Raytheon was able to
identify Internet denizens despite their use of anonymous screen
names.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon believed at least some of the 21 people it called
``John Does'' were current or former employees, though it knew them
only by their handles, such as ``RaytheonVeteran'' and
``RSCDeepThroat.''
</P>
<P>
   The chat postings caused more than $25,000 in damages and harmed
Raytheon's business reputation, the suit alleged, mentioning
e-mails that proported to describe earnings expectations and stock
forecasts, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   To learn the real identities of the authors, Raytheon obtained
discovery motions against Yahoo and other portals and Internet
service providers. As a result, it was able to learn the identities
of at least some users.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon now says it plans no further disciplinary actions. ``We
think it brings the matter to a close,'' said spokesman David Polk.
``Our internal activities are over.''
</P>
<P>
   But debate about the case is likely to continue, as Internet
free-speech groups have accused Internet service companies of
caving in to Raytheon's demands while giving users the impression
they would do more to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Courts should be wary of such demands for discovery, said David
Sobel, chief counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an example of why courts should be
apprehensive about allowing this kind of discovery,'' Sobel said.
The complaint ``shows the potential for an abuse of the discovery
system in removing the anonymity from speakers on the Interet,''
Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   One person targeted by the suit also charged that its withdrawal
showed Raytheon wasn't sincere in seeking to recover damages. ``The
whole pretense is false,'' the person said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``They were really just after the identities.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Polk said the case was necessary to protect internal
company affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rationale was, we feel we have to make a commitment to
protecting our proprietary information,'' Polk said. ``We took
steps we felt were appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard the suit seems to have worked. Lately the Yahoo
message board devoted to Raytheon has contained far less specific
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now the most spirited messages are related to an upcoming union
election at Local 1505 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, which represents thousands of local employees.

 &HT;    CLINTON, IN COLORADO, URGES UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Hours after the nation's latest school
shootings rocked suburban Atlanta on Thursday, President Clinton
called on the students of Columbine High School to honor the
victims of last month's killings here by working to change the
``culture of violence'' that spawned both tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made a plea for understanding as he spoke to about
2,000 Columbine students, faculty and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dark forces that take over people, and make them murder,
are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage with which every
human being has to do combat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, the more you'll know that a great deal of
life is the struggle against every person's own smallness and fear
and anger, and a continuing effort not to blame other people for
our own shortcomings or our fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton journeyed here on a long-planned visit to address the
nation one month to the day after two Columbine students opened
fire on their classmates, killing 12 students and a teacher and
wounding 23 others before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address took on added poignancy, however, following
the Thursday morning shootings at the Heritage High School outside
Atlanta. That incident left six students wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully no one was killed,'' first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton said of Thursday's incident, ``but it should never have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was en route to Littleton aboard Air Force One,
Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote back in
Washington to pass Senate juvenile justice legislation. The bill,
which now goes to the House, is aimed at making it easier to
prosecute juveniles as young as 14 for violent crimes and to
require background checks before firearms are sold at gun shows and
pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking in the White House Rose Garden before leaving
for Colorado, said the Atlanta shooting ``is deeply troubling to
me, as it is to all Americans,'' and pointed to the need for
closing gun control loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident, again, should underscore how profoundly
important it is that all Americans come together in the face of
these events to protect our children from violence,'' Clinton said.
``We have got to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in this Denver suburb on a grey day marked by a brief
hailstorm, the president and first lady visited with families of
the Columbine victims.
</P>
<P>
   Seated around tables set up in the sanctuary of the Light of the
World Catholic Church, the families shared their stories and passed
around homemade scrapbooks memorializing their lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   If the mood in that closed-door session was intimate and somber,
there was a strikingly different atmosphere moments later, when
Clinton walked onto the dais at a jammed gymnasium at the Dakota
Ridge High School, just three miles from Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Columbine,'' the students chanted. Clinton hailed the
boisterous show of spirit as a sign of the powerful renewal
sweeping this wounded community.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the students to harness that spirit to the goal of
helping to build an American society less tolerant of violence and
more forgiving of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a culture of values, instead of a culture of
violence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow what happened to you has pierced the soul of America
and it gives you a chance to be heard in a way no one else can be
heard,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us to build a better future for all our children,'' said
Clinton. ``A future where society guards our children better
against violent influences and weapons that can break the dam of
decency and humanity in the most vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stressed, though, that it won't be easy to cure
the nation's epidemic of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot do what we need to do in America unless every person
is committed to doing something better and different in every walk
of life,'' Clinton said, ``beginning with parents and students and
going all the way to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really meant a lot to us'' that the president came here,
said Columbine freshman Vickie Abel, 15. ``It's going to make us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly dramatic moment, cheers rang out when Clinton
introduced two Columbine students _ Sean Graves and Patrick Ireland
_ who emerged from the hospital where they have been recovering
from wounds received in the shootings to attend Thursday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the students to remember during their commencement
ceremonies Saturday that theirs is a special class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be bittersweet,'' Clinton said. But he urged them to
listen for the support of their nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear the voice of America,'' Clinton said, ``because America
will be cheering you on.''

GORE BREAKS TIE AS SENATE PASSES GUN MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Vice President Al Gore breaking a tie, the
Senate on Thursday voted to require instant background checks for
purchasers at gun shows and before redemption of a gun at a pawn
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decisive role in adoption of the Democratic-sponsored
amendment is the latest in a series of developments that point
toward gun control emerging as a pivotal issue early in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' Gore said.
``Finally, this majority is turning the corner and helping to
protect the children and families of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   All but six Senate Republicans opposed the measure, and only one
Democrat supported it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans,
voted against the proposal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The amendment became part of a bill, designed to combat
juvenile crime, that was headed for a final vote in the Senate
later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, playing on their belief that gun control has become a
popular issue, especially in swing suburban constituencies, had
earlier won approval of an amendment that requires handguns to be
sold with safety devices or trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., threatened last week
to withdraw the measure from Senate consideration, but by Thursday
he was ready to allow a final vote so the politically troublesome
measure could be shipped to the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has signaled support for
new restrictions on gun sales, but it was uncertain if he can rally
support from enough fellow Republicans, including the leadership
duo from Texas, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority
Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic Senate vote came as President Clinton flew to
Littleton, Colo., a month after the deadly gun violence at
Columbine High School, and as another school gun incident unfolded
in an Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Gore to congratulate him for the vote. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton praised the Senate for
taking ``the common-sense approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Littleton, Clinton said: ``I applaud the Senate for
today's historic vote to close the gun-show loophole and keep guns
out of the hands of criminals and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was on an amendment by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
which in a slightly different form was narrowly defeated last week.
The changes attracted the critical vote of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,
creating a 50-50 tie, which Gore broke.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland and other supporters of the measure said he had decided
to switch his vote before the wounding of six students at a
Conyers, Ga., high school.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said, however, that the shooting in his home state
``really confirmed for me that I was on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of strict gun control invoked the latest incident to
press for passage of the mandatory checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much longer are we going to embrace the gun lobby?'' asked
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who while in the House was a major
sponsor of the 1993 law, known as the Brady bill, that first
required a waiting period on gun sales through licensed outlets and
barred gun purchases by felons and the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates said the vote marked a major loss for the
firearms lobby, including the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw is the NRA losing its grip on the United
States Senate, at long last,'' declared Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   NRA leaders vowed to fight additional restrictions on gun sales
and said that ``the Clinton-Gore administration'' was ``pursuing a
charade of lawmaking without law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our schools,''
NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and NRA top lobbyist
James J. Baker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders buttonholed some of the handful of GOP
senators who supported Lautenberg's amendment last week, but they
were unable to convince any of them to switch. With the roll call
in progress, Lott importuned Sen. John Warner, R-Va., publicly on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican majority, traditionally opposed to most
gun controls, has seemed uncertain how to react in the wake of the
rash of school shootings and polls showing big majorities in favor
of cracking down on easy access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Republicans first voted against mandatory background
checks at gun shows, but reversed themselves two days later.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats complained that the GOP-backed approach had
loopholes, many Republicans voted earlier Thursday to tighten some
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby steps,'' chided Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. But in case the
Lautenberg amendment might fail, a number of Democrats voted for
the GOP proposal by Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, which passed
79-21.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's amendment was overridden by passage of Lautenberg's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's proposal would have given state authorities only 24
hours to run a background check on gun buyers, rather than the
three days allowed on purchases at licensed retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had been alerted Wednesday night to the possibility of
a tie, arrived at the Capitol shortly before the vote. It was the
fourth tie-breaking vote of Gore's more than six years as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in favor of the Lautenberg amendment were 44 Democrats
and six Republicans _ Sens. John Chaffee of Rhode Island, Mike
DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Richard Lugar of
Indiana, George Voinovich of Ohio and Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against were 49 Republicans and Democratic Sen. Max
Baucus of Montana.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a charged moment, Vice President Al Gore made a
rare Senate appearance Thursday and cast a tie-breaking vote that
enabled a Democratic gun-control measure to prevail over a less
stringent Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-50 vote, approving a measure to require background checks
with the sale of firearms at gun shows, reversed the outcome of a
similar vote last week and was easily the most stunning of a string
of Democratic victories on gun control in the Senate over the last
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided Gore, whose campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination has yet to catch fire, with a heady
triumph. Democrats believe that American sentiment about firearms
has turned toward their party's advocacy of tighter restrictions,
and Gore got to carry that banner by playing the knight who arrived
in the nick of time to save a teetering cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voted on the same day that bullets ripped through yet
another high school, in Conyers, Ga. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said
the shooting was a factor in clinching his decision to switch his
vote in favor of his party's measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, for his part, was visiting Littleton, Colo.,
where the shooting deaths of 15 people at a high school last month
altered the political climate enough to make Thursday's events in
the Senate possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' said Gore, a
radiant smile glued to his face, at a news conference after he left
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   More somberly, Gore added, ``Now I personally would like to
dedicate my tie-breaking vote to all of the families that have
suffered from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time in Gore's vice presidency that he
broke a tie in the Senate, over which the vce president technically
presides.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a seat at the head of the chamber as the votes
trickled in, and as the possibility of a tie seemed ever more
likely, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., giggled and flashed a
thumbs-up sign at the vice president. Other Senate Democrats rushed
over to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans have a 55-to-45 advantage in the Senate,
six Republicans who have repeatedly broken party ranks on gun
control sided with Democrats Thursday, while only one Democrat
sided with Republicans. That created the tie.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was attached to a juvenile crime bill, that would
provide $1 billion a year to states for prevention and enforcement.
A similar bill before the House Judiciary Committee does not have
gun-control measures in it, but the committee's chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced Thursday that such amendments would
be considered when the committee meets to reshape the bill in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Senate voted on the gun show amendment,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called a news conference to
raise a different issue: the leaking of nuclear secrets during the
Clinton administration to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the success of the Democratic gun-show amendment,
which he opposed, Lott said that the Democrats' campaign for gun
control was largely political preening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns don't cause people to do these things,'' Lott said.
``Something in their beings is doing it. When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a statement released in Littleton, said, ``I
applaud the Senate for today's historic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official described the Lott news conference as
an attempt to divert attention away from his party's gun-control
``debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gun-show amendment, which would mandate
background checks on all people buying weapons at these shows,
joined a series of a half dozen gun-control measures that have
passed as amendments to the juvenile crime bill. Many of the
measures garnered broad Republican support, an unmistakable sign of
changed times.
</P>
<P>
   The bill itself, which calls for about $1 billion annually in
grants to local governments to toughen the prosecution of juvenile
crime and enhance efforts to prevent it, had not come to a final
vote by early Thursday night, but seemed likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Democratic gun-show amendment was the last
strange twist in a bizarre chain of gun-show votes that had
Republicans switching their course or tweaking their position from
one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic gun-show amendment first came up for a vote
a week ago, Senate Republicans defeated it, 51-47, in a largely
party-line vote. Instead, they approved a rival Republican
amendment that called for voluntary background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Senate Republicans rethought their position and
passed a new gun-show amendment that they said made background
checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that the combined Republican amendments
actually relaxed existing gun-control regulations in other areas.
So the Republicans came back with a third amendment, intended to
address concerns about the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment passed Thursday. But only minutes later, the
original Democratic amendment, modified slightly and reintroduced,
supplanted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new outcome was explained in part by the presence of two
Democrats _ Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Daniel
Inouye of Hawaii _ who had been absent last week but voted in favor
of the amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critically, Sen. Cleland of Georgia, one of only two
Democrats who had opposed the measure last week, changed his vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that, because of subtle revisions to the original
Democratic amendment, he had almost firmly decided to switch his
vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that awaking Thursday morning to news of the
shooting in his home state erased any tiny, lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to occur in my own state, in my own back yard,
reinforced and steeled my commitment,'' Cleland said. ``It pushed
me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat to vote against his party Thursday was Max
Baucus of Montana, whose position suggested the degree to which
geography trumps party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six Republicans who joined Democrats last week and
again Thursday were from the Midwest, where support for easy access
to firearms is not as fierce as in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio.
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator John Warner of
Virginia also voted for the Democratic amendment.
</P>
<P>
   These senators said they had problems with several aspects of
the Republican gun-show measures that even a third amendment did
not fix. The measures, for example, would have made it less
cumbersome for licensed gun dealers to sell weapons in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also would have shortened from three business days
to 24 hours the amount of time given to vendors at gun shows to
conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big loophole,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had lobbied against the
Democratic gun-show amendment and, after the vote, said that the
Senate had not addressed a larger problem: lax enforcement of
existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that the association's influence was clearly
waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen today now is, for the first time in a major
kind of gun-control issue, rejection of the National Rifle
Association and a vote for common sense,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control measures in the juvenile crime bill include a
requirement that licensed gun dealers sell child safety devices
with every handgun; a prohibition on gun ownership for anyone who
commits a violent crime as a juvenile, and new restrictions on the
purchase and possession of semi-automatic assault rifles for
children under 18.

 &HT;    Quiet suspect was more talkative when topic was his guns,
friends say
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Heritage High School shooting suspect was quiet,
friends said, unless he was talking about guns.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he gave his neighbors, Skip and Brad Morgan, a
tour of his house, he didn't say much.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the boys admired the posters of baseball greats Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGuire in the suspect's bedroom, he remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   But when Skip, 17, and Brad, 15, followed the boy into the
basement, the teen started rattling on about his stepfather's
firearms, locked in a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was full of big, heavy assault rifles,'' Skip remembered.
``He told us the bullets were in the cabinet below the guns and he
knew where the key was.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested the Morgan's 15-year-old neighbor Thursday after
he allegedly shot six fellow students at the Conyers' high school.
</P>
<P>
   GBI agents looking for answers searched the 3,000-square-foot,
four-bedroom house in the Hanover Square subdivision the boy shares
with his mother, stepfather and little sister.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents were not talking to reporters Thursday. But
the boy's friends and neighbors said they saw changes in the boy,
who was a clean-cut Boy Scout when the family moved to Conyers in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The move came when the stepfather, a trucking company executive,
was transferred from Kernersville, N.C., to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The boy spent his time playing a Mortal Combat video game or
shooting arrows into a target in his back yard, Skip said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Morgan boys went to the suspect's house last summer to
invite him outside to play baseball, he passed on a message through
his little sister that he wasn't coming out. He wouldn't go
swimming in the Morgan's pool, either.
</P>
<P>
   Skip was someone the boy had spent time with five days a week.
They carpooled together going to and from summer school classes
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Skip's dad, Allan Morgan, remembers the boy sitting in the back
of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a heck of a lot of conversation,'' Allan Morgan
said. ``If you tried to bring him into the conversation, he'd just
look at you and stare.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in those summer classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him with anyone,'' said Kelsey Garrett, the
school's football team manager who attended a summer school class
with the suspect. He sat behind Kelsey the whole time, and he
virtually never spoke, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the boy began hanging out with 16-year-old
Glen Ganyard III and Glen's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Like any high school, Heritage has its cliques. There are the
jocks and the brains. Then there are Glen's friends. Glen says his
buddies are the freaks and the rednecks.
</P>
<P>
   To fit in, Glen and Skip said their friend ditched his preppy
clothes and began wearing baggy pants and scrungy-looking shirts.
He stayed in Boy Scouts, but didn't tell his new friends about it.
He got a girlfriend, but talked bad about her to Glen and she
recently broke up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year and a half he's been going down,'' Skip said.
``He'd either put gel in his hair or it would be real greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen said the 15-year-old was boastful and would pick fights but
back down when other boys took his challenge, Glen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 10-feet tall and bullet-proof,'' Glen said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the suspect got a handgun. He told Glen his parents gave it
to him as a gift. The suspect told Glen his parents took the
handgun away from him recently when they learned the boy carried it
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he knew where it was hid,'' Glen said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning at the boy's bus stop was just like any other
day. He showed up and said nothing as he waited with his sister,
along with Brad and Brad's little sister.
</P>
<P>
   Glen, who recently got his driver's license, drove up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up, man?'' Glen asked, as the boy leaned into the
window of Glen's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' the boy responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got any cigarettes?'' Glen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess we'll see you in school,'' Glen said and drove
off.

US CHARGES SCAM IN OPERATION OF DATA FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Founded in 1995, Multinational Systems Corp. claimed
to be a national conglomerate with offices across the country and
$100 million in annual sales. But federal prosecutors alleged
Thursday the high-tech data recovery firm was little more than a
racket that scammed $20 million from lenders it duped.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge company ``was primarily a sham . . . for the
financial benefit of MSC and its principals,'' according to an
indictment in US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a group of very smart, very sophisticated, very
creative people who saw an opportunity to take advantage of the
leasing industry,'' said assistant US attorney Allison Burroughs.
``They did very well at it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Stephen Chan, the company's founder, denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Chan is a young, extremely bright engineer,'' said Atty.
Stephen R. Delinsky. ``He's absolutely incapable of the financial
shenanigans alleged in this indictment. At all times, he acted
under the advice of paid professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan, 27, an MIT graduate, was arrested at his parents' New York
home last August and charged with violating wire-fraud laws shortly
after FBI agents raided MSC's Marlborough, Mass. offices. A federal
magistrate allowed him to remain free following his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's indictment alleges 27 counts of money laundering,
mail fraud, and wire fraud. Others named in the indictment include
Michelle Lee, who allegedly oversaw the company's financial
affairs; William Hulse, an MSC employee; and Dennis Burns, a
financial consultant at Merrill Lynch in Williamsville, N.Y., who
allegedly lied to prospective lenders about MSC's financial
standing. If convicted on all counts, Chan faces a maximum penalty
of 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   MSC claimed to be a so-called ``disaster recovery'' firm in the
rapidly expanding business of helping companies recover or protect
electronic data in catastrophes such as fire or flood, according to
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a sprawling compound in Marlborough that Chan
once referred to as ``the ultimate bunker'' in a newspaper profile,
the company rented offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York's
Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The company performed a modest computer tape pick-up service,
according to the indictment. But MSC's daily operations ``consisted
largely of obtaining lease financing from various lenders by means
of false and fraudulent representations,'' the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The company allegedly used forged opinion letters from a
Japanese accounting firm, fake financial statements, and a
fictitious bank account to convince lenders it was a legitimate
company and obtain huge loans for equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being used to buy equipment, however, the money was
usually dispersed among MSC's principals and various MSC
subsidiaries, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   In one deal detailed in Thursday's filing, Federated Capital
Services of Farmington Hills, Mich., financed the purchase of
$900,000 worth of vehicles, including two Land Rovers, two Lincoln
limousines and a Mercedes Benz.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every year around August or September, the senior
executives from the world's largest producers of vitamins would
gather clandestinely for a few days at a European hotel or an
executive's home for what some called the ``top-notch meeting'' and
others the ``summit conference'' to plan ``the budget for Vitamin
Inc,'' federal prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the meeting set production quotas, prices and
distribution for vitamin ingredients that were used to enrich
products in every refrigerator and kitchen cabinet in America, from
morning supplemental pills to enriched milk and orange juice,
fortified breakfast cereals, breads, butters and meats. The global
market for such vitamins as A, B2 (riboflavin), B5, C, E and Beta
Carotene would be divided among the participants to the
half-percentage point, the prosecutors said. A few months later,
according to the officials, the budget would be reviewed by
mid-level executives to determine whether everything was working as
planned, or whether the details should be adjusted to reflect
corporate profits and world-wide demand.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides Thursday described in
detail a decade-long vitamin cartel that they said had been
shattered in one of the largest criminal prosecutions ever made by
the Justice Department. In a federal court in Dallas, F.
Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, pleaded
guilty to one criminal count of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act
and agreed to pay a $500 million penalty, the largest criminal fine
ever imposed by the Justice Department. A second company, BASF of
Germany, has agreed to pay a $250 million fine for its role in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing a management shakeup on Thursday, including the
departure of top officials in its vitamins division, RocheHolding
AG, the parent company, said that it expects ``substantial further
fines'' in Europe and Canada. It may also face potentially crushing
damages in class-action lawsuits that have been filed by consumers
and companies that bought or used vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here to announce the initial results of the
investigation, Reno and other senior officials described a global
conspiracy to fix prices. They said one Swiss executive had agreed
to return to the United States to serve a jail sentence, he was not
the highest ranking official involved in the price-fixing scheme,
and that at least seven other executives and a dozen smaller
companies remained under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis for the past 10 years, every American
consumer paid to eat and drink or use a product whose price was
artificially inflated,'' Reno said. ``Day by day, consumers took a
hit in their wallet so that these co-conspirators could reap
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said that the conspiracy affected more than $5
billion of commerce ``in products found in every American
household.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that the director of worldwide
marketing for the vitamins division of Hoffman-La Roche had agreed
to travel from his home in Switzerland to the United States to
plead guilty to antitrust and cover-up charges, pay a $100,000 fine
and serve a four-month prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were said to have been particularly angry at the
executive, Kuno Sommer, because they said he had lied about the
existence of the vitamin cartel and his role following Roche's
guilty plea in another antitrust price-fixing case two years ago.
In that case, involving citric acid, Roche paid a $14 million fine
and promised to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, who had lived in New Jersey when he served as North
American regional manager for Roche, denied in a 1997 interview
with investigators that there was a vitamin cartel and said he was
not aware of any meetings or conversations involving price-fixing
in that market, according to court papers filed by the government
Thursday that are part of his plea-agreement. In fact, at that
time, he was still playing an important role in setting vitamin
prices and allocating market share, according to a plea agreement
filed on his behalf Thursday in federal court in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Department officials said that Sommer was not the
highest-level executive who knew about the conspiracy and coverup,
they did not say who might be prosecuted next. Among the executives
who did not receive immunity in the deal reached with Roche were
Roland Bronnimann, president of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals
Division, and Andreas Hauri, a former executive vice president and
head of global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin D. Hirsch, a Roche spokesman, said that both Sommer and
Bronniman had left the company and that it would take a one-time
special charge to pay for the Justice Department case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're redoubling our existing efforts to insure that people at
all levels of our organization receive training on proper business
policies,'' Hirsch said. ``We want to make it clear that any
improper practices will not be condoned by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The long investigation got its big break three months ago, when
Rhone-Polenc of France, one of the members of the cartel, came
forward with crucial evidence in order to avoid prosecution.
Lawyers said that Rhone-Polenc had decided to cooperate in large
part because of a pending $22 billion merger with Hoechst AG, which
cannot be completed without the approval of antitrust officials in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Spratling, head of the antitrust division's criminal
section, said that top executives had treated the industry as one
huge company that they called ``Vitamin Inc.'' Spratling said the
executives ``took great pains to conceal the activity,'' issuing
instructions to destroy all records and notes of their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the vitamin cartel was as bad as they get,'' said
Spratling, an official in the antitrust division for 28 years.
``Nothing was left to chance _ or, more accurately, to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Spratling said that federal sentencing guidelines allowed the
government to seek fines as large as $1.3 billion against Roche and
$300 million against BASF. But prosecutors decided on the lower
figures as part of the deal reached with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fine imposed Thursday on Roche dwarfed the previous record
cases. The largest total fine collected by the Justice Department
before now had been $340 million paid by Daiwa Bank in 1996 for
fraud and coverup in a large securities fraud case. And the largest
previous fines imposed by the antitrust division occurred earlier
this year, when SGL Carbon agreed to pay $135 million and UCAR
International $110 million for their role in a cartel that had
controlled the market for graphite electrodes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, with more than four months remaining in its fiscal
year, the Justice Department's antitrust division has already
collected $913 million, substantially more money than the total
amount collected in its entire history.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamins cartel case grew out of a smaller investigation
into price-fixing in the additives market that involved some of the
same companies at the heart of the price-fixing inquiry. That
investigation ultimately led to a $100 million fine imposed upon
Archer Daniels Midland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that the vitamins case is one of more than 30
investigations now under way of international cartels in a variety
of industries.

GORE BREAKS TIE AS SENATE PASSES GUN MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Vice President Al Gore breaking a tie, the
Senate on Thursday voted to require instant background checks for
purchasers at gun shows and before redemption of a gun at a pawn
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decisive role in adoption of the Democratic-sponsored
amendment is the latest in a series of developments that point
toward gun control emerging as a pivotal issue early in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' Gore said.
``Finally, this majority is turning the corner and helping to
protect the children and families of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   All but six Senate Republicans opposed the measure, and only one
Democrat voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans,
voted against the proposal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The amendment became part of a bill, designed to combat
juvenile crime, that was headed for a final vote in the Senate
later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, playing on their belief that gun control has become a
popular issue, especially in swing suburban constituencies, had
earlier won approval of an amendment that requires handguns to be
sold with safety devices or trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., threatened last week
to withdraw the measure from Senate consideration, but by Thursday
he was ready to allow a final vote so the politically troublesome
measure could be shipped to the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has signaled support for
new restrictions on gun sales, but it was uncertain if he can rally
support from enough fellow Republicans, including the leadership
duo from Texas, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority
Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic Senate vote came as President Clinton flew to
Littleton, Colo., a month after the deadly gun violence at
Columbine High School, and as another school gun incident unfolded
in an Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Gore to congratulate him for the vote. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton praised the Senate for
taking ``the common-sense approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Littleton, Clinton said: ``I applaud the Senate for
today's historic vote to close the gun-show loophole and keep guns
out of the hands of criminals and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was on an amendment by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
which in a slightly different form was narrowly defeated last week.
The changes attracted the critical vote of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,
creating a 50-50 tie, which Gore broke.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland and other supporters of the measure said he had decided
to switch his vote before the wounding of six students at a
Conyers, Ga., high school.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said, however, that the shooting in his home state
``really confirmed for me that I was on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of strict gun control invoked the latest incident to
press for passage of the mandatory checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much longer are we going to embrace the gun lobby?'' asked
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who while in the House was a major
sponsor of the 1993 law, known as the Brady bill, that first
required a waiting period on gun sales through licensed outlets and
barred gun purchases by felons and the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates said the vote marked a major loss for the
firearms lobby, including the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw is the NRA losing its grip on the United
States Senate, at long last,'' declared Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   NRA leaders vowed to fight additional restrictions on gun sales
and said that ``the Clinton-Gore administration'' was ``pursuing a
charade of lawmaking without law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our schools,''
NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and NRA top lobbyist
James J. Baker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders buttonholed some of the handful of GOP
senators who supported Lautenberg's amendment last week, but they
were unable to convince any of them to switch. With the roll call
in progress, Lott importuned Sen. John Warner, R-Va., publicly on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican majority, traditionally opposed to most
gun controls, has seemed uncertain how to react in the wake of the
rash of school shootings and polls showing big majorities in favor
of cracking down on easy access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Republicans first voted against mandatory background
checks at gun shows, but reversed themselves two days later.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats complained that the GOP-backed approach had
loopholes, many Republicans voted earlier Thursday to tighten some
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby steps,'' chided Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. But in case the
Lautenberg amendment might fail, a number of Democrats voted for
the GOP proposal by Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, which passed
79-21.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's amendment was overridden by passage of Lautenberg's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's proposal would have given state authorities only 24
hours to run a background check on gun buyers, rather than the
three days allowed on purchases at licensed retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had been alerted Wednesday night to the possibility of
a tie, arrived at the Capitol shortly before the vote. It was the
fourth tie-breaking vote of Gore's more than six years as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in favor of the Lautenberg amendment were 44 Democrats
and six Republicans _ Sens. John Chaffee of Rhode Island, Mike
DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Richard Lugar of
Indiana, George Voinovich of Ohio and Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against were 49 Republicans and Democratic Sen. Max
Baucus of Montana.

U.S. ACTS IN BEHALF OF IMMIGRANTS WHO FLED RIGHT-WING REGIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Texas)  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reversing decades-old Cold War policy, the federal
government announced Thursday that hundreds of thousands of
immigrants who fled repression from right-wing governments will now
be eligible for many of the same protections from deportation that
had been reserved for immigrants from left-wing or communist
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The rule mainly affects about 240,000 immigrants from El
Salvador and Guatemala, who fled the repressive governments and
civil wars in those countries in the 1980s and have been living in
the United States in legal limbo ever since. Under the new rule,
which takes effect June 21, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service will more easily presume that these people would be subject
to ``extreme hardship'' if they returned.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, their applications for legal residency will be
streamlined, and they cannot be deported while that process is
under way. Previously, under a law passed in 1997, protections of
this sort had been available only to immigrants from Nicaragua, who
argued that they had been victims of the former Marxist Sandinista
government, and from communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1990s, the United States had backed, even propped up,
the right-wing governments in Guatemala and El Salvador, despite
horrific human rights abuses in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalans and Salvadorans came to this country ``seeking
refuge from civil war and turmoil,'' Doris Meissner, the
commissioner of immigration and naturalization, said at a news
conference Thursday. ``They have put down deep roots and are making
a significant contribution to society. They've spent decades in
legal limbo, but this gives them permanent relief from deportation
or removal.''
</P>
<P>
   Central American immigrant organizations had long lobbied the
U.S. government to make the change. Most of the immigrants, and
their political allies, are in California and Florida, important
states for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But those in Congress who are more conservative on immigration
issues had expressed fear that the blanket amnesty would grant
legal status to criminals and others who are unsuitable for
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   To address those polar concerns, Ms. Meissner noted that while
the immigrants in question would receive special handling, each
would also have to sit for an interview with an asylum officer. The
agency will maintain the right to contest the application and send
the immigrant to court. And, Ms. Meissner noted, the review process
for all of them would take several years, adding that ``while the
review process is under way, these people are safe and able to stay
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Meissner specifically noted that the new rule ``will not
result in people getting any benefit that they would not otherwise
have received, under a much longer, and more complex and difficult
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Immigration Forum, which lobbies on behalf of
immigrants, said, ``If implemented properly, this program could
provide a measure of justice to a defined group of hard working,
long-established refugees'' who have been ``treated unfairly for
almost two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who is chairman of
the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, criticized the new
rule, saying: ``Amnesty rewards those who break the law and
encourages more illegal immigration. It is a slap in the face to
all those who patiently waited their turn to come to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation amends a 1997 law that awarded amnesty to
155,000 Nicaraguans and Cubans but gave less generous relief to the
Salvadorans and Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule applied Thursday, the new group will be spared
the need to appear before an immigration judge, where they would
have to prove that they had lived in this country continuously for
the last seven years and would be victims of ``extreme hardship''
if they returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, they will be presumed to be eligible for legal
residency unless the immigration service can find grounds to deny
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said about 190,000 Salvadorans and 50,000
Guatemalans were covered under the new rule. In addition, the
immigration service said, about 10,000 people who fled Eastern
European countries that had been part of the Soviet Union will also
be covered under the new rule.

   FILM-CASTLE (Undated) _ Ever since the days of ``Crocodile
Dundee,'' Australia has been good for at least one delightfully
quirky, jump-out comedy hit every year _ a ``Priscilla, Queen of

year's example could be ``The Castle,'' an Aussie comedy that's
been the biggest domestic hit of recent years Down Under.

   FILM-LOVE LETTER (Undated) _ As the mass of romantic confusion
plays out in ``The Love Letter,'' the best thing about the movie is
Kate Capshaw, who proves herself to be more than just the boss'

Spielberg). Without trying, she's quite appealing, and she holds
the screen well.

   FILM-ENDURANCE (Undated) _ Writer-director Leslie Woodhead, a
documentary filmmaker, says his intention in making ``Endurance,''
a film biography about long-distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, was
to make less a competition movie and more a kind of Robert
Flaherty-like entho-documentary in the vein of ``Nanook of the
North.'' And the first half of his film does a fair job of this.

INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY EXPELS 3 WHO OPPOSED GANDHI CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Congress Party on Thursday night expelled
three dissident leaders who opposed Sonia Gandhi's candidacy for
prime minister because she was born in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions, particularly that of Sharad Pawar, a senior
leader with a powerful base in the western state of Maharashtra,
are quite likely to weaken the party's prospects in the general
election in September.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, the clamor from party workers for strong
action against the three has grown since Monday, when Mrs. Gandhi,
the star attraction and vote catcher for the party, resigned as
party president.
</P>
<P>
   Congress officials said Mrs. Gandhi had been wounded not only by
the four-page letter that the three wrote that sharply questioned
her leadership credentials, but also by her sense that others in
the party had not aggressively leapt to her defense Saturday at a
party meeting where the men first spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been wounded,'' Ambika Soni, a member of the Congress
Working Committee, the party's governing body, said. ``She's heard
that people let one down in politics. If this happens after she's
delivered victories to the party, this is a big question as to what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress officials hope the expulsions and the pleas from party
workers all over India will persuade Mrs. Gandhi to relent and
rescind her resignation. But there is no sign that she is changing
her mind.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Thursday she canceled all her scheduled speeches and
public appearances for Friday, the eighth anniversary of the
assassination of her husband, Rajiv. He was murdered in 1991 as he
campaigned to win back the post of prime minister, which he lost in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, the widowed inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi political
dynasty, will venture out of her home Friday only to visit the
memorial where her husband was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Gandhi, nor any of the three leaders was at the
meeting Thursday night, where the party decided on six-year
expulsions. P.A. Sangma, a member of Parliament from northeastern
India who had been speaker of the lower house of Parliament, and
Tariq Anwar, a Muslim leader from Bihar, were also expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials have expressed outrage that Pawar and Sangma,
whom Mrs. Gandhi had given party positions of authority, had
publicly expressed their views about her foreign origin despite the
party's internal decision to stand behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said the rebels had strengthened Congress'
main rival for power, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party,
which has been making a major issue of Mrs. Gandhi's birth in much
the same language as the three Congress opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress officials are also angry that none of the men has
attended meetings to discuss their actions. Hundreds of party
workers who gathered outside Mrs. Gandhi's residence have branded
the men traitors.

U.S. TRADE GAP A RECORD $19.7 BILLION IN MARCH

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. trade deficit reached another record in
March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, providing fresh
evidence that the U.S. economy continues to absorb imports at a
prodigious rate.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit for March totaled $19.7 billion, the department
said, up from a revised $19.1 billion in February and well above
the $18.5 billion predicted by economists. It was the third
consecutive month in which the deficit was at a new high.
</P>
<P>
   Exports for the month were $77.5 billion, up $700 million from
February, the first increase in five months and a sign of possible
recovery in key foreign markets for U.S. goods such as Asia. But
imports grew even faster, up $1.3 billion, to $97.2 billion, also a
record.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in import revenue was propelled in part by the
higher cost of crude oil, which has jumped in recent months after
being depressed for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But imports surged in other categories as well _ notably steel,
autos and auto parts, as foreign producers looked to the United
States as the vibrant market for their products at a time much of
the rest of the world was in the economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the deficit to continue creeping higher in
coming months, although probably at a slower pace than over the
last several months. They said the deficit would not begin
contracting until Western Europe, Japan and the developing nations
of Asia begin enjoying a more marked rebound than they have had so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that until the pace of economic growth in
the U.S. slows and the rest of the world picks up, the deficit will
continue to grow,'' said G. David Orr, chief economist at First
Union Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the trade deficit during a congressional hearing
Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said it should
not be a problem in the short run because the dollar has been
reasonably stable in value and others have been happy to invest the
dollars they earn through trade back into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that there is any immediate problem
coming because of the fact that we are, as an economy, growing far
faster than the rest of the world,'' Greenspan told the House
Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the deficit could become disturbing in the long run
if it continued to grow, ``creating a significant rise in debt or
claims against us by foreigners, which could essentially
destabilize our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the trade deficit is often as much a political and
diplomatic problem as an economic one. The U.S. deficit with Japan,
long a source of friction between the two countries, surged to $6.5
billion in March from $5.3 billion a month earlier, largely because
of a sharp jump in imports. Washington has been pressing the
Japanese, with mixed success, to do more to stimulate a moribund
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with China dropped to $4.1 billion from $4.6
billion. China has been the focus of the Clinton administration's
trade policy in recent months, as Washington and Beijing spar over
the terms on which the Chinese should be admitted to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The best news in Thursday's report was the increase in exports.
For years, the administration was able to point to growing exports
as evidence that its policy of opening markets to U.S. goods was
paying off in the form of domestic jobs and profits. But since the
Asian financial and economic crisis began in mid-1997, the demand
for U.S. products in many foreign markets has been weak, hurting
farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in exports in March was modest, and it still left
the export level 1.8 percent below where it was a year earlier. But
it reflected improved sales abroad of a variety of products as
diverse as telecommunications equipment, generators, soybeans and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing deficit, the administration has given no
indication of abandoning its policy of keeping the dollar strong, a
strategy that makes exports from the United States relatively more
expensive but helps hold down domestic inflation by making imports
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the surge in imports could ultimately prove
troublesome, it has benefited consumers by creating competition and
forcing American producers to keep prices down. The announcement by
the Federal Reserve on Tuesday that it would tilt in the future
toward higher interest rates could lead to a further strengthening
of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit is one of the few tangible ways in which the
American economy has been affected by recent global economic
turmoil. In part because the United States has weathered the
problems well, policy makers here have urged caution in moves to
change the world financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin repeated
the message that tough monetary and fiscal policy choices, rather
than a new financial architecture, were the most effective ways to
avert problems in the international economy.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing side by side before the banking committee, they
outlined steps the United States has taken to reduce the likelihood
of another global financial crisis, including encouraging nations
to share more economic data with investors and to keep their
currencies realistically valued.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of insuring that developing nations are able to weather
financial crises, Greenspan suggested that they keep enough
foreign-currency reserves on hand to allow them to pay all their
debts for one year without any additional borrowing. He said that
developing countries should not take on too much short-term debt
and that they keep the average maturity of their foreign debt at no
less than three years so they do not find themselves squeezed by
rapid-repayment demands.

 McCAIN HARSHLY CRITICIZES CLINTON POLICIES  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a speech outlining his own views on foreign
affairs, Sen. John McCain was harshly critical Thursday of
President Clinton on issues from Kosovo to the Middle East to
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president often conducts foreign policies that are little
more than international variants of pork barrel politics without
regard for the long-term interests of the United States,'' said
McCain at a National Press Club lunch. ``The next president,'' he
added, ``has to do a whole lot better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lunch gave the Arizona Republican, who is seeking his
party's presidential nomination, a forum in which he could assemble
the range of his foreign policy views in one speech.
</P>
<P>
   On the war in the Balkans, McCain said Clinton had made a
serious mistake at the outset by renouncing the use of ground
troops. And he was contemptuous of the statements of administration
officials that they were not surprised by the aggressiveness of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in routing Albanians from
Kosovo after NATO began bombing Serbia. ``Why didn't we warn the
Kosovars,'' he asked, ``if we somehow knew that Milosevic was going
to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Middle East, McCain said he hoped the election in
Israel this week would result in the resumption of the peace
process. He called the Wye River agreement that Clinton engineered
last year ``a classic Clintonesque exercise.'' He described it this
way: ``Get everybody together, know the outcome, a big photo op,
nice things are said, and then you move on. The Wye River
agreements are in tatters.''
</P>
<P>
   On trade, McCain said, ``Free trade is indispensable to our
prosperity.'' He said if he were president he would negotiate a
free-trade agreement ``with almost any country willing to negotiate
fairly with us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain criticized Clinton for backing away from support of
admitting China into the World Trade Organization and said the
president had done far too little to promote trade with countries
in Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, McCain was asked about the statement of former
Sen. Bob Dole that he was considering donating money to the McCain
campaign, a remark that alarmed those running the campaign of
Dole's wife, Elizabeth. ``They haven't installed a phone in his
woodshed yet, so I haven't had a chance to talk to him,'' McCain
replied with a grin.

 &HT;    Scene of Georgia shootings safe, nurturing, faculty and students
say
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Even after Thursday's shooting rampage at
Heritage High School, Rockdale County Board of Education member Jim
Borland was uneasy with the idea of installing metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put a blinder on, but we can't overreact either,''
said Borland, who heads a committee that just last week was
undecided on the idea of creating what would be electronic
checkpoints between students and their campus.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, up to now, Heritage High School has been a place
where guns and violence seem distant concerns. While other schools
throughout metro Atlanta had experienced bomb threats and other
violent gestures in the wake of the recent Littleton, Colo.,
shootings, Heritage reported nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   Parents said students there are nurtured and guided rather than
considered potential security risks.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly been the experience of Donna Hattaway. When her
parents died within 10 days of each other last fall, she was too
devastated to be of much help to her academically struggling son,
Chris.
</P>
<P>
   So Heritage High School administrators stepped in. They told
Chris that while they understood his sorrow, he had to get back on
his feet and pull up his falling grades. It was what his
grandparents would have wanted, they told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, what they said bothered me,'' his mother said.
``But it was just what he needed. He needed someone to put him on
track. And thank God they did because I was in no shape to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Woods also testified to the school's level of personal
concern. After her son, Michael, 19, was injured in a car accident,
a school administrator came to her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to see how well he was doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while she is concerned about the shooting, she
still will send her daughter, Lynnsey, 17, to Heritage for her
senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have done very well there, and that is why I am just
shocked,'' said Woods. ``My husband and I had talked about moving,
but I didn't want to because I wanted my children to finish here.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice was easy for them, given Heritage's academic track
record. It has been a Georgia Public School of Excellence four
times, most recently this year. It also was a National School of
Excellence in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. News and World Report named Heritage one of
its outstanding American high schools in January, and the CBS
broadcast news magazine ``48 Hours'' talked with administrators in
April about possibly featuring the school in an upcoming segment.
The premise would be to feature schools nationwide that are
producing academically successful students without radical changes
in teaching styles, class arrangements or program adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage has 1,303 students and 88 teachers. It is located on
the south side of Rockdale County in a community that is mostly
middle- and upper-middle class. Last year, its students earned an
American College Testing program composite score of 22.7 out of a
possible 36 points. That is 0.7 above the county average and 1.7
above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The school's average Scholastic Assessment Test score for 1998
was 1014 _ 509 verbal, 505 math _ with 74 percent of students
taking the exam. Though three points below the national average,
the score was 46 points above the state average.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stressing academics, Heritage offers students
vocational programs such as auto assembly and graphic arts. Next
year, the school will resurrect its horticulture program, which has
been on hold for four years because the school could not find a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage, like Rockdale's other two high schools, has a
full-time resource officer from the Rockdale County Sheriff's
Department patrolling the grounds. Alaina Mitchell, 16, a junior at
Heritage, said students felt safe with that and other measures the
school had taken, including locking most doors and insisting that
visitors come to the front office first. She said students had also
taken a zero-tolerance stance against violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person even said anything, even if they are just joking
around about hurting someone, we would jump all over them,'' she
said.

 &HT;    First teen-ager's home burns, then bullet strikes
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Stephanie Laster couldn't stop thinking about her
impending trip to Florida, where she and members of Haven
Fellowship Church were planning to do missionary work with troubled
teens in crime-ridden neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the feisty 15-year-old sophomore from Heritage High
School sat in her bed at Hughes Spalding Childrens' Hospital late
Thursday afternoon, talking to her parents about the shattered day
at Heritage where one of her classmates shot six students.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the family's mettle was tested when fire ravaged
their house in the Honey Creek neighborhood, said neighbor and
friend Steve Merritt. He spent most of Thursday at Hughes Spalding
with Stephanie, her parents Steve and Betty Laster, and her younger
sister, Kelsey, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie was shot once in the buttocks, but the bullet traveled
through her colon and remained lodged in the teen's abdomen
Thursday evening. The injury posed no apparent danger to her
recovery or health, said Dr. Lynn Weaver, interim deputy chief of
staff at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet was not removed because attempting to do so would
have caused more damage to the teen's abdominal area, Weaver said.
The teen, in stable condition, will remain at Hughes Spalding over
the next three to five days, Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie's Sunday school teacher got word of the shooting
minutes before boarding a Delta flight to Atlanta from
Jacksonville. After Wayne Seymour landed at Hartsfield
International Airport and went home to check on his two sons _ both
are students at Heritage _ he went to Grady to see about Stephanie.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart dropped when I heard Stephanie had been shot,'' said
Seymour. ``After I found out my own sons were OK, I wanted to be
here. Stephanie is one of the greatest kids you'll ever want to
meet. She does missionary work with our church, and she was really
looking forward to going down to Florida in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Stephanie, she'll try to go anyway _ she's
strong-willed and determined.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Stephanie who helped keep her family going in the
aftermath of the fire that destroyed their home on March 2, 1998.
The Lasters had just gotten home from church that Sunday when they
noticed smoke seeping from under the garage door, Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they opened the door, the flames were so huge they just
knocked everyone back,'' Merritt said. ``Everyone in the
neighborhood rallied around the family and tried to help them save
as much as they could, but most of their possessions were lost.
Stephanie and her mother just kept the family going with their
spirit and humor and willingness to do anything for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt, smiling and shaking his head, recounted Stephanie's
words as she awoke from her operation: ``She told me she remembered
falling on her face when she was hit. A few seconds later she said
she stood up, shook her head a bit and calmly said to another kid,
'You know, I think I may have been shot.'''

   In a dark, musty garage in the Long Island city of Glen Cove, a
child sleeps under rags and old clothes. Rain drips down into an
electric light socket. The ceiling is caving in. The five people
who live there bathe from buckets and pay $1,000 a month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' says Rosa Benitez, the child's mother, a
31-year-old immigrant from El Salvador. ``I ask the landlord to fix
it. He says if I complain I will be on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   In Farmingville, Guadeloupe Crespo Alvarez, a middle-aged
Mexican, lingers in bed. His foot is black and swollen, having been
crushed by a truck a few weeks ago while he was hauling bricks on a
day job. The boss sent him home with a pill, but no pay, he says,
and the hospital refuses to operate because he has no insurance.
Now he cannot make the $200 rent that he pays for his bunk in a
ranch house crammed with 16 strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, mother,'' he says as he lights a candle to the Virgin
Mary. ``Send help.''

   In Hempstead, a woman named Gloria fries pork chops in a kitchen
that reeks of excrement. She pays $300 a month for a small bedroom
in a wood-frame house where the toilets have not flushed in over a
week. Gloria hopes for something better, but she is not optimistic.
``I keep looking, but no one wants a woman with three daughters,''
she said, her 10-year-old translating and quietly grasping her
mother's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Behind drawn curtains in nearly every town and village on Long
Island, tens of thousands of legal and illegal immigrants from
Central America and Mexico are jammed into subdivided houses and
partitioned apartments, biding their time in invisible suburban
slums that local officials say they have little hope of
controlling.
</P>
<P>
   By day, these men and women perform some of the lowest jobs on
Long Island's booming economic ladder, cleaning the floors or
pruning the shrubbery of affluent suburbanites, hauling
construction materials for home builders, picking spinach in
Riverhead. By night they count up earnings far greater than
anything they could have hoped for back home _ up to $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at 2.8 percent in Nassau and 3.7 percent in
Suffolk, experts and local officials say many of these jobs would
not get done without immigrant labor. ``If we didn't have this
population, the dishes and silverware in our diners probably
wouldn't be clean,'' said Frank P. Petrone, the supervisor of the
Town of Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   But the same booming economy that has drawn so many immigrants
to Long Island has also created an extraordinary shortage of
affordable housing and enabled some landlords to charge thousands
of dollars a month to groups of men who then split the rent as many
as 10 or 20 ways.
</P>
<P>
   While similar overcrowding can be found in many immigrant
neighborhoods in Queens and other parts of New York City, experts
say the housing plight of immigrants in the suburbs is particularly
acute, in part because there are far fewer social services and
homeless shelters available.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many political leaders are reluctant to crack down
on bad living conditions, fearing that such an effort would make
homeless people of those who now have roofs over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many immigrants live on Long Island.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not even estimated
the number, a spokeswoman said. But some experts point to the
growth of the Salvadoran population as a indication of the extent
of the surge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, before civil war broke out in El Salvador, there were
as few as 5,000 Salvadorans living on the Island. Today, according
to immigrant groups and outreach workers, the number is well over
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hondurans, Guatemalans, Mexicans and others have followed a
similar path, bypassing the comparatively tight job market in New
York City and moving directly to the suburbs, where apartment
complexes are scarce but where three-bedroom homes can provide
space for a lot more than three beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've found it almost impossible to find anything but
substandard housing,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the
Long Island Association, an economic development group. ``So
they're doubling, tripling, quadrupling up. And therefore you have
disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Outreach workers point to a series of deaths that have
periodically drawn attention to the housing problems of the
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a 5-year-old girl, Melissa Castillo, died with her
grandmother, Blanca Saravia, in a fire in a cramped Port Washington
house; 11 others were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santos Fuentes died of exposure in 1997 after falling into
a creek next to his bed under a Glen Cove overpass. The same year,
Clementino Morales, a Guatemalan immigrant, was killed in a
Riverhead fire that left his nine housemates homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in Huntington Station, a converted
commercial building teeming with 34 Salvadorans erupted in flames,
killing a woman, her 5-year-old daughter and a man who had arrived
to find work just four days earlier. Another resident has been
charged with murder and arson.
</P>
<P>
   When deaths like that occur and overcrowded housing conditions
are exposed, local officials usually resolve to do more. Now, it is
Huntington's turn, but officials say they have neither the money
nor the support of voters to create housing for poor immigrants or
enforce building codes more vigorously.

<P>
   Long Island's lack of affordable housing can be traced to the
postwar boom that drew hundreds of thousands of new homeowners to
Nassau and Suffolk. The sprawling new subdivisions that sprouted on
Long Island's potato and corn fields featured winding lanes,
cookie-cutter houses and a family car in every driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment buildings, row houses or rental units of any kind were
never particularly welcome among the split level homes, picket
fences and spacious lawns of the suburbs and that attitude prevails
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is racism,'' said Jim Morgo, president of the Long
Island Housing Partnership, a not-for-profit developer of
affordable housing. ``But I've seen many instances of blacks and
Hispanics opposing affordable housing. It has an awful lot to do
with the fact that Long Island, and their home, is people's most
significant financial investment. They have this myth that
affordable housing in their neighborhood is somehow going to
devalue their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though some subsidized houses have been built _ Islip,
with 900 homes built over the last 25 years, has produced the most
_ they cannot, of course, be bought or rented by undocumented
immigrants, who are ineligible for government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trickle-down effect, if anything,'' Morgo said.
``Somebody who's a citizen or a resident alien leaves a unit to buy
one, opening up another apartment.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lax enforcement of housing codes also leaves undocumented
immigrants vulnerable to exploitation by landlords, experts say.
Across the Island, most municipalities have laws limiting the
number of unrelated people sharing a home, said Stefan H. Krieger,
director of Hofstra Law School's Housing Right Clinic. In
Smithtown, for instance, the limit is two; in Huntington, the limit
is five.
</P>
<P>
   But to enforce such laws, inspectors first must obtain search
warrants and then prove that the people are unrelated. But more
critically, town and village officials say they do not have enough
inspectors to handle even a fraction of the hundreds of thousands
of illegal apartments that are believed to exist on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Even when inspections are made and citations are issued, there
is no guarantee that living conditions will improve for anyone.
Huntington's public safety director, Bruce Richard, tells the story
of a single-family house in Huntington Station, a few blocks from
the site of the recent fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he said, inspectors found men living in two outdoor
sheds on the property, and more people living in two apartments
carved illegally out of the garage. The sheds were removed, and the
owner, Estella Martinez, paid $375 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Richard, then an inspector, checked out a report of an
overflowing cesspool and discovered at least 15 people _ all of
them, apparently undocumented immigrants, living on the property:
in a camper parked next to the garage; in four rooms in the cellar,
two of which he likened to a crawl space; and in an upstairs attic.
</P>
<P>
   The house was declared unfit for occupancy, he said, and Ms.
Martinez received 20 summonses, eventually paying $1,100 in fines.
But last January inspectors returned to investigate another
complaint, and found people again occupying illegal apartments in
the cellar of her home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   She was given five more summonses and is due in court Friday.
She could not be reached for comment, and her lawyer Kenneth
Butterfield, declined to discuss her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not unusual, by the way,'' Richard said. ``It's really
frustrating, when people play the system to the point where the
fines that are imposed constitute the cost of doing business.''

<P>
   Early on a rainy morning, men slowly begin their daily trek to
the Glen Cove train station, the meeting place for contractors.
Usually the jobs are in construction or landscaping: $80 for 10
hours' work.
</P>
<P>
   As executives in tailored suits await the 7:30 to Manhattan,
about 50 laborers, sleep still in their eyes, huddle under an
overhang at the other end of the station, hoping the sky will clear
so there will be work.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer arrives. ``You people cannot stand here,'' he
tells the workers. ``You have to be over there.'' He points through
the rain to a trailer that was placed there to serve as a hiring
hall.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was evidence of Glen Cove's dueling impulses.
Notorious in the early 1990s for a local ordinance meant to rid its
street corners of undocumented workers, Glen Cove eventually became
the first community on Long Island to provide a hiring area and
some shelter for day workers.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions persist, and officials say they sometimes have to
police the workers.``We've gotten a lot of complaints about these
guys from citizens,'' said Detective John Nagel of the Glen Cove
Police Department. ``Technically it's railroad property, but if
they are creating a nuisance or blocking pedestrian traffic, there
are laws to make them move along.''
</P>
<P>
   But the working men see themselves as victims of harassment. For
example, they say, the public bathrooms next to the parking lot are
always locked, so they are forced to urinate in the open _ a
complaint that city officials promised to address when told of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us for the dirtiest things,'' said David Antonio
Molina, 29, who came to the United States three years ago from a
small farming village in El Salvador. ``But we don't have many
rights. And after 6 o'clock, they don't want to see you. You don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina lives in a basement with five other men. Upstairs are
four crowded rooms, two with doors freshly carved out of the walls.
In the attic, Virgilio Yanes and four other men live in one small,
sloping warren with plywood walls and broken windows. Five more
live in another. All the men in the attic share a single toilet and
shower. Their kitchen is a hot plate on a piece of lumber.
</P>
<P>
   But Yanes, who with his roommates pays $1,175 a month in rent,
considers himself lucky. ``My dream is to stay,'' he says. ``The
situation in Salvador is critical. Here, I've got a place to stay,
I work, and that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does not know is that his home is going to be raided
soon by Glen Cove housing inspectors. The city has begun issuing
search warrants, subpoenaing phone records and getting the names of
residents from the post office. A list of homes with too many
occupants is being drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi said the crackdown on overcrowding was
meant to protect immigrants from exploitative landlords _ and from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow landlords to take advantage of people of any
race and put them in dangerous conditions,'' he said. ``On the
other hand, if you come to Glen Cove, you must obey the laws. If
you do not, you will be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials on Long Island and the directors of advocacy
groups say they realize the risks involved in taking a hard line
against substandard housing.

</P>
<P>
   Patrick Young, legal director of the Central American Refugee
Center, which is based in Hempstead, worried aloud about what would
happen if, as a result of the Huntington fire, officials started
cracking down on overcrowded conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider that house to be better than living in a
drainpipe,'' he said of the Huntington building. ``That's the
heartbreaking thing: Shutting down overcrowded, rundown houses only
increases overcrowding. You can either become homeless, or go to
live with someone who's already in crowded circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrone, the Huntington supervisor, suggested what he called a
``Band-Aid'' solution: focusing code enforcement on finding and
shutting down the most dilapidated and overcrowded firetraps, while
working with social service groups to ensure that their inhabitants
find new homes.
</P>
<P>
   He and other municipal officials on Long Island say that real
solutions must involve cooperation among federal, state, county and
local agencies. In particular, they say, national immigration
policy should be changed to allow working immigrants to obtain
legal residency faster. That way people would come out of hiding,
get services they are entitled to, and qualify for what little
subsidized housing there is.
</P>
<P>
   And federal officials, they say, must help local governments
provide more affordable housing. Otherwise, Petrone said, the
problems will fester. ``We have to come to a decision one day,'' he
said. ``Is this population fish or fowl?''

<P>
   ``Welcome to Farmingville,'' reads the sign at the corner of
North Ocean Avenue and Horse Block Road, ``Cultural Heart of
Brookhaven.'' Next to it is a 7-Eleven _ and nearly 100 Latino men.
The area, 70 miles east of Manhattan, has become a hub for cheap
labor for the home builders who are rapidly developing eastern
Suffolk County. Every truck that pulls up sets off a stampede of
ever-hopeful day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing numbers of immigrants have also produced growing
tensions. Some longtime residents have videotaped day laborers and
the contractors who hire them, and have given the tapes to county
legislators and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, when the day laborers at the 7-Eleven numbered as
many as 300, officials sent housing inspectors and fire marshals to
six rental homes, where they cited the landlords for code
violations, kicked out dozens of tenants and padlocked the houses.
Forty-four men pitched tents on the lawn of the Church of the
Resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The raids drew national attention, but the day jobs did not
disappear, and neither did the workers. The landlords, who can get
as much as $5,000 a month renting a house to a group of men,
quickly made repairs. Their tenants moved back in.
</P>
<P>
   Employing undocumented workers is illegal, but the risk to
employers who do so is minimal. According to the INS, there are 40
agents who focus on employer sanctions in Suffolk and Nassau
Counties, but they are also responsible for 12 other counties,
including all of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Joseph Caracappa, Farmingville's representative in the
county legislature, wants to make it illegal for contractors to
pick up day workers on the streets. Caracappa did not return
several calls to his office seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The frictions are all too apparent in Farmingville, a
working-class hamlet of 15,000. ``There are bad feelings here,''
said Mario Ugalde, 38, who like many of the other day workers came
from Hidalgo, in western Mexico. ``There is racism. They say we
look at the white women. It's not true. We just want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime residents say the workers are nothing more
than law-breakers, stealing jobs and destroying neighborhoods.
Anything like an outdoor hiring hall, they say, would only condone
an illegal economy and invite more immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people aren't citizens, so why do they have more rights
than me?'' said Vincent Bullock, 75, who lives next door to two
homes overflowing with men and rubbish. ``There are 20 guys to a
place, people in the attic, garage and basement. And more keep
coming. Where is the IRS? The INS? Where's the Board of Health?
</P>
<P>
   ``Long and the short of it, they're knocking down my property
values,'' he said. ``And I'll be damned if I'm paying a dime to
help them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any irony to the living conditions of Long Island's
immigrants it can be found in the old potato fields of Riverhead,
where Edward R. Murrow chronicled the ``Harvest of Shame'' in 1960,
shocking the nation with depictions of migrant workers living in
shacks and chicken coops. Today's work camps are as comfortable as
any in the state. But today's workers have a new reason for
shunning them: the jobs just don't pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landscapers are paying eight, 10, 12 dollars an hour,'' said
Joseph M. Gergela 3rd, executive director of the Long Island Farm
Bureau. ``A farmer just can't afford to pay his men that. A
vegetable farmer can't pass the labor cost on to the consumer. And
it's hard to find an immigrant, much less an American, to do the
job for $5 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   To augment the low wages, farmers supply their field workers
with free housing and, usually, a bonus at harvest's end. The
county provides free medical care and transportation to and from
its clinics. Those who are content to take the jobs cite those
benefits and the dignity of the work.
</P>
<P>
   On the farm of Philip A. Schmitt, a dozen Mexican men labor on
their knees, cutting fresh spinach. The smell of eggs and rice
wafts out from the barracks, a clean, freshly painted cement house
where the men live two to a room. Salsa music plays from somewhere.
Out in the fields, near the road, Juan Rubio, 31, is picking
greens.
</P>
<P>
   The boss is a decent man, Rubio said. Workers are given coffee
and doughnuts at break time. And there is always Sunday off. He is
not treated like a cheap tool made in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make $5.15, which is not as much as some other jobs,'' he
said. ``But this one is steady, every week. And when I get sick,
the doctor comes. And the rent is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he adds, ``is a decent place.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are inescapable indignities.
</P>
<P>
   From up the road, a pickup truck barrels past. Two young white
men are inside, baseball caps pulled down over their eyebrows. One
sticks his head out the window and yells.
</P>
<P>

NYPD'S `WALL OF SILENCE' CRUMBLES IN BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wall of silence continues to crash down on Justin
Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, his fellow police officers have paraded to the
witness stand and offered vivid details in support of an awful
allegation _ that Volpe, in a sadistic rage, rammed a stick into
the rectum of a handcuffed Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Volpe's angry stares, four officers in the past eight
days have held a jury rapt with chilling accounts of his words and
deeds the night Louima's insides were violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just holding it straight out,'' Officer Michael Schoer
said Thursday, describing how Volpe boastfully displayed an
excrement-covered stick.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick described a similar
encounter, days after Detective Eric Turetzky described Volpe
``swinging the stick around like a sword.'' And Officer Mark
Schofield testified that Volpe borrowed a pair of gloves from him,
then returned them, covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the decision of the officers to testify may
suggest changing attitudes within a Police Department legendary for
its lack of tolerance for ``rats.'' But the testimony also revealed
a general reluctance to come forward immediately, sometimes for
fear of retribution or of being implicated, and sometimes out of a
sense of loyalty to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in police behavior speculate that the officers may have
eventually spoken up because of revulsion at the charges and
because of fear of being caught in a particularly sweeping
investigation by federal, as well as departmental, officials.
</P>
<P>
   Schoer testified Thursday that when he was first questioned by
investigators from the Police Department's internal affairs bureau,
he lied and withheld his damaging account of Volpe showing him a
two-foot stick.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the assault, when he met with federal
investigators to finally tell about the stick episode, Schoer said
he lied again. Presumably to explain his delay in coming forward,
he told investigators his wife had been threatened _ though this
was false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' he said. ``I panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick testified Thursday that he first learned about the
extent of Louima's injuries on Aug. 13, 1997, four days after
Louima was arrested. For days, he said nothing. On Aug. 21, he was
notified that he would have to give a statement to internal affairs
investigators. That night, he said, he finally told a police union
trustee what he knew about Volpe and asked for legal help.
</P>
<P>
   And Turetzky, who was hailed as a hero for being the first
officer to break the code of silence in the Louima case,
acknowledged that he, too, did not come forward until hours before
he was to be questioned by internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield waited eight days to disclose the incident involving
the gloves, saying he was nervous about what would happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``About you, right?'' a defense lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the officer answered.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is one of five officers on trial on charges of violating
Louima's civil rights. He is specifically accused of thrusting a
broom stick or mop handle into Louima's rectum, while a
co-defendant, Officer Charles Schwarz, allegedly held Louima down.
Those two officers and two others, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder,
are all accused of beating Louima in a police car before he was
taken to the station house. And a fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, is accused of trying to cover up the events.
</P>
<P>
   But the four officers who are cooperating with federal
prosecutors have testified almost exclusively about Volpe, who
could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   William Bratton, the New York police commissioner from 1994
until 1996, said the surprising spectacle of so many officers
testifying gives hope that the entrenched culture of secrecy is
weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife Rikki, who's a defense attorney, and I were sitting
there having breakfast this morning and both of us were saying,
`What the hell is this?' '' Bratton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, his optimism is tempered by the fact that the
officers were slow to come forward, despite the ``egregious''
nature of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't see the walls of Jericho coming tumbling down
here, but some of the bricks are starting to weaken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one veteran officer who is a police union delegate said
he was concerned that coercion may be playing a role in the
testimony against Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the testimony given by the cops is truthful,''
said the officer, who, like others, would talk only if his name was
not divulged. ``I hope people aren't being forced to give false
testimony because their jobs were threatened or because they worked
out some kind of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another officer: ``These guys are willing to testify
because of the nature of the crime and because of pressure by the
department to talk. But you bet they aren't going to say they saw
Volpe do the deed in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been questioned before about this incident and they
are giving answers that don't go to the allegations per se, but to
the facts and circumstances surrounding them. And everyone is still
going to see them as rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Lynch, president of the John Jay College of Criminal
Justice, said studies have shown that the old culture of silence in
many police departments is giving way to a new ethos of openness
among a generation of better-educated, better-trained officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers with college degrees have fewer civilian
complaints, faster promotions and higher self-esteem,'' he said.
They also are more dissatisfied with their departments, he said,
and therefore more willing to challenge traditions that place
loyalty above accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the wall of silence is being broken,''
Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as one example Turetzky, who is currently taking
classes at John Jay College.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky testified that he decided to cooperate with
investigators out of a sense of duty. He denied suggestions by
defense lawyers that he was motivated by any animosity toward
Volpe, who claimed credit for posting a disparaging caricature of
Turetzky in the 70th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the motives of the other officers. Defense
lawyers declined the opportunity Thursday to cross-examine either
Wernick or Schoer. Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for Volpe, said
Thursday, ``I think before the case is over you'll understand why I
didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear whether those who have broken the wall of
silence will be supported by their colleagues. On Thursday morning,
minutes before testimony was to resume, Wernick stood near the door
of the courtroom chatting with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Volpe walked up and stopped but a few feet from
Wernick. For several seconds, he glared at the beefy sergeant, and
then he started to move closer still. One of his lawyers grabbed
him by the arm and pulled him into the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick, occupied by his friend, didn't notice a thing.

   CONYERS, Ga. _ Ryan Freeman had three special pens ready to sign
yearbooks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to seeing everybody one last time,'' he
said. ``I was trying to dress nice and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But not long after he put on his crisp Tommy Hilfiger polo
shirt, Freeman was watching his school on television as helicopters
circled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it, we see our school, all these people
talking about Conyers, Georgia,'' he said. ``I saw Janet Reno say
`Heritage High School.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the seniors' last day at Heritage High, and it was
supposed to be a day for penning farewell messages, sharing
memories and saying goodbye. Instead, the class of 1999 spent the
day coping with a shooting they say will stain their memories of
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll remember it forever,'' Freeman said. ``Instead of
signing yearbooks, we're watching our school from helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after police had secured the school and blocked the
road leading to it, Freeman was getting gas at a station down the
road from Heritage. His hands shook as he demonstrated the stylish
signature he'd been practicing for his friends' yearbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Kevi Hall, 16, wheeled into the parking lot and ran over
to Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you got shot!'' she said, hugging him tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Krystle Graham, also a 16-year-old junior, said they
now want to finish high school as home schoolers rather than return
to Heritage this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might miss out on walking with my class or senior prom, but
at least you don't have to worry about getting shot,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   By a number of standards, Heritage High is the kind of school
parents want for their kids. Its average SAT score for 1998 was
1014 _ 46 points higher than the state average. Its graduation rate
was nearly 80 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the 250 students graduating May 28 said the shooting took
away a cherished rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be a special day, our last day as a high
school student,'' said Patrick Edwards, 18. ``I was looking forward
to signing yearbooks and saying goodbye to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he grieves for the shooting victims, and feels violated
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they took my last day at Heritage,'' Edwards said.
``I feel like more than just my last day at Heritage has been
robbed. I feel like my safety's been robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was a place-kicker for the Heritage Patriots and is
angry that when he thinks back to his days on the field, the
shooting will inevitably creep into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is an unfair way of having to leave,'' he said.
``It's not supposed to end this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Daven Cox, 18, had begun the day full of senior pride. He
eagerly displayed his class ring, engraved with his name, year and
an armed patriot, the school's mascot. Another patriot stands guard
in the center of the blue stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were just going to have fun today,'' Cox said. He
didn't even make it to school. By the time he neared the parking
lot, authorities were turning cars away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' he said. ``I didn't think it could happen at our
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Several seniors said that although more than 1,300 students
attend Heritage, the school manages to retain a community feeling.
They said the shooting was unbelievably out of sync with the school
they knew for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt like it was a safe school,'' said Amy Arnold,
18. ``I've always felt safe going there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's glad to be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured there would be senior pranks, but nothing like
this,'' Arnold said. ``I have a little sister who goes to Sims
(Elementary School). It gives me a different outlook on her going
to middle school and high school. You turn on the TV and you see
stuff. You don't expect to see your own school.

U.S. OFFERING A DEAL TO END ECONOMIC BOYCOTT AGAINST NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is sending an envoy to North
Korea next week with a proposal to gradually lift the 50-year-old
economic embargo against the country in exchange for several major
concessions, including an agreement that the North will end its
long-range missile program, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several current and former administration officials expressed
doubts that North Korea would accept the limits on military
programs in the proposal, though an end to the sanctions would
allow the famine-scarred nation to trade with the West.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's sales of missiles in the Middle East and to
Pakistan have constituted its only lucrative export in recent
years. And any agreement to lift some of the sanctions would be
subject to congressional approval, which would be an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the diplomatic overture represents the biggest change in
Washington's approach to North Korea since the Korean War ended in
1953. Since that conflict ended in stalemate _ no formal peace
treaty has ever been signed _ the United States has prohibited
virtually all trade, investment and travel and most communication
with the Communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that the United States has made a
comprehensive proposal to lift those sanctions or offer the
prospect of full diplomatic recognition, a matter of prestige for
the isolated country that officials say the envoy, former Defense
Secretary William Perry, will raise during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have declined to detail the contents of
the proposed deal that Perry is hoping to present in person to
North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's trip is the first time a presidential envoy has been
dispatched to the North, although former President Jimmy Carter
traveled there on his own to defuse a nuclear crisis in 1994. That
trip ultimately led to an agreement by the North to freeze its
nuclear weapons program, though American intelligence agencies
believe the North may already hold enough fissionable material to
produce one or two crude nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Perry's visit on
Thursday in congressional testimony, confirming reports that had
circulated in Washington for several days. But she said nothing
about the offer to lift sanctions in return for concessions by Kim,
who has ruled North Korea since the death of his father, Kim
Il-sung, weeks after Carter's visit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic visit culminates a six-month review of North
Korea policy that Perry began, at Clinton's request, after several
years of what even some administration insiders volunteer was a
dangerous neglect of the country. The timing of Perry's trip was
also closely linked to the start on Wednesday of the first American
inspection of a huge, mysterious construction project under a North
Korean mountain that American intelligence agencies feared was
originally intended to house a secret nuclear processing plant.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Perry, who is carrying a letter from
Clinton, will ?? meet with Kim Jong-il, which he had suggested
earlier would be a precondition for a visit. ``We certainly hope to
meet with Kim Jong-il,'' a senior administration official said on
Thursday, suggesting that the North Koreans had provided winks and
nods that such a meeting is being arranged.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Perry persuades Kim that it is in North Korea's
interest to give up the weapons program and curb its behavior, it
is unclear that he can persuade Congress that a lifting of
sanctions is in America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives on Capital Hill have already charged that the
administration is pursuing a policy of appeasement. On Tuesday,
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who leads the House Committee on
International Relations, introduced a bill he called the North
Korea Threat Reduction Act that would prohibit Clinton from lifting
the sanctions _ some of which are imposed at the discretion of the
president, others by congressional mandate _ and will make it
difficult to provide food aid to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has met with members of Congress, and on Thursday gave a
classified briefing to members of the Senate. He has also traveled
repeatedly in recent months to Japan, South Korea and China,
seeking their support for a new American approach.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has been mixed: South Korea's president, Kim
Dae-jung, has pursued what he has called a ``Sunshine Policy'' of
fuller engagement with the North and urged the United States to do
the same. Japan has been far more cautious, especially after the
North shot a three-stage missile over Japan on Aug. 31, a test that
appeared intended to demonstrate that North Korea could hit any
Japanese city and the tens of thousands of American troops based in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   What administration officials have declined to discuss is what
advisers around Perry call Plan B: How to respond if North Korea
decides not to trade its missile program for a gradual relaxation
of the American economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the hardest part, and I think it is the issue
that has delayed the Perry report for so long,'' said Donald Gregg,
a former American ambassador to South Korea, and a CIA operative in
the region during the Cold War. ``To be credible, this plan has to
have a plan about how to deal with the North if they turn this
down. For a while it looked like the recommendation would be benign
neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is clear,'' said Gregg, who now heads the Korea Society
in New York, ``that if we leave them alone, they go back to
building nuclear weapons and missiles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his few public comments while he has been putting together
recommendations for a new policy, Perry has said that he thought it
was important to ``test the proposition that North Korea wants a
more positive relationship'' with the United States, but to be
prepared to respond if it continues on its current path.
</P>
<P>
   That path has been erratic. In 1993 and 1994 the United States
and North Korea appeared veering toward a dangerous confrontation
that Perry, the defense secretary in those years, has since said
could have led to war. North Korea had taken steps that led
American officials to believe it was about to harvest a load of
plutonium at its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang,
the capital. Washington was prepared to seek sanctions at the
United Nations, a move North Korea had hinted could lead to
military reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was within hours of ordering additional troops to South
Korea when Carter visited Kim Il-sung, the country's founder and
its leader during the Korean War. He made the breakthrough that
ultimately led to a freeze of construction of North Korea's
Yongbyon nuclear reprocessing facility. Kim died the next month,
but the accord went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the freeze, Japan and South Korea agreed to build
two light-water reactors in North Korea for electricity production,
and Washington agreed to provide fuel oil to help the country
through its long winters. But Congress slowed those fuel shipments,
and the construction of the plants has moved very slowly; financing
is just now coming together.
</P>
<P>
   So last year North Korea resumed some classic provocations.
First there was the huge underground construction site. The
administration said little about it to Congress, and the
revelations about its existence in mid-August led to a storm of
congressional protests against Albright, who some members charged
had misled them. That was followed by the missile test over Japan.

HOUSE COMMITTEE CONCLUDES CHINA STOLE NUCLEAR SECRETS, OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee has unanimously concluded that
China systematically stole significant U.S. nuclear design secrets,
enabling Beijing to accelerate its weapons program so that it now
possesses thermonuclear weapons design information on a par with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report will be released next week, but this
summary came Thursday from officials who have read the committee's
final report or heard its findings in a closed Senate briefing on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen technology has allowed Beijing in a few years to leap
from a 1950s-era nuclear capability to possessing the most modern
technical information, the officials said. China vehemently denies
the accusations of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who attended the closed briefing, which was conducted
by Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said
the findings were deeply disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials who have been briefed about its contents,
the report concludes that Beijing's acquisition of secret U.S.
weapons designs was part of a 20-year intelligence collection
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The report also enumerates an array of thefts from the
government's weapons labs, including classified information about
seven advanced nuclear warheads, among them the W-88, the most
sophisticated nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal. The report also
says that China stole design information about the neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that after
listening to the briefing Wednesday about Chinese espionage, ``the
hair on the back of my neck stood up because it's scary.'' The
Mississippi Republican added, ``I haven't seen anything like it
before in my 26 years in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Building and deploying a nuclear weapons system requires more
than the design information, but such data is among the most
closely of American military secrets. Lott questioned why President
Clinton and his administration didn't act sooner to prevent
security breaches and he criticized the White House for delaying
the release of the Cox committee report.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said, ``Senator Lott's
comments are mystifying given the fact that Chairman Cox has said
we've been working cooperatively with the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and the Central Intelligence Agency began
to learn about China's espionage in 1995. But President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore were not personally told of the findings
until much later, officials said. On Thursday, at a Senate hearing,
Energy Department documents were released showing that Gore's
office was told by Energy Department officials early on, at least
in 1996 and possibly in 1995, about the first indications of
Chinese espionage at U.S. weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's national security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, was briefed in
April 1996, according to testimony before the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee by Notra Trulock, an Energy Department
intelligence official. This came about the same time the
president's deputy national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was
first told about China's spying.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosshirt, a foreign affairs spokesman for Gore, said
Thursday that Fuerth has no recollection or record of a 1995
briefing. He confirmed the 1996 briefing but said that Fuerth
waited until last March to tell the vice president about China's
espionage activities, shortly after news accounts of the spying
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Berger did not speak with the president about Chinese spying for
at least a year, telling the Cox committee that it was in early
1998. Berger's aides now say he remembers informing Clinton in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's briefing by both Cox and Dicks was an unusual display
of bipartisanship at a time when Congress has been riven over
issues ranging from gun control to Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the Cox report reflect the unanimous conclusions
of both Republicans and Democrats on the House committee, which has
spent months investigating allegations of Chinese espionage. Some
of the committee's findings remain classified and will not be
included in the report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or Secretary of Commerce
William Daley were not briefed by the Energy Department on the
allegations until the end of last year, when the Cox committee
finished its report, officials said. Since the first of the year,
the committee and officials in the administration have been
laboring intensively to figure out which portions of the report
could be declassified, but according to Cox the effort did not
quicken until March.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has said that about 30 percent of the committee's findings
will remain secret due to concerns by intelligence and law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he acted quickly upon learning of the
espionage threat at the government's weapons labs, ordering a
series of tightened security measures in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Trulock, a top intelligence official at the Energy
Department, told the Senate committee Thursday that some White
House officials and senior Energy Department officials did not act
expeditiously on the information that he and his aides brought to
them in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's successor, Bill Richardson, has enacted a far-reaching
reorganization, especially in recent months since the completion of
the Cox committee report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my appointment as secretary of energy, no mission has
been more important to me than improved counterintelligence and
security at the Department's national laboratories,'' he told the
House Committee on Science Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the Clinton administration's response to
information about Chinese espionage go beyond security procedures
at the labs. The Cox Committee, officials said, also found fault
with the administration's loosening of controls over the export of
sensitive commercial technologies which have applications to
nuclear weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton relaxed controls on sales of advanced
computers to countries like China. The next year, his
administration resisted Congressional efforts to retighten those
controls. The Cox committee concluded that some of the American
computers sold to China went to organizations involved in military
activities and that ineffective verification requirements raise the
possibility that American computers have been used for such
military purposes as upgrading nuclear weapons or developing more
accurate missiles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, China pledged to stop physically testing nuclear
weapons, increasing its reliance on advanced computers for
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, the U.S. intelligence community reported that
China had successfully stolen secret American design information
about the neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That same year President Clinton shifted the licensing
responsibility for some commercial satellite sales from the more
security-oriented State Department to the business-friendly
Commerce Department. The Cox Committee, officials said, concluded
that the shift was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used to launch a satellite into space is similar
to the technology used to deliver a missile armed with nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee hired an outside expert to evaluate help that
was given Chinese scientists in the mid 1990s by two U.S. aerospace
companies, Hughes Electronics and Loral Space and Communications.
The companies are under criminal investigation and have denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that the companies illegally transferred
information that benefited China's civilian and military rockets
and is helpful in the design of future Chinese ballistic missiles,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the panel's most severe criticism was aimed at Hughes,
which the committee found had intentionally side-stepped State
Department licensing requirements in 1995, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue involves a 1995 decision by the Commerce Department
that said it permitted Hughes to help the Chinese solve a rocket
failure _ even though State Department approval was required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the chairman of Hughes also headed President
Clinton's export advisory council.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>

   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday
that the alliance had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31
percent of Serbia's heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no
evidence of destruction. &QL;

 Corporate Career Counseling
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Laura Orozco had been the No. 1 telephone salesperson in her
division of Sun Microsystems for almost two years, but she was
getting bored. She thought of leaving the company. She thought of
signing up for some career counseling sessions at a local
nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Orozco took advantage of an unusual employee benefit
offered by Sun _ free on-site career counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Orozco ended up staying with Sun and becoming a software project
coordinator. Two years later, she again used Sun's counseling
program to help navigate a move into project management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without career counseling, I would have left the company for
sure,'' said Orozco, 32. ``But career services introduced me to
other people and other departments in Sun that I never would have
known about. They did everything from giving me a Meyers Briggs
skill test, to looking over my resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, based in Palo Alto, is one of a handful of companies that
offer career counseling as a standard benefit for all their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gutsy move. Many firms shy away from it, worried that
freely available career counseling would simply help their best
employees jump ship for new and better jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun officials say the program _ which provides individual
counseling to about 250 people each month _ actually helps them
hold on to workers in today's tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has found that attrition among employees who use career
counseling is about three percentage points lower than among those
who don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Silicon Valley are all competing for the same dwindling
talent pool, so you need to have programs to keep employees in the
organization.'' said Carol Guterman, career services program
manager for Sun. ``If our career program can stop one employee a
month from leaving the company, we're saving the company money.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, there was little need for the kind of
sophisticated career-development programs now offered by Sun and
firms like Pacific Bell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Companies sometimes offered counseling to small groups of
laid-off employees as part of an outplacement program. But most
firms simply assumed that workers could figure out their own path
through the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be very clear-cut career ladders, where you
could look on a chart and see where you were supposed to go _ from
Analyst 1, to Analyst 2, to Analyst 3,'' said John Parkington, an
organizational effectiveness consultant with Watson Wyatt in San
Francisco. ``That's pretty much vanished. I don't know any
companies in North America that are building career ladders these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with companies constantly merging and changing, many
employees realize they have to draw their own personalized career
map.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of employers provide some limited kinds of
career help _ software programs to assess people's skills, for
instance, or occasional workshops on career issues.
</P>
<P>
   But sustained and individualized programs like the one at Sun
remain very uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human resource folks are ambivalent about whether they can
sell these programs to senior management because the payoff isn't
easy to demonstrate,'' said Parkington. ``And some people say,
`Jeez, if we give counseling to people to enhance their careers,
they'll just bug out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sun's program grew out of a temporary counseling center put in
place during a period of layoffs in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 18 months, there was no need for outplacement, but
someone had the foresight to change it into an `inplacement'
center,'' Guterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sun offers four free career counseling sessions a year to
all of its 27,000 workers, as well as other services like brown-bag
workshops on career issues.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 percent of Sun's employees use the career services in
any given year.
</P>
<P>
   Counseling sessions are confidential and employees don't need to
inform their managers that they've signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The counselors are outside experts from the nonprofit Career
Action Center who work at Sun on a long-term contract basis _ an
arrangement that allows them to remain independent of the company
while developing an insider's knowledge of Sun's structure and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them to go into a site, set up their office as if it
were their own private practice, and get to know that division and
the way the organization works,'' Guterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bay Area companies offering significant career-development
benefits include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pacific Bell, which has five full-time career specialists who
last year provided 1,224 counseling sessions as well as various
workshops. Pacific Bell launched its program in 1989 in response to
a request by the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union wanted us to help employees deal with the reality of
change in the telecommunication industry, assessing and developing
people's skills so they could find the right career path,'' said
Joan Massola, state manager of the company's career development
centers.
</P>
<P>
   _ IBM, which has offered individual career counseling at in &LR; its
various locations since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hewlett-Packard, which doesn't have a large individual
counseling program but has made ``career self-reliance'' a major
corporate goal since 1994. HP's program relies mainly on periodic
workshops and on a career-assessment software program called
CareerSteps, which has been used by 6,000 of the firm's 126,000
employees since it was installed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The software is ``an inexpensive way for an employee to do a lot
of assessment,'' said Lauren Martin Brown, who oversees HP's career
education efforts. ``It doesn't have the experience or wisdom that
a career counselor does. But this is the closest most of our people
will ever get to having a career counselor, and the closest we want
to come as a company to having counselors.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sun, counselors help employees grapple with a wide range of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Recent college grads want to know how to plan their careers.
Other new hires want help figuring out the structure of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-career employees want to get out of a career rut, or switch
from engineering into marketing. Employees of all kinds come in for
help in improving their interview skills or retooling their
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The counselors occasionally find themselves in the touchy
situation of talking with an employee who wants to leave Sun. If
the worker's career goals really require him or her to leave, the
counselors will support that decision.
</P>
<P>
   But those cases are surprisingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Sun is a large enough organization that many
employees manage to change careers while remaining with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, employees who are determined to leave often
don't stop to talk to the counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who are going to leave are head-hunted and
don't need us,'' said counselor Linda Artel. ``The people who come
to see us tend to like the company and want to stay. One reason
they come to us is to find a way to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Braham, 39, is a Sun manager who not only uses the
counseling program himself but enrolled his entire team in a career
workshop. Two-thirds of his 28 employees have gotten individual
career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Braham says that counseling taught him to
network more effectively _ a skill useful to his work at Sun as
well as his own career.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Braham says the career program has created more
motivated and loyal employees. His employees know what their goals
are and understand how their work fits in with those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one of my people has left Sun in 2-1/2 years,'' he said.
``One reason is that they feel they can achieve their personal
ambitions working here.''

</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday
that the alliance had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31
percent of Serbia's heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no
evidence of destruction. &QL;

   TIRANA _ NATO's reluctance to send in ground forces against the
Serbs is creating a sense of foreboding among the Kosovar
Liberation Army, who fear they will be let down.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters in the organization report a mood of creeping pessimism
and worries that the West's desire to avoid a land war may lead to
a compromise peace deal falling far short of an independent Kosovo,
or even a NATO protectorate. Instead it may end up by leaving
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with powers to interfere... &QL;

   TIRANA _ She was a beautiful little girl, just 18 months old,

a mosque in Kukes. The only words she said were ``mother, truck,

   Thursday, in recognition of the need to care and counsel these

Commissioner for Refugees signed an agreement in Tirana to
establish ``Child-Friendly Spaces.''

ANALYSIS: 3 OPTIONS FOR WASHINGTON, ALL WITH MAJOR RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Encumbered by some testy NATO partners and by a
desire to wrap up the war over Serbia, the Clinton administration
faces several unpleasant options under the pressure of a looming
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House on Thursday, President Clinton insisted
again that the NATO air campaign was working and asked the nation
and Congress to be patient. His message was repeated in Washington
by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, the supreme NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
warned military chiefs in a briefing complete with color slides
that he could not guarantee that air power alone would force
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   With no breakthrough in sight in the diffuse diplomatic efforts
and no discernible triumph on the horizon, administration officials
said they had three choices, to press forward on the current
course, to increase significantly the air assaults or to persuade
the alliance that preparations should begin for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision to prepare ground troops, most likely to oversee
the repatriation of refugees, has to be taken in a few weeks if the
force is to be ready by winter, NATO officials said. An initial
deployment of troops would also send a useful message to Milosevic,
the NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all options are mutually exclusive. But all include
considerable political hazards, including further fracturing of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel something has to give,'' an administration
official said of the atmosphere at NATO. ``They feel they have to
have a military breakthrough or a diplomatic breakthrough. Everyone
is tired of this. Maybe we're getting to the first stage in
changing the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   An important point in the diplomacy was supposed to have
occurred Thursday in Moscow, when Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin
reported to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on his meeting
Wednesday in Belgrade with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's session with Milosevic was the first in several
weeks, and it was conducted after Milosevic had been assumed to
have ``stewed a bit,'' as one diplomat described it, about the NATO
air strikes. Talbott had spent hours with Chernomyrdin in Helsinki
to prepare him to present the allies' point of view to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin suggested in Moscow that there had been
some forward motion, a senior administration official here said it
was ``totally unclear'' whether Milosevic was prepared to move
toward accepting the NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat who has dealt frequently with Milosevic said
Thursday that the diplomatic track with Russians as mediators with
the Yugoslav leader was akin to ``crawling,'' and would take
``many, many weeks to get anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who wanted an exit through diplomacy, the exit is
quite a way off, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, set back by the mistaken bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade nearly two weeks ago, picked up steam
again this week with heavy strikes against the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But a bomb went astray early Thursday and hit a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a senior administration official said again Thursday
that the assaults were beginning to hurt the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up the air campaign could lead to several results that
the White House has been at pains to avoid. The first is increased
risk to U.S. pilots, who are flying most of the sorties. No U.S.
pilots have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is the greater risk of killing additional
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. public opinion has become more sensitive to the killing of
civilians by NATO bombers, and support for the air war has dropped,
although several polls indicate that most Americans continue to
support the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, some senators said this week that the
increasing civilian deaths had prompted them to support a bombing
pause.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion was also vigorously put forward Thursday by
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy, the second-largest
supplier of NATO air power.
</P>
<P>
   The option that the administration appears most reluctant to
choose is persuading the alliance to hasten preparations for ground
troops as an international security force in postwar Kosovo.
Britain has strongly argue for preparations. Germany, most of all,
opposes using any ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has ruled out an invasion force, but has agreed
that U.S. soldiers should be part of any security force that would
help repatriate the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees after the bombing has stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Such a force would need to be 48,000 troops, the Pentagon said
this week, much more than the 28,000 estimated before the war
started. Given that the administration had agreed that 4,700
Americans would participate in a force of 28,000, 6,500 Americans
would be deployed for the larger force, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inclination would be we need to move forward with it, so
we are in a maximum position to be ready,'' a senior administration
official said of the security force.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to estimate a timeline for such a buildup. The
official stressed that NATO had not yet asked member countries how
many troops or what categories they would be prepared to

<P>
   But that cautious approach _ deploying ground troops as
peacekeepers, and not as a threat to Milosevic _ is causing ever
more frustration at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what the Americans are doing,'' said an American NATO
planner. ``Trudging down the same difficult track, which is getting
stonier and stonier. The administration keeps hoping Milosevic will
break before they do.''
</P>
<P>
   There was still a belief at NATO headquarters that jibed with
the White House view, that if the air campaign continued long
enough, the allies would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But what then, asked the American NATO planner, adding, ``You've
ended up with a desert in Kosovo _ a totally collapsed structure _
and you still have Milosevic in power.''

 Moving Temp Firms May Not Pay
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have been working as a temp for a small business on
one or two afternoons a week. After two months, I asked my
employment agency for a raise but they declined. I work through
several agencies and know that they all have different pay scales.
If I can get another agency to pay me $2 or $3 more than my current
agency, can I ask the employer to switch to the agency of my
choice?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Switching agencies could end up boosting your pay, but
it may be more complicated than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Most temp agencies want to hold on to the workers they've
recruited. They cast a cold eye on ``temp-napping'' by rival
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   So some agencies require their client companies to sign
contracts limiting the kind of interagency switch you're
considering. Or they require client firms to pay hefty fees in
order to hire a temp permanently _ fees that might apply in your
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss should read through his or her contract with the temp
agency to see if there are any limits on hiring you through another
agency.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract doesn't present any legal problems, go ahead and
make the move. More temp workers should follow your lead and look
at whether the wages they're getting paid are competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But keep a couple of things in mind: You probably won't be
welcomed back with open arms in the future by the agency you're
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And the income you gain may be less than you imagine. Several
temp industry managers told me it's unusual to see a wage spread of
$2 or $3 for the same clerical job with the same employer. (On the
other hand, it's not uncommon to see a significant wage gap when
doing similar work for different employers because the employers
are billed at different rates.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if it's a $2 or $3 difference,''
said Jill Gruber, vice president of branch operations at Westaff, a
temporary staffing firm in Walnut Creek. ``The market tends to keep
wages competitive. Typically, the difference between agencies is
less than $1.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching Visas
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a native of India who arrived in the United States this
spring on an H-4 visa. I'm living with my husband, who is a
computer programmer with an H-1B visa. I have a three-year
bachelor's degree in business from India, along with one year of
computer training, and I now am studying to get an MBA. I'd like to
work while I finish my studies so that my husband doesn't have to
bear all the financial burden. But the H-4 visa doesn't allow me to
hold a job. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Your husband has an H-1B visa, which is a temporary work
visa for skilled professionals. You have an H-4 visa, which allows
spouses and children of H-1B visa holders to live here but not work
here.
</P>
<P>
   There are two different ways you could seek a legal OK to work,
according to Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be to switch to an F-1 student visa because you're
apparently enrolled in business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have permission to work at some on-campus jobs right
away and to work at some other kinds of off-campus jobs after nine
months,'' Shusterman said.
</P>
<P>
   The other option is to apply for an H-1B visa yourself.
Typically, the government limits H-1B visas to people with
bachelor's degrees. So you'd have to demonstrate that your
three-year degree combined with other training or work experience
amounts to the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in this country.
</P>
<P>
   There are some hurdles with this approach. Because H-1B
applicants must be sponsored by an employer, you'd need to line up
a job before you actually could apply for a visa. And the annual
quota of H-1B visas has been handed out already for this year so
you'd have to wait until the start of the new fiscal year, in
October 1999, to have your application processed.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to pursue an H-1B visa, you should talk to an
experienced immigration attorney. To find out if you're eligible
for a student visa, talk to the foreign student adviser at your
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can find a detailed description of the
different kinds of visas on Shusterman's Web site at
 &LR; www.shusterman.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Overtime Conundrum
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a buyer in a manufacturing concern who is paid on a
salary rather than hourly basis. For the third time in recent
months, I've been asked to come in for mandatory weekend work. Can
I demand overtime pay for this? They're treating me as an exempt
employee, but I think they may be wrong because I don't supervise
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You may be legally exempt from overtime even if you don't
supervise anyone, under what is called the ``administrative''
exemption from overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The California Employer Advisor newsletter in Tiburon publishes
a good guidebook summing up the rules for overtime exemption. To
qualify for an administrative exemption in California, it says,
workers must:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spend 50 percent or more of their work time on tasks involving
the exercise of ``discretion and independent judgment in the
performance of intellectual work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Have decision-making power over ``matters of consequence'' to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assist an owner, manager or other exempt administrator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work under general rather than close supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earn at least $1,150 per month.
</P>
<P>
   As a buyer, you may meet these criteria if you have the
authority to make significant decisions about purchasing _ even if
you don't supervise a single soul. The answer really lies in the
details of your particular job and how much responsibility you're
given.
</P>
<P>
   Want more information on the rules for exemption? Check with the
California Labor Commissioner's office at (415) 557-7878, or call
the Employment Law Center, which offers free legal advice to
low-income workers, at (415) 864-8208.
</P>
<P>
   Employers also may find it worthwhile to order the CEA exemption
guidebook for $34 from (800) 695-7178 or  &LR; www.employeradvice.com. &LR;

   &UR; MOST SERB MILITARY STILL UNDAMAGED, NATO NOW ADMITS &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ More than two-thirds of Serbia's tanks and heavy
artillery inside Kosovo are still intact, NATO admitted Wednesday,
raising the prospect of many weeks of further bombardment before
the military capacity of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is
rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater success in the last two weeks of the air
campaign and reports of discipline beginning to disintegrate, NATO
concedes that the Serbs still have a formidable fighting force left
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, General Walter Jertz, said Wednesday
that the alliance had ``struck'' _ rather than destroyed _ 31
percent of Serbia's heavy forces, a nuance which means there is no
evidence of destruction. &QL;

Serbs is creating a sense of foreboding among the Kosovar
Liberation Army, who fear they will be let down.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters in the organization report a mood of creeping pessimism
and worries that the West's desire to avoid a land war may lead to
a compromise peace deal falling far short of an independent Kosovo,
or even a NATO protectorate. Instead it may end up by leaving
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with powers to interfere... &QL;

   TIRANA _ She was a beautiful little girl, just 18 months old,
who had been loved. She was found alone and crying on the steps of
a mosque in Kukes. The only words she said were ``mother, truck,
KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, who was given the name Atdhetare, was just one

   Thursday, in recognition of the need to care and counsel these

establish ``Child-Friendly Spaces.''

FOX WILL HAVE MORE CONVENTIONAL FARE NEXT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reality bites the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. But Fox next fall will be cutting back on
``reality-based'' series in favor of more conventional fare. The
network on Thursday unveiled eight new series _ five dramas and
three comedies _ along with plans to shuffle five other shows to
new time slots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newcomers, ``Time of Your Life,'' has Jennifer Love
Hewitt in a spinoff of ``Party of Five.'' One of the comedies,
currently titled ``Ally,'' is a blenderization by David E. Kelley
of previously filmed scenes from ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The shows getting new slots are ``King of the Hill'' and
``Futurama,'' both moving to Sunday; ``That '70s Show'' and ``Party
of Five,'' both switching to Tuesday; and ``Family Guy,'' to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of Fox's new fall series:
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm in the Middle. A comedy about a 9-year-old kid from a
dysfunctional family who turns out to be a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Time of Your Life. Jennifer Love Hewitt's Sarah Reeves leaves
San Francisco, searching for answers to her mysterious past. She
winds up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ally. If an hour's worth of ``Ally McBeal'' is too much (or if
you just can't get enough), this half-hour compilation of unused
and previously seen footage from ``Ally McBeal'' is the answer to
your prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Get Real. Hourlong drama about a family of six trying to keep it
together under one roof. Debrah Farentino (the mom), Jon Tenney
(the dad) and Christina Pickles (the grandma) are the adults trying
to stay a step ahead of Meghan, Cameron and Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester Prep. Think ``Dynasty, the Teen Years.'' It's all
about ``sex, scandal and betrayal'' among the teenage elite of New
York's Upper East Side, centered on a love-hate relationship
between a boy and his new stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   Action. A half-hour satire of the movie business, starring Jay
Mohr and Illeana Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Caulfield. One-hour drama about a 19-year-old Philadelphian
who turns down a college scholarship to join the police force. Sean
Maher stars as Ryan Caulfield, who still lives at home with his
mom. Mary McDonnell co-stars as Ryan's mom, Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh Realm. Chris Carter, creator of ``The X-Files,'' combines
action-adventure with sci-fi in this drama based on a series of
comic books. Seattle resident Scott Bairstow stars as a soldier
fighting for his life in a world where reality and virtual reality
are indistinguishable. D.B. Sweeney plays a ``virtual'' guy named
Mike Pinnochio.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy's animated sitcom ``The PJs'' isn't on the fall
schedule, but Fox has placed a full order of 22 episodes and plans
to return it to the schedule in midseason. The network also has the
newsmagazine ``Fox Files'' on the bench, along with two new dramas,
``Dark Angel,'' a sci-fi drama from James ``Titanic'' Cameron, and
``The Opposite Sex,'' about an all-girls prep school gone co-ed,
plus a new comedy, ``Titus,'' starring comedian Chris Titus.

   ``We're glad to escape from high school and run away from all
these problems,'' the 18-year-old said Thursday after news spread
of the latest school shooting, in Rockdale County. ``Most kids just
want to get out and start out next year with a clean slate, and
maybe this stuff won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazzled principals, teachers and parents, too, say they need a
summer break badly to reduce anxiety levels that have built since
the shootings a month ago at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all ready for a vacation,'' said Charlie Henderson,
principal at Clarkston High. ``We haven't had any problems here,
not any, but still we're more aware that these kinds of things can
happen, and you have to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say that everybody will be relieved to see this year
end.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the news of shootings that has people on edge.
Since the Columbine shootings, many schools have had to endure
their own bomb threats and emergency drills. Students have been
suspended for statements that might have been seen as jokes before.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee High has installed surveillance cameras. Walton High in
east Cobb has rigged 72 doors to open only from the inside. Decatur
High requires students to take bathroom breaks in a group.
</P>
<P>
   Recent tornado alerts in many metro school districts added
another layer of tension. So this may be the tensest end of the
school year since the height of the Cold War, when air raid sirens
often blared, preparing students for handling a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were slow to accept that school may not be the safest place
for our children,'' said Chamblee Principal Dianne Clark. ``I never
dreamed this kind of thing would dominate. Never in my wildest
dreams did I think we would ever be concerned about such things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on heightened alert for the last month,'' said
Walton Principal John Flatt. ``We are constantly updating our
security plans. We're urging students and parents and teachers to
constantly keep their eyes and ears open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking, sensitive to any change in personality,
change in dress, that kind of thing,'' said Dr. Barbara Wideman, a
psychologist who works for the Cobb County school system. ``All
over Cobb, the administrators and teachers are in the halls,
looking and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means students must cope with extra supervision _ and
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur High received three bomb threats last week, prompting
evacuations. ``They've got the school on lockdown,'' said Travis
Adle, a senior at Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   But Travis and his friends approve of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extreme measures,'' says junior Ron Crane. ``But
(bomb threats) are messing with our education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking around a little bit more,'' said Jennifer
Turner, a 16-year-old junior at Wheeler High School in Cobb. ``All
this trouble has added stress to the end of the year, which is
stressful anyway. Definitely, we don't want to be here anymore, and
not just because summer is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the jitters always end when the school day does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, I was in Captain D's. I sat down with my
husband, and I was looking around to see where the exits are,''
said Laura McGraw, whose son Devin attends Walton. ``Everybody
seems sensitive to what is being said now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody feels the same fear. Some seem to have become numb
to the threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard about the (Rockdale) shooting, we thought it was
no big deal because nobody got killed,'' said Brandi Burton,15, a
freshman at Jonesboro High School.
</P>
<P>
   And, though Thursday's shooting touched metro Atlanta, others
still see the shootings as distant events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at a Catholic school and my children both go to a
Catholic school,'' said Eileen Maron of Decatur. ``Maybe I'm naive,
and I don't feel like this could happen to my children. There's
something special about Catholic school that I feel like protects
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others avoid worry by adopting a fatalistic attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to school every day,'' said Jonathan Rohan, a junior at
East Coweta High School. ``If I get shot, that's just what happens.
I'm probably in more risk driving from home to school than I am of
being blown up anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, though, students, parents and teachers deeply
feel the recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Garrett said the events of the last month ``took some of
the excitement out of finally being king of the hill'' for her son
Matt, a senior at Newnan High.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is counting the days until her children are out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be glad when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hendriks, the Chamblee senior: ``A lot of students are
saying, 'Maybe this summer this will blow a lot of frustrations
over, and people will come back rejuvenated, not hurting. I come to
school to learn.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's frustration, sadness and despair, all due to all
the stuff that's happened. No one can say it hasn't influenced them
in some way.''

HOUSE APPROVES STAR WARS DEFENSE PROGRAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Texas, Ore.)   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two decades of debate over whether to create
a Star Wars defense program, the House voted overwhelmingly
Thursday to enshrine in national security policy the intention to
field a system to protect the country against ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With a vote of 345-71, the House approved the bill that was
passed by the Senate in March. The measure now goes to President
Clinton, who ``in all likelihood will sign it into law,'' a White
House official said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the strong bipartisan support for the bill, with 132
Democrats voting with the 213 Republican majority, was based in
part on the vague nature of the measure. The bill does not
authorize the construction of the antimissile system nor does it
appropriate any money for it. Instead, the bill commits the
government to deploying a missile defense system whenever it is
technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Citing new threats from North Korea, which launched a missile
over Japan last summer, and from China, the House approved the
legislation even though the technology does not exist to build a
network of radars and interceptor missiles to shoot down enemy
missiles heading for the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent assessment, the Pentagon said such a system
could not be deployed before 2005, two years longer than previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan first raised the possibility of a far
grander Star Wars defense against a major missile attack by China
or the Soviet Union 16 years ago, at the height of the Cold War.
The idea drew withering attacks questioning whether the technology
could ever be built and whether it would be worth the hundreds of
billions of dollars required to build it.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's debate, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican
majority leader, gave his party credit for winning the debate that
``Ronald Reagan began in 1983.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The missile threat to the U.S. is real,'' Armey said. ``This
threat and our recent intelligence failures leave us no choice but
to do our best to pre-empt rogue dictators with their fingers on
the button.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Reagan's original proposal to create a defense against a
large attack from the Soviet Union, this more modest system, if it
is built, would only defend the country against a few missiles
fired by nations like North Korea. The Pentagon favored those
limitations and the bill's refusal to impose a deadline for
deployment or to include specifications for the design of a system.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has budgeted $10.5 billion over the next six years
to create a workable system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the bill passed Thursday included an amendment adopted
by the Senate in March that softened earlier concerns of the
Democrats, including Clinton, that the measure would undercut arms
control treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires that any money spent developing the missile
defense system must be voted on each year in the congressional
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   With so many of the potentially divisive issues blunted by
compromise, the largely Democratic opposition was left to emphasize
the high costs of the plan _ it has already cost $60 billion over
the last 15 years _ and the questionable results from the tests of
the missile system. One opponent of the bill compared the Star Wars
missile system to the special effects in the ``Star Wars'' movie
prequel opening across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the movie, this is a phantom solution _ hitting a bullet
with a bullet in outer space,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program questioned the need for such a defense
system since the United States' sizeable nuclear force has been an
effective deterrent for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to launch missiles against the U.S.
because they know we will blow them up,'' said John Pike, director
of space programs for the Federation of American Scientists. ``We
are spending $30 billion a year on nuclear forces to enable us to
turn any other country on the planet into a radioactive parking lot
on half an hour's notice. That's why no country will attack us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vernon Ehlers of Michigan was the lone Republican voting
against the measure. As a trained physicist, Ehlers said he could
not vote for something that cost so much _ perhaps an additional
$75 billion _ and seemed to have such a small chance of succeeding.

LATE SELL-OFF IN COMPUTER ISSUES PULL DOW DOWN 20.65
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A late sell-off in Internet and other computer-related stocks
helped drag down major stock-market averages Thursday, erasing
modest gains that had prevailed for most of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts were generally upbeat, pointing out that advances
outnumbered declines by nearly a 3-2 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange and to some normal jitters over the expiration Friday of
stock and index options.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that the bulk of it was unwinding'' before the
expirations, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at AG
Edwards, referring to a final-hour swoon that left the Nasdaq
composite index with a loss of 35.17 points, or 1.36 percent,
closing at 2,542.23.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts noted another solid advance by smaller stocks,
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's small-cap index climbing 1.06 percent
into positive territory for the year and to the highest level since
Jan. 11. The Russell 2000, a similar gauge, climbed just over
four-tenths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a healthier market for having broadened out'' beyond
big-cap growth stocks in the past several weeks, said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   And investor appetite remained ravenous for the latest Internet
company to go public. The shares of EToys Inc., priced late
Wednesday at 20, soared as high as 85 before ending the day at 76
9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up nearly 59 points in
midmorning, traded narrowly before a late slump left it with a loss
of 20.65 points, or nearly two-tenths of 1 percent, to close at
10,866.74.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the biggest casualty, falling three, to 232 7/8,
followed by Alcoa and United Technologies, down 2 11/16, to 58 5/16
and 2 9/16 to 63 1/16, respectively. Pacing the gainers were
Procter &AMP; Gamble, ahead by 1 11/16 to 96 11/16, followed by Merck,
up 1}, to 72\, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 1 5/8 to 95. Two other
drug stocks, Warner Lambert and Schering Plough, also gained after
word they were discussing a merger.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology stocks were broadly lower, with Amazon.com down
8}, to 130 13/16, Ebay 10 3/16 to 186 5/8, Dell 1 9/16 to 38\,
Intel 2, to 57 11/16, Texas Instruments three, to 114 3/8 and
Microsoft 7/8, to 78 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange volume eased to a moderate 752.3
million shares from 767.7 million on Wednesday.

MERRILL CHARGED WITH 2ND FIRM IN COPPER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators filed a lawsuit Thursday against Global
Minerals and Metals Corp., a Manhattan commodities merchant, and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the investment firm, contending that the two
companies took part in an illegal scheme to manipulate world copper
prices in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, lawyers at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said executives at Global Minerals had conspired with a
rogue copper trader at Sumitomo Corp., the large Japanese trading
company, to illegally corner the copper market in a scheme that
fell apart in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The commission charged Merrill Lynch with knowingly aiding and
abetting Global Minerals and Sumitomo in the conspiracy. Merrill
Lynch provided the two companies with a trading account and more
than $500 million of financing and lines of credit, the regulators
said in their court complaint. Merrill Lynch executives knew that
the two companies were using the trading account to buy up much of
the world's copper supply, the regulators said, and withhold it
from the market to artificially inflate its price.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said that Merrill Lynch had profited from aiding
the two companies in the scheme by making its own trades on the
copper market as the price rose. The investment firm's profits on
those trades were ``in the millions of dollars,'' said a lawyer who
has been briefed on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill denied the commission's charges Thursday, saying the
allegations had no merit. The firm said in a written statement that
its business transactions with Sumitomo ``were conducted in a
commercially reasonable fashion and were fully visible to the
regulators at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill Lynch had no knowledge that the conduct of Sumitomo,
one of the world's largest companies, was unlawful,'' the statement
said, ``and Merrill Lynch had no intention to render assistance to
any conduct that was improper.''
</P>
<P>
   And, H. Peter Haveles Jr., a lawyer for Global Minerals, said
the regulators' complaint was ``based on an `Alice in Wonderland'
view of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Haveles said regulators in London, where most of the copper
trades took place, had been fully informed of the company's
activities at the time. The company is confident, he said, that the
administrative law judge that hears the case will conclude that
Global Minerals and its executives did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge decides that the regulators' charges are true, the
companies could be fined as much as triple the amount they gained
from any illegal transactions and could be ordered to pay
restitution for any damages that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Sumitomo settled charges that U.S. commodities
regulators brought against it by agreeing to pay $150 million in
fines and restitution. Sumitomo settled without acknowledging or
denying the regulators' charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo's copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, pleaded guilty to
criminal charges in Japan in 1997 and is serving an eight-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hamanaka, who became known in the commodities world as
``Copper,'' bought huge positions in both physical copper and
contracts for its future delivery. Capitalizing on weak disclosure
rules, he was able to buy and sell and confuse other traders about
the true size of his copper holdings and thus about the real global
demand. Most of the trading occurred on the London Metal Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the trades ran up the price of copper. But when the
scheme collapsed in the spring of 1996, Sumitomo still had large
positions in the copper market and lost $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit Thursday, regulators provided more details on
how Hamanaka worked to corner the world's copper market. They said
that the trader and R. David Campbell, a New York resident, had
talked between 1989 and 1992 about how they could manipulate the
price of copper to their mutual advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the regulators said, in the spring of 1993,
Campbell helped create a new copper trading company, Global
Minerals and Metals. Campbell and Hamanaka then agreed to a series
of copper supply contracts, the regulators said, in which Global
would sell and Sumitomo would buy physical copper in large
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Because Global was a ``start-up copper merchant,'' it was unable
to get credit lines large enough for the huge copper trades that
were needed to corner the market, the regulators said. But in April
1994, a managing director at Merrill Lynch solved this problem, the
regulators said, by devising a plan where Sumitomo and Global
opened an account in the name of Sumitomo. Global was given the
authority to trade on that account, which was backed by Sumitomo's
credit, the regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said that Merrill Lynch employees knew what the
two companies were trying to do. The regulators said that Global's
chief copper trader, Carl Alm, had discussed strategies with a
Merrill Lynch employee, Martyn Phillips. ``Alm and Phillips
frequently executed trading strategies designed to tighten supply
and increase price,'' court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators charged both Campbell and Alm with helping Global
carry out the illegal trades.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at Merrill Lynch who agreed to talk on the
condition of anonymity said there was nothing unusual in giving
$500 million of financing to a company of Sumitomo's size, or in
allowing Global, its business partner, to execute trades on the
account.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Merrill Lynch said that it had fully
cooperated with the regulators' three-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill Lynch is extremely disappointed that despite the
substantial factual record developed, the commission has decided to
institute this proceeding,'' the statement said.

HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF UPN'S MOVES FOR FALL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard to figure where UPN is going these days. But it sure makes
for interesting copy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the viewer-starved network announced a fall
prime-time schedule that includes five new series, but it also
canceled the animated series ``Home Movies,'' its most interesting
new comedy in years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers are three comedies, a drama and a weekly,
two-hour helping of fake wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   A rundown on UPN's new series:
</P>
<P>
   Mo'Nique. Half-hour comedy spinoff of ``Moesha,'' featuring
Countess Vaughn in the role of Moesha's friend, Kim Parker.
Mo'nique, played by stand-up comic Mo'Nique, is Kim's mom, who
decides it's time to go back to school, much to Kim's dismay. Best
character name: Probably Mo'Nique, no?
</P>
<P>
   The Grown Ups. Jaleel White (Urkel of ``Family Matters'') plays
Calvin Frazier, regional vice president of a corrugated-box
company. While hoping his new title serves as a babe magnet, he
lives with a woman who thinks he's gay. Best character name:
Marcus, Calvin's arch rival.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta McNasty. The title alone is worth at least one visit.
``Shasta McNasty'' is a sitcom, and it's the name of a fictional
hip-hop group made up of three guys _ Ran, Dennis and Scott (Dale
Goldboldo, Jake Busey and Carmine Giovinazzo) _ who live together
in Venice Beach. Despite their success, they continue to act in the
manner of typical slacker bachelors. Best character name: Can't
beat Shasta McNasty.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Agent Man. A throwback to ``Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' days
from the makers of ``Men in Black,'' featuring a trio of agents
working for a government agency that monitors high-stakes global
espionage. Costas Mandylor, Dondre Whitfield and Dina Meyer star.
Best character name: Monk, played by Mandylor.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Smackdown! The World Wrestling Federation comes to network
TV. Best character name: With the likes of Stone Cold Steve Austin,
The Undertaker and The Rock, the WWF is nothing but weird names.

FIRST THREE KOSOVAR FAMILIES LEAVE FORT DIX TO START NEW LIVES IN
U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ With little more than hope, anxiety and a few
pieces of carry-on luggage between them, the first three families
of Kosovar Albanians left the haven of this Army base, where they
were embraced just two weeks ago, and fanned out across the
American landscape to begin their new lives in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The three families, 18 people in all, had learned only on
Wednesday that they would be moving from Fort Dix to apartments in
Sarasota, Fla., Seattle and Boise, Idaho. Under a glorious morning
sun, friends they had made in these last tumultuous weeks stood by,
tearful at their imminent departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about Boise,'' said Arlinda Gashi, 19,
as she waited to see her friend Mirsade Bejiqi, who was leaving for
Idaho. ``But now I know that it's potato city.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Bejiqi, 20, came out, she collapsed in tears as she
hugged her friends. ``How many times do I have to say goodbye to my
friends?'' the young woman said. ``That's the real question.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for her family in English, Ms. Bejiqi said she had
never heard of Boise, and wanted most of all to go home to Kosovo.
``Whenever it's better in Kosovo, I will go back,'' she vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sevdie Pllana, 39, said she had never heard of Sarasota, where
she was headed with her husband, Mehmed, 69, and their three
daughters. She said one daughter had learned about the United
States and reassured her when they were told they would be moving
south.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us Florida was a good place to live,'' Ms. Pllana
said. ``We hope it will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's departures begin the resettlement of the Kosovar
refugees, who now number more than 3,000 here. On Friday six more
families, totaling 25 people, will leave for destinations still
unannounced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement organizations are making an effort not to
concentrate the refugees in any specific region of the United
States, but to resettle them in clusters in communities throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Muhamet Hakiqi, 28, stood outside drawing a map of the United
States on a slip of paper. He asked how Seattle, Wash., where one
of the families was flying to today, could be on the West Coast,
confusing it with Washington, D.C., where President Clinton lives.
Hakiqi said he was feeling ``a little bit upset _ I don't know
where these people are going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks, the Kosovars have been checked by doctors and
immigration and law-enforcement officials. Once approved, the
newcomers are eligible to apply for permanent residency in a year,
and for U.S. citizenship in five years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, representatives from nonprofit refugee relief
agencies have been collecting data on the families and parceling
out the newcomers for resettlement by one of nine resettlement
agencies, which have found communities throughout the country that
are eager to welcome the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   The resettlement agencies receive an initial grant of $740 for
each refugee they resettle, some of which may be passed along to
the refugees. The agencies are reimbursed for any additional
services they may provide, including English lessons or help in
finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their confinement, the refugees have had their every
need attended to at Fort Dix, where soldiers have child-proofed the
barracks and officials have provided English lessons and cultural
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the newcomers ended a chapter of uncertain waiting that
began with their forced expulsion from their battle-torn homeland
in Yugoslavia. They traded the security and comforts of Fort Dix
base for freedom in this vast country, which they know mostly
through television and books.
</P>
<P>
   Lavinia Limon, the head of the refugee resettlement program for
the Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday that she
sent the Kosovar Albanians out with good wishes but had not been
prepared for the emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk out this door and onto that bus, you're free to
enjoy all the rights of citizens except voting,'' she told them.
One man smiled broadly. Others broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some confusion,'' Ms. Limon said, adding: ``As
Americans, we don't know what it's like not to be free, and they
don't know what it's like to be free. They will learn this, over
the course of time.''

VANILLA ICE CLAWING HIS WAY BACK WITH NEW ALBUM, TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In 1994, Vanilla Ice nearly killed himself with a
potentially lethal mix of heroin, marijuana, booze and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to escape permanently,'' the former rap star
said by phone this week from Miami. ``My friends were dumping
buckets of cold water on me. It was an ugly scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice had reached the peak of his career in the early '90s
with the hit album ``To the Extreme'' and its chart-topping rap
single, ``Ice Ice Baby.'' Fueled by the popularity of his MTV
videos, the album sold more than 15 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   But the unmerciful backlash that followed turned Vanilla Ice _ a
white rapper with platinum-blond hair and a cocky image _ into a
national joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very cocky, very stupid. Just young and dumb,'' he said.
``But I know the impact I had was phenomenal, whether positive or
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   After his overdose, Vanilla Ice realized he had to pull himself
together. He had a leaf tattooed on his abdomen to signify he was
turning over a new leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vanilla Ice _ born Rob Van Winkle _ is clawing his way
back with an album, ``Hard to Swallow,'' that is radically
different from his rap of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice described its hardcore sound as ``skate rock'' or
``Adidas rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Vanilla Ice and his seven-piece band created the sound on
their own, the former rapper credits producer Ross Robinson _ who
has worked with Korn, Sepultura, Limp Bizkit and other hard-edged
bands _ with giving it the right spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what the music is and it's hard to explain,'' he
said. ``Ross Robinson pretty much invented the sound. It's a
mixture of punk, metal and hip-hop.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs are cathartic. ``Zig Zag Stories'' focuses on
his drug experiences, while ``Scars'' stirs up tales of abuse from
his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is like therapy,'' he said. ``I was all alone on
this planet when I overdosed. And I felt like I had no friends to
talk to about this stuff. It was trapped inside me. So I've used
the music to talk about it and let it out. I feel much better
now.''
</P>
<P>
   One song, ``Too Cold,'' features a line from ``Ice Ice Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to say, `Look, guys, this is me. I'm not running or
hiding from anything. This is how I sound now. You either like it
or you don't.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept my past, but I've moved along. And I've cut the
string, so to speak. I'm not a puppet or record company whore
anymore. I'm trying to keep it real.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice's band includes two guitarists, two bassists, a
drummer, a deejay and background singer. Most of the shows on the
tour have been at clubs and small theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing clubs,'' he said. ``It's so in-your-face, so
personal. It's not about trying to milk a stadium full of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice described the shows as ``dark, energetic and
spontaneous,'' with lots of Gallagher-esque antics. ``One night we
brought a bag of flour out and got it all over us, the crowd,
everything,'' he said. ``It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the tour began in October, Vanilla Ice and crew have
performed more than 100 shows to crowds that included goths, punks
and mainstream rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have listened to Vanilla Ice when they were in high
school because everybody across the country did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they weren't really into rap or hip-hop. They were more
into Pearl Jam and Smashing Pumpkins and bands like that. So they
can appreciate the rock side of what I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice looks back on his days of rap stardom with a mix of
pride and regret. He began his career as a raunchy rapper
performing for predominantly black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he had to choose between two record deals. The first,
for about $30,000, would have placed him in a recording studio with
rap group Public Enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with them would have given me tremendous credibility
as a rapper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second deal, which he accepted, was a recording contract
worth $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody in my shoes would have done what I did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was three car payments behind and I was living with three
other guys in an apartment and couldn't pay the rent. It was like
winning the lottery and I took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize the consequences of being turned into a
novelty act literally overnight. I was playing to 12-year-olds in
braces at huge arenas. And I was asking myself, `Where did my real
crowd go? They were gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Vanilla Ice played it smart with his finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I went on a huge spending spree, I put on the brakes.
And then I started studying about all these entertainers who made
millions and just lost it. I tried to learn from that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most celebrities who have been over the waterfall in a
barrel, Vanilla Ice values the kinds of things he once took for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my 19-month-old daughter and realize that she would
not be here if I succeeded in killing myself,'' he said. ``Now I
see what life's about.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Dan DeRose, marketing consultant, was busy doing
the math for his new client, the Newark Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   The question on everyone's mind: How much money could the
district make if it signed an exclusive contract with a soft-drink
company? The answer, DeRose said: a lot more than it gets right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say everyone drinks one product a day, and let's
just count the students,'' he said. ``At 45,000 times 180 days of
school, that's 8.1 million cans. At 75 cents apiece, that's $6
million walking out the front door of your school every year in
quarters and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get a lot of it,'' he told his audience of principals,
athletic directors, PTA officials and one student. ``Let's get some
of it back to the schools.'' Even $5 million would make a
difference in the district's $550 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   With his square shoulders, steady smile and conscientious use of
the first-person plural, DeRose and his company, DD Marketing, are
storming a once-quiet backwater in the soft-drink business. Schools
regard him as a font of information. Soft-drink companies, which
used to make low-key deals on their terms with local school
districts, hate him with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known consultants in a rapidly growing
specialty, DeRose, who is based in Pueblo, Colo., says he has
obtained exclusive contracts, or is negotiating them, for 63 school
systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive contract, a winner-take-all creation of the
soft-drink companies themselves, eliminates rivals' products from a
school, a hotel, an airline. Thanks to Coca-Cola and Pepsico's
desire to market to children, and the eagerness of schools for the
income, DeRose has found a niche.
</P>
<P>
   Almost evangelical in his zeal, he primes school officials to
take on the soft-drink companies, raising the stakes for all
concerned and profiting handsomely from the deals that go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan DeRose is probably the person most responsible for this
current feeding frenzy,'' said Alex Molnar, a professor of
education at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Others say there is a need for his services. ``Most educators
don't have a background in food management,'' said Barry Gaskins, a
spokesman for the Pitt County schools in Greenville, N.C., which
hired DeRose last year. ``They're trained in the three R's, and the
R's don't include retail.''
</P>
<P>
   While demand for exclusive contracts has never been greater,
there is a distinct downside. Some lawmakers want to ban the sale
or giveaway of soft drinks on school grounds during the school day,
citing nutritional concerns and the ubiquity of ads and vending
machines. Advocates for education say students are captive
audiences who should not be sold to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   DeRose is working with Valerie Wilson, the food-services manager
for Newark schools, who wants to consolidate the system's patchwork
arrangement _ some Coke here, some Pepsi there, plus other brands.
Whoever wins the contract would supply sodas for vending machines
and juices in 82 school cafeterias and water and other drinks for
athletic events.
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion about the merits of the idea, officials
solicited bids from three marketing consultants, settling on
DeRose, Ms. Wilson said. Earlier this month, nattily dressed in a
gray suit, blue silk tie and black alligator loafers, he met with
the committee Ms. Wilson assembled to discuss the fine points.
</P>
<P>
   He warmed up by discussing deals he has orchestrated for school
systems in Colorado and Kansas _ one for $11.1 million, the other
for roughly $5.3 million. ``In Kansas City,'' he noted, ``they were
getting 67 cents a kid before, and now they're getting $27.'' Then
he went to the heart of the issue: how much Newark's kids could be
worth.
</P>
<P>
   As in hundreds of school systems around the country, Newark
officials are unable to pay for every program on their agendas. The
system was so badly mismanaged that in 1995, the state took
control.
</P>
<P>
   To make the most of its assets, DeRose said, Newark should make
a deal with just one soft-drink giant. ``We're going to get what we
call a rights fee,'' he said, adding that companies like Coke and
Pepsi love exclusive contracts because they imprint brand loyalty
on young minds.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, DeRose cited his own first-grader, Anna, whose
school in Pueblo has an exclusive contract with Coca-Cola, the work
of DD Marketing. ``From now until she's graduated, all she'll drink
is Coke,'' he said. ``She goes out for pizza and we ask, What do
you want to drink, honey? Coke. She doesn't even know how to spell
Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics compare DeRose to the title character in ``The
Music Man,'' the musical about a small town falling for a
charlatan's pitch. ``He really illustrates the worst aspects of
commercialism in schools,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw, senior program
director for the Center for Commercial Free Public Education in
Oakland, Calif. ``He is making millions of dollars off
commercializing public schools, and he is not taking into account
any of the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   How many millions? DeRose would say only that ``We're doing
really good.'' He charges a percentage of the final contract _ 25
to 35 percent, according to school systems that have hired him.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recently he modified his commission for a $4.6 million contract
between Coca-Cola and the Manteca, Calif., schools. DeRose offered
to accept $160,000, far less than 25 percent, after Coke first
refused to bid on the contract, said Jerry Ogden, an assistant
superintendent there.
</P>
<P>
   Such fees, soft-drink companies say, are outlandish. ``These
consultants who charge commissions based on the fees in the
contracts generally bring little or no value to the school
system,'' said Bob Lanz, a spokesman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, the
Coke bottler for Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Statements like these elicit smirks from DeRose, who likes to
read from Coca-Cola's 1997 annual report _ lines like ``Sales of
Coca-Cola and other company products exceed one billion servings
per day'' _ as part of his sales pitch. The names and logos of Coke
or Pepsi do appear frequently on exclusive contracts he arranges.
``They'll want ads in athletic programs, something on tickets, and
the scoreboard,'' he told the Newark group. But when Ms. Wilson
asked whether there would be ``Coke and Pepsi plastered all over
the building,'' DeRose replied: ``We'll do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRose insisted he was helping make schools more realistic for
children. ``If you have no advertising in schools at all, it
doesn't give our young people an accurate picture of our society,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, children should not be ``bombarded with it.''
His partner in DD Marketing came up with the idea of putting ads on
school buses, and the company also markets Zap Me, a
computers-in-schools program that includes ads in one corner of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say soft-drink contracts distort a school's role. They
differ from contracts for textbooks or pencils, which are
educational essentials, Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry about the nutritional impact. ``Twenty years ago,
teen-agers drank twice as much milk as soda pop, and now they drink
twice as much soda as milk,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive
director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark group seemed impressed by DeRose's presentation,
which included frequent pauses to answer questions. ``It's a first
time for us,'' said Roger Jones, a spokesman for the Newark Public
Schools, when asked why the system needed a consultant. ``It's an
opportunity to bring together all the people involved in vending so
we have one voice speaking for everyone,'' and help generate a
windfall ``that ultimately goes back into our system so students
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of DeRose's projects work out. The Pitt County school
board paid him nothing after opting not to pursue a contract. Both
Coke and Pepsi refused to bid, though a vending company made an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the board learned a lot. ``Just by the fact that Dan DeRose
walks in and says this is the kind of money you could get, you know
it's there,'' said Gaskins, the Pitt County spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``some of our board members felt this was too
good to be true, and another rubbing point was the commission that
would be paid to DD Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thought of generating that kind of revenue stream,
where you didn't have to raise property taxes, you didn't have to
increase the sales tax and you didn't have to do battle with the
county commissioners, was very attractive,'' Gaskins conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's always easy money. School officials in Colorado
Springs learned last year that only beverages purchased from
vending machines count toward the system's 70,000-case annual
quota, said John Bushey, an administrator, which has forced the
system to pay closer attention to purchases to make the most from
its $11.1 million contract with Coca-Cola. ``Quite honestly, they
were smarter than us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With their costs rising, Coke and Pepsi say they want to avoid
deals that involve marketers like DeRose. ``I'm surprised that
during his presentation, the high school band didn't break into a
spontaneous version of `Seventy-Six Trombones,''' said Lauren C.
Steele, a spokesman for Coca-Cola Consolidated, a bottler in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi also views consultants with distaste. ``We tend not to
love working with these guys,'' said a spokesman, David DeCecco.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, soft-drink companies would make low offers and
schools would usually accept them, lacking the time and inclination
to pursue alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the word is out. ``Coke came to the table with an offer
last week, and I said, `based on what you did in Manteca and what
you did in Wyoming, this isn't good enough,''' said Bill Erlendson,
an official with the San Jose, Calif., school district, who used
information DeRose provided. He was expecting a revised bid from
Coke this week.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Newark calls for installing eight vending machines
at each of the city's 13 high schools; two to four at each of the
69 lower schools. ``Typically, we like to add a machine in a hall,
to give the company a presence,'' he said. Committee members were
asked to sign confidentiality agreements, to keep the offers secret
from competing bidders, DeRose said.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark group next meets June 1 to discuss the proposal
DeRose assembles, before soliciting bids from the beverage
companies. If all goes according to plan, Newark will sign an
exclusive contract by the time school opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   At its last meeting, the committee did express several
reservations, including whether one old high school would be able
to support eight vending machines on its existing electrical work,
and whether the girls' basketball team would still be able to sell
drinks at football games.
</P>
<P>
   DeRose smiled, fixed his gaze on the group and said: ``All of
your concerns, I've heard them 500 times before. All of your peers
across the country have the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give you a little comfort: when this process is over, we're
all going to have more money than we have now.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Natan Yehuda is still elated, three days after a
long, joyous night of beef and wine celebrating the staggering
electoral triumph of his political party and spiritual home, Shas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they push us down, the more we will rise up,''
Yehuda, 40, said in an open-air market Thursday, with a hearty
handshake and wide smile. ``Before they know it, we will be prime
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party representing working-class
Sephardic Jews, has been the political phenomenon of the last
decade, a social and religious movement with a strong message of
ethnic pride. The party's followers are descendants of Jews who
immigrated from North Africa and the Middle East after 1948. Shas
has risen from scratch to secure a place as the third largest party
in the multi-partied Israeli Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday's elections, Shas was dwarfed by the two major
parties, Likud and Labor. On Monday, however, as Likud and Labor
shrunk, Shas mushroomed. It captured 17 out of 120 seats, up from
10 and only 2 less than Likud.
</P>
<P>
   That stunned many Israelis, who struggled to reconcile what
seemed to be contradictory results: the landslide victory of Ehud
Barak, a secularist kibbutznik, as prime minister, and the
unexpected rise of a political movement led by three rabbis _ one
scholarly, one mystical and one, Aryeh Deri, a convicted criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming contradiction underscores that the fiercest battle
lines in Israeli society are between secular and religious. If
Barak's victory was part of a backlash against the power held by
religious parties under the departing prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, Shas' gain was a stab in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, for He is good!'' proclaimed the banner headline in
the special election edition of the Shas Party newspaper, Day by
Day.
</P>
<P>
   But in another, more basic way, the two wins _ by Barak and Shas
_ are two sides of the same coin. They both reflect the failure of
Netanyahu and of his demoralized Likud Party. Just as Barak
siphoned voters from Netanyahu, Shas stole them from Likud, a
traditional home for the Sephardic working class, the so-called
Second Israel. Sephardic Jews in Israel often complain of feeling
like outsiders, belittled and discriminated against by the
Ashkenazic elite.
</P>
<P>
   The sub-headline in the Shas paper tells that story: ``The dream
has come true! The Second Israel is not second anymore! Sephardim
have captured the state of Israel!''
</P>
<P>
   A political party built on a fundamentalist religious movement,
Shas has used its access to government funds to develop a national
social service infrastructure. Offering hot meals, pre-school,
government jobs and Torah studies, it has built a loyal following
among poor Israelis of North African and Middle Eastern descent. It
has developed into a kind of Sephardic power movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the closest thing we have to the Islamic movement,'' said
Shahar Ilan, a religion expert for the Haaretz newspaper. ``It's
not violent. But Shas is a party that builds on its institutions of
welfare and education. It is the real proletarian party of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Likud earned the most votes in Jerusalem and Shas came
in fifth. This year, Shas captured more votes there than any other
party.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Shas' new adherents are not strictly religious, but were
drawn in partly by what they perceived to be the persecution of
Deri.
</P>
<P>
   Deri's conviction on corruption charges this spring galvanized
many Sephardim. Many accepted Deri's view _ expressed in a
videocassette and CD-rom called ``J'accuse'' _ that he had been
singled out and persecuted by the judicial system because he was
Moroccan-born and successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph went to jail in Egypt, and eight years later he was
king,'' Yehuda said. ``The same will happen to Aryeh Deri. If he
goes to jail, he will come out prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced in April to four years in jail, Deri, who was a close
ally of Netanyahu, is free pending an anticipated appeal of his
conviction on bribery and fraud charges. On Tuesday, feeling
exonerated by his supporters, Deri announced he would step down as
Shas' political leader and resign from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, on the night of elections, hundreds
of young Israelis pleaded with Barak to turn his back on the
ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party when he forms a coalition
government. ``Just not Shas!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   But a party that earned nearly 430,000 out of 3.7 million votes
is difficult to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can scorn these numbers, and no one can scorn these
people,'' Yossi Beilin, a top-ranking Labor official, told Israel
television.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who aims to build a broad government, says that he will
not include Shas if Deri remains the leader behind the scenes. The
leftist Meretz Party, a key member of Barak's future coalition,
said it would not sit beside Shas in a coalition with or without
Deri, protesting what it calls the religious party's defiance of
the ``rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak has called the party ``a genuine political and social
movement,'' and some of his colleagues in Labor have been
rehabilitating the image of Shas as a viable partner now that Deri
has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation effort stems largely from the Barak
government's sense of the future. Since the Shas leadership, as
opposed to that of Likud, is emphatically and unconditionally
pro-peace, the presence of Shas in a coalition could add crucial
support for concessions in any peace negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his book-lined study, Rabbi Reuven Elbaz, one of the
movement's leading rabbis, explained Shas' position on peace and
some of his own views.
</P>
<P>
   With piercing eye contact, Rabbi Elbaz spoke in the soothing but
animated tones of a charismatic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Sephardim are Middle Eastern people,'' he said. ``We lived
with Arabs in the past with no problems. We respected them. They
respected us. In fact, they give more respect to the Jews who are
believers, like us. In the end, the Arab people too believe in the
Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should let the rabbis negotiate on this issue,'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   An aide, Binyamin Edry, 28, later offered his view: ``If one
sheep is surrounded by 70 wolves, he cannot do battle. So as the
saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them. We're all sons of
the same maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Edry pointed to the work that Shas has done developing social
service systems in some Israeli Arab villages. This earned Shas, as
he noted, many votes in many Arab towns, like Kafr Manda and Yirka.
</P>
<P>
   As yeshiva students studied beneath him in a high-ceilinged
hall, Elbaz traced his own involvement in the back-to-religion
movement that Shas has spawned among the Sephardim. He spoke of
touring coffee shops and billiard halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you walk into the stronghold of those so far from the
Torah? I was asked,'' he said ``Slowly we did. From one small
yeshiva of born-agains, we developed over the years into 230
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same way with Shas,'' he said. ``We started with 4
seats, then 10, now, thank the Lord, 17. Next time, it will be 25,
26.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz said it was partly ``natural growth,'' given the large
families in the religious Sephardic population, partly the
recruiting success of Shas' schools and jobs programs, partly
ethnic pride and partly ``a feeling of oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling on his beard, he said he was puzzled by what seemed to
be fear of the ultra-Orthodox by secular Israelis. ``They think
we'll force them into it, don't they?'' he said. ``But the Torah is
not imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had a ``deep friendship'' with Barak _ and photographs
to prove it _ he described him as ``very, very gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are no devils around him, he will lead very, very
well,'' the rabbi said. ``He does not have hate for religion. I
believe we could work very well with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of Shas, has said that
he believes Deri's resignation opens a door into Barak's
government, and that he would welcome an alliance, Haaretz reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials have supposedly already accepted that they are
bound to lose the powerful Interior Ministry, which oversees
immigration policy and much municipal-level social spending.
Yisrael Baaliyah, the Russian immigrant party of Natan Sharansky,
campaigned to wrest its control from Shas, and will likely get it.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians' campaign increased Moroccans' jealousy of Russian
immigrants _ for receiving benefits denied them decades ago _
indirectly fueling their resentment and probably driving more to
Shas.
</P>
<P>
   The peace issue aside, Shas ministers in Barak's government
could well constrain on his efforts to promote harmony between
secular and religious Jews. And it would alienate many who voted
for him partly out of anger at the special powers and privileges of
the religious parties under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But Elbaz, his palms laid flat on an oversized Hebrew text
before him, said he did not feel that Barak had much choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for groveling,'' he said. ``But he can't lead
the country without us. The social sector, the poor people, would
rise up if their interests were not represented.''

AUSTRALIA COMES THROUGH AGAIN WITH A QUIRKY COMEDY, `THE CASTLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the days of ``Crocodile Dundee,'' Australia has been
good for at least one delightfully quirky, jump-out comedy hit
every year _ a ``Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' ``Muriel's
Wedding'' or ``Strictly Ballroom.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's example could be ``The Castle,'' an Aussie comedy
that's been the biggest domestic hit of recent years Down Under. It
debuted last weekend at the 25th Seattle International Film
Festival and begins a regular theatrical run on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of the Kerrigans, a lower-middle-class family
that lives happily in an eyesore of a home on the edge of
Melbourne's international airport. As the film opens, they discover
that the airport is expanding and their home is to be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Kerrigan _ an extremely good-natured tow-truck driver
_ simply refuses to believe the Australian Constitution will allow
such a soaring injustice to occur, and the movie chronicles his
battle to save the Kerrigan ``castle.''
</P>
<P>
   The running joke _ which is accented by voice-over narration by
the youngest Kerrigan son _ is that the family doesn't have a clue
as to how hopeless their plight is, or how absurdly naive their
worldview is. They're gullible, trusting and boundlessly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The trick first-time director-writer Rob Sitch pulls off is
that, while the movie is set up to ridicule the Kerrigans and their
values, it doesn't. Gradually and subtly, it celebrates them and
vindicates the power of their childlike faith.
</P>
<P>
   Another film from the Seattle International Film Festvial's
opening weekend that's leaping into a regular theatrical engagement
on Friday today is ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' a breathless
romance directed by the popular Basque filmmaker Julio Medem
(``Vacas,'' ``The Red Squirrel'').
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of the epic, star-crossed love affair between
Otto and Ana (each played by three different actors during the
course of the film), who fall instantly in love as children, seem
destined for one another in every way, but have a heck of a time
getting together.
</P>
<P>
   It is non-linear (jumping back and forth in time), structured in
a series of titled chapters (alternating the points of view of the
lovers), sumptuously photographed, voluptuously surreal and
fatalistic and, overall, so silly it's only an inch away from
self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   The Castle. Directed by Rob Sitch. Written by Sitch, Tom
Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Santo Cilauro. Cast: Michael Caton, Anne
Tenney, Stephen Curry, Charles Tingwell. Miramax. 82 minutes. Rated
R for no obvious reason.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of the Arctic Circle. Directed and written by Julio
Medem. Cast: Fele Martinez, Najwa Nimri, Nancho Novo, Maru
Valdivielso. First Line Features. 112 minutes. In Spanish with
English subtitles. Rated R for nudity and sex scenes.

WIVES, MOTHERS PROTEST, AND GENERAL SENDS TROOPS BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Five days of demonstrations by women in
southern Serbia who were angry because their men had been drafted
for military service in Kosovo ended Thursday when many of the men
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The army commander in Kosovo, Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic,
intervened to defuse the anger of the women, reservists' wives and
mothers who were demanding news of the men. Pavkovic also commands
the Third Army, based in Nis.
</P>
<P>
   He met with hundreds of women on Wednesday in two separate and
stormy sessions in the Krusevac Town Hall, listening to their
complaints and calling the men heroes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, soldiers began arriving home in army trucks
and cars, apparently given permission to return from Kosovo in
large numbers, and residents reported that Krusevac was quiet
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The women's main demands had been for new information. Their
anxiety turned to terror when the bodies of seven soldiers were
brought home for burial last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The women were expecting the men to return after the official
announcement on May 9 that troops were being withdrawn from Kosovo.
But rumors flew that there had been many casualties, residents
said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who attended a meeting with Pavkovic said the women
had asked him to understand that they were not unpatriotic and did
not want the army to abandon Kosovo, just that they wanted news.
</P>
<P>
   Some were angry and complained that while the men were in
Kosovo, rich young men went around town talking on their cellular
telephones. Many complaints were based on economic hardship. With
the main breadwinners absent, some for 40 days, many women are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were sometimes heated, but ended with the women
applauding the general. One gave him a gift, a sweater. He listened
to their complaints, one woman said, and promised that reservists
would serve shorter terms and that the men would be relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Pavkovic described the March 1998 class of draftees as ``real
heroes.'' Those troops should have ended their one year of service
two months ago, but have had their period extended. Some
demonstrators in Krusevac were mothers who were protesting the
extension.
</P>
<P>
   The timely return of some reservists was also probably an army
move to defuse the tension. NATO had reported that 500 to 1,000 men
had demanded to return home after hearing of the demonstrations.
When they were denied permission, NATO officials said, the troops
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governing Socialist Party, Ivica Dacic,
dismissed any suggestion that the men were deserters. ``Such a
thing exists only at NATO briefings, and they are aimed at
undermining national unity and the defense of the country,'' Dacic
said.
</P>
<P>
   An army official in Belgrade said, however, that the men had
been given permission to go home. Those soldiers who returned
clearly did so with permission and little tension, residents said.
They stood in groups on village street corners, hugging friends and
relatives, said a resident who had traveled by bus through the
region. Gunfire sounded through the night and much of the morning,
apparently from soldiers who were celebrating the return by firing
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have clearly embarrassed local authorities,
as has recent violence in Belgrade aimed at the opposition
Democratic Party headquarters. Foreign journalists have been denied
permission to travel to Krusevac and Aleksandrovac, near the Kosovo
border.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign television crews including CBS News and CTV of
Canada had film of the damage to the Democratic Party offices
confiscated or heavily censored.
</P>
<P>
   That Pavkovic went to talk to the women was a signal of how
serious the protests had become. It may also be a sign of his
natural charisma. He is the country's most visible general, has
frequently appeared on television and has been promoted three times
since the beginning of the yearlong Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a weekly newspaper, Svedok, he warned NATO
not to try a ground offensive, because ``hell awaits them.'' It was
a fierce message to the allies, but it was also a rallying cry to
his troops and the people of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people and our army are determined to defend Kosovo at any
cost,'' Pavkovic said. NATO ``cannot advance overland without many
casualties. Of course, we can count on taking losses, too. But if
they come here, they must know that they will not be able to stay
and survive. They are going to die day by day, month by month, and
die horrible deaths.''

BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER URGES CONGRESS NOT TO `BUCKLE' ON KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Conn., N.Y.)   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The British foreign minister, Robin Cook, came to
Washington Thursday to tell Congress and the American news media
that ``this is not the time to lose our nerve'' over Kosovo, and to
say that NATO should have troops and equipment ready to advance if
Yugoslav forces collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't buckle first,'' he told the Senate Armed Services
Committee, because that would greatly weaken NATO, said Sen. Jack
Reed, D-R.I., who was at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Cook made his sales pitch despite a complaint by President
Clinton on Tuesday night about what appeared to be a British push
for an invasion of Kosovo. But Cook insisted his trip had been
planned long before and did not relate to any differences with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's tour seemed aimed instead at American public opinion,
with a lunch with columnists, editorial writers and reporters, and
meetings with House and Senate committees coming before a session
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and an appearance with
her on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He told the House International Relations Committee that he
believed there were no serious differences between Britain and the
United States, or even with Germany. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
of Germany threatened on Wednesday to veto the use of ground forces
before a peace agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Cook offered a reporter a three-point summary of his message:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The USA should be proud of what it has accomplished in the
Kosovo campaign so far.'' (Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said Cook
stressed that American pilots had flown three-fourths of the combat
missions, and that he dismissed the idea that it was a risk-free
campaign, saying the pilots did not feel that way.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The air campaign has already caused serious demoralization
among the Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``This is not the time to lose our nerve. The air campaign is
working, and NATO should be ready to take advantage of its
success.'' (Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., quoted Cook as saying,
``There can't be a gap between when Milosevic surrenders and you're
ready to move.'')
</P>
<P>
   King and Gejdenson said Cook's arguments were well received by
most of the representatives present.

`THE LOVE LETTER' IS BEST RETURNED TO SENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hong Kong romance, ``Comrades: Almost a Love Story,'' was
not even an art-house hit in this country but it was probably the
best-reviewed foreign film of 1997 and won the best picture award
at that year's Seattle International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is not too surprising that its director, Peter Ho-sun
Chan, would be one of the Hong Kong directors invited to make a
big-budget Hollywood film after the near-collapse of the former
colony's film industry during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike John Woo and the others who have successfully made
the transition to these shores, Chan's particular gift seems to
have been stunted by the Hollywood machine. His first U.S. film,
``The Love Letter,'' is a fairly charmless dud.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Cathleen Schine, it's about the effect of a
gushy and anonymous love letter on a number of characters in a
small, idyllic, seaside Massachusetts town _ most prominently Helen
(Kate Capshaw), a single, 40ish bookstore owner who first finds it.
</P>
<P>
   She assumes it was written by Johnny, the hunky 20-year-old (Tom
Everett Scott) who works part time in her store. When he stumbles
upon it, he assumes Helen wrote it to him. Then Helen's business
partner, Janet (Ellen De Generes), finds it, and assumes it was
written to her. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The mix also includes George (Tom Selleck), the town fireman
who's always loved Helen; Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson), a
tomboyish young woman who also works in the bookstore and has a
crush on Johnny; and Helen's mother (Blythe Danner), who has a
secret romantic agenda of her own.
</P>
<P>
   As this mass of romantic confusion plays out, the best thing
about the movie is Capshaw, who proves herself to be more than just
the boss' wife (the film was produced by DreamWorks, and she is
Mrs. Steven Spielberg). Without trying, she's quite appealing, and
she holds the screen well.
</P>
<P>
   But she has little chemistry with the annoyingly boyish Scott,
and she can't do anything with a premise that never once seems as
light and magical as the producers obviously hoped it would be, and
a script that is labored and grindingly unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the movie lacks the kind of light, deft directorial
touch that a Lubitsch or a Renoir might have used to make the
souffle rise. Chan clearly has no feel for eccentric Northeastern
characters or small-town American life, and everything about ``The
Love Letter'' rings false.
</P>
<P>
   The Love Letter. Directed by Peter Ho-sun Chan. Screenplay by
Maria Maggenti. Cast: Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen DeGeneres,
Tom Selleck, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart. DreamWorks. 89
minutes. Rated PG-13 for sex scenes and brief nudity.

SIGNALING SHIFT ON GUN CONTROL, SENATE PASSES CRIME BILL

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a vote of 73-25, the Senate Thursday night
passed a broad juvenile crime bill that contained an array of new
gun-control measures, the fruit of the most significant debate over
gun control in Congress in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures ranged from a requirement that licensed dealers
sell child safety devices with every handgun to mandatory
background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun shows. The
amendments to the juvenile crime bill also restricted the access
that children under 18 have to semi-automatic assault weapons and
banned the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than any of these measures was the fact
that they came up for consideration _ and, in some cases, drew
bipartisan support _ at all. That fact reflected an undeniable
shift in the political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Although surprising momentum has grown in the Senate in recent
weeks for gun control measures, they are still relatively modest
and fall short of proposals for more stringent regulation. Yet the
progress represents the biggest victory for the gun control
advocates in five years, and they come as a new political center is
developing on guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had once chalked up the loss of their majority in
Congress in 1994 to their advocacy for gun control, suddenly sensed
that the issue had turned in their favor and pressed forward with
gun-control proposals. Many Republicans acquiesced, more skittish
about seeming soft on gun control than alienating the gun lobby or
their most conservative, rural constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But the most charged moment of the day came hours before the
bill's passage, when Vice President Al Gore made a rare Senate
appearance and cast a tie-breaking vote that enabled a Democratic
gun-control amendment to prevail over a less stringent Republican
version.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-50 vote on the amendment, which would require background
checks with the sale of firearms at gun shows, reversed the outcome
of a similar vote last week and was easily the most stunning of a
string of Democratic victories on gun control in the Senate over
the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided Gore, whose campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination has yet to catch fire, with a heady
triumph. Democrats believe that American sentiment about firearms
has turned toward their party's advocacy of tighter restrictions,
and Gore got to carry that banner by playing the knight who arrived
in the nick of time to save a teetering cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voted less than four hours after bullets ripped through yet
another high school, in Conyers, Ga. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said
the shooting was a factor in his decision to switch his vote in
favor of his party's measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, for his part, was visiting Littleton, Colo.,
where the shooting deaths of 15 people at a high school last month
altered the political climate enough to make Thursday's events in
the Senate possible. The legislation faces uncertain odds in the
House, where there have been conflicting signals about lawmakers'
receptiveness to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' said Gore, a
radiant smile glued to his face, at a news conference after he left
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   More somberly, Gore added, ``Now I personally would like to
dedicate my tie-breaking vote to all of the families that have
suffered from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours later, after debates and votes on less heavily
freighted amendments, the Senate passed the juvenile crime bill,
73-25. The core of the bill, which became a vehicle for several
gun-control amendments and the most significant gun-control debate
in Congress in half a decade, calls for $1 billion in federal
grants to toughen prosecution of juvenile crime and enhance efforts
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill before the House Judiciary Committee does not
have gun-control measures in it. But the committee's chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced Thursday that such amendments would
be considered when the committee met to reshape the bill in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time in Gore's vice presidency that he
broke a tie in the Senate, over which the vce president technically
presides.
</P>
<P>
   As votes on the last of several gun-control amendments trickled
in around midday, Gore took a seat at the head of the chamber. When
it became clear that a tie was likely, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., giggled and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the vice
president. Other Senate Democrats rushed over to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans have a 55-to-45 advantage in the Senate,
six Republicans who have repeatedly broken party ranks on gun
control sided with Democrats Thursday, while only one Democrat
sided with Republicans. That created the tie.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Senate voted on the gun show amendment,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called a news conference to
raise a different issue: the leaking of nuclear secrets during the
Clinton administration to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the success of the Democratic gun-show amendment,
which he opposed, Lott said that the Democrats' campaign for gun
control was largely political preening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns don't cause people to do these things,'' Lott said.
``Something in their beings is doing it. When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a statement released in Littleton, said, ``I
applaud the Senate for today's historic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official described the Lott news conference as
an attempt to divert attention away from his party's gun-control
``debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gun-show amendment, which would mandate
background checks on all people buying weapons at these shows,
joined a series of a half dozen gun-control measures that have
passed as amendments to the juvenile crime bill. Many of the
measures garnered broad Republican support, an unmistakable sign of
changed times.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Democratic gun-show amendment was the last
strange twist in a bizarre chain of gun-show votes that had
Republicans switching their course or tweaking their position from
one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic gun-show amendment first came up for a vote
a week ago, Senate Republicans defeated it, 51-47, in a largely
party-line vote. Instead, they approved a rival Republican
amendment that called for voluntary background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Senate Republicans rethought their position and
passed a new gun-show amendment that they said made background
checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that the combined Republican amendments
actually relaxed existing gun-control regulations in other areas.
So the Republicans came back with a third amendment, intended to
address concerns about the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment passed Thursday. But only minutes later, the
original Democratic amendment, modified slightly and reintroduced,
supplanted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new outcome was explained in part by the presence of two
Democrats _ Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Daniel
Inouye of Hawaii _ who had been absent last week but voted in favor
of the amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critically, Sen. Cleland of Georgia, one of only two
Democrats who had opposed the measure last week, changed his vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that, because of subtle revisions to the original
Democratic amendment, he had almost firmly decided to switch his
vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that awaking Thursday morning to news of the
shooting in his home state erased any tiny, lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to occur in my own state, in my own back yard,
reinforced and steeled my commitment,'' Cleland said. ``It pushed
me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat to vote against his party Thursday was Max
Baucus of Montana, whose position suggested the degree to which
geography trumps party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six Republicans who joined Democrats last week and
again Thursday were from the Midwest, where support for easy access
to firearms is not as fierce as in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio.
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator John Warner of
Virginia also voted for the Democratic amendment.
</P>
<P>
   These senators said they had problems with several aspects of
the Republican gun-show measures that even a third amendment did
not fix. The measures, for example, would have made it less
cumbersome for licensed gun dealers to sell weapons in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also would have shortened from three business days
to 24 hours the amount of time given to vendors at gun shows to
conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big loophole,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had lobbied against the
Democratic gun-show amendment and, after the vote, said that the
Senate had not addressed a larger problem: lax enforcement of
existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that the association's influence was clearly
waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen today now is, for the first time in a major
kind of gun-control issue, rejection of the National Rifle
Association and a vote for common sense,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control measures in the juvenile crime bill include a
requirement that licensed gun dealers sell child safety devices
with every handgun; a prohibition on gun ownership for anyone who
commits a violent crime as a juvenile, and new restrictions on the
purchase and possession of semi-automatic assault rifles for
children under 18.

NO REAL TENSION, TOO MANY DETAILS IN `ENDURANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In movie decades past, it was often the custom to surround a
popular athlete with professional actors and cast him as himself in
a movie version of his own life _ ``The Jackie Robinson Story,''
``The Bob Mathias Story,'' ``The Greatest'' (Muhammad Ali), etc.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Endurance'' renews this custom in a somewhat artier
style with its biography of Haile Gebrselassie, the long-distance
runner who grew up in soul-devouring poverty in rural Ethopia to
became one of the stars of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and most interesting, part of the film traces the
early years of the determined runner on a drought-ravaged farm,
where his stern father is less than supportive of his athletic
interests, and his kindlier mother dies young.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to years later and Haile has moved to the capital city of
Addis Ababa, where he lives with his older brother and has joined a
track club. Only a few scenes later, we're at the Olympics, where
he establishes himself as what one commentator calls ``perhaps the
greatest runner ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Leslie Woodhead, a documentary filmmaker, says
his intention was to make less a competition movie and more a kind
of Robert Flaherty-like entho-documentary in the vein of ``Nanook
of the North.'' And the first half of his film does a fair job of
this.
</P>
<P>
   But even these scenes soon get bogged down in numbing
ethnological details, and the rest of film fails to build any real
tension. The Olympics sequences are almost completely devoid of
drama, and the script never quite makes it clear exactly why he's
regarded as being such a special athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gebrselassie exudes a quiet determination and
likability, he's simply no actor. His face and eyes are opaque, his
manner is self-contained, and he communicates little of the fierce
inner drive that propelled him to these Olympian heights.
</P>
<P>
   Endurance. Directed and written by Leslie Woodhead. Cast: Haile
Gebrselassie, Gebrselassie Bekele, Assefa Gebrselassie. In English
and Ethiopian with English subtitles. 124 minutes. Rated G,
suitable for all audiences.

A BOY WITH AN AFFINITY FOR WEAPONS WOUNDS 6 AT GEORGIA SCHOOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Almost every teen-ager in the neighborhood knew
what was in Thomas Solomon's basement. They could hardly have
missed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guns were in this fancy display case, like a wood and
glass armoire,'' said Skip Morgan, 16, who lived two doors away.
``There had to be a dozen, maybe 15: all rifles, really nice ones
that his stepdad collected. And the bullets were in this drawer
right underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lock on the case, but it did not keep Thomas, a
15-year-old sophomore known as T.J., from getting to the hunting
weapons kept their by his stepfather. Friends say he knew where the
key was kept, and liked to take a rifle into the woods behind his
spacious home for occasional target practice on tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning it was a .22-caliber rifle that was used to
wound six students at T.J.'s high school not far away, a spasm of
violence for which the boy was being held by Rockdale County
authorities in a juvenile facility 30 miles from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities would not say Thursday if the rifle used in the
attack had come from the case in T.J.'s basement. As interested as
he was in his stepfather's guns, friends said, Thomas had never
been known to point one at a person.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cohran, who played baseball with Thomas for years in the
county athletic league, said his friend had never been considered
an angry or defiant young man, and had the usual number friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he was a football star, but he had friends,''
said Larry, like T.J. a sophomore at Heritage High School. ``Nobody
picked on him. He was just a regular kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a child of privilege. T.J. lived with his sister,
mother and stepfather in a large four-bedroom home on an acre and a
half of land at the end of a winding cul-de-sac called Hanover
Square, where the lawns are as lush and manicured as putting
greens. The 27 homes in the neighborhood _ each a solid fortress of
brick, many with winding driveways and basketball courts _ range in
price from $200,000 to $500,000, said Sue Kelley, a real estate
agent for the neighborhood, who lives next door to T.J.'s family.
She said the family had bought the house about two years ago for
$275,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' stepfather, Robert W. Daniele, is believed by neighbors
to be a salesman who works in Atlanta. His mother, Mae Dean
Daniele, is a secretary who works in the Conyers area. The parents,
who moved with their children to the neighborhood from South
Carolina, were described by those who live on their street as
friendly but not notably outgoing, just another prosperous
professional couples who like the quiet of an exurban subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept to themselves, and we'd only see them when they
worked on the yard,'' said Al Morgan, Skip's father. ``I drove T.J.
to summer school last year along with my son, and he seemed like a
quiet kid, pretty much like most of the others. He didn't make much
of an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at the school had mixed impressions of T.J.'s position
in its social hierarchy, with some describing him as an outcast and
others saying he preferred his friends in his boy scout troop and
on his baseball team. ``He was a nerd,'' said Jordan Smith, a
sophomore who ran in a more popular crowd. ``In home room, when
everyone else was socializing, he'd sit and do his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Cohran, who knew him better, said Solomon was more
intelligent and a better student than most of his schoolmates, and
wasn't interested in their chatter. He liked listening to rap
music, particularly Tupac Shakur, several friends said, and played
a variety of computer games ranging from virtual sports to the more
violent Mortal Kombat, although he was not described as being
obsessive about it. He was the only teen-ager his friends knew who
cared enough about target practice to regularly shoot arrows into
an archery target in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had been seeing a girlfriend for about two years, Larry
said, but lately the couple had been struggling, because she
believed he did not talk to her enough. Larry said he believed the
two had a serious argument the day before the shooting, and may
have decided to break up, although Larry was skeptical that could
have led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it could have been,'' said Larry, who cared
enough about his friend to wait at the county courthouse with his
grandfather for a chance to shout a word of support. ``I just
talked to him the other day, and he was fine. I guess you never
really know what's going on inside.''

   WASHINGTON _ NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, told Pentagon
leaders Thursday that the alliance needed to begin soon to assemble
a force of 45,000 to 50,000 troops on Kosovo's borders, U.S. and
NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The force would be intended to increase pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, to accept NATO's terms for a
settlement. It is one of three things _ including the use of Apache
helicopters in Albania and tougher steps to cut off Yugoslavia's
supply of oil _ that Clark sought to bolster the military campaign.
In conversations with U.S. officials, he warned that NATO might not
prevail with air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you prepare for ground forces, among other things, you make
Milosevic contemplate the consequences of not going along with the
political objectives'' of NATO's campaign, one official said,
describing Clark's message.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to move ahead with the deployment came at a time
when diplomatic efforts to forge a solution were developing on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, met outside
Moscow Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had just returned from talks with Milosevic in
Belgrade, where Goran Matic, an influential Minister Without
Portfolio, said, ``I think we can expect a political settlement in
the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomacy and Clark's visit to Washington _ his first since
NATO's summit here a month ago _ came at a time of divisions within
NATO about the course of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and other capitals, political pressure has grown
to end the conflict. Earlier this week, Britain called on NATO to
do basically what Clark is proposing: build up allied forces in
Albania and Macedonia as a way to increase pressure on Milosevic.
After President Clinton declined to rule out ground troops on
Tuesday, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, bluntly and
forcefully derided the use of ground troops and said his country
would block NATO from fighting any war on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The force Clark is recommending would be intended to enter
Kosovo only after the bombing ended, officials here said. The
deployment of the force, which would need the approval of NATO's 19
members, would also leave open the option of a ground invasion
should the air campaign ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton said the alliance needed to stay ``focused
and patient'' while it pursued its goal: allowing Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians to return to their villages and live with a degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the campaign is working,'' he said. ``Each day we
hear reports of desertions in the Serbian army, dissension in
Belgrade, unrest in Serbian communities. President Milosevic should
know that he cannot change the fundamental terms that we have
outlined, because they are simply what is required for the Kosovars
to go home and live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke after meeting at the White House with his national
security advisers to discuss NATO's progress. Clark did not attend
that meeting, nor did he appear in public.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he spent the day across the Potomac River in closed
meetings at the Pentagon with Secretary of Defense William Cohen;
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton; the
vice chairman, Gen. Joseph Ralston, and the senior officers of the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and the Pentagon have portrayed the campaign as a
success, Clark provided a more sober assessment of its status and
its prospects, officials familiar with the meetings said. While
Clark said nearly two months of bombing had exacted a heavy toll on
Yugoslavia's armed forces, he warned that it might not be enough to
force Milosevic to relent.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the general said he could not guarantee that
NATO objectives would be met by the bombing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Clark did not propose using ground forces to drive Yugoslavia's
military and police units from Kosovo. The officials said there is
virtually no possibility that the alliance would approve a land
war, especially given Chancellor Schroeder's forceful remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's staff has also updated NATO's plans for the size of the
force that would be needed to repatriate refugees, to 48,000, from
28,000 estimated as the air war began.

 &HT;    Educators struggle with school safety options
 &HT;    By Joanne Huist Smith, Mark Fisher, Mara Lee and Margo Rutledge
Kissell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some Beavercreek parents want National Guardsmen
stationed in Ankeney Junior High, where a homemade bottle bomb blew
up in a cafeteria trash can Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents criticize any effort to bring in police or
security. They feel it stifles students' opportunity to express
themselves and act like kids, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With yet another school shooting Thursday _ this time in a
suburban Atlanta high school _ principals around the Miami Valley
dealt with an onslaught of parent calls and student fears. As the
clock ticks down to summer break, educators say they wrestle with
choices that limits student freedom to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job comes with a tremendous responsibility to protect
children,'' Jack Poore, principal of Springboro High School, said.
``Everybody wants tough discipline for everyone except their own
child.''
</P>
<P>
   In the month since two disgruntled Columbine, Colo., students
massacred 12 classmates and a teacher, then killed themselves,
Miami Valley schools have been plagued by bomb threats, rumors of
violence and threats against students. Rumors of pending violence
led officials in the Trotwood-Madison school district to call a
town meeting. In Xenia, four high school students were arrested
April 29 in connection with threats made to others. In Dayton, bomb
threats were made at Patterson Career Center and Colonel White High
School for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   David Elliott, principal at Ankeney Junior High, said school
administrators in the area are ``stuck in between that proverbial
rock and a hard place'' on how far to go to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly difficult to try to strike the balance between
students' rights and doing everything in your power to ensure their
safety,'' Elliott said Thursday. ``At this point, we are trying to
err on the side of caution and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavercreek City School District recently put security
guards at Ankeney and Ferguson junior high schools and Beavercreek
High School.
</P>
<P>
   June Arnett, assistant director of the National School Safety
Center in Westlake Village, Calif., said when the school climate is
hot, freedom should take a backseat to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kind of climate we have in schools right now,
whatever freedoms we have to remove from our children are
justified,'' Arnett said.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the school year near, Arnett hopes local school
boards will spend the summer re-evaluating school safety policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``School violence isn't a national issue; it's a local issue,''
Arnett said. ``School boards and the communities they serve have to
decide how much they want to spend to prevent violence and what
freedoms they want to take away from kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning our schools into armed camps with security guards and
metal detectors won't solve the problem, said Raymond Vasvari,
legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio. In
the month since the Columbine shootings, students and their
families have filed 40 complaints with the ACLU, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are being singled out because they look different or
because they wear black or because they like funky music,'' Vasvari
said. ``I worry that our schools are sowing seeds of suspicion,
intolerance and mistrust. That's a misguided reaction and may be
laying the seeds for the next disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools would be better served, Vasvari said, by learning to
identify children with potential problems _ kids who've talked
about suicide or whose grades have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide these children with intervention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Ochsenbein, educational consultant for Huber Heights-based
Risk Management Professionals, gives seminars on preventing school
and workplace violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said schools can go too far by reacting too much _ for
example, by closing school based on unsubstantiated rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go so far as to create your own sense of paranoia,''
said Ochsenbein, a former school counselor in the Mad River School
District.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton City Schools are not planning restrictions or security
measures beyond those that have been in place all year, but they
are seeking to head off any budding confrontations among students,
school officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton schools have several initiatives, including peer
mediation and conflict resolution programs, designed to prevent
escalation of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene Wallace, the Dayton school district's assistant
superintendent for secondary schools, said she has asked Dayton's
secondary school principals to identify students who are constantly
picked on and talk to them, as well as to those students who might
be participating in the verbal abuse, to try to head off potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're instructing our staff to be vigilant and to make
themselves aware of and follow the procedures we have in place,''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DePalma, superintendent at Centerville schools, also
emphasized cutting down on taunts at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offers our best chance at preventing violence,'' he said.
``Teasing, whether `I'm gonna kill you' type stuff to calling
people `fat' or `fags' _ It's all serious in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the shootings last year, if an elementary school student
shoved another student, they would get a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we're sending them home'' DePalma said. ``Most
cases, it's just for the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Northmont schools already a rule that says students can't
intimidate, verbally abuse, sexually harass or make obscene
gestures to anyone else in the school. Next year, the school will
create a `menacing' category, which will have a more severe
punishment, Gale Mabry, superintendent of Northmont schools said.

 &HT;    Georgia leaders still stumped for solutions to violence
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia leaders were already groping for answers. The
shooting Thursday at Heritage High School brought a new urgency,
but still no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shows how much work it's going to take when one of
the best high schools we have in Georgia is unable to use
preventive measures to stop something like this from happening,''
said Brian Kintisch, director of the Macon-based Center for
Children and Education, which unsuccessfully fought parts of the
state's new school discipline law that his group considered too
punitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be taken for granted any longer,'' said Essie
Stewart Johnson, president of the Georgia Association of Educators,
the state's strongest teachers union. Johnson said everybody, but
especially the citizens of Rockdale County, realizes that security
guards, metal detectors and surveillance cameras can never stop
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, politicians jumped on the suburban Atlanta
shooting in the debate over a gun control amendment that passed in
the Senate on Thursday. Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) said he plans
to introduce House legislation within the next couple of weeks for
a staff position in schools that would handle discipline cases and
work with authorities. Each of the nation's 87,000 public schools
could apply for the federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one thing every school doesn't have, and one thing
that will help address a major problem in the country,'' said
Isakson, former chairman of the Georgia state school board. ``The
tragedies are becoming far too frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes declined comment but cleared his appointments
for the day and visited the most seriously wounded girl, who was in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   State school Superintendent Linda Schrenko, who also declined
comment, did not change her appointments, speaking in schools in
Union County all day. But she had spelled out proposals on the
Department of Education Web site, http: //www.doe.k12.ga.us. Among
them: metal detectors in every school and safety funding through a
tax on violent electronic entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Others called for more attention to students' needs. ``I hate to
say this, but I think for the most part schools are safe, and
there's nothing that we can do that would absolutely prevent what
happened,'' said Cathy Henson, retiring president of the Georgia
PTA and soon-to-be member of the state school board. ``It's really
hard to say what the problem is, other than angry and frustrated
kids with problems, and access to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Smith Pass, who co-chaired a safety and violence task force
that Schrenko initiated in 1997, said balance is needed between
reactive measures, such as more security, and pro-active measures,
such as teaching conflict resolution. ``Hopefully, we will work
ourselves out of the metal detector business,'' she said. ``The
Legislature, the governor, the superintendent of education, and
more importantly, every citizen in the state has to get together
and decide how we get there.''

 &HT;    Conyers residents only hope for answer
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Not since a tornado spun through Conyers in 1973,
killing two and injuring 300, have Rockdale County residents been
forced to recover together from a crisis like Thursday's Heritage
High School shooting. Just hours after the shooting, they came to
the frightening conclusion that, like the twister, this, too, was
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens in suburbs, not the big city,'' Louise Colquitt,
70, said as she ate fried chicken and okra at the VFW.
</P>
<P>
   Her identical twin, Cille Roberts, quickly added, ``I think it
could happen anywhere with the mentality today.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the twins and other Rockdale residents jaded by two
years of reports from suburban schools in places like Littleton,
Colo., and Pearl, Miss., still struggled to process the day's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never think it's going to happen where you live,''
said Susan McIntosh, who manages the VFW restaurant, where the
all-you-can-eat country buffet is a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   A small, rural bedroom community in the shadows of Atlanta, 25
miles away, Rockdale is nonetheless used to the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers' Georgia International Horse Park hosted equestrian and
mountain biking during the 1996 Olympics. Nancy Fowler has drawn as
many as 100,000 from Mexico, Argentina and beyond to her White Road
farm north of Interstate 20 when she relays visions she says are
from the Virgin Mary. And the Monastery of the Holy Ghost, about
five miles by car from Heritage High School, sells its fresh-baked
bread to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday brought a new fame. County and city workers answered
calls from news agencies all over the country and from as far away
as Tokyo. The Heritage shooting stung the community's pride and joy
_ its school system, which is considered among the best in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all the variables here, you ask that
question, `How could this happen?''', said Conyers Mayor Randy
Mills, placing his blame on loosening societal values. ``This is
bigger than what you see here. How can you get your arms around
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale Commission Chairman Norman Wheeler expressed similar
feelings: ``When you realize it did happen, it puts you to the
point of almost feeling helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most suburban counties, Rockdale has growing pains.
Developers are building houses faster than commissioners can talk
the federal government into letting them build roads. Longtime
residents think about moving away, frustrated by traffic, dense new
subdivisions and tacky commercial corridors. The dream of bringing
upscale office developments to the county has been stalled by two
years of controversy over its troubled water and sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockdale is also the kind of place where the South Rockdale
Civic Association eats a potluck supper before its monthly
meetings. It's the kind of place that values parkland and green
spaces. In many parts of Rockdale, neighbors are barely within
shouting distance.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockdale, ideas of God and country are still sacred, and a
.22-caliber rifle is a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had them when we were younger,'' Colquitt said at
the VFW. At a nearby table, 68-year-old Jean Clay echoed a
sentiment heard often in Rockdale: ``Put the name of the Lord back
in the school, put discipline back and give the teachers the
control of the classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   For twins Cille Roberts and Louise Colquitt, the answer isn't so
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Colquitt said as she stared at a wall and
chewed fried okra. ``Is there a solution?

6 STOCK BROKERS PLEAD GUILTY TO ILLEGAL TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six stock traders, including four who worked on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, pleaded guilty Thursday to
felony charges of illegal stock trading in a case that has raised
questions about the integrity of trading on the nation's biggest
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators and federal prosecutors are continuing to
investigate the extent of illegal trading by brokers who work on
the floor of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability of the authorities to bring more charges, either
for criminal wrongdoing or for civil violations of securities laws
or stock exchange rules, appears to have been weakened by the
government's inability in the current case to sort out the specific
illegal acts and the amount of ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   William Killeen and Thomas Bock, the co-owners of Oakford Corp.,
a trading firm, now defunct, each pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to engage in unauthorized trading. In U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, Killeen and Bock acknowledged that they set up
accounts for use by the four New York Stock Exchange floor traders,
allowed the traders to enter orders at their discretion and then
split with the traders the profits from the activity. Oakford also
pleaded guilty to the same charge.
</P>
<P>
   That type of trading violates federal law and New York Stock
Exchange rules, which generally prohibit brokers on the floor of
the exchange, who are in a position to see large, potentially
market-moving orders being placed, from trading for their own
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Killeen and Bock also pleaded guilty to one count each of tax
evasion, based on separate charges that they used corporate money
to pay personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The four exchange traders _ Thomas Cavallino, Edward Mueger and
two brothers, John Savarese and Mark Savarese _ also pleaded guilty
to one count each of conspiracy to engage in illegal trading.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements by the defendants to plead guilty substantially
reduced the charges originally brought in February 1998 by the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan. Prosecutors had also charged each trader
with illegally profiting from their activity.
</P>
<P>
   That charge was dropped from the plea bargain, however, and
prosecutors surprised even the judge overseeing the case when they
said that they could not determine the amount of profits generated
by the trading _ or even which particular trades were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   When they announced the case, prosecutors said the ring of rogue
brokers made more than $11 million in illegal trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and securities regulators have since contended that
as many as 64 brokers working on the exchange floor have engaged in
similar trading activities. But the ability of the authorities to
bring criminal charges against other defendants might be hampered
by the government's inability to say which specific trades violated
the rules against discretionary transactions and how much in
illegal profits those trades produced.
</P>
<P>
   Federal sentencing guidelines for the charges to which the two
Oakford officials pleaded guilty put their potential sentences at
15 to 20 months in prison plus probation and a fine. The four floor
brokers face zero to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jed Rakoff, responding with surprise to the prosecutors'
contention that they could not quantify the illegal gains from the
trading scheme, said again Thursday that he might conduct his own
hearing to determine the profits. The results of that hearing might
give the judge cause to set stiffer sentences. A sentencing hearing
is scheduled for Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Five other floor brokers and one clerk previously pleaded guilty
to similar charges, and one has already been sentenced to 15 months
in prison. On Wednesday, prosecutors agreed to drop charges against
another broker, John D'Alessio, who was also a floor official at
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Stock Exchange spokesman said Thursday that the
exchange's suspension of D'Alessio, which went into effect when the
indictment was announced, was not affected by the pending
withdrawal of the charges.

PARTICIPATORY MANAGEMENT HASN'T WORKED WELL IN THE REAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Participatory management. Self-managed teams. Employee
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Management theorists like to toss these terms around. But for
most average workers, they amount to oxymorons.
</P>
<P>
   Although participatory management has been a popular theme in
management books, seminars and directives for the past decade, it
hasn't worked very well in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that people can't agree on what
participatory management even means, said T.J. Elliott, research
director of Cavanaugh Leahy &AMP; Co., an organizational consulting
firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 400 books and articles have been written on
the topic in the past decade, it's still very much an enigma,
Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that participatory management, which has long had a
following in professional journals and academic circles, is growing
in the mainstream business press as well as in organizational
practices,'' he said. ``But our study also revealed deep
differences over the meaning of the term, scant guidance on how to
implement participatory management, striking ambivalence about its
efficacy and little appreciation of what it actually requires.''
</P>
<P>
   Participatory management means employees have the authority to
manage themselves and their workplaces, Elliott said. ``It's
clearly placing the role of decision-making in employee hands so
they can participate in their own management.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the work world, there is a lot of confusion over what
participatory management entails.
</P>
<P>
   Concepts vary from using work teams to mandating employee
involvement and to having employee suggestion programs, he said.
Some companies equate participatory management with issuing stock
options. Others identify ``total quality management'' efforts as
participatory management programs. Still others say it's as simple
as ``getting out and hobnobbing with employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies reflect the confusion. One study cited in Incentive
magazine said fewer than 10 percent of companies have ``true
participatory management.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, cited by the Journal of Commerce, said about 80 percent
of Fortune 500 companies have worker involvement programs.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is many programs appear to solicit participation,
but don't give employees real authority, he said. Employee
suggestion programs, for example, aren't really participatory since
management doesn't have to act on the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Such discrepancies were reflected in yet another study. A Wyatt
survey of 4,300 Americans reported that 61 percent of senior
managers thought they did a good job of involving employees in
decisions. Two-thirds of non-managerial workers in the same survey
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion of participatory management has a powerful
draw. Companies keep trying different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   It takes communication, resources, commitment and follow-through
to make participatory management work, Elliott said. The payoff
comes in a more energized work force, people who are more
productive, creative and engaged in their work.
</P>
<P>
   In true participatory management, employees have both the
authority to act on their decisions and the responsibility to
follow through on them.
</P>
<P>
   To make such programs effective, there has to be a mechanism for
accountability, he said. ``You have to be specific about who is
going to do what by when.''
</P>
<P>
   And for this system to work, resources have to be available so
employees can do what they've decided needs to be done. Asking for
input, then not acting on it, tends to breed cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Participatory management isn't suited to every company or every
situation, he said. ``If you're rowing the lifeboat away from the
Titanic, participatory management might not be the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And not every function in a company lends itself to
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have (employees) rendering decisions about things
that aren't negotiable,'' he said. Companies wouldn't use
participation, for example, to revise human resources policies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies benefit most from participation in areas where they
need diverse voices, such as developing new strategies, he said.
``When you get people involved, you tap into a much broader range
of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a downside to encouraging participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is employees may challenge (management's ideas,)'' he
said. ``They may come up with things that you're not comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, that's the whole point.

NEBRASKA IMPOSES 2-YEAR MORATORIUM ON EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Responding to concerns that the death penalty was
being applied unfairly, the Nebraska Legislature voted Thursday to
impose a two-year moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have considered such suspensions,
Nebraska's is the first legislature to approve one. The purpose of
the moratorium would be to allow time for a study on whether the
race or economic status of the defendant, or any other issue
unrelated to the crime, plays a role in death sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation faces the likelihood of a veto by Gov. Mike
Johanns, a first-term Republican who supports capital punishment
and has expressed opposition to the moratorium. Still, the governor
said Thursday that he would take a serious look at the measure,
which he has five days to sign or veto. After that, it becomes law
without his approval.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the one-house Legislature was 27-21, two more votes
in favor than were needed for passage but three fewer than would be
required to override Johanns' veto. And while the governor could
allow the bill to become law without his signature, he suggested
Thursday that he would not choose that path. ``I think I'm here to
make difficult decisions,'' The Associated Press quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   A co-author of the legislation, state Sen. Kermit Brashear, a
R-Omaha, said he did not oppose the death penalty but was
unconvinced that it was being applied fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love the law and you love justice, you must be
committed to fairness,'' Brashear said. ``And when I see 165
murderers in Nebraska prisons and only 10 are on death row, I want
to know: Why are some of these people treated differently?''
</P>
<P>
   Brashear said that while he did not believe that Nebraska itself
practiced racism in its use of capital punishment, ``there is
clearly a racial component and a socioeconomic component
nationwide'' in death sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Although they account for only 13 percent of the country's
population, blacks make up 42 percent of the 3,600 or so prisoners
on death rows. In Nebraska, three of the 10 death-row prisoners are
black or American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fate of the bill, opponents of the death penalty
said, the vote Thursday sends a heartening message.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty, based in Washington, said Nebraska, a
mostly conservative state, was not a place where such deep-seated
reservations about executions might have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in the public attitude on the death
penalty,'' Hawkins said. ``We're very encouraged by what we're
hearing in the heartland. It says something about where Middle
America stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and other foes of capital punishment attributed that
change to a variety of factors. One was Pope John Paul II's
strenuous opposition to executions. Another was the concern over
mistaken convictions that has been stoked by a series of cases in
Illinois. In the last 12 years, a dozen men on death row there have
been exonerated, one of whom, Anthony Porter, came within two days
of being put to death last fall.
</P>
<P>
   A bill has been introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature that
calls for a moratorium on executions. A bill passed recently in
Montana bans the execution of anyone who is a juvenile when
arrested for the capital offense. Texas, the leader in executions,
is considering a measure that would outlaw putting to death anyone
who is mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The action in state legislatures represents the reversal of a
trend seen three years ago, Hawkins said, when politicians were
looking for ways to give the death penalty broader reach.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the states assess the use of the death penalty, the
number of executions nationwide are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four inmates have been executed so far this year, Hawkins
said, predicting that perhaps 100 people will be put to death by
the end of 1999. That would be a record number of executions since
the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Nebraska has carried out three executions since
1976, the latest in December of 1997. One inmate on death row,
Randolph Reeves, was spared in January when the state Supreme Court
granted a stay of execution based on the promise of equal
protection under the law. A lawyer for Reeves, an Omaha Indian, had
argued that the death penalty discriminated against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty eight states have the death penalty, although some, like
New York, have not put any inmate to death in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   States without a death penalty are Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island,
Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

   PASTOR-MOOREHEAD (REDMOND, Wash.) _ New testimony gives strong
support to sexual misconduct allegations against the Rev. Bob
Moorehead, who resigned last year from Overlake Christian Church,
leaders of the Redmond, Wash., congregation said Thursday. Church
elders have heard from multiple witnesses to at least some of the
allegations leveled against Moorehead, according to a letter sent
to members of Washington's largest church. Last May, the elders
dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against Moorehead by 17
men because they said the incidents couldn't be substantiated by
eyewitnesses.

BLACKS SUE HOTEL, CHARGING BIAS AT COLLEGE REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Black plaintiffs filed a federal lawsuit
Thursday charging that the Adam's Mark Daytona Beach Resort, one of
the more luxurious hotels here, discriminated against
African-Americans who had gathered in April for the Black College
Reunion, an annual event that draws young black men and women from
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Orlando, asserts,
among other things, that the hotel overcharged the event's
participants for rooms, required full payment in advance by check
or money order, as well as demanding a $100 refundable damage
deposit, a $25 deposit to have room telephones turned on and a
deposit of $300 for access to minibars. None of these policies, the
lawyers contend, applied to whites who were staying at the hotel at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also asserts that Adam's Mark Daytona required blacks
who stayed at the hotel during the reunion to wear bright orange
wristbands to indicate that they were guests and to buy an
additional wristband, for $50, for anyone who wanted to visit them.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Fred Kummer, chief executive officer of
HBE Corp., owner of the Adam's Mark, said Thursday that it was
standard policy for hotel to require guests to wear wristbands
during special events ``to ensure that guests do not exceed the
maximum room occupancy at such events, thus violating fire codes
and impacting the quality of the stay for other hotel guests.''
Kummer said the hotel also asked guests for a $100 damage deposit
during other large Daytona Beach gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refundable deposit required at BCR was no different than
that which is usually requested for any hotel guests who do not
offer credit cards at registration for the coverage of incidental
expenses,'' Kummer said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the plaintiffs said, however, that they were required
to pay deposits even though they paid for their rooms with credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asserts that uniformed officers from the Daytona
Beach Police Department and the Volusia County Sheriff's Office
were out in force at the hotel to make sure blacks were wearing
their wristbands. Sherri Davis, a spokesman for the Daytona Beach
Police Department, said Thursday that she did not have records
immediately available on whether officers were on or off duty while
working at the hotel. The sheriff's office could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in county jail the whole weekend,'' said
Napoleon Berrian, 28, who drove from Atlanta with his brother and
two friends to stay at the Adam's Mark during the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Latoya Straughn, 25, of Ocala, Fla., said she had attended the
reunion with three female friends and that they opted to wear the
``cheap, plastic'' orange bands on their ankles, rather than on
their wrists, where they would clash with their clothes. As a
result, Ms. Straughn said, ``every five feet, and/or every 10
minutes,'' an officer would ask her for proof that she was
registered at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the plaintiffs said that during the weekend they
repeatedly noticed white guests not wearing wristbands and not
being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The Black College Reunion has provoked increasing debate in
Daytona Beach, a city of 62,000 residents that consists of an
overwhelmingly white beach community on a barrier island and a more
heavily black section on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1984 as a relatively small social weekend involving
students from two black schools, Florida A&AMP;M University in
Tallahassee and Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, the event
now attracts more than 100,000 people. Its size now puts it on par
with other social events in Daytona like Race Week, when stock car
fans gather for the Daytona 500, Bike Week, when thousands of
motorcycle enthusiasts flock here, and Spring Break, the
traditional six-week-long party that attracts hordes of exuberant
college students.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowds at Race Week, Bike Week and Spring Break are
overwhelmingly white, Black College Reunion is the only major
annual event in Daytona whose participants are almost all black.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives, city officials and some residents complain
of noise by participants and assert that the primary activity of
the weekend, cruising and socializing on Route A1A, the main road,
creates horrendous traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, local officials have felt that Spring
Break also was getting out of hand, said Larry Fornari, president
of the Hotel/Motel Association of Volusia County. Daytona Beach has
tried to discourage visits by rowdy college students by emphasizing
that laws will be strictly enforced, he said, and the city has
sponsored concerts and beach sports to relieve congestion on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Fornari said Daytona Beach had tried a similar approach with the
Black College Reunion, and failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cruise and see-and-be-seen event,'' he said. ``That's
what they want to do while they're here. I don't think they want to
be involved in other events, or history has shown that they don't
want to be in other events. And that poses a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble escalated last year when a male participant from
Orlando engaged in a gun battle with police, wounding four officers
before he was killed. Some city leaders, including Mayor Bud Asher,
said later that they wanted to get rid of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black College Reunion as presently constituted is neither a
desirable or an acceptable event for Daytona Beach,'' Asher said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the City Council passed a plan that would allow
police officers to halt all traffic heading over the six bridges
leading onto the commercial beach strip. Officers would allow only
residents, employees of city businesses and hotel guests to drive
across the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
sued the city, contending that the traffic plan violated the rights
of assembly of the black participants in the reunion weekend. In
April, Judge Patricia Fawsett of the U.S. District Court in Orlando
agreed and issued an injunction banning the city from instituting
its traffic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs contend that executives of the Adam's
Mark were among the most vociferous in demanding that the city halt
the Black College Reunion. After the judge threw out Daytona
Beach's traffic plan, the lawyers assert that hotel executives
decided to make the event so unpleasant to the participants that
they would not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adams Mark incident, the mistreatment of the BCR students
did not occur in a vacuum,'' said Bruce Gear, a lawyer with the
NAACP.

 Healtheon Confirms Deal _ Stock Jumps
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Healtheon Corp. shares soared another 25 percent yesterday after
the company confirmed it is merging with WebMD to create what could
become the Internet's leading provider of health care information
and services.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Healtheon will exchange 1.815 of its shares for
each of privately held WebMD's 54 million shares outstanding. That
would value WebMD at $9.9 billion, based on Healtheon's closing
price.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's stock soared $20.38 to $100.63 yesterday, giving it
a market value of $7.1 billion. The company's stock has surged 114
percent since rumors of the merger first surfaced a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new entity will have its corporate headquarters in Atlanta
and a ``technology headquarters'' in Santa Clara. It will be named
Healtheon/WebMD, but all its products will be called WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The deal attracted big investments from other industry players.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is paying $250 million for an 11 percent stake in the
new company. Additionally, Microsoft has committed $150 million to
help cover the $29.95 monthly fee for 11,000 physicians, allowing
them to subscribe free to the service, and another $100 million for
advertising and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Co., a large drugmaker, has committed $180 million to
underwrite physician subscription fees and $40 million in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Intel Corp., Excite Inc. and the Japanese
media company Softbank Corp., will invest an additional $110
million in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company will be run by WebMD's 29-year-old chief
executive, Jeff Arnold. Healtheon CEO Mike Long, 46, becomes
chairman and chief operating officer. Healtheon co-founder and
Chairman Jim Clark, 53, will be a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are betting that the new firm, by using the Internet,
will help streamline the inefficient but lucrative health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care information management is in the dark ages, so
it's ripe for the sort of automation the Internet can bring to
it,'' said David Simons, managing director of Digital Video
Investments, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real stumbling block is you have this myriad, incredibly
disparate, endless array of legacy systems, none of which were ever
designed to talk to each other,'' Simons said. ``Getting that to
work together is the real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet won't necessarily fix the problem, he said. Taming
health care ``has been one of the Holy Grails of the Information
Age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal draws much of its cachet from the involvement of Clark,
who has struck it rich for the third time. Clark also helped found
Silicon Graphics and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's 11.7 million Healtheon shares were worth $1.17 billion
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings the business-to-business goals of Healtheon
together with WebMD's consumer-oriented services, said David
Restrepo, the health analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon has used the Internet to connect physicians,
hospitals, insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD _ which was founded in 1996 as a cardiac monitoring
company, but sold that business last year to reinvent itself as an
Internet firm _ initially provided online information to doctors
but more recently acquired two companies that serve health care
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD is likely to acquire more companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to get an online vitamin vendor or drugstore or
develop it themselves,'' Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these two money-losing companies can merge themselves
into profitability is by no means certain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It remains to be seen whether they can pull off this very
ambitious project,'' Restrepo said.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Against the grim backdrop of yet another
school shooting, this one in Georgia, President Clinton told this
grief-racked but determined Rocky Mountain town Thursday that the
massacre here had ``pierced the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that was partly because of the number of dead, 15,
and partly because suburban Littleton is like so many other places
in America.
</P>

   Because the Littleton shootings had caught the attention of the
whole world, the president said, the community now had a chance to
teach everyone about overcoming hatreds, distrust and the urge for
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your tragedy, though it is unique in its magnitude, is, as you
so well know, not an isolated event,'' Clinton told an audience of
nearly 2,000 people, mostly students, packed into a high school
gymnasium about a 15-minute drive from Columbine High School, where
the shootings took place a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know somehow that what happened to you has pierced the soul
of America,'' he said, ``and it gives you a chance to be heard in a
way no one else can be heard, by the president and by ordinary
people in every community in this country. You can help us to build
a better future for all our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also made a pointed reference to the arsenal
amassed by the two killers, saying that access to such weapons
``can break the dam of decency and humanity in the most vulnerable
children.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the program, at which Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the first lady, also spoke, the audience responded with
cheers and foot-stomping, giving the event the incongruous feel of
a pep rally. The Clintons seemed surprised by the reaction, but
they quickly interpreted the cheers as a determination of spirit,
which they both lauded.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady spoke after meeting privately for
90 minutes with the families of all but one of the 13 victims in
the April 20 rampage. The parents of John Tomlin did not attend.
Not included were the families of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
the two boys who killed their classmates and a teacher, and then
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shoels, whose son Isaiah, 18, was one of those killed,
said afterward that he had given the president a two-page letter
that Clinton promised he would read. Shoels said: ``Such a tragedy
as this, we should use it as a tool to make change. I cry before I
go to sleep, and in the morning I still feel the tears. But I have
to stay strong as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In the role of national healer, which Clinton said he had
assumed all too often in his six years as president, he also
extended some compassion to the killers, saying that their struggle
with demons is a universal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dark forces that take over people and make them murder
are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage with which every
human has to do combat,'' he said. ``The older you get, the more
you'll know that a great deal of life is the struggle against every
person's own smallness and fear and anger and a continuing effort
not to blame other people for our own shortcomings or our fears.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Clinton placed phone calls to five of the
students who are still hospitalized with injuries from the
shootings. In a surprise for the audience here, two of those
students _ Sean Graves and Patrick Ireland _ attended the
president's speech, whisked to the school by ambulance. Their
introduction from the stage brought a thunderous and emotional show
of support. Patrick was the student who had been captured on film
crashing through a window in the school to escape the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the periodic cheers, Mrs. Clinton, who spoke
before her husband, told the audience, ``We have suffered and wept
and prayed and hoped and, yes, cheered, as lives have been mourned,
as those who are injured have healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Columbine seniors would be graduating on
Saturday, Clinton said he knew the commencement would be
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even your archrivals at Chatfield will be cheering you on,''
he told them. ``When you hear those people cheer for you, I want
you to hear the voice of America, because America will be cheering
you on. And remember that a commencement is not an end, it is a
beginning.''

 Jury Gets Purloined DNA Case   By Tom Abate 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Which scientist lied?
</P>
<P>
   That's what a federal jury in San Francisco must decide after
hearing closing arguments yesterday in an extraordinary patent
infringement case that pits the University of California against
Genentech Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The case has rocked the biotech world because the two scientists
who led Genentech's human growth hormone project in 1979 _ Peter
Seeburg and David Goeddel _ took opposite sides in the case and
essentially called each other liars on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the six-week trial, UC attorney Gerald Dodson tried
to persuade jurors that, 20 years ago, Seeburg and Goeddel made a
secret pact to use a patented DNA sample _ which Seeburg filched
from a UC lab _ to create Genentech's lucrative growth hormone
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech has never paid UC a dime for the commercial use of
this invention,'' Dodson said.
</P>
<P>
   UC hasn't filed a damage claim yet, but Dodson has said his
client could seek royalties and punitive damages up to $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides predicted victory. Genentech has said it would
exercise its right to appeal any negative verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech attorney John Kidd told jurors his client doesn't owe
the university any money because it hadn't used UC's DNA or
infringed on UC's patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pioneered the work, we created the industry, we made a
medicine for people, not the university,'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides devoted much of yesterday's closing arguments to
painting different pictures of Seeburg, who took the stand for UC,
and Goeddel, who testified for Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel maintained that his former colleague Seeburg invented
the story that they had conspired to fake their experiments at
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg emerged as the most complicated character in this
courtroom drama.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born scientist, now 53, came to the United States in
the late 1970s to do research at the University of California at
San Francisco. In spring 1978, Seeburg was one of three UC
scientists who identified the DNA for human growth hormone. Dodson
called it a breakthrough invention for which UC immediately filed a
patent, naming Seeburg and several colleagues as co-inventors.
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1978, after a falling out with his UCSF boss,
Seeburg quit the university to join Genentech's crash program to
create a growth hormone drug. Seeburg testified that just before
midnight on Dec. 31, 1978, he snuck back into his old UCSF lab,
took a sample of the DNA that UC was trying to patent, and stashed
it in a refrigerator at Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Despite UC demands that the DNA be returned, Seeburg testified
it remained in refrigeration until early May 1979. During that
spring, Goeddel had joined Genentech's project to help cultivate
its own batch of growth hormone DNA that owed nothing to the UC
sample.
</P>
<P>
   But Seeburg testified that in early May, he and Goeddel
concluded the Genentech effort had failed. He testified that he and
Goeddel decided to use the UC sample in their experiment and to
keep this a secret _ faking the data they reported in a 1979
scientific paper which they published in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seeburg was admitting his part in scientific fraud,
Dodson painted the German scientist's confession in the best light.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has a scientific reputation,'' Dodson said of
Seeburg, whose work until now has made him highly regarded. ``He
has put that on the line to come here and tell the truth ... about
the agreement with Dr. Goeddel that he can no longer keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's lawyers attacked Seeburg's credibility, using his
own testimony about marital and drug problems during this period in
1979 and noting that by his own admission he worked only an hour or
two a day some days. Kidd said Goeddel joined the project after
Seeburg ``failed to perform'' and suggested that Seeburg grew
resentful when Goeddel, five years Seeburg's junior, was glorified
as principal inventor of Genentech's growth hormone drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he (Seeburg) is finally getting even with the person who
stole his dream and got the credit he wanted,'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech lawyers also reminded the jury that Seeburg, one of
the named inventors on the UC patent, stands to win perhaps 10
percent of any money that the jury might award UC. That would work
out to $120 million if UC got all the punitive damages it has
requested.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tearing down Seeburg's testimony, Genentech
sought to build up Goeddel, who founded his own biotech firm,
Tularik Inc., after leaving Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Much of yesterday's arguments revolved around the contents of a
black lab notebook in which Goeddel kept track of the
Genentech-sponsored growth hormone experiment. That notebook is
essential for Genentech to prove that its growth hormone differs in
important ways from UC's variety.
</P>
<P>
   UC's outside experts testified that in the May period _ when
Seeburg says he and Goeddel secretly used UC's DNA _ the two
Genentech scientists didn't have enough time to perform the
experiment Goeddel described.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech attorneys countered with testimony from Goeddel's
former lab assistant, Elizabeth McLeod Yelverton, now a genetics
professor at the University of Southern Alabama, corroborating
Goeddel's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge Charles Legge gave the nine jurors the weekend off
before ordering them to reconvene Monday morning to begin
deliberations. A verdict is expected next week.

WHITMAN BACKS BILL THAT RESTRICTS ABORTION RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ For the first time in her political career, Gov.
Christie Whitman said Thursday that she would support legislation
restricting some abortion rights, endorsing an Assembly bill that
would require parental notification before a teen-age girl can get
an abortion in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which was approved Thursday afternoon by the
Assembly Judiciary Committee in a 5-2 vote, still faces a vote in
the full Assembly _ where the speaker, Jack Collins, said there was
broad support _ and in the Senate, which could make changes to it.
But with the backing of Whitman, the legislation is expected to
become law soon.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, a moderate Republican who has been one of the most
outspoken supporters of abortion rights in her party, had
previously opposed parental notification. But, facing a race next
year for the U.S. Senate and not wishing to alienate conservatives,
she yielded on the issue after persuading the sponsors of the bill
to soften some of the language in their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill released from the Assembly Judiciary Committee today
appears to strike an appropriate balance between the legitimate
needs of a young woman and the rightful interests of her parents,''
Whitman said in a statement that her office issued within an hour
of the committee's vote. ``It is a vastly improved measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes she made was a broadening of the circumstances
under which a judge could grant a waiver of the rule; for instance,
allowing a teen-ager to get an abortion if she seemed mature enough
to make that decision herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its current form, it appears to provide a common-sense
solution to the problem of respecting parental rights and
preserving personal choices,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as opponents of abortion cheered Whitman's position on the
issue, a group of moderate Republicans who support abortion rights
praised the governor and tried to make sure that she was protected
from criticism from the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not represent a change in Whitman's strong support
of abortion rights,'' Lynn Grefe, national director of the
Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, said in a statement that Whitman's
office circulated to reporters along with the governor's statement.
``This bill would pass with or without her signature, and therefore
she used her considerable knowledge and understanding to insure
that no teen will be harmed. Once again, the pro-choice community
applauds her political acumen and work on behalf of women.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has long been considered a bulwark when it comes to
abortion rights, and any movement in that position, no matter how
slight, is sure to attract national attention in the abortion
debate. Supporters of measure said that they had already been
contacted by abortion opponents in other states, including New
York, to share information on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The major roadblock to parental notification may be the New
Jersey courts, which have traditionally been unwavering in support
of abortion rights and have struck down previous efforts that they
found infringed on minors' rights to have access to abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation, which included representatives of
the New Jersey Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties
Union, testified Thursday that they considered the measure
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they said, it would violate the equal protection
guarantees of the federal and state constitutions since the state
does not require parental notification for a pregnant minor to
receive medical treatment and care when she carries a baby for a
full term.
</P>
<P>
   The notification bill, which was sponsored by Assemblyman John
Rooney and Assemblywoman Marion Crecco, both Republicans, would
require doctors to notify a parent or guardian before performing or
inducing an abortion on an unmarried girl under 18. Doctors would
be required to notify the parent either personally or by certified
mail, and an abortion could not be performed until at least 48
hours after the parent was notified.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to meet constitutional concerns and to make the
legislation politically palatable to the governor, the sponsors
amended their bill before the Judiciary Committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Language in the original proposal had mentioned only biological
or adoptive parents, but Whitman insisted that it be expanded to
include any adult who assumed the parental role, like an aunt or
uncle, a grandparent or an older sibling.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was also amended to broaden the exceptions to parental
notification. In its original form, a girl could petition a
Superior Court judge for a waiver if she could demonstrate that she
was a victim of abuse, cruelty or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   It was changed, again at the Whitman administration's
insistence, to read that a waiver could be granted if the judge
found convincing evidence that the girl was ``sufficiently mature''
to decide whether to have an abortion; that there was a pattern of
physical, sexual or emotional abuse of the girl by the parent or
guardian; and if for any other reason the notification of the
parent was ``not in the best interests of the minor.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to avoid a constitutional challenge, sponsors at the last
minute added a clause that would allow doctors to perform an
abortion on a minor without parental notification if the doctor
could certify that the abortion was necessary because of a medical
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   A medical emergency is defined as a condition in which an
immediate abortion is required because of risk of death or risk of
substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though Thursday's vote did not go to the heart of the
abortion debate _ whether a minor can or cannot have an abortion in
New Jersey _ it was a significant gain for anti-abortion forces,
who have tried unsuccessfully since 1989 to get a parental
notification bill through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have consistently shown that most New Jersey residents
back the right of a woman to have a legal abortion. But a
Quinnipiac College poll taken in March 1998 showed that residents
also favored some limits. By a 71 percent to 24 percent margin, the
poll showed that New Jersey residents supported a requirement that
parental consent be given before a girl under 18 years of age could
have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In lobbying legislators and in their testimony before the
Judiciary Committee Thursday, proponents of the notification bill
cited those poll results and a recent study by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute that showed New Jersey had the highest rate of teen-age
pregnancies in the nation and the highest rate of abortion among
teen-agers _ 58 percent of all adolescent pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly could vote on the legislation as early as Monday,
and supporters said their goal was to get the bill through the
Senate and on to the governor.

2 HEALTH-RELATED INTERNET FIRMS TO COMBINE IN $7.85 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Healtheon Corp., a rapidly growing Silicon Valley start-up with
big ideas for changing the health care system, said Thursday that
it would buy WebMD Inc., a seven-month-old Internet company, in a
stock deal valued at $7.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon is also allying itself with some of technology's
best-known names, selling $250 million of its high-flying stock to
Microsoft Corp. and $110 million to other backers, including Intel
Corp. and Excite Inc., the Internet portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which will have a stake of more than 10 percent in
the combined company, Healtheon/WebMD, also pledged $100 million in
advertising, which would be added to $40 million already committed
for advertising by DuPont Co. It is Microsoft's first big foray
into Internet health care.
</P>
<P>
   The new company said it would also have promotional and other
tie-ins with an array of media companies including CNN, MSNBC and
the Westwood One radio chain and Internet companies like MSN and
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon, which went public at $8 a share in February, reached
a high of $114 Thursday before closing at $100.625, up $20.375.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to buying other companies, ``their stock is free
money,'' said Linda Killian, a portfolio manager with the
Renaissance IPO Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have relatively few customers, and no profits, a
common Internet predicament, Healtheon and WebMD have sweeping
aspirations. Healtheon, which has been growing through
acquisitions, offers electronic processing of health care claims
and online registration for health plans, It also links doctors
over the Internet with hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, a privately held company based in Atlanta, specializes in
Internet support groups in which consumers can learn about
health-care subjects like nutrition and cancer, as well as
physicians' services.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the companies hope to sell electronic products to
hundreds of thousands of doctors whom they covet as gatekeepers to
$800 million in annual health care spending. The doctors could also
become a lucrative audience for drug company advertising and other
medical marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal would be to link all types of customers and
providers of health care, using the Internet as an end run around
the many obstacles to communication between thousands of computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring the advantages of the Internet to health
care, an industry that has been slow to adopt new technology,''
said James Clark, the co-founder of Netscape who also co-founded
Healtheon in 1996 in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But for just that reason, some analysts questioned whether
Healtheon and WebMD could ever herd thousands of notoriously
independent-minded doctors into its system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is such a cottage industry and it is so hard to
link all the doctors,'' said James Hudak, a managing partner of
Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is fundamentally different than securities trading or
auctioning on the Internet, like Ebay,'' he added. ``Health is not
a commodity.'' As for quality and accuracy, he said, ``you have to
know, Is the information you are getting correct or is it coming
from some cyberquack?''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy of medical records of patients is another sensitive
issue. WebMD chief executive Jeffrey Arnold said that personal
information about consumers would not be sold without their
consent. The WebMD Web site says that data about consumers will be
sold only in broad aggregate form, for example as percentages.
Healtheon chief executive W. Michael Long said the company ruled
out selling personal data to pharmaceutical companies or anybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   As for protecting the data, from unauthorized intruders, Long
said that ``security of the data has been a prime focus of our
engineering over the last three years,'' from encryption into
secure codes to storage on data bases. ``We have been a market
leader in demonstrating that the Internet can be as secure an
environment as any,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold of WebMD declined to disclose his company's finances. He
changed the subject to $500 million in commitments, including an
additional $150 million from Microsoft, which he said had been
promised by companies that would subsidize doctors who would be
recruited to use the company's Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   That $150 million would provide free introductory access to
180,000 doctors for five years. There are 5,000 doctors now using
the system and 49,000 more whose fees have already been paid by
sponsoring organizations like health systems.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD hopes to have positive cash flow by the end of
next year. But before it can make a profit, it faces several years
of charging off good will that it acquired in its chain of mergers
and acquisitions. Healtheon and Mede America, another merger in
process, have combined annual cash flow of about $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon processes electronic claims for United Healthcare
Corp., which has an 11 percent ownership stake in Healtheon through
a business developed by United and later acquired by Healtheon.
Cigna Corp. also buys claims processing services.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon also provides online enrollment services for a few
thousand members of health plans served by Blue Shield of
California. And Healtheon processes lab test orders for SmithKline
Beecham Clinical laboratories, which is being purchased by Quest
Diagnostics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In the merger, 1.815 Healtheon shares will be exchanged for each
WebMD share, so that existing shareholders of each company will
have about 50 percent of the new company.  &QL;

   HURST, Texas _ Michelle Werthen knows the fate of the 16th
Annual Lake Worth (Texas) Bullfrog Festival is on her shoulders _
or at least her patio.
</P>
<P>
   Seven sage green bullfrogs arrived at her apartment on Thursday
from New York, and they are the stars of the festival in the Fort
Worth suburb, which began Wednesday and runs through Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just can't escape,'' Werthen said as the $125 bullfrogs
lounged lazily in a net-covered fish pond on her apartment patio in
Hurst, just outside Fort Worth. ``When they came out of their box,
they stretched and yawned.''
</P>
<P>
   The frog-finding frenzy reached fever pitch after a newspaper
article described the local chamber of commerce's desperate search
for bullfrogs. Executive Director Judy Haas was led to Ward's
Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, N.Y., which shipped the
frogs by Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Werthen's guests, renowned for their jumping prowess, arrived
about noon in a wax-covered box cushioned in moss. Werthen said
that when the delivery driver saw the ``live frogs'' label, he
figured she had ordered a meal for a pet boa constrictor.
</P>
<P>
   The seven frogs appeared fine in a prefabricated fish pond with
heavy netting securely clamped on it to keep the frogs from leaping
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were happy to get out of their cramped
quarters,'' Werthen said.
</P>
<P>
   She has plenty of crickets to feed them before their race at 2
p.m. Saturday. FrifArM

COTY IS IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE DEBT-RIDDEN REVLON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DANA CANEDY and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coty Inc., a leading seller of fragrances and cosmetics, is in
talks to acquire part or all of Revlon Inc., the debt-ridden
cosmetics company controlled by billionaire Ronald Perelman,
executives close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are preliminary and could fall apart over price or
other terms. Another suitor might also step forward with an
attractive offer.
</P>
<P>
   A combination with Coty would enable Perelman to rid himself of
an investment that has proved disappointing and give Coty a
dominant position in the United States and a stronger brand to
market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is completed, Revlon would become part of Benckiser
NV, the Dutch consumer products company, which has been on an
acquisition binge and picked up Coty in 1992. Revlon's sales last
year were $2.2 billion. Coty had sales of $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to confirm they were in negotiations,
and a spokesman for Perelman's holding company, MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes, said he had no comment. But Revlon's stock has risen more
than 22 percent this week on speculation that a deal was imminent.
Shares of Revlon gained 75 cents Thursday, to $29.25.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was so heavy on Tuesday, in fact, that the New York
Stock Exchange requested the company issue a statement explaining
the ``unusual market activity.'' The volume was twice the daily
average for the last three months. Revlon stated then that it was
not its policy to comment on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Still analysts and industry experts said that the two companies
would be a good fit. Revlon products, including the Revlon, Almay
and Ultima II makeup brands, are sold in the same aisles as Coty's
Jovan Musk, Lady Stetson and Sand and Sable fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   Coty has long sought this kind of stellar cosmetics brand to
complement its fragrance business in the United States. Revlon, for
its part, has been struggling to increase its international
presence, just as Estee Lauder has succeeded in doing.
</P>
<P>
   A deal could not come soon enough for Revlon. In addition to
declining orders from retailers here, the company has suffered from
weakened consumer purchasing power abroad. At the same time, it
faces stiffer competition from Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which is
taking on the Almay line with the U.S. introduction this year of
Oil of Olay cosmetics. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, too, recently added
makeup to its Neutrogena skin-care line.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory crunch at Revlon and problems abroad have led to a
string of disappointing financial results and a sagging stock
price, which sank to $12 last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's dismal performance prompted Perelman to announce in
April that he would consider selling what has been the jewel of his
portfolio. At the time, Revlon said it had retained Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. and Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. to review the company's options.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Coty, other names that have been circulating as
potential bidders are Unilever NV, the Dutch consumer goods company
that makes Elizabeth Arden cosmetics; the Shiseido Co., a Japanese
cosmetics company, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, which makes Cover Girl
cosmetics. Procter &AMP; Gamble is the most unlikely buyer for the
entire company, however, because it would almost certainly face
antitrust problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me one of the last great, well-known brand names
to be up for sale,'' William Steele, managing director of Banc of
America Securities, said. ``There is a scarcity value involved
there, so I would expect a number of companies to look at this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that Revlon could fetch between $35 and $50 a
share. That amount would be in the range of prices for other
consumer companies, which tend to sell for 1 1/2 to two times
revenue. And while the Revlon name is certainly worth a premium,
they say, the company has lost some of its negotiating power
because of its recent poor performance, heavy debt level of $1.7
billion and Perelman's apparent eagerness to sell.
</P>
<P>
   If the price does not become a sticking point, purchasing Revlon
would certainly fit into Coty's growth strategy. The company
acquired 14 businesses between 1990 and 1996 and says it wants to
become the premier global fragrance and cosmetics business. In a
business outline, Coty said it wanted to ``gain a seat at the table
with L'Oreal, Avon and Estee Lauder.''
</P>
<P>
   Coty has a strong perfume and makeup business worldwide. It
recently expanded into Brazil, Hungary, Colombia, Ukraine and
Turkey. And it plans to push into developing countries in regions
including Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. In the United
States the company is strong in mass retail perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big hole is in the U.S. mass makeup business,'' Allan G.
Mottus, publisher of the Informationist, a trade publication, said.
``They have nothing. That would give them a marriage of two
distinct groups, being fragrance and makeup, one that I think could
be a very powerful entity.''

GIANTS' BURKS POSITIONED FOR SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ellis Burks was a free agent with two bad
knees. That can be a deadly blow to a baseball player's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents with physical problems usually have a hard time
getting a job in the off-season. Most of the time they end up
facing two dreary options: a one-year contract laden with
incentives but with a low salary, or a minor-league contract with
an invitation to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Burks was spared such fates this past off-season. The San
Francisco Giants wanted him back, bad knees and all. Just a few
days after declaring for free agency, Burks reached an agreement
with the Giants on a two-year, $10 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the guys we wanted to keep,'' Giants manager
Dusty Baker said. ``We didn't want him to get out there and be
entertained by other clubs or be flirting with anybody. He's not
only a big part of the spirit of the team, but he's also one of our
big-ability guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Burks, ``They offered me a two-year deal even though they
knew I was going to have knee surgery. They had a lot of faith in
me and showed a lot of confidence in my ability. So I said, I'm
staying, no questions asked.'',There was one stipulation: a
position change. Burks once refused to move from center to right
field while with the Boston Red Sox, believing it was a demotion.
Now he was insisting upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the body,'' said Burks, who won a Gold Glove as a
center fielder in 1990. ``You don't have to run as much. You don't
have to back up everywhere like you do in center. Right field is
less stress and strain on the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks is 34, and the position change is his one concession to
age, the knee operations and six trips to the disabled list. He
admits his legs feel as if they have a million miles on them. He
has had more than 500 at-bats in a season just twice in the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Everman High School graduate, a two-time all-star and
one of the best baseball players to come out of Tarrant County, is
nowhere near ready for a career change. This might be a critical
year, coming off double knee surgery, but the Giants' eagerness to
get him signed quickly after last season is a strong indication he
still commands respect as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, he's a quality guy,'' Baker said. ``He's liked and
respected by all of his teammates. He comes to the park ready to
play and plays hard every day. He doesn't complain, and he doesn't
make any alibis or excuses. He loves to play and he loves to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't even mention his playing ability. He can still
hit, hit with power, field, throw, run, there's nothing he can't
do. And he's not even at full speed yet. He's still not too far
removed from knee surgery. He's only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants acquired Burks from the Colorado Rockies on July 31
for center fielder Darryl Hamilton and two minor-league pitchers.
The Giants were looking for more power in the lineup to support
Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Burks, whose parents, James and Nettie Terry, still live in Fort
Worth, had built a house in a Denver suburb for his wife, Dori, and
his three children, Carissa, 10; Elisha, 7; and Christopher, 4, and
was happy in Colorado. But he says the trade to the Giants tur.em
out to be a good move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little skeptical at first,'' Burks said. ``I had never
been traded before, and I didn't know how it would go. I had to
find a new place to live, get acclimated to a new city. But the
guys made me feel welcome and so did the organization. So
everything has worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Burks has been thrust into a more prominent role with Bonds
sidelined until July because of elbow surgery. The Giants pointed
to Burks as the player who could keep them from floundering until
then, and he has moved into Bonds' No. 3 spot in the order. The
Giants remain in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another opportunity and another challenge,'' Burks
said. ``That's all this game is about, opportunity and challenges.
I know I can play this game; everybody around the game knows I can
still play.''
</P>
<P>
   He's just three years removed from his best season. Burks hit
.344 for the Rockies in 1996 with 40 homers, 142 runs scored and
128 runs batted in. He is one of three players, along with Hank
Aaron (1963) and Alex Rodriguez (last year), to get at least 40
homers, 200 hits and 30 stolen bases in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   He still believes he's as good a player as he has ever been,
although his numbers won't be as impressive away from Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   This year he's hitting .267 with five home runs and 22 RBI.
Baker points out Burks still is not 100 percent after the knee
operations, and Burks points out he usually gets better as the
season goes along.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back that up. They also show the move to right field
should help.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, Burks has hit .292 before the
All-Star break and .338 afterward. He also has hit .331 playing one
of the corner outfield positions and .302 in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not injured, my numbers are as good as anybody's,''
Burks said. ``I've had some bad luck, but I know how to deal with
it. I still love the game. It's always been a passion for me ever
since I started playing. That drives me. When you're still having
fun and still having success, you're still motivated to keep
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel I can play three or four more years. Once I get
through that, I can retire on my own terms. You don't want to get
pushed out of the game, but I still believe I can play three or
four more years.'' \Ntagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817) 390-7760

RANGERS MIGHT FEEL FORCED TO GO AFTER SCHILLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Philadelphia Phillies are winning, but
Curt Schilling is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are competing, but I don't think our owners are
committed to winning,'' Schilling said. ``I haven't seen any signs
the last two years that ownership is willing to spend money to help
us win games. For us to be successful, to contend and to win,
they've got to get a big-name pitcher in here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can play good baseball. We're hitting pretty
good. But we've got to go out and get a starting pitcher. You bring
in a Randy Johnson or Kenny Rogers or Brad Radke, then we're
legitimate contenders. But they haven't shown the commitment to do
that, physically or financially.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject is a difficult one for Schilling, who is off to a
7-1 start with a 2.58 earned-run average. He remains the subject of
extensive trade rumors, most notably to the Cleveland Indians and
the St. Louis Cardinals, although the Phillies right now don't want
to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   There are those around this area who would love for the Rangers
to get him, although the cost would be steep if he is traded, and
giving Ruben Mateo for him would be a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who is in the second season of a three-year, $15.9
million contract, would like to stay in Philadelphia. But he said
again Wednesday he would welcome a trade if the Phillies aren't
serious about competing. To him, that remains the case, even though
they were 21-18 after Wednesday's loss to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly not block a deal if the Phillies weren't in
contention in July and our owners weren't willing to do what it
takes to win,'' Schilling said. ``But I have a total no-trade
clause in the contract, and we want to go to a team where we are
comfortable and we have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are a team with whom he would be comfortable. Dick
Bosman was his pitching coach when Schilling was in the Orioles'
farm system, and he became good friends with Rick Helling when they
were both part of the all-star team that toured Japan at the end of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' first choice _ the smart choice _ is to try to win
this season without being forced to make another trade that
disrupts their farm system. The Rangers are about a year away from
having their system fully rebuilt, and unloading three or four
prospects for Schilling would only delay the process.
</P>
<P>
   But the temptation will be hard to resist this summer,
especially given the current state of their rotation. There is no
doubt Schilling is the No. 1 starter the Rangers need badly. Just
start with that he has four complete games this season, and the
Rangers have none.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one guy is going to be the savior; it takes all 25 guys,''
Schilling said. ``But I would bring something to the table, a
chance to win every fifth day ... a better-than-average chance of
winning. The ability to pitch in big games is something I crave.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Phillies keep winning, Schilling won't be traded. If they
falter, he becomes the big prize in the midsummer trade market. The
Indians will go hard after him, and so too would the Yankees, just
to keep him out of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Once that gets going, the Rangers will feel the pressure to join
in, just as they did with Roger Clemens. The Yankees' recent slump
will only make it more enticing.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will come down to how much they're willing to give up
for that ``final piece of the puzzle,'' the one that has proved so
elusive in the past.

CLAYTON READY TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton experienced
no difficulties during his two-game medical rehabilitation
assignment and should be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list
before tonight's game against the Orioles in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton (torn muscle, right shoulder) played nine innings
Tuesday and Wednesday for Triple-A Oklahoma and went 1-for-7 with
three walks and one run batted in during two games at Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to option shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt to
Oklahoma to make room on the 25-man roster for Clayton, who went on
the disabled list May 1. Clayton hit only .150 (9-for-60) during 19
games before the injury forced him to the disabled list. BACK TO
BALTIMORE Rangers designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro will make his
first appearance in Oriole Park at Camden Yards tonight after
leaving the Orioles this winter as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro will return hitting .377 with 11 home runs and 36 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to concentrate on what to do, not against who,''
said Palmeiro, who Wednesday had the 20th two-homer game of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit .500 (13-for-26) with five home runs and 13 RBI
during the Rangers' recent seven-game homestand and called the
streak ``probably one of my best, if not my best.'' CLARK TO MISS
SERIES Orioles first baseman Will Clark (fracture, left thumb)
likely will not be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list until
after the Rangers leave Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles sent Clark to their extended spring training program
in Sarasota, Fla., yesterday and plan for him to play there today
and tomorrow. The Orioles will evaluate Clark's progress Sunday and
determine a course of action. Clark played for the Rangers from
1994-98. PACKAGE TICKET PLAN The Rangers yesterday announced a
15-game, season-ticket miniplan involving The Ballpark in
Arlington's club-level seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power in the Park'' includes 15 scheduled games during July,
August and September and an option for postseason tickets. The plan
also includes discount coupons for merchandise, food and beverages
at The Ballpark's Diamond Club and a voucher for two free
upper-level tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Rangers' ticket office at (817) 273-5100 for more
information. BRIEFLY Outfielder Mike Simms went 0-for-3 with a walk
as Triple-A Oklahoma's designated hitter Wednesday while on his
second medical rehabilitation assignment. Simms (torn tendon, left
Achilles) went on the 15-day disabled list before the season began
and his return remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer will take an eight-game hitting steak
to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Greer and second baseman Mark
McLemore share the Rangers' longest hitting streak of the season at
10 games. / nn

BECAUSE OF NEED, RANGERS ALTERING PROMOTION PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' rotation struggled through late
April, yet general manager Doug Melvin dismissed a major-league
promotion for right-hander Ryan Glynn as an option.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, the organization's most successful minor-league pitcher
at Triple-A Oklahoma, inspired a promotion conversation after his
one-hitter on April 28 against the New Orleans Zephyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by the way he's throwing,'' Melvin said then,
``but he's still better off doing that consistently and getting in
a good groove down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who remain leery of rushing prospects through their
minor-league system, prefer for their players to experience a
successful full season at a particular level before moving on to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   The events of this season have altered that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, whom the Rangers recalled Sunday, became the fourth
player promoted from Oklahoma in only the first seven weeks of the
season. Glynn joined right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, left-hander Mike
Venafro and shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt on the Rangers' 25-man
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not envision those four contributing at the
major-league level before this season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not by choice,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``It's been because of need. Zimmerman and Venafro are here because
of need. Glynn is here because of need. Dransfeldt is here because
of need. That's what your Triple-A club is for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers purchased Zimmerman's contract April 13 to reinforce
an exhausted bullpen created by the rotation's early-season
failures. Venafro was recalled April 22 after John Burkett went on
the disabled list and remained with the Rangers when left-hander
Eric Gunderson went on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt made his 16th start Wednesday since his May 1 recall
for the injured Royce Clayton, who could be reinstated from the
15-day disabled list before tonight's game in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled Glynn on Sunday after right-hander Esteban
Loaiza (fracture, right hand) went on the disabled list, and Oates
announced two days later that the 24-year-old rookie would replace
the struggling Burkett in the rotation and start Tuesday at Tampa
Bay.

STARS FEELING DECREASE IN PRESSURE AT ADVANCED HEIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The pressure certainly isn't off the Stars, but
it has changed, Stars center Guy Carbonneau and coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   By advancing past the second round of the playoffs, the Stars
have at least met their accomplishments of last season. And while
Hitchcock and Carbonneau said that in no way makes the Stars any
less hungry to win, it does reduce the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying this is going to be easy,'' Carbonneau said.
``But when you have a team that has a lot of success during the
regular season, you can't afford to lose in the first two rounds.
There's a lot of pressure that if you do, your season is a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we think we can lose now, or we don't put
pressure on ourselves, but the monkey is off our backs a little
bit,'' he said. ``Now, we don't sit there and say, `We can't make a
mistake, we can't lose.' Now we can look at it and say `Let's do
this positive, let's do this to win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the pressure on the Stars was tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that we're past it, you can say we felt it,''
Hitchcock said. ``This is definitely a different kind of pressure
now.'' YOUNG LEGS While most fans will be focused on the Avalanche
scoring trio of Joe Sakic, Theo Fleury and Peter Forsberg, the
Stars can't afford to overlook the Avalanche's less glamorous
players, center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleury is obviously another threat for them, but I think a
bigger factor for them has been the play of their two young
rookies, \RMilan\S Hejduk and \RChris\S Drury,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``A lot of people talk about Detroit's depth in the past few years,
but Colorado had more depth than Detroit because of the play of
that third line.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury and Hejduk each are among the three finalists for NHL
rookie of the year (Ottawa's Marian Hossa is the third) and the two
Avalanche forwards have combined for 10 playoff goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they had that last year,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``That third line did a lot of damage. And while they might not be
getting a lot of attention, certainly we're looking at them.''
INJURY UPDATE The Stars were up to practicing almost a full lineup
yesterday and could have at least one more component on the
practice ice today. Pat Verbeek missed workouts yesterday as he
rested from flu symptoms. He is expected to practice today.
Defenseman Shawn Chambers is still rehabilitating an injured right
knee and is not expected to play in Game 1 of the Western
Conference finals tomorrow, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he is leaning toward using rookie defenseman Brad
Lukowich over veteran Doug Lidster in place of Chambers in Game 1,
and that he'll also be working to get Lukowich more ice time than
the six minutes Lukowich has averaged in his past two outings.
MENTAL BATTLE Ken Hitchcock said the Stars have advanced to the
point where they are prepared to keep an opposing goaltender from
getting into their heads the way Edmonton Oilers goalie Curtis
Joseph did two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that lesson,'' Hitchcock said. ``If you're going
to allow a goaltender to frustrate you and outwork you, you're
going to be in trouble. We know the only way to beat a hot goalie
is to outwork him.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Colorado Avalanche tough guy Claude Lemieux stood at
his locker in the basement of Joe Louis Arena early last week and
tried to explain what happened in the humiliating back-to-back
losses at home to the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much what the Red Wings were doing, Lemieux said
scornfully after the Avalanche trailed 2-0 in the Western
Conference semifinal series, ``It's more what we didn't do.

   ``I'm sure they didn't have to work too hard to beat us,''

defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings from the playoffs came
down to changes Colorado made after the second game. Those upgrades
seem to have put the Avalanche in the role reserved for Detroit as
the favorite in the Western Conference finals against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a much better team \Rthan Detroit\S in my mind,''
Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``They proved that in the last
series, and now we have to go out and beat this team. After what
they did to Detroit, I don't think anybody's worried about Detroit
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of what the Avalanche did to Detroit had to do with
``getting back,'' and not just to basics, including:
</P>
<P>
   Getting back a healthy Valeri Kamensky, an addition that not
only bolstered one of the club's top two lines but also
strengthened the third line by allowing the talented Adam Deadmarsh
to move down alongside Chris Drury and Shjon Podein.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to smart play. The Avalanche's obsession with
physical play in the first two games led to a string of untimely
penalties. When the series moved to Detroit, the Avalanche players
kept their collective temperament in check for the rest of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to the net. The Avalanche vowed to clog the area in
front of Detroit goalie Bill Ranford starting in Game 3, and it
did. Throughout the series, Colorado continued to drive hard to the
goal against Ranford and his replacement, Chris Osgood, increasing
their number of quality scoring chances. Eventually, those chances
became goals.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back the ``real'' Patrick Roy. Widely regarded as
perhaps the best big-game goalie in hockey, Roy played like it the
last three games. Roy frustrated Red Wings scorers time and again,
causing them to miss open shots and fire others weakly.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Kamensky ``brought a lot of enthusiasm and
excitement to the dressing room,'' Colorado center Joe Sakic said.
``We've got a lot more depth when we've got Val back. He's such a
great player, he opens up the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said: ``He's got lots of speed and
lots of skills. He generates great chances.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure on the top two lines removed upon Kamensky's
return, all the Avalanche lines appeared to play better _ even the
fourth line, where strongman Dale Hunter properly returned. This
nullified the Red Wings' previous edge in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to the Avalanche was a reinstalling of on-ice
discipline, particularly when it came to unnecessary rough stuff.
Stupid penalties left Colorado repeatedly shorthanded in the first
two games.
</P>
<P>
   For example, trailing 2-0 in Game 2, the Avalanche took several
penalties, killing hopes for a comeback. Such penalties, caused by
frustration with Detroit's tight neutral ice defense in Games 1 and
2, were minimized in the final four games.
</P>
<P>
   One Avalanche player who pointed out the folly of excessive
physical play was defenseman Miller, who scored a key goal in the
crucial 5-3 victory in Game 3 and finished at plus-5 for the series
with a goal and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just playing stupid,'' a suddenly vocal Miller said
after the frustrating first two games. ``It was disheartening and
an absolute lack of effort. We have to change the way we're
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche did change the way it was playing, to a smart,
controlled style, taking advantage of opportunities and not forcing
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg, whose world-class game picked up as the series
wore on, put it this way: ``We sat back a little more and didn't
run around as much.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of that smarter game, the Avalanche drove harder to the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hartley after Game 3: ``We managed to get closer to the
net. We had good jump to the net and we beat them to the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unlikely comeback would not have been possible without
Roy, the three-time Stanley Cup champion and two-time Conn Smythe
award winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick is unique in his ability to raise his expectations,''
Hartley said. ``I've never seen an athlete put so much pressure on
himself and then live up to it.''

 &HT;    Clinton delivers message of change at Columbine
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Hours after the nation's latest school
shootings rocked suburban Atlanta on Thursday, President Clinton
called on the students of Columbine High School to honor the
victims of last month's killings here by working to change the
``culture of violence'' that spawned both tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made a plea for understanding as he spoke to 2,000
Columbine students, faculty members and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dark forces that take over people, and make them murder,
are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage with which every
human being has to do combat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton journeyed to Littleton on a long-planned visit to
address the nation one month to the day after two Columbine
students opened fire on their classmates, killing 12 students and a
teacher and wounding 23 others before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address took on added poignancy, however, following
the Thursday morning shootings at Heritage High School in Rockdale
County, Ga. That incident left six students wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, no one was killed,'' first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton said of Thursday's shootings, ``but it should never have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking in the White House Rose Garden before leaving
for Colorado, said the Atlanta shooting ``is deeply troubling to
me, as it is to all Americans,'' and he pointed to the need for
closing gun control loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in this Denver suburb on a gray day marked by a brief
hailstorm, the president and first lady visited families of the
Columbine victims. Seated around tables set up in the sanctuary of
the Light of the World Catholic Church, the families shared their
stories and passed around homemade scrapbooks memorializing their
lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   If the mood in that closed-door session was intimate and somber,
there was a strikingly different atmosphere moments later, when
Clinton walked onto the dais at a jammed gymnasium at the Dakota
Ridge High School, just three miles from Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Columbine,'' the students chanted. Clinton hailed the
boisterous show of spirit as a sign of the powerful renewal
sweeping this wounded community.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the students to harness that spirit to the goal of
helping to build an American society less tolerant of violence and
more forgiving of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a culture of values, instead of a culture of
violence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow what happened to you has pierced the soul of America
and it gives you a chance to be heard in a way no one else can be
heard,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us to build a better future for all our children,'' said
Clinton. ``A future where society guards our children better
against violent influences and weapons that can break the dam of
decency and humanity in the most vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stressed, though, that it won't be easy to cure
the nation's epidemic of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot do what we need to do in America unless every person
is committed to doing something better and different in every walk
of life,'' Clinton said, ``beginning with parents and students and
going all the way to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really meant a lot to us'' that the president came here,
said Columbine freshman Vickie Abel, 15. ``It's going to make us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly dramatic moment, cheers rang out when Clinton
introduced two Columbine students _ Sean Graves and Patrick Ireland
_ who emerged from the hospital where they have been recovering
from wounds received in the shootings to attend Thursday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the students to remember during their commencement
ceremonies Saturday that theirs is a special class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be bittersweet,'' Clinton said. But he urged them to
listen for the support of their nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear the voice of America,'' Clinton said, ``because America
will be cheering you on.

SPORTS COLUMN: IMPORTED NOISE IN ATLANTA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You could hear they were New Yorkers even before
spotting the orange and blue colors supporting the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Patrick, I'm from Manhattan,'' one fan yelled at
courtside, although Patrick Ewing did not acknowledge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Jeff, I got bad legs, but I can play,'' another one
shouted during warm-ups, drawing just the slightest sideways smile
from the coach, Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Loud and familiar and pointed, these fans made up fully one
quarter of the crowd that huddled in one dreary little corner of
the looming Georgia Dome. They were giving the Knicks a verbal
touch of Noo Yawk Thursday night as the Knicks tried to make it two
straight over the Hawks in their second-round playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these people? Some of them were transplanted New
Yorkers, brought here by the vicissitudes of transient corporate
life. Others were current New Yorkers who realized they had a
better shot at buying tickets here than at the fat-cat emporium on
Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in a Delta Airlines fare, some of them were
probably saving money over what they would have to pay the friendly
gents who ply the scalper trade in the shadows around the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' players appreciate it when New Yorkers, either real
or wannabe, express themselves so blatantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to go into a gym and have some fans,'' Chris Dudley
said. ``It was the same in Miami for the first game. There were
guys with KNICKS painted on their chests, just like Yankee fans. I
think it helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs said: ``A lot of these people have lived in New
York, and they support us. It's kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were not amused that 25 percent of Knicks fans could
drown out the other 75 percent of the crowd of 18,513 during
Tuesday's 100-92 victory by the Knicks. The total itself was fine,
considering that Madison Square Garden, always sold out, holds
19,763 fans, but the nature of the Dome crowd was most emphatically
Noo Yawkish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Tyrone Corbin said. ``It's in our home
building, and they're cheering for the other team. But it happens.
We can't get wrapped up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin acknowledged that the local fans never got into the game
after the Hawks fell behind early. In New York, however, a
depressing start to a playoff game would prompt a massive volley of
boos _ just to show that New Yorkers care, in our own surly way.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be that the Georgia Dome is not actually
the Hawks' home. They are just using it while their new arena is
being constructed just up the hill. The dome is configured for
21,000 seats, which even with curtains and movable stands, are
swallowed up in the dome, which has 71,200 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also play some games at Georgia Tech, which produces
an identity crisis among fans, who never know where they are
parking or sitting. The man from Congo, Dikembe Mutombo, is of the
opinion that Atlanta fans ``do not care for games,'' but he is only
judging from the tepid reception to his sport. For example, Ted
Turner did not come to the first four playoff games here _ and he
owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that there is only one sport down here. Turner
discovered how it worked here a couple of decades ago when his
Braves actually had a pretty decent run in the first two-thirds of
the season, but the ball park was practically deserted on the first
Friday night of a homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody broke the news to Ted. It was late August, and the high
schools were playing ``foo'ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome actually rocks for the Falcons, although
they've been having trouble filling it, on occasion. Now the
National Hockey League is returning to Atlanta, where the sport
failed once before. The Braves, one of the great baseball teams of
the decade, do not always sell out their playoff games, either.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the diffused nature of Atlanta, with its
_ shall we say? _ modest downtown, and suburbs that sprawl out to
Gingrich Country and beyond, dependent on interstates clogged
during rush hour. Turner adamantly insisted on placing the new
arena next to the CNN building, rather than in the 'burbs, but
Hawks games currently lack the urban buzz that accompanies any
event in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith of the Hawks has said he is looking forward to
playing in the Garden Sunday afternoon and Monday night because of
the intensity. Smith understands. There was some intensity in the
Dome _ but most of it was produced by people wearing orange and
blue. &QL;

 &HT;    Logan in U.S. Senate race _maybe as independent
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Servic--
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like a thunderstorm over a picnic,
Willie Logan snatched a rare ray of sun away from the Democrats on
Thursday with his decision to run for the U.S. Senate _ possibly as
an independent.
</P>
<P>
   While many top Democrats dismiss Logan's candidacy as nothing
more than a distraction, others worry that Logan could siphon votes
away from the party's likely nominee, insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson, and give the election to the Republicans next year.
</P>
<P>
   Logan remained mostly mum about his plans, saying only that he
will meet with voters during the next few weeks to explore his
potential for victory. ``Then,'' he said, ``I will decide how I
want to access the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year state representative from Opa-locka said even if he
runs as an independent he will remain a registered Democrat. ``My
candidacy will not be based on any particular politics or political
party,'' he said during a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   With only five open Senate seats in the nation and control of
the chamber at stake, both national parties are targeting Florida,
where two-term Republican U.S. Sen. Connie Mack is retiring. ``This
race is going to get a lot of attention,'' said Republican
strategist Mike Murphy. ``You'll see both parties spend a lot of
money to win Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan's unceremonious removal last year from his post as House
Democratic leader caused a deep rift within the party.
</P>
<P>
   During the governor's race, Logan endorsed Republican Jeb Bush.
Declaring his own independence, Logan worked closely with GOP
leaders during the legislative session that ended this month. At
the same time, however, Logan attended a Democratic caucus and
spoke on behalf of Rep. Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach who was
chosen to lead House Democrats next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been sending a lot of mixed signals,'' said one
Democratic leader, who asked not to be named. ``I think Willie is
just looking out for what is best for Willie and right now the best
thing for Willie is to work both parties to his advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have certainly responded. Former state party
Chairman Tom Slade said he would love it if Logan would run as an
independent. Slade said he'd help raise money for Logan, who would
be unlikely to take away many GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been giddy over the prospect of having Nelson
unchallenged. When Mack announced earlier this year that he would
not seek a third term, candidates quickly lined up in both parties.
Weeks later, after more thought, Democrats such as U.S. Reps. Peter
Deutsch of Fort Lauderdale and Robert Wexler of Boca Raton, quickly
dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that is expected to cost an estimated $10 million to
$15 million, Nelson could be in the position of sitting back,
having a quiet primary season while the Republicans chew each other
up and spend valuable cash trying to win the nomination. That's
exactly what happened to the Democrats in 1988. There were six
candidates in the primary and the eventual winner, Buddy MacKay,
staggered into the general election, losing in one of the state's
closest races to Mack, who had only a token challenger in the GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
   So far Republicans have two serious candidates: Education
Commissioner Tom Gallagher and U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum of Altamonte
Springs, who may be best known for his role as one of the
prosecutors during President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans could have a third candidate if state Senate
President Toni Jennings of Orlando decides to get into the race.
She spent several days in Washington last week talking to
pollsters, media consultants and others in an effort to measure her
chance of winning. Republicans supporting her candidacy believe she
could take some women's votes away from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If she gets into the race, Republicans would be certain to have
not only a primary vote, but a runoff election as well, giving the
winner, who could be nearly broke, just four weeks to take on a
cash rich Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks so good for us it frightens me,'' said Charlie
Whitehead, a retired Panama City car dealer who took over the helm
of the Democratic Party at the urging of Nelson and other party
leaders who said they needed help strengthening the party.
Whitehead, who had been party chairman during most of the '80s,
said, ``I've been around long enough to know it can't stay this
good.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JIM ABBOTT'S INSPIRATIONAL RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people may surely be surprised to see Jim Abbott back on a
major-league mound, after what happened last year, or the year
before, and, to be sure, the year before that. Even the first part
of this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Abbott has always been full of surprises, including
making the major leagues at all, the only pitcher known to have
reached the big time with just one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was the 6-foot-3-inch, 210-pound left-hander for the
Milwaukee Brewers getting ready to face the New York Mets' lineup
in the first game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium on Thursday,
with a dispiriting 0-4 record and lugging around an 8.49 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first start in three weeks, after having been
relegated to the bullpen after three unimpressive starts. He didn't
complain of the demotion to manager Phil Garner. ``How could I?''
Abbott said. ``I didn't have a leg to stand on.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner was sorry to drop the invariably polite, diligent Abbott
from the rotation. ``You hope he finds himself,'' Garner said.
``He's a gutsy guy, and maybe the harder he tries the less
effective he is. He's no longer a power pitcher, but more of a
finesse pitcher, and he's in the transition of trying to master it.
I just want him to throw free and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner is giving him another shot as a starter, and Abbott knows
he either succeeds now, or may very soon run out the string here.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott has had some wonderful accomplishments in his 10
big-league seasons, including an 18-11 year with the Angels in 1991
and a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1995. But he fell on rocky times
in Gotham and was traded to the Angels. Three seasons ago he won
two games and lost 18, and was released by Anaheim. ``I felt,'' he
said, ``uneasy with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And he quit the game, at 29. He had rarely quit at anything,
always determined to forge ahead. When he was 5 years old, in
Flint, Mich., his parents had fitted him with a hook for a hand. He
came back from kindergarten crying that the other kids had made fun
of him and were afraid to play with him. He removed the hook, never
to wear it again.
</P>
<P>
   He endeavored to prove himself in myriad ways, none more
dramatically than on the athletic field, becoming a baseball star
at he University of Michigan and going straight into the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He inevitably became a hero and model to many who felt
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't carry that as a burden,'' he said. ``I've looked at my
life as a personal journey. But I'd say in 50 percent of the parks
we play in, parents of kids with one hand, or some other
disability, bring their kids to meet me.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, as he did in Pittsburgh recently, he will play
catch with them on the sidelines, removing their gloves to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the quietest kids that move me the most,'' he recalled.
``You see their shyness, that they want to be like everybody else.
I understand that. And they open up a little bit. It's inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   After he quit baseball he sat around his home in Michigan
watching baseball games on television _ he was still being paid
around $3 million from his Angels contract _ and realizing that it
was still very much in his blood. After that season of inactivity,
his agent called the White Sox and Abbott last season returned to,
of all places, Hickory, N.C., Class A ball.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved him up to Class AA, then Class AAA and, finally,
last September, to the White Sox, for whom he was a remarkable 5-0
in that last month of the season. He became a free agent and signed
a one-year contract with Milwaukee for $400,000 plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The game Thursday began forlornly for Abbott, and ended that
way. Robin Ventura belted a bases-loaded home run off him in the
first inning. His throwing error in the fourth cost him a run. In
the bottom of the fifth, he gave up two hits with one out, and
Garner removed him. The next batter homered, and Abbott, who was
credited with giving up seven runs on seven hits in four and a
third innings and was the losing pitcher, could hardly have been a
bundle of joy as he soaped himself in the shower, and contemplated
his future, at 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously didn't do very well today,'' Garner said. ``But
right now he's still in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, when Abbott was throwing well and looking
like a star again, and hitting a single and laying down a sacrifice
bunt, since National League pitchers must bat, Mark McGwire said it
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jim Abbott doesn't inspire you,'' McGwire said, ``there's
something wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, really, has changed.

<P>
   HURST, Texas _ Michelle Werthen knows the fate of the 16th
Annual Lake Worth (Texas) Bullfrog Festival is on her shoulders _
or at least her patio.
</P>
<P>
   Seven sage green bullfrogs arrived at her apartment on Thursday
from New York, and they are the stars of the festival in the Fort
Worth suburb, which began Wednesday and runs through Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just can't escape,'' Werthen said as the $125 bullfrogs
lounged lazily in a net-covered fish pond on her apartment patio in
Hurst, just outside Fort Worth. ``When they came out of their box,
they stretched and yawned.''
</P>
<P>
   The frog-finding frenzy reached fever pitch after a newspaper
article described the local chamber of commerce's desperate search
for bullfrogs. Executive Director Judy Haas was led to Ward's
Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, N.Y., which shipped the
frogs by Federal Express.

<P>
   Werthen's guests, renowned for their jumping prowess, arrived
about noon in a wax-covered box cushioned in moss. Werthen said
that when the delivery driver saw the ``live frogs'' label, he
figured she had ordered a meal for a pet boa constrictor.
</P>
<P>
   The seven frogs appeared fine in a prefabricated fish pond with
heavy netting securely clamped on it to keep the frogs from leaping
away.

<P>
   ``I think they were happy to get out of their cramped
quarters,'' Werthen said.

   She has plenty of crickets to feed them before their race at 2

   As it neared evening Thursday, Werthen wondered about the noise
level at nightfall _ and whether her neighbors would be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   With bullfrogs croaking and crickets chirping, ``it will sound
like a warm, summer evening,'' she said.

NOT SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'm a manager at a large corporation. I work long hours and
regard my time away from the office as an invaluable chance to
recharge and to relax with my family. But supervisors and
colleagues call me constantly me at home (or page me or call my
cell phone), often asking that I rush back to the office. I can't
just turn off my pager and cell phone, because I'm expected to be
on call for emergencies. Increasingly, however, I am called about
not-so-important matters. How do I cut down on these annoyances
without having my dedication questioned?
</P>
<P>
   A. Welcome to the dark side of the workplace without boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers and cell phones can lead people to think you're available
24 hours a day, said Barbara Miller, a consultant in Mill Valley,
Calif., who specializes in work- and life-style issues. ``But the
reality is that nobody can function as a working person 24 hours a
day,'' she added. ``We all need downtime.''
</P>
<P>
   A first step is to talk with your co-workers about the problem,
to see if they have similar frustrations. ``It's almost guaranteed
that you are not the only one in your work group with this
problem,'' said Susan Seitel, president of Work and Family
Connection, a publishing and consulting firm in Minnetonka, Minn.
So you can do everyone a favor by getting the issue out in the
open.
</P>
<P>
   Define your terms and set limits. ``Have informal conversations
with individual culprits,'' advised Bonnie Michaels, president of
Managing Work and Family, a consulting firm in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Ask why they feel a need to consult you on everyday matters, for
example, and explore alternative paths to answers. If the problem
is technical, remember that the same high-tech world that produced
the pager has also given us data bases and Web sites with quick
access to all kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, decide what constitutes an emergency and what
merits what response. A message on your answering machine might be
OK for important, but not vital, matters, while a cell-phone call
could be reserved for code-blue crises.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to your boss, however, will require diplomacy. ``Rather
than saying, `I'm upset because you've been calling me at home for
the last three weeks at 7 o'clock at night,' go in and say, `I
really need you to help me problem-solve on this one,''' Ms. Miller
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Try to depersonalize the situation. ``Encourage your boss to
look at this as a systemic issue rather than just your issue,'' she
said. That can show that you're a team player, not a whiner.
</P>
<P>
   Once the limits have been set, find ways to enforce them. After
a certain hour, consider using your answering machine to screen
calls, returning only those about true emergencies. But don't take
such steps to avoid confronting the boundary issue head-on at the
office, Ms. Michaels said. Otherwise, she added, ``the calls are
just going to continue, and somebody's going to get mad because you
don't call them back.''

   U.S. DETAILS GLOBAL CARTEL THAT FIXED VITAMIN PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides described in detail a
decade-long vitamin cartel that they said had been shattered in one
of the largest criminal prosecutions ever made by the Justice
Department. Hoffman-LaRoche of Switzerland agreed to pay a $500
million penalty, the largest fine ever imposed by the Justice
Department. A second company, BASF of Germany, has agreed to pay
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, senior executives of the world's
largest producers of vitamins met every year to set production
quotas, prices and distribution for vitamin ingredients that were
used in products in every refrigerator and kitchen cabinet in
America.

 &HT;    Tax breaks on domestic goods unlikely, but other cuts may follow
in Texas
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State lawmakers have all but buried proposed tax
breaks on such things as clothing, school supplies and diapers, but
a lead House Democrat on Thursday said tax cuts still likely to be
approved this session are balanced between businesses and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two House committees on Thursday approved three Senate bills
that include about $1.4 billion in tax cuts and tax prevention
measures. Tax prevention measures slow down future tax increases,
but do not lower current taxes.
</P>
<P>
   About $220 million of the $1.4 billion would go to businesses;
$20 million would go to consumers who use the Internet. The rest,
about $1.2 billion, would be divided between businesses and
consumers who own property, with business property owners expected
to take the largest portion of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have chosen the wrong taxes to cut,'' said Dick Lavine, a
senior analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which
advocates on behalf of low-income Texans. ``The average Texan will
not be seeing the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The center says taxes shouldn't be cut, but if lawmakers cut
taxes, they should target them to low- and middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rene Oliveira, (D-Brownsville), is chairman of the House
Ways and Means committee, which approved two of the bills. He said
he's disappointed that tax cuts on diapers and school supplies are
unlikely to pass. But he said a still-viable proposal to cut sales
taxes on over-the-counter medicines is good for all consumers and
helps balance the proposed cuts between consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade-off for me is that over-the-counter tax cuts help
everybody,'' Oliveira said. ``The school clothes and school
supplies and diapers are things that help people at some point in
their lives. To help the most people during all of their lives, the
over-the-counter is the best vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Public Education Committee approved the third bill,
which contains about $1.2 billion in measures meant to hold down
and cut local school property taxes. The bill, Senate Bill 4, also
contains $1.7 billion for $3,000, across-the-board teacher pay
raises and about $900 million in new school spending. It also
contains measures to end social promotion in schools. The practice
is meant to keep students on grade-level with their peers even
though they haven't mastered the material at their current levels.
</P>
<P>
   By House rules, all three bills must clear the full House by
Wednesday. The Senate then is expected to reject House proposals,
setting up conference committees that would have to produce
compromise bills. Those bills then would have to be approved by the
House and Senate by May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The session ends May 31, but that day is reserved for
corrections to passed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee had about $500 million to divide
between business and consumer sales tax cuts. But the House already
has approved about $450 million in such cuts for small Texas
corporations and on over-the-counter medicines. That means changes
to already approved business and sales tax cuts will have to be
made to accommodate those approved by the committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts approved Thursday include several that are key to Gov.
George W. Bush, including $20 million in Internet access sales tax
cuts and business tax cuts for research and development and
investment tax credits. They also contain key Democratic cuts,
including job creation tax credits and additional investment tax
credits for business investments in 90 poor counties, largely along
the Texas-Mexico and Texas-Louisiana borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a commitment to work on a balanced proposal,'' said
Oliveira, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
``It' going to take a lot of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay) said a large portion of the
business tax cuts being discussed are targeted to small businesses.
That, he said, makes them closer to consumer tax cuts than business
tax cuts. Fraser, who's pushed the tax cut for small businesses,
also said all tax cuts will be good for consumers in the end
business tax cuts allow for better prices or more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts are tax cuts,'' he said.

CSUN, UCLA WIN PLAYOFF GAMES IN SOFTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although unspoken, the ghosts of past postseason
failures hung over the Cal State Northridge softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday. The fifth-seeded Matadors knocked around No. 2
Missouri 7-3 in an NCAA region opener at UCLA to record their first
win in the postseason after six consecutive losses over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge (30-22) scored a season-high six runs in the second
inning and got home runs from infrequent power sources.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Katrina Nolletti and Ashlie Hayes each hit their second
home runs of the season in the second inning, making it easy for
pitcher Tara Glaister (21-13). Northridge reached today's 3 p.m.
game against Minnesota. Missouri (38-20) plays Alabama today at 10
a.m. in an elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels good,'' Northridge coach Janet Sherman said.
``We felt good, we felt confident. We're enjoying the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge trailed 1-0 after one inning, which must have had
Sherman wondering about the team's fate in this year's tournament.
But then came the second inning and she was able to breathe easier.
</P>
<P>
   Nolletti's three-run shot _ only her second of the year _ off
Stephanie Falk (24-12) barely cleared the left-field fence and gave
CSUN a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I popped it up to left field,'' Nolletti said. ``I
didn't think I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes followed two batters later with a mammoth 250-foot shot to
left-center that finished the inning's scoring and chased Falk. It
was the fourth time this season Northridge had scored six times in
an inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit two out in the second inning, and that's the
ballgame,'' Missouri coach Jay Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   After the second, Northridge collected just one hit, but by then
the runs had the desired calming effect on Glaister (one earned
run, eight strikeouts, three walks). Not needing to fret about the
location of every pitch, Glaister got the first five outs by
strikeout and scattered seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Missouri scored two unearned runs in the fifth inning
to halve Northridge's lead to 6-3, Glaister wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't so touchy about spots,'' she said. ``I had some space
if something were to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Little else did, except for Jessica Creith's sacrifice fly in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   __ UCLA 7, Alabama 0: Courtney Dale pitched a one-hitter with 10
strikeouts and Julie Adams hit two two-run home runs and drove in
five. Top-seeded UCLA (56-6) advanced to today's 12:30 p.m. game
against Creighton. Alabama dropped to 39-25.
</P>
<P>
   Dale (29-1) pitched five perfect innings, then lost her bid for
her first perfect game with an errant throw to first. She lost the
no-hitter in the sixth when Kelley Askew dumped a leadoff single to
left field.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said she was unaware she had a perfect game or a no-hitter.
Coach Sue Enquist wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She plays the game one pitch at a time,'' Enquist said. ``She
can dominate. She has great composure. She had control, she had one
slip, she regrouped and she closed the door.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA pounded Alabama pitcher Penny Cope with four runs in 21/3
innings. Cope two-hit UCLA the last time the teams played March 12
in a tournament in Chattanooga, Tenn. UCLA won that game 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' five RBI matched a season high, last accomplished March 6
against Creighton. It also was her second multihomer game this
season.

ANALYSIS: DEMOCRATS GAIN GROUND, AN INCH, ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the past two extraordinary weeks in the Senate,
Democrats and gun control advocates accomplished far more than any
of them had ever thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the celebration, the package they assembled was
still a modest one, falling short of President Clinton's proposals
after the Colorado shootings and much less attempting anything as
far-reaching as a handgun ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats did not dream of bringing up, for example, the
president's proposal to limit individuals to buying one handgun a
month. They lost an effort to limit gun sales on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And fearful that they could endanger final passage of the
juvenile-justice bill if they overplayed their hand, gun control
proponents stopped short of trying to restore a waiting period for
handgun purchases, a part of the 1993 Brady law that has since
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever said this is the last thing on guns,'' said
Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota. ``This was
the most realistic approach we could use, given the circumstances
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the measures were limited, the package _ including a
requirement of background checks at gun shows _ was the first major
congressional victory for gun control advocates in five years. And
there was evidence that a new political center was developing in
the nation on guns and violence, as Americans recoil from school
shooting after school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Republicans lurched from position to
position, as their first efforts to stop the Democratic measure to
require background checks at gun shows proved politically
untenable. Now two Republican presidential candidates, Elizabeth
Dole and Sen. John McCain, have come out in favor of some measures
for gun control. So, too, have the two Republican congressional
leaders, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lott, to the dismay of many conservatives, did not
yank the bill from the floor when momentum started shifting the
Democrats' way. This Republican repositioning is important because
gun control is an emotional social issue where change comes hard
and any movement is significant.
</P>
<P>
   It took the proponents of the Brady bill seven arduous years to
put in place its regulation of handgun purchases. And since 1994,
when Republicans took control of Congress with significant support
from the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby has been
considered invincible.
</P>
<P>
   That supremacy was shattered Thursday when Vice President Al
Gore cast the dramatic tie-breaking vote that passed the measure to
require background checks at gun shows. So Democrats were able to
say Thursday, as a triumphant Gore did, that ``this is a turning
point for our country'' and that change often begins ``with the
narrowest of margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledged that to achieve their victories they had
carefully scaled back their ambitions, framed gun control as a
child-safety issue and selected such politically popular measures
as safety devices for guns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said the measures that the
Democrats selected to fight for had to pass two tests: that they
had a realistic chance of becoming law and that they could be seen
as bearing some relationship to what had happened in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate has really been about common sense, moderate
efforts to limit the accessibility and availability of weapons to
children,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who has
been battling for gun control since his two brothers were
assassinated in the 1960s. He said that while the political climate
was changing, it had not changed enough that he could pass the
measure that eluded him three decades ago: a ban on cheap handguns
known as Saturday night specials.
</P>
<P>
   What the Senate votes mean for further gun control is uncertain.
These proposals still have to get through the House, where pro-gun
sentiments run stronger and conservatives have greater sway.
</P>
<P>
   And while Democrats vowed to continue with a new gun control
offensive on another day, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, long
one of the few Republicans in favor of gun control, predicted there
would be a hiatus before Congress considers any more stringent
measures.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that gun control will be an issue in the
2000 campaigns. Gore obviously relished the opportunity to use his
incumbency to cast the tie-breaking vote. Democrats have also vowed
to use the GOP lurches on gun control against the Republicans from
swing states who are up for re-election in 2000, like Spencer
Abraham of Michigan, Rod Grams of Minnesota and Slade Gorton of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were furious that they had been caught so
flat-footed. ``We're losing,'' complained Sen. Bob Smith R-N.H., a
presidential candidate, who is an avid opponent of gun control.
``The other side skillfully used terrible tragedies to change
peoples' votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives groused that Lott had allowed the gun-control
debate at all, and Republican moderates complained that their party
leaders had been so tone deaf that they allowed Sen. Larry Craig of
Idaho, a board member of the National Rifle Association, to be
their point man on the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the Senate Republican
re-election effort, argued optimistically that the confusing
multitude of votes over the past days had allowed Republicans to
stake out positions that would be acceptable whether they came from
western, more pro-gun states, or the more moderate northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our candidates largely voted the way they should have
given their particular states,'' he said.

SORTING OUT FALLOUT FROM A LAWSUIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For many long and unprofitable years, air-pollution control
companies waited for the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce
provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 that made each state
responsible for keeping its air breathable.
</P>
<P>
   The companies figured that if the agency cracked down on the
states, the states would crack down on polluters. And they, in
turn, would buy precipitators, scrubbers, and other machines that
remove pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the agency started spewing forth those rules, and
the $3 billion industry thought its future was secure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, a federal appeals court appeared to snatch
that security away. In a lawsuit brought by three states and
several industry groups the court ruled that the EPA had been too
arbitrary in setting a new low standard for fine particulates _ in
other words, soot _ and had exceeded its constitutional powers in
tightening standards for ozone, a main ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   Are the air-cleaning companies back to square one? Jeffrey
Smith, executive director of the Institute of Clean Air Companies,
a trade association, thinks not. But he is worried.
</P>
<P>
   Q. With the smog-and-soot rules in limbo, are orders going to
dry up?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not for now. The EPA gave the states as long as 10 years to
comply with some of the new rules, so some orders wouldn't have
come in for several more years. The compliance deadlines for
reducing toxic substances and NOx _ the nitrogen oxides that are
the precursors to ozone _ fall much sooner, and those rules are the
main sources of our orders now.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, our members booked more orders than in any quarter
of the last eight years, and it was mainly because of NOx. The NOx
rules are based on the old ozone standards, so last week's court
decision shouldn't have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   But anything the EPA does of any consequence winds up being
litigated, and the NOx standards are in litigation, too. Opponents
of ambient air standards have had a great week _ they're in a
celebratory mood, giddy with success. This decision is energizing
them to build legal war chests to oppose other rules, including the
NOx rules.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If those NOx rules are overturned, how severe a blow would
that be to air-cleaning companies?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think they will be overturned. And, there is a
backstop rule in place anyway. Under the Clean Air Act, states that
have heavy concentrations of NOx in their air because of emissions
blowing down from other states can petition the EPA to take
remedial action. About a dozen states have already done that, and
if existing rules are overturned, they will probably press their
case. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So last week's court action is not having a dampening effect
on your industry?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course it is.
</P>
<P>
   When the EPA came out with its new rules in 1997, it energized
us. For the first time in a long time, we had a sense of a firm,
certain, inevitable future market. That made it easy to attract
investors and to recruit and keep talented people. We began
spending again on research and development, looking for more
efficient and less costly technologies, and we started finding
them.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision may dissipate a lot of that energy. We got
burned earlier this decade when we expected an immediate surge of
orders from the Clean Air Act that never came. That left us
respectful and wary of the deleterious effect that any sense of
delay or uncertainty can have on orders.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the air pollution control market is that customers
buy just enough, and just on time. They may rethink or postpone
purchases of air pollution control technology based on their
perception that Congress or the EPA will rethink the entire Clean
Air Act. That may not be factually correct, but business acts on
perception, not reality.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your association was influential in getting the tighter
smog-and-soot rules passed. How do you plan to keep them alive now?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not our policy to participate directly in any
litigation. But we're spending a lot of time on the phone with
federal and state officials, making sure they understand that if
you interpret the court's decision rationally, it should not ripple
into other areas like NOx controls.
</P>
<P>
   And we're spending a lot of time with our members, too, trying
to reassure them that the sky is not falling. After all, the court
didn't disagree with the proposed standards, just with the way the
EPA articulated its criteria for setting them. There's no reason to
believe that the EPA can't put together a justification of the
standards that would pass muster with this panel. And, I expect the
EPA to vigorously pursue its options on appeal, even if it means
going to the Supreme Court.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If it does, will it win?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think so. But remember, I expected them to win this time.
</P>

 &HT;    Frankly, mansion's no Tara
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The doors to Whitehall, the 1840s Greek Revival
mansion in Covington that some say was one of Margaret Mitchell's
architectural inspirations for ``Gone With the Wind,'' were swung
open to ``GWTW'' fans Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can now tour what inspired the family home of
Ashley Wilkes,'' owner K.C. Bassham told us before the 5:30 p.m.
ribbon cutting of the house and soon-to-be museum. More than 175
``GWTW'' devotees had reserved tickets for the tour that features
artifacts from both the book and movie. Former child actors Patrick
Curtis and Mickey Kuhn, who both claim to be baby Beau in the film,
were also scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Bassham and her husband, Vern, bought the property in January
partly because they believe Mitchell told ``GWTW'' producer David
O. Selznick that Whitehall was ``her vision of what Twelve Oaks
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, two local ``GWTW'' authorities say. Author and
``GWTW'' collector Herb Bridges says his research shows that
Mitchell probably never said that to Selznick. Bridges says the
source of the legend is a book, ``David O. Selznick's Hollywood,''
where a photo of Whitehall appears. ``Once it got in that book, it
became gospel,'' says Bridges. ``The truth is, you could look at
any grandiose mansion of that era in Atlanta and say it was a model
for Twelve Oaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rose Taylor, executive director of the Margaret Mitchell
House, says she too is dubious about Whitehall's role. ``My feeling
is that Margaret's Mitchell's vision of Twelve Oaks was always a
composite of many homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, in a city where thousands flock yearly looking for
Tara, Whitehall might make a compelling enough stop. The
10,000-square-foot, four-story structure opens for tourists June 2.

EDITORIAL: ONLY A START ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 21:
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gun control took a dramatic turn Thursday. Hours
after another frightening school shooting episode _ this time at a
high school outside Atlanta _ Vice President Gore cast a
tie-breaking vote in the Senate to tighten existing gun control
laws, dealing an important defeat to the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's vote broke a 50-50 tie on a proposal by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., to close a major loophole in the Brady law that
makes it easy for youths and criminals to buy firearms at gun shows
without any background checks. The proposal, a retooled version of
a measure Senate Republicans had narrowly killed nine days before,
also closed a dangerous new loophole buried in the phony gun-show
bill Republicans approved last week. The loophole would have
allowed convicted felons to reclaim their guns from pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Lautenberg and Sens. Charles Schumer of New
York and Richard Durbin of Illinois, showed admirable persistence
in pressing the gun-show issue. They also benefited from the votes
of two Democratic senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who had been absent for the original vote,
and a switch by another, Max Cleland of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important were the votes of six lonely Republicans who
rose above intense partisan pressures to defy the gun lobby on the
gun-show issue _ John Chafee of Rhode Island, John Warner of
Virginia, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana
and George Voinovich and Mike DeWine, both of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the majority leader, Trent Lott, and most of his
Republican colleagues have yet to be persuaded of the urgency of
broader reform. Despite the passage of the gun-show measure, the
amendments _ attached to a juvenile justice bill _ are
disappointingly meager.
</P>
<P>
   One provision, for example, would require that trigger locks be
provided separately with gun purchases. But it sets no deadline for
requiring that locks be incorporated as part of the design. The
Senate did agree to bar further imports of large military-style
ammunition clips, as well as sales of assault rifles and shotguns
to juveniles under 18 and their possession by juveniles under 18.
But it stopped short of raising the age for sales and possession of
these weapons from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Senate defeated Schumer's proposal to subject
Internet gun sales to background checks, and completely ignored at
least three other important proposals. One would have reinstated
the Brady waiting period for purchasing guns. The second would
limit gun sales to individuals to one per month to deter
large-scale gun trafficking. The third would allow criminal
prosecution of parents whose failure to securely lock away their
guns results in violence by a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will shortly move to the House, where gun
control forces in and outside of Congress will need to step up the
pressure for a much stronger package. That includes President
Clinton and Gore. The vice president's rescue mission Thursday
should help improve not only his political fortunes but those of
his party, which in contrast to the Republicans has shown real
independence from the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Senate's weak performance demonstrates, there is a
lot more that can be done to keep guns out of the hands of troubled
schoolchildren. And as the school shooting in Georgia reminds us,
there is a lot more that must be done.

EDITORIAL: A WARNING FROM THE BUTTERFLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bt'' is short for Bacillus thuringiensis, the name of a
naturally occurring soil bacterium that produces a toxin capable of
killing some insects while leaving others unharmed. For farmers who
closely monitor their crops and are willing to manage its
application with care, Bt has been a resounding success since the
early 1960s. But for those same reasons, Bt has never been widely
adopted by conventional farmers, who prefer longer-lasting
pesticides and whose fields are so large that effectively timing
the use of Bt is impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Bt is now available to conventional farmers in the very crops
they grow, in genetically modified versions of potatoes, cotton and
corn that are designed to express the Bt toxin. In the United
States this year, nearly 20 million acres of Bt corn will be
planted. That sounds, on the surface, like a good thing. But
researchers at Cornell University have discovered in a laboratory
study that the pollen from Bt corn, when eaten by larvae of monarch
butterflies, killed nearly half and stunted the rest. The Corn Belt
happens to be critical ground for monarchs, which live on milkweed,
a plant found all across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody yet knows if the pollen is killing a substantial number
of butterflies in the real world, but this is deeply disturbing
news. It reminds us just how little we know about the impact of
genetically modified crops in nature and how little the regulatory
process can tell us, so far, about their effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another potential problem. One of the things that
makes Bt safe and effective when applied as a spray is that it
breaks down quickly, lessening the opportunity for insects to
develop resistance to it. But in a transgenic crop, like Bt corn,
it is prevented from breaking down. Some studies have shown that
continuous exposure to Bt quickly creates resistant insects, thus
destroying the effectiveness of the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid the development of resistance is to
interplant Bt corn and non-Bt corn in a checkerboard pattern,
creating a refuge for insects that can interbreed with resistant
insects, rendering them less resistant. Something like this pattern
has been required for the use of Bt corn in Canada. But for large
commodity farmers, this planting scheme, of course, negates many of
the gains that transgenic Bt crops were supposed to create.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a tragedy if the use of transgenic corn, potatoes and
cotton by conventional farmers ends up destroying the effectiveness
of a safe, natural pesticide that is of great value to many small
farmers and all organic farmers _ to a whole sector of the
agricultural world that has relied on close, attentive management
practices as an alternative to chemical pesticides. It is important
to make sure that monarch butterfly populations are not harmed by
transgenic crops. It is just as important to save Bt itself.

   It was fitting that this financial revelation came in church.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent service, our minister honored the people who
have been members of the congregation for at least 50 years. As he
called their names, they stood at their pews, some with the aid of
canes. Almost all of them were women.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my wife, Christine, sitting next to me, and I
suddenly realized that she could be among the honorees someday and
that I would not likely be standing next to her. The odds are that
Christine, a television reporter, will outlive me by a good
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   I leaned over and whispered my thoughts to her, and we spent the
rest of the service holding hands. I was sitting in that church
trying to figure out how I was going to save for my children's
college education as well as our retirement _ and still have enough
for Christine when she's going to church solo.
</P>
<P>
   Not a very romantic notion, but a prospect that financial
experts say baby boomers must consider. After all, the Census
Bureau says that in 1997, some 46 percent of all women 65 and older
were widows, while only 16 percent of men that age were widowers.
And if wives indeed outlive their husbands, the family's assets
must outlive the husbands, too.
</P>
<P>
   Having a sound financial strategy is an obvious first step
toward that goal. Like many other certified financial planners,
Elaine Bedel of Indianapolis recommends conventional investments
first, with life insurance as a possible supplement.
</P>
<P>
   If couples think that their assets will not last long enough to
provide for a surviving wife, they can buy insurance to cover the
shortfall. She favors level term policies that can offer hundreds
of thousands of dollars in coverage at the same, or level, premium,
for as long as 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance agents often recommend whole life insurance and
variable annuities, which offer both investment returns and death
benefits. But financial planners, citing the fees and tax
complications, say many people would be better off buying term life
insurance while using their other funds for conventional
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even a solid strategy, however, can weaken if one partner is not
a participant. In many families, one spouse often takes financial
charge, and even in the 1990s, it's usually the husband.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Phelps, 53, a vice president of employee benefit sales at
Conseco Risk Management in Carmel, Ind., had always managed his
family's assets. He had the expertise and his wife lacked interest.
His father had died young, so he knew the importance of
preparation. Recently, Phelps asked his wife, Kay, to accompany him
to visit Ms. Bedel.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I still had time to do something about it, I wanted to
make sure we had our finances on track,'' he said. ``I wanted my
wife to be more involved and aware of what was happening. I was
concerned that if something happened to me she wouldn't know where
to start financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phelps, 53, an administrator of a scholarship program for
the Independent Colleges of Indiana in Indianapolis, found the
meeting useful, but still counts on her husband. ``He's so
conscientious, and such a good husband and parent,'' she said. ``I
guess I have always had so much confidence in his love and caring
for me that I knew everything would be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps now carries about $1.25 million of life insurance, mostly
term insurance. He plans to cut back, sharply though not entirely,
as he nears a retirement he intends to finance with his
investments. ``I've been in the insurance industry for 30 years and
have a loyalty to the product, so I am reluctant to give it up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But how much money will a widow need? The more men think about
it, the thriftier they might become today to provide their wives
with more security tomorrow. Assuming continued low inflation, Ms.
Bedel said that if a man who is 45 today lives to 65, and his wife
outlives him by 10 years, she will need $750,000, assuming living
expenses of $50,000 a year. If she outlives him by 20 years, the
total rises to $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   To reach those totals, a Mr. Wonderful must immediately start
saving $1,250 or $2,000, respectively, a month or invest $150,000
or $250,000 now and get an 8 percent return until he dies.
</P>
<P>
   So get busy, guys. &QL;

EDITORIAL: ASKING STUDENTS TO DO MORE WITH LESS
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki sounded tough last week about making high
school graduation requirements stricter, telling reporters that
``we should not back down one iota from our efforts to raise
students' performance standards.'' But his utterly inadequate
education budget would make it difficult for most New York state
school districts to meet those standards, and practically
impossible for districts serving the poorest students.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers of both parties have good reason to be nervous,
because beginning next year all students will have to pass the
rigorous Regents English exam to graduate. Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky has proposed legislation to allow school districts to use
alternative assessments in place of the Regents tests. But in
theory, students would still have to show higher achievement to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, students could choose to take basic competency tests
to graduate rather than the harder Regents exam that leads to a
Regents diploma. In New York City, fewer than 25 percent of
students get the Regents diplomas. A recent report showed that 27
percent of high school seniors statewide and 37 percent of seniors
in New York City would not have graduated last year if the new test
requirement had been in place. The standards will become more
demanding in subsequent years when students will have to pass
Regents exams in other areas besides English. Some community
leaders worry that 20 percent or more of seniors will not graduate
under the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents wanted to improve student performance. That
goal still makes sense. For too long New York state has awarded
second-class diplomas to barely literate students. But standards
cannot be raised in a vacuum. The state cannot expect students in
schools without decent libraries, laboratories or trained teachers
to pass tests that have no connection to what is happening in the
classroom. The solution is not to dumb down the standards but to
provide enough resources so that even students from impoverished
areas have a chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents have recommended increasing the state education
budget by $885 million for the coming year, especially targeting
the neediest districts. The money would pay for after-school
instruction, more summer school, more teacher training and repairs
to facilities like science labs. But Pataki slashed the amount to
$270 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he is reneging on a 1997 budget deal that
provided property tax cuts favored by suburban areas in return for
more spending to cut class sizes and finance preschool programs.
New York City schools will be among those hit hardest. The city
will get only 28 percent of his meager budget increase, even though
it educates 38 percent of the students in the state and serves 62
percent of students living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The fight now has to be about resources, not achievement
standards. Without financial commitments from the governor and the
legislature, New York state will soon be engaged in the pointless,
destructive exercise of flunking tens of thousands of students who
never had much of a chance.

 &HT;    Chen gets chance to display progress
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bruce Chen is getting a second chance tonight, about
seven weeks later than he expected. The rookie is slated to start
in place of John Smoltz while he's on the disabled list with an
inflamed elbow
</P>
<P>
   For Chen, who lost the fifth starter's job during spring
training, it's a chance to impress the Braves' front office and
perhaps win back a spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go out and win the game,'' Chen said. ``As much
as I'd like to show everyone I'm ready, I don't want to try too
hard.... It's definitely an opportunity. But I can't say this will
determine the outcome of my future. It's not the most important
start of my life. I'll go out and try to continue what I did in
Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen was 3-2 with a 2.30 earned run average at Richmond, and was
dominating there except for one start when he gave up seven runs.
Otherwise, his ERA was 1.10. He said he discovered a flaw in his
delivery that he has corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was among the last to get the word that he was being
recalled, and his Richmond coaches and teammates used that to get a
good laugh at his expense Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had sent word that Chen was to throw only 30 pitches
in his start Monday night so he'd be well rested for tonight's
start.
</P>
<P>
   Chen threw a 1-2-3 first inning with one strikeout and saw
teammate Ismael Villegas warming up in the bullpen. He pitched
another 1-2-3 inning, this time with two strikeouts, and then saw
Richmond pitching coach Bill Fischer signal for Villegas to come in
the game.
</P>

   Javy Lopez entered Thursday night's game with a .303 batting
average, highest among the regulars, but he wasn't happy with the
way he's been hitting.

   ``I'm not concentrating the way I want to,'' Lopez said. ``Even
before my mom died I wasn't feeling good at the plate. I wasn't
feeling good when I came back (after a week off). My mom was part
of the reason, but not the reason. I don't want people to think the
reason I'm doing bad is because I'm thinking of her, because I'm
always thinking of her.''

   IN ISRAEL, JOURNALISTS OUT FOR BLOOD. If you think the American
press is tough on politicians, think again, suggests columnist Bill
Maxwell, on assignment in the Middle East. The hard-hitting,
focused commentary in Israel's leading media outlets, conservative
and liberal alike, he reports, makes that of most of their American
counterparts read like sophomoric peregrinations. ``Israeli opinion
writers do not need a cause celebre, either an issue or an event or
a person, to go for the jugular,'' he writes. ``Serving a
news-addicted, navel-gazing readership, they employ, among other
journalistic devices, the scalpel, the rapier and the blunt
instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN SPRING: A TIME FOR NEW BEGINNINGS. When the first buds
appear on the trees, there is a stirring in Indian hearts, muses
columnist Tim Giago. ``Our Lakota ancestors used to hold religious
ceremonies to welcome the spring, and in the Lakota camps warriors
and women prepared their weapons and cooking utensils for the
buffalo hunts about to begin,'' he writes. This is a ritual that
took place for thousands of years, he says, ``and I believe today
it is still a part of the subconscious mind of every Lakota child,
as it has been through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE 2000. The same mentality that brought
California the controversial and divisive Proposition 187 in 1994
is preparing a new initiative for the state-wide ballot next March
(2000) that would convert local cops into immigration officers,
reports columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``That will unleash
traffic cops, park rangers, meter maids, State Treasury messengers,
and part-time constables into every nook and cranny of California
to search for people illegally in the country,'' he writes. And you
can bet they won't be looking for blue-eyed blonde types, either,
he adds.

   COMPUTER SKILLS FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS. Visitors to the Web site
for Computers in Our Future (CIOF) in Santa Barbara, California,
are greeted with this stark factoid: 60 percent of new jobs next
year will require computer skills that only 22 percent of workers
now have. But an ambitious program at CIOF is helping low-income
workers gain valuable job skills that could turn this situation
around. Created to foster computer literacy among the poor, this
modest classroom-size education center has already helped more than
2,000 people in its first year of operation, writes Tim Dougherty
in Hispanic Business.

<P>
   WEST `DISCOVERS' EASTERN MEDICINE. Traditional Asian medicine
appears to be undergoing a popular rebirth in the United States.
Vinita Srivastava, in A. Magazine, examines the West's
``discovery'' of age-old Eastern healing traditions. ``Migration
and shifting public perception may be chipping away at the pariah
status of traditional Asian medicine,'' she writes, ``but
disagreements over the validity of Asian therapies continue to
ensnare governments, major corporations, environmental activists _
and desperate patients looking for cures.''

 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He

 &HT;    
 &HT;    HAIFA, Israel _ If you think the American press is tough on
politicians, well, think again. The hard-hitting, focused
commentary in Israel's leading media outlets, conservative and
liberal alike, makes that of most of their American counterparts
read like sophomoric peregrinations.
 &HT;    Sure, many American commentators fancy themselves as having been
rough on Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky saga. But that was
a rarity, even in these times of gotcha journalism in the United
States, and the press has calmed down.
 &HT;    Israeli opinion writers, however, do not need a cause celebre,
either an issue or an event or a person, to go for the jugular.
Serving a news-addicted, navel-gazing readership, they are on
journalistic steroids, employing, among other devices, the scalpel,
the rapier and the blunt instrument. They use satire, innuendo,
conceit, parable, Scripture, myth, aphorism, hyperbole,
understatement, allegory, ad hominem. They are as hardy and as
independent and as unapologetic as the half-century-old nation
itself.
 &HT;    I began to appreciate these traits anew when, upon arriving in
Israel on May 4, I read the English edition of Ha'aretz, which
calls itself ``Israel's leading daily newspaper.''
 &HT;    As each paragraph from Ha'aretz's ``Opinion &AMP; Comment'' section
stalked its prey, I thought of lawmakers back home who squeal like
stuck pigs when editorial writers and columnists home in on their
policies and character flaws.
 &HT;    Following are comments from Ha'aretz that attacked Prime
Minister Benjamin ``Bibi'' Netanyahu, the publication's favorite
Likud target (and who, as we now know, failed to retain his job,
losing in this week's elections):
 &HT;    ``Bibi, who has never told Clinton the truth and has broken all
his promises to him, is regarded by the U.S. president as a lying
cheat. ... Under his regime, corruption has received official
protection, intrigues have become a style of government, truth has
become falsehood and falsehood truth. No politicians, especially
the members of his own camp, believe a word he says, and all his
friends have abandoned him.''
 &HT;    ``There are some people with names like Rivlin and Netanyahu,
but the connection with their illustrious fathers disappeared long
ago. They are true rabble, vulgar people without dignity or depth,
liars and impostors with the aspirations of hooligans and
mafioso.''
 &HT;    How many American editors would let their columnists write
similarly of a powerful official?
 &HT;    Here is more:
 &HT;    ``Bibi cannot cite any achievement in his three years of office.
He has been exposed as a charlatan, and an incompetent one at that.
He has neither initiated nor completed any task. He has turned the
clocks back, so once again the whole world is against us. When his
name is mentioned in Washington, the chiefs of the Clinton
administration stop up their ears.''
 &HT;    ``Bibi has been a prime minister without a map, without a plan,
and _ principally _ without talent. He has functioned not as a
prime minister but rather as the terminator of the culture of
ethical government.''
 &HT;    ``Bibi has restored norms that we long ago discarded, rekindled
the flame of ethnic hatred, and widened the gap between secular and
religious Israeli Jews. He has turned ethnic groups against one
another and social groups against one another and has exacerbated
social conflicts.''
 &HT;    I could not resist a few comments in the Jerusalem Post, an
English language magazine, from a roundup of the election:
 &HT;    ``What was billed as a battle between two dashing leading men,
Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, has become the showcase for
character actors. According to the polls, (and confirmed by this
week's elections) this year's Oscar will go to Barak. If it does,
he'll owe the prize to, among others, a hoodlum rabbi, an
ex-barroom bouncer, a snake handler, a professional grump and a
most reluctant Russian.''
 &HT;    ``Enter the supporting players, starting with Aryeh Deri. A
convicted felon and leader of the Sephardi ultra-Orthodox party,
Shas, he has started a nasty vendetta against the legal system that
sentenced him to four years in prison. His supporters see him as a
modern-day Dreyfus, but to the rest of the country he's nothing
more than a crook and a sorehead.''
 &HT;    ``Next comes Avigdor Lieberman, the beetle-browed brawler and
former Bibi aide who has founded his own political party.
Lieberman, who is under more-or-less continuous criminal
investigation, is running against the police, giving his candidacy
a Capone-like aura.''
 &HT;    So, the next time I hear one of my U.S. colleagues crow about
his organization's hard-hitting commentary, I will walk away.
Israeli journalists, whom I admire, refuse to give politicians any
respite _ on any day. Civility has not entered the lexicon of
Israel's press.

INDIAN SPRING: A TIME FOR NEW BEGINNINGS

 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian
name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When the first buds on the trees opened into the green leaves of
spring, there was an air of excitement among the boys and girls at
the Holy Rosary Mission boarding school on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation in South Dakota.
 &HT;    Perhaps the stirring in our hearts was inherited from our Lakota
ancestors who would hold religious ceremonies to welcome the
spring. There would be joy and anticipation in the Lakota camps as
the warriors and women prepared their weapons and cooking utensils
for the buffalo hunts about to begin.
 &HT;    The cold and oftentimes bitter winter was behind them and the
Lakota prepared to move from their winter camps to their favorite
hunting grounds. This is a ritual that took place for thousands of
years and I believe it was a part of the subconscious mind of every
Lakota child through the generations.
 &HT;    At the mission school it also meant that school was about to let
out.
 &HT;    For nine months we had been virtual captives at the mission. We
attended classes, went to church services seven-days-a-week, and
ate the nearly inedible meals in the school dining halls. We ate so
much yellow, cornmeal mush that our opponents at sporting events
posted banners that read, ``Crush the Mush.''
 &HT;    During the year some of us worked in the farm and dairy units
for Brother Bauer. Some worked in the cobbler and carpentry shops
for Brother Gross. Others worked with the blacksmith, Brother Eban.
And the lucky ones worked with the school baker, Brother Sier.
 &HT;    I worked with the coach; a Lakota man named Bob Clifford was the
school barber. On Sunday nights when the movies were shown in the
school gym, Chuck ``Wobbie'' Trimble and I made the popcorn, bagged
it, and then sold it at the movie concession stand. Of course, we
tried to sneak as many mouthfuls as possible without being caught
by the Jesuit prefect, Mr. Bryde.
 &HT;    So for nine months we went to school, went to church, went to
our jobs and watched for the first signs of spring. When it finally
arrived it was like a miracle.
 &HT;    Early in the morning of the day school let out, we gathered with
our meager belongings and waited in front of Red Cloud Hall for our
parents in the caravans of cars and wagons that would soon be
arriving to take us far away from Holy Rosary Mission.
 &HT;    My cousins Frosty, Pat and Heavy Garnette lived at Potato Creek
(we called it Spud Creek) just a short distance from my home at
Kyle in the center of the reservation. My friends Bill and Johnny
Bear and Dutchie Apple also lived in Kyle and we would talk
excitedly about spending those long, hot summer days fishing and
swimming in Kyle Dam as we waited impatiently for our mothers and
fathers to arrive.
 &HT;    We watched with happiness _ and fear _ as each car made the turn
onto the school grounds from Mission Flats. We were happy because
we knew we were going home but a little frightened that perhaps our
parents had forgotten us. As we spotted our family cars we heaved a
great sigh of relief.
 &HT;    To this day I feel a flutter in my heart and there is a gleam in
my eye when the first leaves of summer appear on the trees. It is a
time for new beginnings.

IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE 2000

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS

radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the black-and-white patrol cars of Anycity, California, leave
their stations, observers can note that the town will be well
patrolled by the men and women of the police force.
 &HT;    That may change if a bunch of radicals in Los Angeles get their
way on the state-wide ballot next March (2000). They would convert
local cops into immigration officers.
 &HT;    A crime wave of tsunami proportions could hit the state when
local police officers pretend to be immigration cops. As they waste
their time hassling people who look ``Mexican,'' actual criminals
will run amok on copless streets.
 &HT;    The same mentality that brought us the controversial and
divisive Proposition 187 in 1994 is preparing this new initiative
that will unleash traffic cops, park rangers, meter maids, State
Treasury messengers, and part-time constables into every nook and
cranny of California to search for people illegally in the country.
 &HT;    The proposed title of the initiative: The Local Immigration
Officer Training Act. It would mandate that local/state laws and
policies prohibiting ``cooperation'' between local and state law
enforcement agencies will be by-passed by this Act and such
agencies ``shall provide full cooperation to peace officers in the
performance of immigration law enforcement functions pursuant to an
agreement under'' the U.S. Code.
 &HT;    Under this Act, for example, will a Hispanic legally in the
country report a crime if the victim may be in the country
illegally? Will predator criminals intentionally target illegal
aliens as victims knowing they will not report the crime for fear
that the beat cop will be more concerned about legal residency than
the robbery, burglary, assault, or rape?
 &HT;    Supporting the proposed act is a cabal of anti-immigrant,
anti-Mexican activists. They are the usual suspects. Among the
usual suspects, Los Angeles conservative blacks. This is done to
convince the media and the general public that the sponsors of the
proposed Act are not radical White Supremacists, but rather
inter-racial community minded people who have positive goals. They
fall short, however, when one reads the ``Findings and
Declarations'' of the proposed Act.
 &HT;    Remember, these sponsors are not sociologists, law-enforcement
professionals, elected officials, community organizers. In many
cases they aren't even educated people. They cite no studies, nor
community experience, only their own views _ and gigantic
gratuitous assertions. The following is a sample:
 &HT;    ``Section 1. Findings and Declaration. The People of California
find and declare: That the federal government's enforcement of the
United States immigration laws has failed to prevent millions of
aliens from unlawfully entering California and taking up residence
within the State; That the unlawful presence of millions of aliens
imposes intolerable burdens on California public schools, public
health resources, and other state and local government services and
facilities and fosters a climate of lawlessness that threatens
social peace and stability.''
 &HT;    There is no ``climate of lawlessness'' in California. Are there
``millions of aliens'' in California who have ``unlawfully''
entered the state and taken up ``residence?'' No! No one knows how
many illegals there are, though the Census and Immigration
officials estimate somewhat over 5 million illegal aliens of all
nationalities in the entire country.
 &HT;    The assertions that ``millions'' of illegals are creatinga
``climate of lawlessness'' do not compute with plunging crime rates
all over the state including the inner-cities.
 &HT;    And who will the cops stop?
 &HT;    Don't be fooled by the local pro-immigration-cop proposal. The
proponents will insist the proposal is aimed at all illegal aliens,
not just Mexicans. But everyone knows that is not so.
 &HT;    Will cops stop blonde, blue-eyed people to check if they are
illegal Canadians among us? There are hundreds of thousands of such
illegals living and working in California. Will cops bother them?
No.
 &HT;    Cops will stop everyone who looks Mexican. Every such person
will have to carry proof of citizenship and legal residency.
Imagine, we _ and I _ will have to satisfy cops as to whether we
are living here legally. I won't have to do that in New York, or
Texas, or New Hampshire, just in California.
 &HT;    So, here come police checkpoints, warrantless searches and
midnight raids. People who don't look Mexican won't be
inconvenienced, this time.
 &HT;    But, what about next time?

 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Visitors to the Web site for Computers in Our Future (CIOF) in
Santa Barbara, California, are greeted with this stark factoid: 60
percent of new jobs next year will require computer skills that
only 22 percent of workers now have.
 &HT;    The bad news doesn't end there. The page goes on to tell of an
inequity that lies at the heart of CIOF's raison d'etre: Just 4
percent of U.S. families earning $20,000 or less own a computer
compared to 66 percent of those earning more than $50,000.
 &HT;    Fortunately, developments at the Santa Barbara CIOF facility
itself have been more encouraging. Created to foster computer
literacy among low-income individuals, this modest classroom-size
education center has already helped more than 2,000 people in its
first year of operation.
 &HT;    ``The numbers are better than we ever thought possible. We're
already talking about expanding,'' exclaims John Romo,
vice-president of continuing education for Santa Barbara City
College (SBCC), a partner in the program.
 &HT;    One of 11 such sites across the state funded in part with grants
from the California Wellness Foundation, Santa Barbara's CIOF is
unique in terms of its size and, some organizers would say,
success. Housed at an area community center, it is outfitted with
20 computer terminals where neighborhood residents can learn basic
office applications and Internet navigation, both in a formal
classroom setting and during open access hours.
 &HT;    According to Romo, the center came by its comparatively large
compliment of computers (it's the state's largest CIOF site)
through corporate sponsorship and partnerships with local education
agencies such as SBCC and the area high school district.
 &HT;    If they differ in terms of size and resources, though, all CIOF
sites work from the same premise: computer know-how is the key to
professional advancement.
 &HT;    Data to support the assertion are not hard to find. The top
three job categories in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics'
Occupational Outlook Handbook, for instance, are all
computer-related: database administrator, computer engineer, and
systems analyst in descending order. Perhaps in recognition of the
trend, 30 percent of Hispanic households now own a computer, up
from 13 percent in 1994, a recent report by the Tomas Rivera Policy
Institute found.
 &HT;    ``We see it as a public health issue, the thinking being that
people who are computer literate will likely be able to better
provide for themselves and their families,'' says Gary L. Yates,
president and CEO of the California Wellness Foundation.
 &HT;    Established in 1992, the private foundation provides grants for
health promotion, wellness education, and disease prevention.
 &HT;    Because the CIOF program targets low-income individuals,
cultural sensitivity is an important concern. In Santa Barbara
classes are taught in English and Spanish. Care is also taken so
participants are not overwhelmed by the subject matter.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about people who have never had access to
computers, at home or through work,'' says Jose Martinez, director
of the Santa Barbara CIOF.
 &HT;    Though the program is aimed primarily at youth and young adults
age 14-23, in the case of Santa Barbara's site at least, a
concerted effort is made to involve parents and other community
members as well. This has made for more than a few instances of
children teaching adults, according to Martinez.
 &HT;    Of course, success tends to beget expansion pressures, and such
has been the case in Santa Barbara. Waiting lists for the center's
computers are becoming increasingly common, and newly added classes
fill quickly. Romo says he's begun exploring partnerships with
other community groups to open other CIOF sites in the community.
 &HT;    In the short term, however, the Santa Barbara CIOF site will
likely have to content itself with its original constituency, which
suits administrators fine. They've just begun tracking the progress
of people who have passed through the program, and initial
indications have been very positive.
 &HT;    In a program to be continued this summer, for example, Santa
Barbara's CIOF recently hosted 43 at-risk students for six weeks of
instruction in Web page development and computer maintenance.
Participants were required to sell Web site concepts to local
businesses before designing and posting them on the Internet. At
the end of the program, many students received job offers and
others are eligible to become certified technicians.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen of them already have jobs in technology-related
fields. It's incredible!'' says Martinez.

 &HT;    In 1983, my grandmother was suffering from heart disease in an
overcrowded hospital in Mumbai (then Bombay). She was flown to New
York City, where my aunt, an M.D., made sure she had the best
treatment options of Western medicine.
 &HT;    While Bibiji, as my grandmother is called, placed her faith in
the Western medicine that saved her life, she also continued to
rely on the spices and healing cures that came from her world,
using huldi (turmeric) for cuts, and chyawanprash, an herbal
supplement for strength used in the Aryuvedic healing system of
South Asia.
 &HT;    My doctor aunt wanted my grandmother off those old traditional
remedies that she believed interfered with the Monday through
Sunday pill regimen. But Bibiji defied my aunt and relied on her
years of experience, opening plastic bags of mixed powders and jars
of black jam and taking spoonfuls anyway. Very good, she said, this
is very good.
 &HT;    In the private arena of my grandmother's sickness, two vastly
different systems of healing collided. The holistic approach toward
health _ a balance of exercise, herbal supplements and spiritual
well-being _ is the cornerstone of traditional Asian medicine. And
``alternative'' methods such as acupuncture and Aryuvedic sound
therapy (chanting) have withstood the test of centuries.
 &HT;    But while some Western doctors have begun to research and
integrate Asian techniques in their own practices, the attitude of
the U.S. medical establishment toward these healing models has
until recently been one of stubborn resistance _ rooted in a
complicated matrix of colonialism, ignorance and the efficacy of
scientific discoveries like the MRI and penicillin.
 &HT;    Migration and shifting public perception may be chipping away at
the pariah status of traditional Asian medicine, but disagreements
over the validity of Asian therapies continue to ensnare
governments, major corporations, environmental activists and
desperate patients looking for cures. Traditional Asian medicine
can split families, produce miracles or cause tragedy, depending on
your perspective.
 &HT;    Karna Singh first learned of alternatives to Western medicine
when his brother Gora, a dancer, was diagnosed with AIDS in 1993.
Karna watched the toxic side effects of prescription drugs weaken
Gora's already frail condition and decided to research other
options. Gora gave up on the drugs and went the herbal way, and
Karna saw him dance again. But the doctor, who did not know about
the dancer's herbal turn, encouraged him to try the new
pharmaceutical cocktails. When Gora went back on the drugs, his
condition deteriorated. He died in 1997, leaving Karna to campaign
for HMO coverage of alternative healing.
 &HT;    Some insurance companies and HMOs, including Oxford, Blue
Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna Health Management and Travelers, are
starting to cover alternative therapies, but policies still depend
to a large extent on state laws. Washington state passed a law in
1996 requiring insurers to pay for visits to any certified,
licensed health care provider within the state. And alternative
health plans are available in Arizona, California, Colorado,
Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wisconsin.
 &HT;    Moreover, there are active lobbies all over the country pressing
for a fundamental change in the predominant health care paradigm.
``The question of health goes way beyond a tablet or an
injection,'' says Singh. ``We have to get into the whole way of
life. It's about how we do things.''
 &HT;    It seems public opinion is behind him. In a special issue
dedicated to alternative medicine, the Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA) reported in November that approximately
83 million (one-third of all Americans) have used some form of
herbal medication and that visits to ``alternative practitioners''
increased by 50 percent between 1990 to 1997.
 &HT;    A stream of recent news reports has interpreted the trend as
part of the ``green'' movement, a backlash against the
chemical-industrial-technological character of life in the United
States. At the heart of it all is the realization that there are
aspects to illness, both emotional and spiritual, that have not
been adequately addressed by Western medicine.
 &HT;    Despite the growing interest in ``alternative medicine,'' many
traditional Asian healing methods still carry a certain stigma that
confines them to a perennial gray area. Less than 40 percent of
those who use alternative therapies inform their medical doctors,
according to JAMA. And payment for alternative treatment most often
comes out of pocket.
 &HT;    In contrast to the ``quack'' stereotype, however, acupuncturists
and herbologists must undergo a lengthy training period in order to
practice legally. In the United States, hopeful practitioners study
for three to four years before taking the certification exam of the
National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncture and
Oriental Medicine (given in English, Chinese or Korean). In
addition, most states have their own licensing requirements.
Training in Asian countries is even more rigorous _in China, for
example, it includes five years of study plus a minimum of three
years as an apprentice.
 &HT;    Traditional Asian techniques have an impressive track record
with chronic conditions, often prevailing where Western medicine
has failed. Rui Lian He, an acupuncturist and herbologist
specializing in infertility problems, has some patients who travel
to her Brooklyn, New York office from as far away as Connecticut
and Tennessee because of the success of her treatments.
 &HT;    One of her patients, a 27-year-old New York City schoolteacher
named Vaughn Maloney, said he suffered from debilitating back pain
three years ago. Sitting, getting up and climbing stairs caused
searing pain, but Maloney's doctor told him there was nothing
wrong. A friend referred him to He, who prescribed a combination of
herbs to clear up a ``blockage of energy,'' and he has felt no back
pain since. ``She uses preventative measures,'' says Maloney. ``I
have a regular doctor, but I don't go to him anymore.''
 &HT;    Anecdotal evidence abounds attesting to the capacity of
traditional Asian therapies to heal chronic conditions such as
asthma, allergies and back pain. And the JAMA report includes
studies demonstrating the efficacy of various traditional Asian
therapies in correcting breech position in late pregnancy,
relieving irritable bowel symptoms and healing some symptoms of
carpal tunnel syndrome.
 &HT;    Regulatory bureaucracies, however, have been slow to respond to
the trend. Popular remedies like ginseng and goldenseal cannot be
sold as medicine but as ``dietary supplements,'' because they
cannot make medical claims without the approval of the Food and
Drug Administration. If someone wants to sell a product for
medicinal purposes, they must first apply for a new drug
application _ a process that requires regulation testing and costs
millions of dollars. And that does not include the money needed for
clinical trials.
 &HT;    In fact, 25 percent of all pharmaceuticals on the market are
derived from natural remedies. Aspirin, the birth control pill,
certain heart medications and some cancer drugs all come from
herbal derivatives. Many in the medical establishment believe the
expensive research behind these pharmaceuticals is absolutely
necessary. ``Those remedies have all been rigorously tested,'' says
Dr. Anita Srivastava, a family and community physician at Women's
College Hospital in Toronto (and sister of the author).
 &HT;    ``I don't have anything against natural remedies, but I resent
people who assume pharmaceutical companies are evil, doing harm.
Just because something is natural does not mean it is not harmful.
People who make herbal products are out to make a buck. Just like
the pharmaceuticals,'' says Srivastava, coming off her emergency
room shift. ``I had to use forceps tonight to pull a clove of
garlic from a woman's ear. She said it cured congestion, which is
maybe true, but she has to do it safely. With a pharmaceutical you
get the same thing every time.''
 &HT;    Much of the recent media hype surrounding herbal medicine has
fixated on this ``Wild West'' atmosphere in which American
consumers are trying out herbs without being informed about the
proper dosage and potentialy negative side effects. This goes very
much against the traditional Asian approach, in which herbology is
considered an exact science.
 &HT;    ``Every herb can be dangerous if you take too much,'' warns He.
She says it is important for those taking herbs to do so under the
supervision of an herbologist who knows how to combine herbs to
counterbalance negative effects.
 &HT;    These days, popular interest in traditional Asian therapies is
bringing medical philosophy full-circle. ``Germany and the United
States are recapturing folk medicine _ whether it's African,
aboriginal, Aruyvedic or Chinese,'' says Singh. ``e trailing behind
the Western realization that these (old techniques) have answers.''
 &HT;    Asian and Western medical theories have traversed the globe so
much that while some research firms predict the U.S. herbal
medicine market could reach $12.3 billion by 2001, Chinese exports
now account for o world's $15 billion market in herbal products.
Even within China, traditional medicine sales are sagging due to
the increased reliance on Western pharmaceuticals.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, major U.S. pharmaceutical corporations, with brand
names like Bayer, Centrum and Benadryl, have begun to market their
own herbal supplements. The presence of these corporate giants in
the herbal world (praised by some as a development that will rid
the market of snake-oil-peddling charlatans) is likely to crush
mom-and-pop herb companies. For American consumers unfamiliar with
Chinese or Hindi labels, buying herbs with a popular brand name
bolstered by millions of marketing dollars, seems a safer bet. Even
Wal-mart is introducing its own line of herbal supplements.
 &HT;    Dr. Deepak Chopra, who went to medical school in India and once
worked a $101-per-week job in Plainfield, New Jersey, is one of the
few successfully making a fortune in the West off of things Indian.
Sales of Chopra's books, in which he simplifies ancient Hindu texts
and philosphies for the American masses, have soard past the 10
million mark.
 &HT;    Despite his stunning popularity and colossal book sales,
however, this Buddha of Surburbia has been mocked by mainstream
medicine as an Indian guru and a throwback to the Beatles' yoga
days. The National Council Against Health Fraud has accused him of
substituting superstition for medicine. And in 1991, JAMA printed
an article that so offended Chopra that he took them to court for
mocking his beliefs (the suit was settled out of court for an
undisclosed amount).
 &HT;    The spiritual emphasis of the holistic approach in Asian
medicine is one reason for its growing popularity. Unlike the
Western approach of isolating the problem in order to cure it,
Asian therapies are based on a `full body' approach that places
some of the power and responsibility in the hands of the sick
themselves.
 &HT;    The key component of Asian healing systems is not cellular
biology but the human energy field, called qi in China, kuna in
Hawaii and prana in India. East Asian healing practices, typfied by
the Chinese system, seek to regulate qi with herbs and treatments
such as acupunture. And Aryuveda balances prana through the
relationship between food (seen as medicine), body, mind and
spirit. Both these systems say good health is all-encompassing, and
they require a full relationship with the body, mind, and spirit
 &HT;    Dr. R. Zhu, a traditional Chinese doctor trained in herbology
and acupuncture with a practice in Manhattan's Chinatown, says he
chose Chinese medicine over Western because he believes they are
less toxic. Zhu comes from generations of herbologists and still
uses family secrets to treat patients. His rates are cheaper than a
visit to an M.D., with a sliding scale ranging from $20 for a minor
prescription to $40 for more involved treatments. Although Zhu
admits that when he is unable to treat a sick person, he sends them
to the hospital, his medicine is the preferred route to health in
Chinatown.
 &HT;    While practitioners of Asian medicine have readily acknowledged
the strength of Western medical science in treating acute,
life-threatening conditions, the U.S. medical establishment has f
acupuncture's capacity to heal over 43 disorders, including
sinusitis and addictions.
 &HT;    There are other signs that Asian and Western medical
philosophies may be coming together. In China, doctors trained in
Western medicine work alongside acupunturists and herbologists, and
acupunture is often used as a natural (and cost-effective)
substitute for anaesthesia in minor surgeries.
 &HT;    In the United States, practicing M.D.s are taking abbreviated
training courses in traditional Asian therapies, according to the
American Association of Oriental Medicine. And the FDA passed the
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994, allowing
companies to make some health claims on their products.
 &HT;    The change has its limits, however, according to Elizabeth
Carstens, the marketing manager of Nature Care (the company is the
U.S. distributor for Dabur India, the oldest and largest
manufacturer of Aryuvedic products). Although Dabur India has been
researching Aryuvedic products for 116 years, holding clinical
trials at their Research Foundation in New Delhi, India, ``We
(still) cannot make disease claims,'' says Carstens. ``For example,
you can say something supports the joints but not that it is used
to treat arthritis. And we can't have `medicine' anywhere on our
product, and others pass on Asian healing methods, disparate
approaches to health are slowly beginning to move together. Western
society wants easy and fast answers, Dr. Zhu says. But healing
oneself takes time, and one must swallow the bitter herbs day after
day.

<P>
   PSSST! Wanna buy a nice old car _ cheap? The Post Office has
some Model T Fords, half a Gatsby-era limo and some well-finned
1950s models including a turquoise '57 Chevrolet Bel Air cream
puff, all going for 32 or 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you would settle for a stylized hood ornament _ pretend
it's from a Rolls-Royce _ for just 10 cents. The ultimate tailfin
of the '50s, from the classic '59 Cadillac, is just 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service is issuing sheets of ``Celebrate the
Century'' stamps, 15 for each decade, with each stamp highlighting
a different bit of history. Stamps for the next decade to be
celebrated, the 1950s, come out on Wednesday with three automotive
motifs: the aforementioned Bel Air as a paean to ``Tail Fins and
Chrome,'' plus drive-in movies and stock-car racing. The stock-car
stamp features another '57 Chevy, along with a '59.
</P>
<P>
   An automotive theme has been threaded throughout the series.
There was a Model T Ford for the 1900s and a Gatsby limo, sort of a
composite Duesenberg, for the 20s. The Ford Mustang is next to
arrive, in August, on the 1960s sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The topics have been chosen by popular vote, with mail-in
ballots at every post office and an electronic ballot at the Postal
Service's Web site (http://www.usps.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there were no automotive topics chosen for the 1970s _ the
decade of fuel crises was not a stellar period for car design. For
the 1980s, minivans ran 21st in a field of 25 possibilities,
defeated by Cabbage Patch dolls and four electronic-oriented
categories. (Video games got the most votes.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that an automotive stamp will make the 1990s
series, however; sport utility vehicles are on the current ballot.
</P>
<P>
   If they fail to make the cut, hobbyists can just settle for
those 10-cent hood ornaments and 15-cent Cadillac fins. But they
appear on coil stamps used for advertising mail, so a special
permit is needed to use them on your subscription renewal for Car
and Driver.

BETTY ROBINSON, TRACK'S FIRST FEMALE GOLD MEDALIST, DIES AT 87 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ill., The Netherlands, Canada, Germany)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty Robinson Schwartz, who in 1928 as a 16-year-old high
school junior became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal
in track and field, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Richard Schwartz Jr. of Denver, told The Chicago
Tribune she had suffered from cancer and Alzheimer's disease in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's life story _ which included prodigious athletic
glory, a life-threatening accident and an amazing Olympic comeback
_ sounded like the product of an overimaginative screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth ``Babe'' Robinson was born Aug. 23, 1911, in
Riverdale, Ill., a small town south of Chicago. Her career started
when a high school teacher and assistant track coach in Harvey,
Ill., saw her running for a commuter train (the legend is that she
caught it). She later ran 50 yards for him in a school corridor,
and a track career began.
</P>
<P>
   These were the nascent days of organized women's track and field
at the national level. As she told The Los Angeles Times in 1984:
``I had no idea that women even ran then. I grew up a hick. That is
when I found out that they actually had track meets for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after being discovered, Robinson made her racing
debut in a regional meet and finished second to Helen Filkey, the
U.S. record-holder at 100 meters. In her next meet, the
Chicago-area Olympic trials, she equaled the world record of 12.0
seconds (the current world record is 10.49, set by Florence
Griffith Joyner in 1988). In her third meet, the U.S. final trials
in Newark, N.J., she finished second and made the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, the year Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly
across the Atlantic, female track and field athletes were allowed
to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The 1928 Amsterdam
Games would mark the fourth meet of Robinson's career, just four
months after she took up the sport at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   A week after qualifying for the Olympics, she and her teammates
sailed to Amsterdam and worked out on a quarter-mile linoleum track
laid around the ship's deck. In Amsterdam, she finished second in
her trial heat and first in her semifinal and became the only
American to reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was close in the finals, and the judges declared
Robinson the winner over the favored Fanny Rosenfeld of Canada in
an official time of 12.2. Because the 100-meter race was the first
of five women's track and field events at the 1928 Games, Robinson
had won the first gold medal handed out in her sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the flag went up after the race,'' she said, ``I started
crying like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld and her Canadian teammates later defeated Robinson and
the American team in the 4x100-meter relay, with the U.S. team
taking the silver.
</P>
<P>
   After Robinson won the gold, Douglas MacArthur, then the
president of the American Olympic Committee, presented her with a
small gold charm shaped like the world. When she returned home, she
was honored by ticker-tape parades down Broadway in New York and
State Street in Chicago. In her hometown, she received a diamond
watch from an adoring public and a silver cup from her high school.
</P>
<P>
   She was still a world-class athlete when a biplane she was
riding in with her cousin crashed near Chicago in 1931. Both
survived, but Robinson spent 11 weeks in a hospital with severe
head injuries and a broken leg and arm. A silver rod and pin were
inserted to stabilize the leg, which was placed in a hip-to-heel
cast. For four months, she was in a wheelchair or on crutches, and
the leg became a half-inch shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not been in such good physical condition,'' she said,
``I would not have lived through it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, she was out of competition for three and a half
years. When she tried a comeback in 1936, she could not bend a
knee, so she had to make a standing rather than a crouching start
in the 100 meters. Still, she made the Olympic relay team, along
with Harriet Bland, Annette Rogers and Helen Stephens. This time in
Berlin, the American team _ with Robinson running the third leg _
captured the gold when a member of the record-setting German team
fumbled the baton pass before the last handoff. Robinson had
completed an improbable comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, she married Richard S. Schwartz, who owned an
upholstery firm. They had two children.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son, she is survived by her daughter, Jane Hamilton
of Denver, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Her career included world records at 50, 60, 70 and 100 yards.
She was inducted into the National Track and Field, the U.S. Track
and Field and the Helms Halls of Fame. After she stopped running,
she was a coach, timer and public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   She never received the publicity and public adulation of such
American successors as Babe Didrikson, Wilma Rudolph and Griffith
Joyner. Years after her Olympic triumphs, she said: ``I suppose
most Americans don't even recognize me. It happened so long ago I
still can't believe the attention I get for something I did so long
ago.''

HOUSE COMMITTEE CONCLUDES CHINA STOLE NUCLEAR SECRETS, OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs 5th and 6th graphs to note activities may have taken
place in previous administrations; 10th and 12th graph to clarify;
14th graph to correct day of briefing; 20th graph to add first
reference to Federico Pena)

 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee has unanimously concluded that
China systematically stole significant U.S. nuclear design secrets,
enabling Beijing to accelerate its weapons program so that it now
possesses thermonuclear weapons design information on a par with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report will be released next week, but this
summary came Thursday from officials who have read the committee's
final report or heard its findings in a closed Senate briefing on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen technology has allowed Beijing in a few years to leap
from a 1950s-era nuclear capability to possessing the most modern
technical information, the officials said. China vehemently denies
the accusations of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who attended the closed briefing, which was conducted
by Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said
the findings were deeply disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials who have been briefed about its contents,
the report concludes that Beijing's acquisition of secret U.S.
weapons designs was part of an intelligence collection effort that
spanned 20 years, including both Republican and Democratic
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report also enumerates an array of thefts from the
government's weapons labs, including classified information about
seven advanced nuclear warheads, among them the W-88, the most
sophisticated nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal; that theft is
believed to have occurred during the Reagan or Bush administration.
The report also says that China stole design information about the
neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that after
listening to the briefing Wednesday about Chinese espionage, ``the
hair on the back of my neck stood up because it's scary.'' The
Mississippi Republican added, ``I haven't seen anything like it
before in my 26 years in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Building and deploying a nuclear weapons system requires more
than the design information, but such data is among the most
closely of American military secrets. Lott questioned why President
Clinton and his administration didn't act sooner to prevent
security breaches and he criticized the White House for delaying
the release of the Cox committee report.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said, ``Senator Lott's
comments are mystifying given the fact that Chairman Cox has said
we've been working cooperatively with the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the Energy Department and the Central Intelligence
Agency began to learn the record of China's alleged espionage. But
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were not personally
told of the findings until much later, officials said. On Thursday,
at a Senate hearing, Energy Department documents were released
showing that Gore's office was told by Energy Department officials
early on, at least in 1996 and possibly in 1995, about the first
indications of Chinese espionage at U.S. weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's national security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, was briefed in
April 1996, according to testimony before the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee by Notra Trulock, an Energy Department
intelligence official. This came about the same time the
president's deputy national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was
first told about China's spying.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosshirt, a foreign affairs spokesman for Gore, said
Thursday that Fuerth has no recollection or record of a 1995
briefing. He confirmed the 1996 briefing but said that Fuerth
waited until last March to tell the vice president about China's
alleged espionage, shortly after news accounts of the spying
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Berger did not speak with the president about Chinese spying for
at least a year, telling the Cox committee that it was in early
1998. Berger's aides now say he remembers informing Clinton in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's briefing by both Cox and Dicks was an unusual
display of bipartisanship at a time when Congress has been riven
over issues ranging from gun control to Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the Cox report reflect the unanimous conclusions
of both Republicans and Democrats on the House committee, which has
spent months investigating allegations of Chinese espionage. Some
of the committee's findings remain classified and will not be
included in the report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or Secretary of Commerce
William Daley were not briefed by the Energy Department on the
allegations until the end of last year, when the Cox committee
finished its report, officials said. Since the first of the year,
the committee and officials in the administration have been
laboring intensively to figure out which portions of the report
could be declassified, but according to Cox the effort did not
quicken until March.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has said that about 30 percent of the committee's findings
will remain secret due to concerns by intelligence and law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he acted quickly upon learning of the
espionage threat at the government's weapons labs, ordering a
series of tightened security measures in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Trulock, a top intelligence official at the Energy
Department, told the Senate committee Thursday that some White
House officials and senior Energy Department officials did not act
expeditiously on the information that he and his aides brought to
them in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, who took over the leadership of the Energy
Department from Federico Pena in the fall of 1998, has enacted a
far-reaching reorganization, especially in recent months since the
completion of the Cox committee report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my appointment as secretary of energy, no mission has
been more important to me than improved counterintelligence and
security at the Department's national laboratories,'' he told the
House Committee on Science Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the Clinton administration's response to
information about Chinese espionage go beyond security procedures
at the labs. The Cox Committee, officials said, also found fault
with the administration's loosening of controls over the export of
sensitive commercial technologies which have applications to
nuclear weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton relaxed controls on sales of advanced
computers to countries like China. The next year, his
administration resisted Congressional efforts to retighten those
controls. The Cox committee concluded that some of the American
computers sold to China went to organizations involved in military
activities and that ineffective verification requirements raise the
possibility that American computers have been used for such
military purposes as upgrading nuclear weapons or developing more
accurate missiles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, China pledged to stop physically testing nuclear
weapons, increasing its reliance on advanced computers for
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, the U.S. intelligence community reported that
China had successfully stolen secret American design information
about the neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That same year President Clinton shifted the licensing
responsibility for some commercial satellite sales from the more
security-oriented State Department to the business-friendly
Commerce Department. The Cox Committee, officials said, concluded
that the shift was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used to launch a satellite into space is similar
to the technology used to deliver a missile armed with nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee hired an outside expert to evaluate help that
was given Chinese scientists in the mid 1990s by two U.S. aerospace
companies, Hughes Electronics and Loral Space and Communications.
The companies are under criminal investigation and have denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that the companies illegally transferred
information that benefited China's civilian and military rockets
and is helpful in the design of future Chinese ballistic missiles,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the panel's most severe criticism was aimed at Hughes,
which the committee found had intentionally side-stepped State
Department licensing requirements in 1995, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue involves a 1995 decision by the Commerce Department
that said it permitted Hughes to help the Chinese solve a rocket
failure _ even though State Department approval was required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the chairman of Hughes also headed President
Clinton's export advisory council.

SHELDON JUDSON, 80, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR IN GEO-ARCHEOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J., N.Y., Wis.)  (rk)

<P>
   Sheldon Judson, an archeologist and a retired professor of
geo-sciences at Princeton University, died Thursday in his home in
Princeton, N.J. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to a statement
released by the university.
</P>
<P>
   Judson was born on Oct. 18, 1918, in Utica, N.Y. He earned a
bachelor's degree from Princeton in 1940 and master's and doctoral
degrees from Harvard University. After teaching for several years
at the University of Wisconsin, he joined the Princeton faculty in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   Judson was the author of numerous geo-archeological reports,
including several studies of paleo-Indian sites in North America
and studies of late Paleolithic rock shelters in France. He also
worked extensively in Etruscan, Roman and Greek sites in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1982, Judson was the chairman of the Department of
Geosciences at Princeton. From 1972 to 1977, he served as chairman
of the University Research Board with the rank of dean. In 1964, he
was appointed the Knox Taylor professor of geology. He also held
faculty fellowships from the Ford, Guggenheim and Fulbright
Foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Judson wrote or co-wrote textbooks and workbooks used in
introductory geology classes. His best-known book is perhaps
``Physical Geology'' (Prentice Hall, 1954) written with L. Don Leet
and, in revised editions, with Marvin E. Kauffman. His most recent
book was ``Earth: An Introduction to Geologic Change'' (Prentice
Hall, 1995) written with S.M. Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Anne Perrin, died in 1990. He is survived by his
second wife, Pamela Judson-Rhodes; three daughters, Stephanie Dean
Judson of Riverton, N.J., Lucy Sheldon Judson of Boulder, Colo.,
and Anne Perrin Judson of Burlington, Vt.; six grandchildren; four
stepchildren, and six stepgrandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald J. Lieberman, a former Stanford University provost and an
expert in statistics and operations research, died on Tuesday at
his home on the Stanford campus in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as
Lou Gehrig's disease, according to a statement from the university.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, as his condition worsened, Lieberman was a
research subject at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and
Information, working with engineers who were designing
communications devices for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   He tested a variety of equipment, including a voice synthesizer
that researchers outfitted with special word-prediction software.
His synthesizer was programmed so that he could rattle off his
favorite catch phrase _ ``Take the rest of the day off!'' _ with a
single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was provost or acting provost during the presidencies
of three Stanford leaders and held several other administrative
positions, including vice provost and dean of graduate studies and
research and associate dean of humanities and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was born on Dec. 31, 1925, in Brooklyn. He graduated
from Cooper Union in 1948 and received a master's degree from
Columbia University in 1949. He received his doctorate from
Stanford in 1952. The next year, he joined the Stanford faculty in
statistics and industrial engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1995. At the time of his death, he was professor
emeritus of operations research and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is survived by his wife, Helen; three daughters, Janet
Lieberman Argyres of Castro Valley, Calif., Joanne Lieberman of
Palo Alto and Diana Lieberman of Palo Alto; a son, Michael
Lieberman of Palo Alto; a sister, Shirley Ross of Great Neck, N.Y.,
and two grandchildren.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23)  
 (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the modern pantheon of hot cars, the Nissan Maxima ranks as a
minor deity _ not up there with, say, the BMW 3-Series, yet forever
to be honored as the first midsize sport sedan for about the same
price as a drab family hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1981, the Maxima had crisp handling and a peppy
engine, and it quickly won converts among Americans accustomed to
Detroit bargemobiles and dorky Japanese compacts. A new, sleeker
design in 1985 _ with front-wheel drive and a standard V6 engine _
brought annual sales into six-figure range.
</P>
<P>
   Another major makeover in 1995, which delivered more interior
room and better performance for less money, cemented customer
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's global market, all automakers must run simply to
stay in place. And a series of snazzy, competitively priced midsize
sedans led by the Audi A4 cruelly dated the old Maxima. Yes, it
still had an enviable record for reliability as well as the
smoothest V6 around.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the competition was so refined, including somewhat
less expensive family sedans like the Honda Accord and Toyota
Camry, the rack-and-pinion steering seemed too light, the driver's
seating position seemed a bit awkward and the styling looked dowdy.
Sales have remained above the 100,000 mark, in large part because
Nissan offered sweet lease deals and generous rebates on the
already modest sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Maxima make a comeback? The auguries were not
promising: Nissan was strapped for cash and, in any case, top
executives feared that any radical change in the familiar shape
would alienate tradition-minded customers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But with a lot of help from the design studio in California and
the engineering nerds in Japan, Nissan has pulled off the
improbable. After a mechanical revamping and substantial face lift,
the Japanese-built 2000 Maxima is again a world-class,
no-compromise sport sedan and a marvelous bargain to boot. Even the
styling, though no match for the cool postmodern designs coming
from Europe, will turn a few heads.
</P>
<P>
   Some specifics: The standard 24-valve, 3-liter V6 has been
goosed to 222 horsepower, a gain of 32, and the torque curve has
been flattened to provide raging acceleration in the 20 to 60 mph
range at which most drivers merge into freeway traffic. The
four-wheel independent suspension has merely been tinkered with.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, small mechanical changes have led to large gains in
surefootedness. The light feel of the wheel has been fixed with
more sophisticated speed-sensitive power steering.
</P>
<P>
   With stop-and-go traffic and cell phones to contend with, most
Maxima buyers will doubtless choose the electronically controlled
four-speed automatic. But purists can still opt for the
glassy-slick five-speed manual that I drove.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima does not stint on safety. Front air bags are
standard, of course, and side air bags can be had for extra money.
The Maxima's excellent anti-skid disk brakes are still excellent.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic traction control is available as an option on cars
with the automatic transmission. All models get terrific halogen
headlights. And the sporty SE version will be available with
17-inch wheels and grippy low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary changes in the Maxima's suspension and drivetrain
are complemented by revolutionary changes in comfort and
convenience. The wheelbase is just 2 inches longer, the body is
stretched by only 1.5 inches and the curb weight is up just 50
pounds, but the cabin is far more airy.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Maxima's front seats seemed too narrow and the
footwells too small for long American legs. Now the seating is
reminiscent of the Lexus ES300 or the new Acura 3.2TL, with
eight-way adjustment, more padding and room to sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The back seat, miracle of miracles, can now manage a fifth
passenger in relative comfort. And the suppression of road noise is
up to the standards of the near-luxury class.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima's controls have been improved, too, with handsome,
readable gauges and bigger buttons. The audio system comes in three
grades ranging from a 60-watt, four-speaker version to a 200-watt,
seven-speaker behemoth by Bose, with integrated cassette and CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Cup holders and a second 12-volt outlet have been added in the
rear. And the 60-40 split back seats fold forward, allowing
oversize objects to pass through from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the Maxima's looks? Both the front and rear have
been reworked to pass for contemporary without sacrificing what
Nissan's chief designer, Gerald Hirshberg, calls it's
``Maxima-ness.'' It's still no beauty, but the over-the-hill
generic Japanese aspect is gone.
</P>
<P>
   I've saved the best for last. Better handling, more power and a
much stiffer chassis have transformed the Maxima into a driving
machine that transcends the class. Equipped with the five-speed
manual, it has become the poor man's BMW _ and I mean the 5-series
BMW with a real back seat, not the 3-series that barely
accommodates four.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that dealers who can coax showroom browsers into
test drives will make a lot of easy sales.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the very best: the by-no-means-stripped Maxima
GXE lists for just $21,569, while the gussied-up GLE can be had for
$26,769. Adding leather and a sunroof can run up the bill a bit
more. But feature-by-feature, the Maxima is a solid $3,000 to
$5,000 less than comparable sedans from Acura, Audi and others. &QL;

NATO COMMANDER CALLS FOR TROOP DEPLOYMENT AT KOSOVO BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, told
Pentagon leaders Thursday that the alliance needed to begin soon to
assemble a force of 45,000 to 50,000 troops on Kosovo's borders,
American and NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The force would be intended to increase pressure on Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept NATO's terms for a
settlement. It is one of three things _ including the use of Apache
helicopters in Albania and tougher steps to cut off Yugoslavia's
supply of oil _ that Clark sought to bolster the military campaign.
In conversations with American officials, he warned that NATO might
not prevail with air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you prepare for ground forces, among other things, you make
Milosevic contemplate the consequences of not going along with the
political objectives'' of NATO's campaign, one official said,
describing Clark's message.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to move ahead with the deployment came at a time
when diplomatic efforts to forge a solution were developing on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met
outside Moscow Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had just returned from talks with Milosevic in
Belgrade, where Goran Matic, an influential minister without
portfolio, said, ``I think we can expect a political settlement in
the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomacy and Clark's visit to Washington _ his first since
NATO's summit here a month ago _ came at a time of divisions within
NATO about the course of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and other capitals, political pressure has grown
to end the conflict. Earlier this week, Britain called on NATO to
do basically what Clark is proposing: build up allied forces in
Albania and Macedonia as a way to increase pressure on Milosevic.
After President Clinton declined to rule out ground troops on
Tuesday, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, bluntly and
forcefully derided the use of ground troops and said his country
would block NATO from fighting any war on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The force Clark is recommending would be intended to enter
Kosovo only after the bombing ended, officials here said.

NEW JERSEY MOVES TOWARD REQUIRING `SMART GUN' TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A state Senate committee Thursday unanimously
approved a requirement that all handguns sold in the state five
years from now be equipped with so-called smart-gun technology,
computer chips or other features that make the guns inoperable by
anyone other than their owners.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the first time that a smart-gun requirement had
advanced this far in any state legislature and was cheered by gun
control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey is on track to become the first state in the nation
to require that only firearms that have been personalized for an
authorized user can be sold in the state,'' said Sarah Brady,
chairwoman of Handgun Control, the nation's largest gun control
lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came on the wave of widespread national concern about
school shootings, like the one in April in Littleton, Colo., and on
the day that yet another school shooting drama was unfolding in
Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee, as expected, also approved a bill Thursday
requiring trigger locks on handguns; it would take effect
immediately upon becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the smart-gun measure, both Democratic and
Republican supporters said that the requirement would pave the way
for the next generation of laws intended to reduce gun violence and
make guns truly childproof.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, D-Essex County, a co-sponsor of the
measure with state Sen. Joseph Palaia, R-Monmouth County, said: ``I
endorse trigger locks, but that wouldn't have prevented the
Littleton massacre, and maybe nothing would have. But childproof
handguns can.''
</P>
<P>
   Although likely to pass in the Senate, the measure still faces
an uphill battle in the Assembly, which is controlled by
Republicans, like the Senate, and has traditionally been more
receptive to the gun lobby. But this is an election year for
Assembly members, a factor that could persuade legislators to vote
for the smart-gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Should the measure pass both houses it will still have to be
signed by Gov. Christie Whitman. Although Whitman favored trigger
locks long before many political figures in the state, she has
expressed doubts about whether the technology to produce smart guns
has advanced enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at that again if and when this measure
passes,'' said Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, which is slated for a vote in the full Senate
next month, trigger locks would immediately be required on all
handguns sold in the state. Three years from now, the state
attorney general, if convinced that there is a proven smart-gun
technology available, could order that the technology be included
on all handguns sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement could be delayed for two more years if the gun
industry is unable to develop smart guns by then. But in any event,
the smart-gun requirement would go into effect no later than 2004,
Codey said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure that was passed Thursday had dropped requirements
that many supporters felt could have indefinitely delayed the
effective date or mired it in subjective considerations about the
``commercial viability'' of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Morton, president and chief executive officer of Oxford
Micro Devices, a company in Monroe, Conn., that manufactures
smart-gun devices, said that smart guns could on the market within
18 months of the passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the committee, Morton said there were about 30
patents related to smart-gun technology. They ranged, he said, from
devices like the one his company produces, which reads fingerprints
and compares them with those of authorized users stored in a
computer chip, to radio-controlled or magnetic systems that match a
mechanism in the gun with a mechanism carried by authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trigger-lock and smart-gun measures, the
committee also passed bills Thursday that would grant sales tax
exemptions and rebates up to $5 on the purchase of trigger locks
and firearm vaults.
</P>
<P>
   The intense political interest in gun issues could be seen
throughout Thursday's packed hearing. Early in the session,
proponents and opponents of the smart-gun measure recessed and were
closeted in the offices of Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who
reportedly helped hammer out a compromise that allowed the
trigger-lock bill and the smart-gun measure to move forward
together. Committee members returned but immediately ran into
confusion about the exact form of the compromise and had to recess
briefly again to clarify the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Miller, executive director of the Coalition of New
Jersey Sportsmen, which is made up of gun owners who support
trigger locks but oppose the smart-gun requirement, said the
smart-gun measure was ``nothing more than a gun ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller blamed Senate Republicans for allowing the measure to
advance, predicting that it would hurt the political chances of
DiFrancesco, who is expected to run for governor if Whitman wins
the U.S. Senate seat of the retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
Similarly, he said, Whitman would be hurt politically should she
ultimately embrace the smart-gun measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitman and DiFrancesco are going to lose us as a base, all in
order to pick up no one among the Democrats,'' Miller said. ``This
is all foolish.''

NBA'S BIG FUTURE: DUNCAN VS. O'NEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal are the preeminent
centers in the NBA today, and they seem to have inherited the
burden of carrying the league into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   However, NBA observers say it's too early to start comparing
what they do on the basketball court to any of those clashes of old
between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. And that's in spite of
what has transpired in the West Conference semifinals between
Duncan's San Antonio Spurs and O'Neal's Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't guard each other that much, so I don't know if I
can compare them to Russell and Chamberlain,'' Spurs forward Sean
Elliott said. ``But they'll have to guard each other a lot in the
future, because there's going to be a day when \RSpurs center\S
David \RRobinson\S isn't here any more, and Tim is going to be the
center. So I'm sure they will have some battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neal and Duncan will have their talents on display when
the Lakers and Spurs play at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood,
Calif., tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in Game 3 of this best-of-seven
series. San Antonio won two games at home this week and leads the
series, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan dominated Game 1 with 25 points and six blocks, then made
the game-winning shot in Game 2. But Duncan, contrary to popular
belief, claims he is not the straw that stirs the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of players on this team who have helped us get
to where we are today,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to do my part
to help us win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has the skills of a forward, but is trapped in a center's
body. The 7-foot, 255-pounder starts at power forward for the
Spurs, but slides over and plays center when Robinson needs a break
or gets in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   However, Duncan knows that when Robinson _ who turns 34 in
August _ retires, he'll see much more of O'Neal in head-to-head
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is such a big body that we have to get him out of the
post and not give him high percentage opportunities,'' Duncan said.
``But there's no one person that can go out there and stop him
one-on-one. It's a team effort, and we're going to need that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the matchup _ whatever it is _ will be in his favor
going into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Duncan is cool, but no one man can guard me,'' O'Neal
said. ``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that the
NBA is supposed to enforce, but they never enforce them, which is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Blake, the NBA director of scouting, said he doesn't
particularly favor O'Neal over Duncan, or vice versa. He simply
gives the advantage to the player who is surrounded by the best
collection of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're totally different kind of players,'' Blake said.
``Duncan can do more things that Shaq, but Shaq is overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is a dominating force in the middle. He'll get better.
He'll play a long time, and they've got to find a way to get him
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neal and Duncan are candidates to win this year's NBA
most valuable player award. That comes after O'Neal led the Lakers
in scoring (26.3) and rebounding (10.7), and led the NBA in
field-goal shooting (.576 percent), while Duncan led the Spurs in
scoring (21.7) and rebounding (11.4).
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's rise is phenomenal, because the swimming fanatic didn't
pick up a basketball until he was 14 years old. That was nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now in only his second NBA season, Duncan is playing like a wily
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has done just a terrific job in figuring out what the NBA
is all about,'' Robinson said. ``He amazes me with his maturity
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone, when I first saw Tim play, I said I believe
I'm going to be playing more at the center position, because he can
pass and handle the ball better than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects Duncan and O'Neal to match the championship
exploits of Russell and Chamberlain _ they collectively won every
NBA title from 1959-69, plus two others _ NBA fans can anticipate
some fierce matchups in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tim's contract is up, I told him, `I'm going with you,
brother,' '' Spurs guard Mario Elie said. ``That guy is special.
He's a talented young player. And so is Shaq.''

ANOTHER COLLEAGUE TESTIFIES AGAINST SUSPECT IN POLICE TORTURE
CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A second police officer testified Thursday that the
officer accused of torturing Abner Louima made statements linking
himself to the attack in the restroom of a Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Michael Schoer told a jury in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn that Officer Justin A. Volpe showed him a stick and said
that a brownish stain on it was human feces, several hours after
prosecutors say Officer Volpe rammed a stick into Louima's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Schoer testified on a day when Volpe's lawyer, in a sharp
reversal of his stated plans, chose not to cross-examine the first
officer who testified Volpe made statements regarding the torture
of Louima. After the testimony on Wednesday of the first officer,
Kenneth Wernick, had ended for the day, the lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, had told reporters to ``wait for the cross'' before
forming any judgments on the reliability of the witness. But in a
surprising move Thursday, Kornberg told the judge that he had no
questions for Wernick, a sergeant who held the rank of officer at
time of the alleged beating. Kornberg later told reporters: ``We've
changed our position, it's that simple. We've changed the trial
tactic in the case. You'll see why when we finish the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoer testified Thursday that Volpe showed him a stick in the
70th Precinct station house in Flatbush on the morning of Aug. 9,
1997. ``He was holding a stick or an object that appeared to me to
be a stick,'' Schoer said. ``Off the cuff, I asked him what was
that,'' he said, referring to a stain ``two or three inches long''
on a stick that he said was about two to two and a half feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Schoer's testimony corroborated part of Wernick's. The sergeant
testified that Volpe boasted to him on the same morning of having
shoved a stick ``five or six inches'' into Louima's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick's testimony was the first to support Louima's account
early in the trial that Volpe had jammed a stick into his rectum
after Louima, 32, a Haitian immigrant, had been arrested in a melee
outside a Flatbush nighclub.Prosecutors say that the attack with
the stick caused major injuries to Louima's rectum and bladder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Volpe, three other officers are on trial on
federal charges of violating Louima's civil rights. Louima
testified that a second officer _ identified by prosecutors as
Charles Schwarz _ had held him down while Volpe brutalized him.
Louima said Volpe, Schwarz and two others _ identified as Thomas
Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ beat him in a police car before he was
taken to the station house. Louima is black and all the officers
are white. A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with
trying to cover up the alleged beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Schoer, who is still with the 70th Precinct,
acknowledged under questioning by a prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, an
assistant U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, that when he was first
interviewed in August 1997 by Police Department investigators about
Louima's account of torture, he did not tell them that Volpe had
shown him a stick or that he said it had human feces on it.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he did tell investigators from the FBI about
the stick in September 1997.

ELKINGTON INTENDS TO PLAY THROUGH SICKNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When last we checked on him, Steve Elkington
was withdrawing from the Shell Houston Open last month after
becoming ill with viral meningitis, his third bout with the disease
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Elkington emerged from six weeks of inactivity to
card a two-under-par 68, good enough for a six-way tie for fourth
place during the first round of the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to \Rlet it\S stand in my way,'' said the
Australian-born Elkington, who lives in Houston. ``This last bout
was not as serious as the other two _ the recurrences get less and
less severe. I didn't lose any weight or my strength. I don't feel
sick. I don't feel weak. I don't see any reason why I can't play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, 36, was first found to have viral meningitis_ a
swelling of the spinal cord near the base of the brain _ while he
was in Australia in 1986. Doctors diagnosed it again a day before
the 1998 GTE Byron Nelson Classic. Over a 10-month period before
the second diagnosis of meningitis, Elkington had suffered a
strained rotator cuff, a strained hip, a strained foot, and had
seven sinus infections.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who has won nine PGA Tour events including the PGA
Championship in 1995, had shot a 65 on the Saturday of the Houston
tournament to get on the leader board. Then he began experiencing
severe headaches and neck soreness _ a few of the symptoms most
commonly associated with the disease _ and checked into a hospital,
where he stayed for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the measles _ you are only supposed to get it
once,'' Elkington saYfHUutJuIYR &QC; Q &LR;

SILVER MEDALLIONS GIVEN TO GOLFERS (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ MasterCard Colonial participants discovered
a surprise in their lockers yesterday: sterling silver medallions,
presented by tournament officials to commemorate their
participation in the 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
   The medallions awarded to past champions were inscribed with
their names and the year or years of their triumphs. It marked the
first time in tournament history that medallions were presented to
every player in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give them something to remember Colonial by,''
said Phil Thomas, tournament chairman. \Nname:_ Jimmy Burch
DOUBLE-DUTY CARRIER Fred Funk's caddie is carrying more than his
golf bag this week. She's also carrying his unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Funk learned two weeks ago that she is pregnant with the
couple's third child that's due in January. But that did not stop
her from filling in this week after Funk fired his former caddie,
Paul Jungman, after a disagreement at the Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Funk said, he plays his best golf with his wife on
his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``She keeps me straight. She's not afraid to get in my face if
she thinks I'm doing something wrong on the course. If I have a
real boo-boo, she gets mad,'' said Funk, who carved out a
bogey-free 68 in yesterday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   As for prospective names, Funk said: ``I think we'll call it,
`Y2K Funk.' '' \Nname:_ Jimmy Burch CREATIVE SHOTMAKING It took a
little creative shotmaking for 1974 Colonial champion Rod Curl to
salvage a bogey at the par-4, 404-yard No. 10. Curl sailed his
third shot over the green, where it landed about 10 inches from a
large tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the inevitable problem it would have caused on the back
swing, Curl instead hit straight at the tree, banking the ball off
the trunk and landing about 10 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like banking my shot,'' Curl said, who finished with a
77. \Nname:_ Kathy Kudravi BEEN THERE, DONE THAT The last time
Franklin Langham played at Colonial, in 1996, he scored an eagle on
the par-4 18th hole, using a sand wedge from the fairway to hole
his shot from 98 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Langham might have been absent from Fort Worth for two years,
but he proved yesterday that he has not lost his magic on the 18th
hole. With his ball in the fairway about 116 yards from the hole,
he used a pitching wedge and watched as the ball took three hops on
the green and bounced off the pin. He sank his putt for a birdie
and a first-round score of 2-under-par 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a guarantee that you will do well in the tournament,
but it always helps when you have nice feelings about 18,'' Langham
said. \Nname:_ Kevin Lyons SOME KIND OF 5 Scott McCarron had one of
the most interesting plays of the day when his tee shot on the
par-4 17th rolled into the concrete drain that goes down the right
rough. The ball, moving in the water, was stopped and marked by a
marshal.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a ruling, McCarron learned he could drop the
ball and play it where the marshal marked it _ even though the ball
began rolling in nearly two inches of water in the concrete drain,
which is a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron dropped the ball, took a few steps and hit the moving
ball. Not exactly a common shot in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practice that shot all the time,'' McCarron said jokingly.
``I'm going to practice it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe he went after it with spikes on,'' playing
partner Billy Mayfair said. ``He could have slipped and killed
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot out of the hazard hit a tree and left McCarron behind
another tree. He had to hit a left-handed shot into the rough, then
hit the ball on the green and one-putted for a bogey five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit a moving ball, hit a left handed shot and make five,''
McCarron said. ``That's a great five.'' \Nname:_ J. Douglas Foster
HELPING HAND Phil Mickelson, hitting out of the rough, did not want
to take any chances with a stake for the gallery rope near the 10th
green.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially offending metal object was between Mikkdlson's
ball and the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   As a course marshal prepared to cut the rope off the stake,
63-year-old Stan Underwood came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No need to cut it,'' Underwood said, ``I was in the Navy, so I
can untie any kind of knot. It was sort of a half hitch. You could
tell Phil was getting a little nervous, so I wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Mickelson's shot wasn't even near the stake
and he wound up bogeying the 10th. \Nname:_ Eric Zarate WAS
PREPARED Tommy Armour must have been a Boy Scout. He knows how to
``be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Armour noticed his feet sliding around in his shoes during the
first six holes yesterday before making a mid-round switch.
</P>
<P>
   On the No. 7 tee, Armour changed shoes, almost as if he expected
he'd need a second pair.
</P>
<P>
   The footwear Armour discarded won't be seeing the light of day _
at least on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave 'em to someone in the crowd,'' Armour said. ``They got
a brand new pair of Florsheims.'' \Nname:_ Troy Phillips AND THEN
THERE WERE 110 The MasterCard Colonial field shrunk by two players
yesterday as John Daly withdrew and Dudley Hart was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who has missed the cut in each of his three previous
Colonial appearances, withdrew after an opening-round 10-over-par
80. Hart was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard. He
signed for a four at the par-4 No. 15 when he had actually made a
five. \Nname:_ J. Douglas Foster RUNAWAY HEADGEAR A not-so-ordinary
distraction had Scott Verplank backing off his approach at No. 9
for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   With Verplank ready to fire, a straw hat rolled into his line of
sight from the left side of the fairway. A wind had caught the back
brim of spectator Robert Taylor's hat before he could grab hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it would just go all the way to the other side,''
Taylor said. ``I figured they'd step on it or something. I'm just
glad no one went into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   A marshal retrieved Taylor's hat for him after Verplank, Loren
Roberts and Bill Glasson made their approaches. \Nname:_ Troy

FLESCH HOPES FIRST WIN FALLS ON BIRTHDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Steve Flesch already has earned the respect
of his peers on the PGA Tour. He did that last year by placing 35th
on the money list with $777,186, which earned him the Tour's Rookie
of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch wants more _ specifically, he wants his first Tour title.
And he took a big step toward getting that in yesterday's opening
round of the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch, a left-hander who will turn 32 on Sunday, overcame Texas
winds and the difficulty of playing in the next-to-last pairing of
the day to take the first-round lead with a 4-under-par 66. He
birdied the last two holes to establish a one-stroke cushion ahead
of Jeff Sluman and Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I need to win,'' Flesch said. ``But surely I
would love to do that. I was playing well a couple of weeks ago so
I had a little bit of confidence coming in. Yeah I'm still waiting
on my first win but I'm not pressing to get it. I just want to go
out and put myself in the position to win and one of those Sundays
I'm going to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping the first winning Sunday happens on his birthday. If
so, he'll be able to look back at yesterday's round as one of the
keys. On a day when only 15 players shot below par, Flesch made
just two bogeys _ one at the par-4 No. 9 and another at the par-3
No. 13 after waiting through a backup of two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little bit of a distraction,'' Flesch said. ``When
you sit around for 15 minutes you lose a little bit of the
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   He recovered quickly, making par on the next three holes before
birdies on Nos. 17 and 18 gave him the lead. At 17, he hit a
pitching wedge within 12 feet and made the putt, then hit a 9-iron
within 15 feet on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch was playing with a brace on his right elbow, there to
absorb shock on the ulnar bone he fractured on March 5.
</P>
<P>
   And just two months after slipping off the stairs at his home in
Kentucky, he's holding the first-round lead at a PGA event for just
the second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, the chance to be leading overnight is
more of a confidence thing,'' Flesch said. ``We've got three more
long days on a good golf course where the greens are firming up. If
the wind continues to blow it's not going to be way under par
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a patience game, but I'm very happy about leading
overnight. It makes you sleep a little bit better.''  &LR; tagtop:J.

hit the ball on the green and one-putted for a bogey five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit a moving ball, hit a left handed shot and make five,''
McCarron said. ``That's a great five.'' \Nname:_ J. Douglas Foster
HELPING HAND Phil Mickelson, hitting out of the rough, did not want
to take any chances with a stake for the gallery rope near the 10th
green.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially offending metal object was between Mickelson's
ball and the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   As a course marshal prepared to cut the rope off the stake,
63-year-old Stan Underwood came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No need to cut it,'' Underwood said, ``I was in the Navy, so I
can untie any kind of knot. It was sort of a half hitch. You could
tell Phil was getting a little nervous, so I wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Mickelson's shot wasn't even near the stake
and he wound up bogeying the 10th. \Nname:_ Eric Zarate WAS
PREPARED Tommy Armour must have been a Boy Scout. He knows how to
``be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Armour noticed his feet sliding around in his shoes during the
first six holes yesterday before making a mid-round switch.
</P>
<P>
   On the No. 7 tee, Armour changed shoes, almost as if he expected
he'd need a second pair.
</P>
<P>
   The footwear Armour discarded won't be seeing the light of day _
at least on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave 'em to someone in the crowd,'' Armour said. ``They got
a brand new pair of Florsheims.'' \Nname:_ Troy Phillips AND THEN
THERE WERE 110 The MasterCard Colonial field shrunk by two players
yesterday as John Daly withdrew and Dudley Hart was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who has missed the cut in each of his three previous
Colonial appearances, withdrew after an opening-round 10-over-par
80. Hart was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard. He
signed for a four at the par-4 No. 15 when he had actually made a
five. \Nname:_ J. Douglas Foster RUNAWAY HEADGEAR A not-so-ordinary
distraction had Scott Verplank backing off his approach at No. 9
for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   With Verplank ready to fire, a straw hat rolled into his line of
sight from the left side of the fairway. A wind had caught the back
brim of spectator Robert Taylor's hat before he could grab hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it would just go all the way to the other side,''
Taylor said. ``I figured they'd step on it or something. I'm just
glad no one went into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   A marshal retrieved Taylor's hat for him after Verplank, Loren
Roberts and Bill Glasson made their approaches. \Nname:_ Troy
Phillips

 WASHINGTON: the company.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long investigation got its big break three months ago, when
Rhone-Polenc of France, one of the members of the cartel, came
forward with crucial evidence in order to avoid prosecution.
Lawyers said that Rhone-Polenc had decided to cooperate in large
part because of a pending $22 billion merger with Hoechst AG, which
cannot be completed without the approval of antitrust officials in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Spratling, head of the antitrust division's criminal
section, said that top executives had treated the industry as one
huge company that they called ``Vitamin Inc.'' Spratling said the
executives ``took great pains to conceal the activity,'' issuing
instructions to destroy all records and notes of their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the vitamin cartel was as bad as they get,'' said
Spratling, an official in the antitrust division for 28 years.
``Nothing was left to chance _ or, more accurately, to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Spratling said that federal sentencing guidelines allowed the
government to seek fines as large as $1.3 billion against Roche and
$300 million against BASF. But prosecutors decided on the lower
figures as part of the deal reached with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fine imposed Thursday on Roche dwarfed the previous record
cases. The largest total fine collected by the Justice Department
before now had been $340 million paid by Daiwa Bank in 1996 for
fraud and coverup in a large securities fraud case. And the largest
previous fines imposed by the antitrust division occurred earlier
this year, when SGL Carbon agreed to pay $135 million and UCAR
International $110 million for their role in a cartel that had
controlled the market for graphite electrodes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, with more than four months remaining in its fiscal
year, the Justice Department's antitrust division has already
collected $913 million, substantially more money than the total
amount collected in its entire history.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamins cartel case grew out of a smaller investigation
into price-fixing in the additives market that involved some of the
same companies at the heart of the price-fixing inquiry. That
investigation ultimately led to a $100 million fine imposed upon
Archer Daniels Midland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that the vitamins case is one of more than 30
investigations now under way of international cartels in a variety
of industries.

ELKINGTON INTENDS TO PLAY THROUGH SICKNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When last we checked on him, Steve Elkington
was withdrawing from the Shell Houston Open last month after
becoming ill with viral meningitis, his third bout with the disease
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Elkington emerged from six weeks of inactivity to
card a two-under-par 68, good enough for a six-way tie for fourth
place during the first round of the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to \Rlet it\S stand in my way,'' said the
Australian-born Elkington, who lives in Houston. ``This last bout
was not as serious as the other two _ the recurrences get less and
less severe. I didn't lose any weight or my strength. I don't feel
sick. I don't feel weak. I don't see any reason why I can't play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, 36, was first found to have viral meningitis_ a
swelling of the spinal cord near the base of the brain _ while he
was in Australia in 1986. Doctors diagnosed it again a day before
the 1998 GTE Byron Nelson Classic. Over a 10-month period before
the second diagnosis of meningitis, Elkington had suffered a
strained rotator cuff, a strained hip, a strained foot, and had
seven sinus infections.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who has won nine PGA Tour events including the PGA
Championship in 1995, had shot a 65 on the Saturday of the Houston
tournament to get on the leader board. Then he began experiencing
severe headaches and neck soreness _ a few of the symptoms most
commonly associated with the disease _ and checked into a hospital,
where he stayed for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the measles _ you are only supposed to get it
once,'' Elkington said. ``But I've got a recurring form of the
virus, and the funny thing is, I keep giving it to myself. It's not
going to kill me. It's not career-threatening. I talked to all of
the specialists, and they don't know if it has to do with anything
_ allergies, stress, my immune system. They just don't know. I
guess if I would not have been in the good shape that I was in, it
would have been worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a rough month for Elkington's caddie, Joe
``Gypsy'' Grillo. Grillo had a benign tumor on his finger removed
recently and won't be back until early June. Yet despite the recent
run of health problems, Elkington refuses to get down on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky because I've played on the tour for 13 years _ I've
got a great family, great kids,'' Elkington said. ``I've done
everything I've wanted to do this decade. Is it a little
frustrating? Yes, I have some sicknesses. But it hasn't hurt my
ability to play. In 10 years, I've only missed about six months.
That is not too bad in an athlete's life, if you compare golf to
some other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not life-threatening,'' he said, ``it's just a
nuisance.''

NBA'S BIG FUTURE: DUNCAN VS. O'NEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal are the preeminent
centers in the NBA today, and they seem to have inherited the
burden of carrying the league into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   However, NBA observers say it's too early to start comparing
what they do on the basketball court to any of those clashes of old
between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. And that's in spite of
what has transpired in the West Conference semifinals between
Duncan's San Antonio Spurs and O'Neal's Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't guard each other that much, so I don't know if I
can compare them to Russell and Chamberlain,'' Spurs forward Sean
Elliott said. ``But they'll have to guard each other a lot in the
future, because there's going to be a day when \RSpurs center\S
David \RRobinson\S isn't here any more, and Tim is going to be the
center. So I'm sure they will have some battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neal and Duncan will have their talents on display when
the Lakers and Spurs play at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood,
Calif., tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in Game 3 of this best-of-seven
series. San Antonio won two games at home this week and leads the
series, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan dominated Game 1 with 25 points and six blocks, then made
the game-winning shot in Game 2. But Duncan, contrary to popular
belief, claims he is not the straw that stirs the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of players on this team who have helped us get
to where we are today,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to do my part
to help us win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has the skills of a forward, but is trapped in a center's
body. The 7-foot, 255-pounder starts at power forward for the
Spurs, but slides over and plays center when Robinson needs a break
or gets in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   However, Duncan knows that when Robinson _ who turns 34 in
August _ retires, he'll see much more of O'Neal in head-to-head
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is such a big body that we have to get him out of the
post and not give him high percentage opportunities,'' Duncan said.
``But there's no one person that can go out there and stop him
one-on-one. It's a team effort, and we're going to need that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the matchup _ whatever it is _ will be in his favor
going into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Duncan is cool, but no one man can guard me,'' O'Neal
said. ``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that the
NBA is supposed to enforce, but they never enforce them, which is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Blake, the NBA director of scouting, said he doesn't
particularly favor O'Neal over Duncan, or vice versa. He simply
gives the advantage to the player who is surrounded by the best
collection of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're totally different kind of players,'' Blake said.
``Duncan can do more things that Shaq, but Shaq is overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is a dominating force in the middle. He'll get better.
He'll play a long time, and they've got to find a way to get him
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neal and Duncan are candidates to win this year's NBA
most valuable player award. That comes after O'Neal led the Lakers
in scoring (26.3) and rebounding (10.7), and led the NBA in
field-goal shooting (.576 percent), while Duncan led the Spurs in
scoring (21.7) and rebounding (11.4).
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's rise is phenomenal, because the swimming fanatic didn't
pick up a basketball until he was 14 years old. That was nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now in only his second NBA season, Duncan is playing like a wily
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has done just a terrific job in figuring out what the NBA
is all about,'' Robinson said. ``He amazes me with his maturity
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone, when I first saw Tim play, I said I believe
I'm going to be playing more at the center position, because he can
pass and handle the ball better than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects Duncan and O'Neal to match the championship
exploits of Russell and Chamberlain _ they collectively won every
NBA title from 1959-69, plus two others _ NBA fans can anticipate
some fierce matchups in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tim's contract is up, I told him, `I'm going with you,
brother,' '' Spurs guard Mario Elie said. ``That guy is special.
He's a talented young player. And so is Shaq.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RADIO VOICE FOR KNICKS IS AS BIG AS LIFE ON ROAD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Mich., N.C., Texas)  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gus Johnson calls a Knicks game on the radio, he visualizes
his audio audience: fans in their cars, tired truckers, eager to
get home, needing a boost for 2 1/2 or three hours. People who need
to keep their spirits up as they drive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remembers his days as a television sports anchor in
Waco, Texas. He remembers the drives to and from high school games
on Friday nights and the magic of radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always turn on the high school football games and listen
to announcers in these small Texas towns calling their games,''
Johnson said. ``I loved it. It was exciting to me and very genuine.
There's something really unique and genuine about radio, something
different about it. You have to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Following your team on the radio can be torture _ if you truly
care. You trust the broadcasters to be more than your eyes. You
trust them to convey what they see, and for the evidence of things
that can only be felt: the mood, the energy, the surge of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two seasons, Johnson's enthusiastic voice has
guided a regular audio underground of tortured Knicks fans through
the highs and lows of their perilous campaigns. With each Knicks
victory this audience grows: night shifts at the factory, people
working late at the office, operating delis. All flying blindly,
following their unpredictable Knicks on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Johnson had a larger audience than usual. The day
was too beautiful to stay inside but the game was too important to
miss. So fans sat in cars, in the park or in their gardens, on pins
and needles, as the Knicks played the Heat in a crucial Game 5
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's voice reflected every emotional nuance, captured the
highs and lows of another roller-coaster Knicks game in their
roller-coaster season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the moment of truth, with game on the line, Allan
Houston hit the game-winning shot with less than a second to play.
Johnson, with the unabashed enthusiasm of someone who had just seen
Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon for the first time _ at the same
time _ seemed to leap through our radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter, one dribble for the win. ... No good! And the Knicks
win, 78-77! They take the best-of-5 series from the Miami Heat. An
eighth seed has won for only the second time in NBA history, and
Pat Riley and the Heat, their season is over. The Knicks continue
to play. Unbelievable!''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Atlanta Hawks, Johnson called Games 1 and 2 and will
call Games 5 and 7 if they are played. Expect no letup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get so excited about it,'' he said. ``I really love it. I
really, truly, genuinely love basketball. I love to see the great
athletes play. It's such an elegant game, yet it's such a powerful
and fearsome game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson replaced Marv Albert as the radio voice of the Knicks
last season when Albert resigned following his guilty plea to a
misdemeanor assault charge. When Albert was brought back this
season, Johnson agreed to an arrangement in which he would call the
Knicks' road games and Albert called the home games. Their
contrasting approaches parallel the Knicks' evolving style. Albert,
like the old Knicks, is cool, professional, polished, predictable.
Johnson, like these Latrell Sprewell-led Knicks, is unabashed and
exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're coming up as a broadcaster you always try to mimic
everybody else,'' Johnson said. ``You try to be Marv Albert or
George Blaha or Bob Costas. Now I'm coming into who I am, and I
feel comfortable with that. At the same time, you feel uneasy
because you're exposed. People are seeing who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was born in Detroit and was a honorable mention
all-state basketball player, though his best sport was baseball. He
accepted a baseball scholarship to Howard University but he never
had illusions about a pro career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a slow line-drive-hitting outfielder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became interested in broadcasting in his junior year. By
graduation he landed a TV weekend sports anchor job in Waco, and
from there he moved to Huntsville, Ala., then to Winston-Salem,
N.C., where he began his radio broadcast career calling high school
football games for $10 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget was so bad that we didn't have headsets,'' he said.
``So we used a telephone. I'd do play-by-play then hand the phone
to my partner and he handed it back. That's the way we did the
entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson joined Fox television in Washington in 1993, calling the
NFL and college football, and also worked for ESPN. He joined CBS
in 1995 and shortly after joined the MSG Network.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also an actor. He played the role of a street kid in
an independent film, ``Urban Folk Tales,'' and he did a voice-over
in Spike Lee's ``He Got Game.'' Johnson completed his first
off-off-off-off-Broadway play, ``So That's Love,'' in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many similarities between the two arenas,''
Johnson said, but added: ``The theater is a story being told by
actors, but everything you see in a basketball or a sporting event
is better than theater because nobody knows the outcome. The
outcome changes all the time. The sporting event is live theater:
there's a beginning, there's a middle and an end. There are central
characters, there are protagonists, antagonists, and it changes
from minute to minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high drama of this Knicks' playoff run, the 31-year-old
Johnson sees himself as a narrator. ``Look at that Game 5 in
Miami,'' he said. ``Who would have thought that the game would have
ended that way? Who would have thought that the Knicks would have
been able to overcome all of these different obstacles?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at the end, Allan Houston, the player to hit the big
shot, is the one who was having the worst game among them, the one
who has always been questioned about his resolve and his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gets pumped up just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's theater at it's best,'' he said. ``That's unbelievable
stuff.''

RATES ARE RISING. ARE THE BEARS NEAR?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Goldilocks dead, choking on her porridge, or merely suffering
indigestion?
</P>
<P>
   People have long wondered just how long the ``not too hot, not
too cold'' environment that has amazed economists and nourished
financial markets for years could last. Recent events suggest we
may be in the introductory phase of a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price report for April, which showed an increase of
0.7 percent, hit on May 14. Then, last week, the Federal Reserve
Board, for the first time in more than two years, said it was more
inclined to raise rates than to lower them.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that inflation is entitled to one bad month
every now and then. And since 1996, the Fed has adopted a bias
toward tighter monetary policy 14 times, but has actually raised
interest rates only once.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with stocks at high levels, there is little margin for
error. Kevin Parke, chief equity officer at MFS Investment
Management in Boston, talked last week about the possibility of a
post-Goldilocks economy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Bond traders have been pushing up interest rates for some
time now. Is this just a blip, or are we in an upward trend? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The fact is that bond traders overreacted to last fall's
global financial crisis by pushing bond yields down too far. Now
you are getting a bounce back up, but I think it is best measured
from a floor of 5.25 percent, not the 4.75 percent level they
reached during the crisis. We think the correct range for bond
yields is between 5.25 percent and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that bond yields went through 5.90 percent is
fantastic, because it means that the market is not complacent. Bond
traders are a policing mechanism, keeping a lid on inflation and
economic growth. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So do you still believe in Goldilocks? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rise in bond yields and the Fed's announcement last week
insures a continuation of the Goldilocks scenario. It will help
keep us in the middle ground we have occupied for some time. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Fed didn't actually say it was going to raise rates, and
many analysts say it is unlikely to do so this year. Do you agree? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would be surprised if the Fed didn't eventually raise
interest rates this year. As international economies recover, that
puts more pressure on rates. And one of the main reasons the Fed
cut rates three times last year was to help the world financial
system. If they truly believe the patient is now healthy, they can
turn off the I.V. machine.
</P>
<P>
   We are not worried about consumer inflation, because there is no
indication you can pass on price increases at all. In fact,
companies are still cutting prices. Just look at what Amazon.com
did with best sellers last week. And the competition followed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does a change in rates warrant a change in how investors pick
stocks? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You want to find companies that can thrive in a relatively
slow-growth, low-inflation environment and companies with
managements that can take advantage of opportunities. This will be
more of a stock-picking market, not one you just throw money at. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can the hot growth stocks that have led the market thrive in
this environment? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have to be very careful what you pay for high-quality
growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This market has been helped by earnings, but it has also been
helped by higher valuations for growth stocks. If interest rates
are rising, I don't think these sorts of price-to-earnings
multiples can be justified.
</P>

   Stocks are the longest-duration financial instrument we have.
They are like zero-coupon bonds. When rates are stable,
price-to-earnings multiples will be stable. When rates are falling,
which they have been for some time, the ratio will rise. The last
thing you want to pay is 40 times earnings for a company whose
growth rate is slowing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Name a few companies that fit your criteria for purchase at
this point. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the pharmaceutical area, a sector where most will
experience a slowdown in growth, we see some companies whose growth
rates are accelerating, like American Home Products and Pharmacia
Upjohn.
</P>
<P>
   In industrials, United Technologies will continue to be a very
strong performer. About 25 percent of their business is in Asia,
which will show an improvement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A number of companies saw the crisis in Asia as a chance to
buy local businesses at bargain prices. Do you like any of them? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One industry that will benefit from those who bought on the
cheap in Asia is investment banking. Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Citigroup all gained market share in
these parts of the world. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some market forecasters say that with rates rising, a
correction of 5 to 10 percent is quite possible in the next month
to six weeks. Do you share that concern? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know about the near term, but I do think the market
is vulnerable, because there is an excess of speculation in the
market. Things have been too easy for too long.

JAMES BROUGHTON, 85, POET  
 LEMBIT OLL, CHESS GRANDMASTER, 33

<P>
   James Broughton, a poet and filmmaker, died May 17 at his home
in Port Townsend, Wash. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Long a prominent member of the avant-garde artistic community in
San Francisco, Broughton once described himself as ``an Anglican by
birth, a Taoist by nature, a Dionysian in spirit, an Apollonian in
practice.'' Over the years he collaborated with many other artists,
composers and performers and, starting in 1948, turned out a body
of work _ much of it highly experimental _ that included some 20
books and 23 films.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Modesto, alif., Broughton lived in San Francisco until
1989. He attended Stanford University and later taught at San
Francisco State University and the San Francisco Art Institute. His
books include ``Musical Chairs,'' ``Seeing the Light,'' ``Odes for
Odd Occasions,'' ``75 Life Lines'' and ``True and False Unicorn.''
In his review of ``True and False Unicorn'' in The New York Times,
the poet Kenneth Rexroth described Broughton as ``a real master of
catchy meters and bubbling, twisted cliches, which, after they have
caught, bite.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Broughton's films were shown in programs at the Film
Forum and at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York during
the 1970s, including ``This Is It,'' ``Dreamwood,'' ``Testament''
and ``Nuptiae.'' He received the American Film Institute's lifetime
achievement award in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s Broughton was married to Suzanna Hart. He is
survived by a son, Orion, of Port Townsend; a daughter, Serena
DeCastro of Grand Junction, Colo., and his companion and longtime
collaborator, Joel Singer.
</P>
<P>
   Lembit Oll, an Estonian chess grandmaster who was preparing to
take part in a qualifying competition for the International Chess
Federation's world championship match this summer in Las Vegas,
died May 16 in a plunge from a window of his fourth-floor apartment
in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, press reports there said. He was
33.
</P>
<P>
   Oll was ranked No. 42 in recent world standings.
</P>
<P>
   The reports from Tallinn said he was survived by two sons.

DRIVE, DON'T TALK, COMMISSION TELLS TAXI DRIVERS, CITING SAFETY AND
COURTESY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The notoriously garrulous New York City taxi driver
is about to become a little less talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a rising number of passenger complaints, the Taxi and
Limousine Commission passed a new regulation Thursday that
prohibits cabbies from using cellular phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who violate the rule will face a $200 fine and two
penalty points on their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the new rule, which takes effect July 1,
makes New York one the first municipalities in the country to
outlaw mobile phone use while driving, if only for the city's
90,000 taxi, car service and limousine drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a passenger has the right to get into a cab and not
have a driver who is chatting on the phone,'' said the commission's
chairwoman, Diane McGrath-McKechnie. ``They are entitled to a
driver who is focused on the road, not the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The new measure would not apply to two-way radios that
livery-cab drivers use to talk to their dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission does not keep a tally of accidents
related to cellular phone use, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said a recent
study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found
that drivers who used a mobile phone behind the wheel had a higher
accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian study published in 1997 concluded that hands-free
phones were no safer than hand-held phones.
</P>
<P>
   Most cabbies and passengers interviewed Thursday agreed with the
new rule, saying that cell phone use by drivers is both rude and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how distracting it is because I've had a few near
misses myself,'' said Mary Liz McDonald, 32, a film producer from
Hoboken, N.J., who was stepping into a taxi at the Port Authority
Bus Terminal last night. ``Taking a New York City cab is perilous
as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McDonald, who has orchestrated many deals while driving,
would object to such a ban for everyone else. ``I couldn't exist if
I wasn't able to drive and talk on the phone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farooq A. Bhatti, the director of Pak Brothers Yellow Cab
Drivers Union, a fraternal organization, said he thought the ban
was a good idea. Bhatti said that as he was driving from La Guardia
Airport Thursday, he saw two limousine drivers who were both using
cell phones get into a minor accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both got out of their cars yelling at each other and
telling their callers to hold on,'' he said. ``It was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone approved of the ban, especially the cellular
phone industry. James J. Gerace, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic
Mobile, said cellular phone companies would try to amend the
regulations to allow drivers to use hands-free phones and
voice-activated dialing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this measure will discourage drivers from using cell
phones at all,'' he said, ``which would be too bad, since the
safety benefits of carrying a mobile phone have been well
documented.''

HOW TO TURN THAT DRIVE AND ANGER INTO AN HONORED CAREER IN TV
NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, Okla.)   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The essential story about Paula Walker Madison, the
news director of WNBC-TV's Channel 4 and one of the few black
female news directors in the country, took place at Cardinal
Spellman High School, circa 1969, when she was growing up in Harlem
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madison's current-events class was discussing Mayor John V.
Lindsay's budget cuts, and soon enough one of the many white
students said something like why didn't the mayor get all those
people off the dole. Ms. Madison sat mute, then raised her hand at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked how many of them have had a social worker come to
their house and look in their closets to see if your mother had a
man in there?'' Ms. Madison recalled. Also, ``How many of them had
to make a Monopoly game because they didn't have the money to buy
one?'' And how many had eaten salty ``welfare cheese'' and Spam?
</P>
<P>
   The story doesn't end there. Afterward, the nun told Ms. Madison
that what she had said was important and would she please come back
and repeat it for the afternoon class?
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Who's going to take  &UR; my &LR;  afternoon class for
me?''' Ms. Madison said. ```I did not come to this school to share
my experiences with a comfortable middle class group so that they
could learn what it was like to be poor and black.' I was there to
get an education.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Madison, 46, one of the more conspicuously successful
black women in the city, has taken that anger and drive to become
the pulse of a top-rated news program in the nation's No. 1 market.
(In recent years Channel 4 has more often than not edged out its
main competitor, WABC-TV's Channel 7, as the No. 1 news broadcast
at 11 p.m.) This is in part because of spillover from NBC's popular
entertainment programming, like ``ER,'' but fans of Ms. Madison,
and there are many, say it is also because she puts on less blood
and more substance _ like the graphic eight and a half minutes of
an instructional video on breast self-examination that she
broadcast in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best teaching tool that I had seen,'' said Ms.
Madison, who had discovered a lump in her own breast and had it
removed _ it was a benign cyst _ a few months before the video was
shown. ``But I wasn't even doing it correctly.'' Ms. Madison said
the response from viewers was overwhelmingly positive; Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which made the video, said it
received more than 3,000 requests for it. Ms. Madison dismissed a
few critics who said she should have made her own video, and not
used the hospital's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not experts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her office last week, Ms. Madison had a certain blunt,
commanding style. ``If you're stupid and you're incompetent, you
don't want to be near Paula,'' said Ti-Hua Chang, an 11 p.m.
reporter, who is not, and likes her. ``I think people in the
newsroom are afraid of her.'' Andrew Lack, the president of NBC
News, who is not Ms. Madison's boss but runs the news division of
her network, assessed her this way: ``Capable. Tough cookie.'' And
also: ``No nonsense. Shoot from the hip. Get it done. Don't mess
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madison's style was evident in her description of her
parents, who immigrated separately to New York from Jamaica,
married, then spent decades in a messy marriage. ``My father was an
educated man,'' she said. ``My mother was not an educated woman.
Part of what defined my mother's status was color. My father is a
very dark-skinned man. My mother is fair-skinned. She had Chinese
features, long hair.'' (Her father was Chinese.) In short, ``a
physical appearance that was `appreciated' _ I'll say it that way.
They didn't have a lot in common.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Madison was a toddler, her father, who had entered
America using the false name Moncrief Powell, was deported. Ms.
Madison's mother became a citizen while he was gone, enabling her
father to come back after a year as the real Elrick Williams Sr.,
which changed Ms. Madison's name from Paula Powell to Paula
Williams _ for years a source of confusion to the record keepers at
her school.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 7, her father, a tool and die maker, finally
moved out to Queens, got into custody battles with her mother and
frequently didn't pay his support. Ms. Madison's mother took in
sewing, but the city sent welfare checks until Ms. Madison's older
brother, who went to Williams College and then Harvard Business
School, stepped in. ``He was the first millionaire I knew,'' Ms.
Madison said. (Her other brother, a former drug addict, is a
trucker.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madison went to Vassar, married, had a daughter, was a
reporter at The Syracuse Herald-Journal, The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram and The Dallas Times-Herald, divorced, then worked
her way up as a news director at television stations in Texas and
Oklahoma, where her mother moved in and helped raise her daughter.
In 1989 she came back home and went to work at WNBC; she has been
news director since 1996. She lives in Westchester County and is
married to Roosevelt Madison, Tom Brokaw's make-up artist.
</P>
<P>
   One of her goals is to diversify the broadcast, realistically.
``If we're going to cover street crime, violent crimes, we're going
to have some representation among black people,'' she said,
referring to ``the proverbial perp walk.'' But: ``All investment
bankers are not white men. Nor are all nurses white women. Nor are
all subway conductors African-American.''

BATTLE OF THE BILLBOARD THAT HASN'T BEEN BUILT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ With visions of world domination dancing in his head,
Frank G. Zarb, chief executive of Nasdaq's parent, decided that his
electronic stock market had to erect the biggest, most dazzling
billboard in Times Square for all the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to put it on 4 Times Square, the skyscraper known
as the Conde Nast Building. About the size of three basketball
courts, it would wrap around a 10-story cylindrical structure that
forms the building's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   Enter S.I. Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast, which publishes
such glossy magazines as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Details.
Newhouse, with visions of airy and chic offices, brought in a
renowned architect and designers to make the company's new
headquarters _ much of it in the middle of the cylinder _ an
esthetic haven.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse does not want Nasdaq's huge $20 million electronic sign
to darken his windowsill.
</P>
<P>
   So, the financial titan, the magazine mogul and their common
landlord at 4 Times Square, Douglas Durst, are locked in a dispute
over the giant video display, which Newhouse contends will block
natural light from his windows. Citing his lease, he is claiming
the right to bar the sign from the side of the tower, at Broadway
and 43d Street.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which under the terms of their lease has been sent
to an arbitrator, has left many Times Square denizens chuckling.
Just a few years ago, many companies refused to advertise in what
was then a shabby Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Landlords bitterly opposed zoning regulations that required
large, bright signs on buildings in the district. Today, Budweiser,
Cadillac, Calvin Klein and Suntory are vying with Nasdaq to pay
millions of dollars a year to advertise their wares at what is
called the crossroads of the world. The number of billboards in
Times Square has tripled, to 150, in the last two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the wonderful explosion of light and action
in Times Square,'' Tama Starr, president of the Artkraft Strauss
Sign Corp., said of the battle. ``It's fitting that Times Square is
the home of the biggest and the brightest sign, until the next one
comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign war at 4 Times Square is only the latest of the
troubles at the soon-to-be completed tower. The construction has
been marred by small fires, a scaffolding collapse that left one
person dead, and an elevator accident in which a worker died.
</P>
<P>
   None of the participants are eager to talk about the sign
dispute. Maurie Perl, a spokeswoman for Newhouse and Conde Nast
Publications, declined to comment, and Michael Jones, senior vice
president at Nasdaq, referred all questions to Durst.
</P>
<P>
   The developer tried to take a middle road between his squabbling
tenants. ``Conde Nast is proud and protective of its sensational
new headquarters,'' Durst said. ``Nasdaq wishes to build a
spectacular sign for its new marketing center. Our leases provide
for a speedy alternative dispute resolution process. We're
confident this issue will be behind us by the time Conde Nast takes
occupancy, in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq sign would be the biggest single sign in Times
Square, where there are scores of pulsating neon, electronic and
vinyl billboards. It would also be the largest LED _ light-emitting
diode _ display in the world, according to sign makers. Diodes
would enable a single image to move across the sign's 14,000 square
foot surface, or divide the sign into a multitude of images.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, the chairman of Nasdaq's parent, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, signed a deal last summer to move his
marketing center from an obscure location in the financial district
to 4 Times Square, where it could better be seen by millions of
tourists and television viewers. In an attempt to create a virtual
trading floor that would rival the often televised opening bell of
the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq is building a round,
glass-walled television studio on the first two floors of the 4
Times Square cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq video sign would stretch from the 3d floor to the
10th. The problem is that the top half of the cylinder is peppered
with five rows of five-foot-by-eight-foot windows that look onto
the art departments of Newhouse's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast, which was the first tenant to sign on for Durst's
project, has leased floors 4 through 22 in the 48-story tower,
where it is to have a titanium and blown-glass lunchroom _ Titanium
Cafe _ designed by the architect Frank Gehry and personal bathrooms
for the publishers, top editors and vice presidents in the Conde
Nast publications.
</P>
<P>
   The sign has cutouts for the 30 windows. But the drawings showed
the face of the sign extending five feet from the building,
creating what Newhouse bemoaned was a tunnel-like effect around his
windows. The sign itself is only about 18 inches thick, but there
is room for ventilation and a three-foot-wide catwalk behind the
sign for maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse and his lawyers seized on clauses in their lease that
they said gave them the right to block substantial design changes
and prohibited any sign from extending more than 20 inches from the
building facade, according to people on both sides of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq contends that the sign complies with its lease, a
different document. Besides, it says, the graphic artists at Conde
Nast do not rely on natural light anyway.

GUN-SHOW CURB PASSES AS GORE BREAKS TIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats, with the help of a rare vote from Vice
President Al Gore, won a dramatic victory on a gun-control measure
Thursday that would put tough limits on gun-show sales. The measure
is part of a sweeping bill, which the Senate later passed, that
would pour $5 billion into juvenile justice programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' Gore said after
breaking the tie in his role as president of the Senate. ``Finally,
this majority is turning the corner and helping to protect the
children and families of this country.''

   The vote was cast as President Clinton visited Littleton, Colo.,
one month after two students killed 13 people and themselves.
Moreover, hours before the vote, six students were wounded in a
school shooting in Georgia, an event that immediately became a
focal point of the floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding juvenile crime bill, which had languished for
months until the Littleton shooting, passed 73-25. The legislation
now goes to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cast his vote on one of the most contentious measures, that
would require background checks on all purchases of weapons at gun
shows. It also would require someone who redeems a weapon at a pawn
shop to undergo a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents of the measure said the recent spate of
school shootings turned the political tide in favor of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series of tragedies in the schools sharpened the public's
focus on the issue. It showed the unreasonableness of the National
Rifle Association,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA remained unbowed, accusing the White House of backing
``a charade of lawmaking without law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``NRA will continue to hold a mirror up to this dishonest
process until the American people demand more meaningful and
substantive action from government,'' the organization said in a
statement. ``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Gore's tie-breaker, a crucial vote came from Senator
Max Cleland, a Georgia Democrat. Cleland had been leaning against
the measure, but changed his mind Wednesday night after being
assured the amendment would not drive unlicensed dealers into the
black market. If any doubt remained in Cleland's mind, the
shootings in Georgia ended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just an issue in Littleton, Colo., anymore,''
Cleland said. ``It was hometown people, in my backyard, and I said
anything I can do I want to do to work on this problem.'' Thursday
was the second time in eight days that Republicans have been
embarrassed over the gun-show sale issue. On May 12, the
Republican-led Senate rejected a Democratic proposal requiring
background checks for gun-show sales, only to wake up to widespread
criticism the following day. Republicans then reversed themselves,
approving a modified restriction on gun-show sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, apparently sensing that the mood had shifted
after the shootings in Littleton, said the Republican measure was
filled with loopholes, such as allowing high-volume dealers known
as ``special licensees'' to sell firearms without making background
checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Thursday's political maneuvering in the Senate. It
began when Republicans tried to kill a growing momentum for tougher
background checks at gun-show sales proposed by Senator Frank
Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. Republicans offered a
compromise measure that included some restrictions on gun sales at
pawn shops and gun shows, but did not go as far as the Lautenberg
amendment. The Republican measure passed 79-29.
</P>
<P>
   But Lautenberg said the Republican proposal still had too many
loopholes, most notably a 24-hour time limit for background checks.
Lautenberg said most gun sales should go through immediately if
there are no questions about a buyer's background, but authorities
need three days if trouble signs arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine we can't even take enough time to
investigate the prospective buyer to make sure we are protecting
people,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, led the opposition,
saying Lautenberg's measure would backfire. ``I think it will push
people to sell guns in the black market, which I think would
undermine everything he is trying to do,'' Hatch said of
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate prepared to vote on the Lautenberg amendment, Gore
took his seat on the dais as president of the Senate. A clerk
handed Gore the roll-call results.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this vote, the yeas are 50 and the nays are 50,'' Gore
said, employing the language required by parliamentary rules. ``The
Senate being equally divided, the vice president votes in the
affirmative. The amendment is agreed to.'' It was the fourth time
Gore has broken a Senate tie since he was elected vice president.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 45 Democrats voted against the Lautenberg amendment:
Senator Max Baucus of Montana. Six Republicans supported it:
Senators John Chafee of Rhode Island, Michael DeWine of Ohio, Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana, George Voinovich
of Ohio, and John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 billion juvenile justice bill includes $450 million a
year for drug testing and detention centers, $435 million annually
for juvenile crime prevention, $75 million in state grants, and $40
million for research of juvenile crime programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would make it easier for prosecutors to charge
juveniles 14 and older with violent crime, study the way children
are affected by gun-marketing, music, television, and the Internet;
and revoke the right of gun ownership for people convicted of a
gun-related crime as a juvenile.

 &HT;    Cubs' win prolongs Maddux's miseries
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The May madness continues for Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   After supplying their struggling ace with only two runs in his
three previous starts this month, the Braves scored three times in
the sixth inning off Steve Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, whose grand slam was the key to their win
Wednesday, ripped a two-run double past third base to cut the Cubs'
lead to 5-3. Ryan Klesko followed with a run-scoring double, but
spoiled the rally by getting doubled off second base on Williams'
liner to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had another head-scratcher going through the first five
innings, allowing the Cubs, whom he'd beaten seven of eight times
before this week, to take a 5-1 lead. In his last 24 1/3 innings,
he has given up 22 runs, and his earned run average has risen to
5.02. Maddux provided few answers Thursday night, only raising more
questions.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired the first two hitters, Sammy Sosa and Mark
Grace reached Maddux for back-to-back home runs in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The second scoring outburst started more subtly with a one-out
Lance Johnson infield hit and a Mickey Morandini grounder through
the middle that barely eluded Walt Weiss and a potential double
play. Maddux retired Sosa on a fly ball, but left a 3-2 pitch over
the plate for Grace who drove in his second run with a shot to the
right field corner.
</P>
<P>
   With Maddux down 3-0 at that point, Henry Rodriguez dropped a
bloop single softly into center field to score Morandini and Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was spiraling toward his fourth loss in a row and second
to the Cubs in a week when the Braves offense woke up.

AS A SHOOTING GUARD ALLEN IVERSON MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Iverson is free. No longer hindered by the constraints of
playmaking, he is finally able to be himself on the basketball
court. He does not have to set up shots for his teammates or force
himself to think pass rather than shoot. Oddly enough, as a
shooting guard, he is now doing what he seldom did as a point
guard. He is making his Philadelphia 76ers teammates better.
</P>
<P>
   Since Iverson entered the National Basketball Association three
years ago, the knock on him has been that he does not improve the
players around him. His ``no one can stop me'' mentality was
unbecoming of a point guard, and the proof was in the 76ers' woeful
records in his first two seasons. But things changed when Coach
Larry Brown moved Iverson off the ball this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers became one of the surprises of the league, qualifying
for the playoffs for the first time in eight years, ousting the
favored Orlando Magic in the first round, and spawning a new
appreciation for the Iverson in team.
</P>
<P>
   When Philadelphia plays host to the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of
their Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night at the First Union
Center, Iverson will not be viewed as a point guard with his
priorities out of whack. He will be the wild card who, if able to
get into his rhythm, can lift his 76ers to improbable heights and
make the Pacers' comfortable 2-0 lead in the series disappear as
quickly as one of his stunning crossover dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Daly, Orlando's respected coach, who implemented a
scaled-down version of his famed Jordan Rules in an effort to
defend Iverson, witnessed as much when the 76er star scored 30 or
more points three times as the 76ers eliminated the Magic, three
games to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you guys have any concept of the impact this kid
has on a game,'' Daly said after Iverson had 37 points and 9
assists in the series finale. ``This was the Allen Iverson show.
He's a tremendous competitor. What he does for the Sixers, I don't
think even they realize.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that critics were saying Iverson did little
for the 76ers. An unconventional point guard, he produced All-Star
statistics while alienating his teammates. Even his assists _ he
averaged a solid 6.8 a game his first two seasons _ came as an
afterthought, often when he found himself in the air with no
alternative but to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But now Iverson is seen as one of the league's leading most
valuable player candidates. After leading the league in scoring
with 26.8 points a game, he will most likely be named first-team
all-NBA, and even Brown, his hard-to-please coach, throws accolades
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good players make other players better,'' said Brown, who is
in his second season in Philadelphia. ``I didn't know when I first
got here if that was the case with Allen. And early on in my first
season, I didn't see any chemistry out there and I didn't see that
as part of what he was about. But from the second half of last
season and this year, he's doing what great players do: making
other players better.''
</P>
<P>
   The newfound appreciation for Iverson's ability to improve the
play of his teammates is a direct result of the 76ers' success. But
the fact is, little has changed besides his position. His game is
as undisciplined as ever, but because he is no longer responsible
for running the offense, it works.
</P>
<P>
   His shooting percentage dropped significantly, from .461 last
season to .412 this year, his assists average fell to 4.6 and his
turnovers remained high (3.5 a game). But because opponents are
forced to double-team Iverson, the 76ers have one more man than the
opposition crashing the boards. That is one reason Philadelphia
finished tied for second in the league in rebounding and forwards
Theo Ratliff and George Lynch averaged career highs in rebounds.
Center Matt Geiger averaged a career-high 13.5 points. With the
defense preoccupied with Iverson, Eric Snow, a career backup,
averaged 8.6 points and 6.3 assists as a starter. Iverson, in turn,
credits his teammates for his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are the ones that set the screens for me and get me
the ball in the spots that I need the ball in,'' Iverson said.
``They bring me a lot of energy and they always believe in me, and
for a basketball player, it's important to know that your teammates
are behind you,'' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every one, however, is convinced that Iverson has arrived.
Julius Erving, the most spectacular player in 76er history, was
critical of Iverson after he averaged 28.3 points in the four
playoff games against the Magic. Erving, Orlando's executive vice
president, said he would take Portland's Damon Stoudamire and
Seattle's Gary Payton over Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see him play and I see the way they use him, it's
really a throwback to the pro summer leagues, where you've got a
guy who's going to dribble around until he finds an opening and
then put it up,'' Erving said. ``Philly had the most simplified
offense you can have _ give the ball to Allen and get out of the
way. And if he throws it to you, shoot it. With that offense, it's
going to be a roller coaster ride because some nights he's going to
go 3 for 21 and people will say, `Why are you letting the guy do
all of this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had one of those nights on Tuesday in Indiana, when he
made 7 of 28 shots in scoring 23 points in Game 2. But when he
scored 13 in the fourth quarter as Philadelphia cut a 17-point
deficit to 2 before losing by 85-82, everyone was praising Iverson
for giving his team a chance to win. That is what he will be
expected to do again in Game 3. The 76ers' fortunes depend on it.

SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF 8-YEAR-OLD WAS TIPPED OFF BY A NEIGHBOR,
POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ A man charged with fatally shooting an
8-year-old boy who was a witness in a murder case was tipped off to
his whereabouts by a neighbor who paged the gunman when the boy and
his mother returned from grocery shopping, according to a police
account released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lookout's pay, collected in advance, was a handful of crack
cocaine, according to the police. The bargain was struck after the
neighbor had refused to kill the boy, Leroy Brown Jr., and his
mother, Karen Clarke, for ``a couple of hundred dollars,''
according to documents filed in state Superior Court here.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors previously identified the neighbor as Josephine Lee,
32, who pleaded guilty to serving as a lookout for Adrian Peeler,
23. Leroy was to have testified against Peeler's brother, Russell
Peeler, 27, at his trial in the May 1998 slaying of Ms. Clarke's
fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Peeler brothers, both of Bridgeport, were charged last month
with the Jan. 7 murder of the boy and his mother. Both men pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say that after summoning the gunman by pager, the
neighbor accompanied him to the door of Ms. Clarke's duplex on a
dead-end street here.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman rang the bell and when Ms. Clarke asked, ``Who is
it?'' the neighbor gave a friendly greeting, and Ms. Clarke opened
the door a little bit, according to the account.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said that the gunman ``flew over me and pushed the
door open,'' according to the account. Groceries that the boy and
his mother had dropped in the front hall flew everywhere, and there
was a struggle and a gunshot, the account said. Ms. Clarke's blood
was later found on one of the grocery bags, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said Leroy and his mother fled upstairs, with the
boy yelling as they went, the documents say. The gunman badgered
Ms. Clarke about her son's impending testimony and then shot her,
the neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the shot and the little boy was reaching out for his
mother,'' said the neighbor, who had followed the gunman upstairs,
according to the account. ``He was yelling, `Mommy, mommy, mommy,
mommy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy was still yelling for his mother when he was shot in the
head, the neighbor is said to have told the police. His body was
found face down at the top of the stairs, shot behind his left ear,
in both arms and in his upper back, the authorities said. A stray
bullet was found in the wall near his body.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clarke was shot in the right forearm and twice in the upper
abdomen, the authorities said. Her body was found lying on the
floor of a back bedroom, next to a phone. The receiver was off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   Before the killings, a judge had ordered prosecutors to provide
Leroy's name and address to Russell Peeler's lawyer so a defense
could be prepared, and the police had stopped protecting the boy at
his mother's request.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage about the deaths has spurred an overhaul of
Connecticut's witness-protection laws, and Gov. John G. Rowland has
said he will sign the plan that emerges from the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, according to the police account, told
investigators that the offer of a few hundred dollars to kill Leroy
and his mother had come as the Peeler brothers cooked crack cocaine
in her kitchen. According to the account, after the neighbor
refused, Russell Peeler turned to his brother and Adrian Peeler
said, ``I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan C. Benedict, the state's attorney in Fairfield County,
said the Peelers would not be tried for at least several months
because of the preparation required in a capital case.

CHARISMATIC HAD STUMPED THE EXPERTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The horsemen who competed against
Charismatic in a $62,500 claiming race at Santa Anita on Feb. 11
would like to say they saw Triple Crown potential in the runner-up
that cool Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My crystal ball was broken that day,'' joked Mike Harrington,
trainer of Valley Don, who came in third, a neck behind
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you ever see this coming?'' said Danny Sorenson,
jockey for Valley Don.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised, like everybody,'' said Juan Garcia, trainer of
What Say You, who finished first by a neck in the 6{-furlong
sprint, only to be disqualified for interference, making
Charismatic and jockey Chris McCarron the winners.
</P>
<P>
   If Charismatic wins the June 5 Belmont Stakes to complete
America's first Triple Crown sweep in 21 years, it won't be the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness or the Belmont that defines his
rags-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the race _ five starts before the Derby _ in which
trainer D. Wayne Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis risked him
for a claiming price, the equine equivalent of baseball's waiver
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody bought Charismatic, probably because they agreed with
Lukas' dim appraisal of the one-time $200,000 yearling. To be sure,
nobody imagined finding a Derby winner in a lineup of nine $62,500
claimers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pay much attention to him,'' said trainer Nick
Canani, who did claim eighth-place Devil's Judge out of the same
race.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how far Charismatic has come, consider that the
other eight horses in that race have combined for 22 starts since
then and recorded just two victories. Seventh-place Lee's Jewel
went on to win a $25,000 claimer at Hollywood Park, and ninth-place
Buddynamedme went on to win an allowance-level race at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   What Say You, the disqualified winner, is 0 for 5 since then.
Devil's Judge hasn't raced while recovering from an attack of
colic. Valley Don has been claimed for $40,000 _ also by Nick
Canani _ fourth-place Orca Bay for $32,000, and Lee's Jewel for
$32,000 and $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was Buddynamedme, a close-up fourth turning into the stretch,
who got the worst of the interference attributed to What Say You,
dropping back to last place at the wire. The three Santa Anita
stewards placed What Say You ninth behind Buddynamedme in the
official order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult decision,'' steward Tom Ward said Thursday
after reviewing minutes of the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a bad decision, said Garcia, the trainer, and
Randy Valdez, the jockey for What Say You. They conceded What Say
You veered toward the grandstand in the stretch, bothering
Charismatic, sixth-place Purdue Castle, Devil's Judge and
Buddynamedme. But they maintained that What Say You had to veer to
avoid Valley Don, who was lugging out from the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson, Valley Don's jockey, said What Say You and Valdez
shifted out because they overreacted. Sorenson said Charismatic
deserved to collect the $47,000 winner's purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic was going to win the race (if he hadn't been
impeded),'' Sorenson said in the Hollywood Park barn area Thursday
morning. ``I don't think he was going to win by much, but he was
going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia agreed that Charismatic, who took the turn wide as he and
McCarron rallied from eighth, ``was the best horse in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   He went into it with a 1-for-9 record after finishing last
behind winner General Challenge in the 1 1/16-mile Santa Catalina
Stakes. Trainer Mike Mitchell liked the looks of Charismatic in the
paddock before the Santa Catalina and considered taking the colt
when he was entered in the claiming race.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell said he decided not to put in a claim slip because
of his affection for the Lewises, who give him tickets to the
February drag races in Pomona each year. Mitchell said he doesn't
regret the decision. He admits that although he liked Charismatic,
he didn't see a Kentucky Derby in the 3-year-old's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pitch (to a prospective owner) wouldn't have been, `He can
win the Derby!' '' Mitchell said. ``It would have been, `He can win
for 80 (thousand dollars).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic went off as the bettors' 5-2 third choice in the
Feb. 11 race. He was an insulting 17-1 when he ran second to the
promising Apremont in an allowance sprint eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   His dramatic improvement since then _ apparently the result of a
harder training regimen _ has warmed the hearts of the men who fill
their barns with claiming horses and can only dream of Triple Crown
glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the industry,'' Harrington said. ``This sport
thrives on hope. And this is a horse who at one time was considered
a disappointment who went on to do something great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for him,'' Garcia said, looking ahead to the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't make history themselves, those Feb. 11 losers can
enjoy their roles as footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was joking around with Juan (Garcia),'' said Valdez, who
rode What Say You to the neck victory that was taken away, ``you
better put him in the Belmont, so we can beat Charismatic again.''

CLINTON REMINDS LITTLETON RESIDENTS NOT TO LOSE FAITH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A month to the day after the tragic Columbine
High School shootings occurred, President Clinton brought his
condolences and message of hope to this community where 15 people
died and hundreds have suffered trying to carry on with their lives
in the aftermath of the worst school violence in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several thousand people, including hundreds of
Columbine students, Clinton told the community it had suffered not
only ``terrible losses ... and heartbreak'' caused by the violence
but also the loss of ``a certain kind of innocence'' young people
should not have to part with ``so soon or so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you are left with searing scars and unanswered
questions that must be healed, answered or dealt with as best you
can,'' Clinton said, adding that for many there may never be any
satisfactory answers to shootings and bombings that ripped apart
this quiet Denver suburb a month before students were scheduled to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you cannot lose your faith,'' Clinton counseled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address was at Dakota Ridge High School because
Columbine is still being treated as a murder scene. Columbine
students have been attending classes at another school in
preparation for graduation ceremonies that will take place
Saturday, despite the shooting and bombing rampage that was carried
out on April 20 by Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   The two teen-agers killed 12 of their classmates and one
teacher, and wounded 21 other people before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the commencement ceremony, Clinton noted it would
be ``bittersweet'' for most in the community. He said it would not
be everything Columbine seniors had ``hoped it would be when you
were freshmen.'' But he encouraged them to ``remember that a
commencement is not an end. It is a beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Harris and Klebold, but he spoke of the
``dark forces'' that can ``take over people and make them murder,''
and which, he said, every human being ``must do mortal combat
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Those forces, Clinton said, can tear away at the mind and heart
of anyone who loses faith in themselves and what the future can
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see here today that you have decided not to give your mind
and heart away,'' the president continued. ``I ask you to share it
with all Americans who love you and need you.''
</P>
<P>
   The gymnasium where Clinton spoke was packed with Columbine
students, who wore white T-shirts bearing a slogan that has become
a symbol of pride for this community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Columbine,'' the slogan goes, and the students shouted
it repeatedly as Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, entered the school.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech at Dakota Ridge, Clinton and the first lady
met privately at a nearby Catholic church with some 75 relatives of
the victims of the Columbine violence.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president also spoke by telephone
with five of the wounded students who were still hospitalized
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons moved quietly among the relatives, offering
comforting words and hugs to some and listening as several
recounted stories about a slain child.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had been waiting for an appropriate time for the
Clintons to visit Littleton. The violence erupted as Clinton was
preparing to host the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was later invited to speak here by district school
officials who, White House aides said, asked that he visit one
month to the day after the incident occurred. School officials said
they did not want it to be a memorial service but something that
would help bring ``closure'' for the community.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks before Clinton's speech, the first lady also spoke of
closure and healing, not just for Littleton, but the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at Columbine has had an impact unlike any I have
ever seen or felt: It has pierced the heart of America,'' she said,
adding that the strength and commitment ``to rebuild'' shown by the
community here has inspired the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton also referred to the school shooting in
Conyers, Ga., Thursday morning in which six students were injured
when one of their classmates suddenly opened fire with a gun.
Thankfully, Clinton said, the students who were wounded are
expected to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if this can happen here, it can happen
anywhere,'' Clinton said. ``Your tragedy, though it is unique in
its magnitude, is not an isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there would be ``no more fitting monument or
tribute to those who died than to promise ourselves that we will do
everything we can to prevent it from happening anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on all Americans to ``take what happened in
Columbine, and not only never forget it, but use it to make more
opportunities for others to live the kind of lives we would have
wished for those who were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech moved some in the crowd to tears. But the
gathering here seemed more like a pep rally with the students
shouting ``We are Columbine'' and cheering enthusiastically for the
president and first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the Clintons, said Columbine freshman Vickie Abel,
15, ``really meant a lot to us. It's going to make us stronger.''

IMMUNEX GETS A $450 MILLION INFUSION FROM AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS
INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Immunex Corp. on Thursday issued a $450 million note
to American Home Products Corp., giving the Seattle biotech company
the largest infusion of cash in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible subordinated note with an interest rate of 3
percent was bought by American Home Products, which owns a majority
stake in the company, in a private placement. Immunex plans to use
the money to accelerate clinical development of new drugs, to begin
planning for its new research headquarters in Seattle and to expand
its commercial manufacturing capacities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help the company unlock the value of its scientific
discoveries by accelerating development of products,'' said Andrew
Heyward, analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. ``In Immunex's
case, they are discovery rich and cash- and infrastructure-poor
(with respect to) getting drugs into the clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has the capacity to take one new drug into
clinical trials a year, wants to increase that capacity to four new
drugs a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company can't develop (the new drugs) themselves,
they'd have to license them out,'' said Heyward. ``So from a common
shareholder's perspective, this is a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to use the money to look for strategic
acquisitions of products, technologies or other businesses, and to
increase the sales of Enbrel, its recently approved drug for
rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new financial resources fuel our strategic plan and help
Immunex capitalize on global opportunities for continued growth,''
said Ed Fritzky, chairman and chief executive officer of Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   The note is convertible to common stock at a price of $173.68
per share, a 30 percent premium over the average price over the
past eight trading days.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products may convert the note into common stock of
Immunex at any time, including in response to a notice of
redemption by Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex can redeem the note in three years, provided that its
closing stock price for 20 consecutive trading days is at least
$208.42 a share. After four years, Immunex can call the note at any
time as long as its closing stock price for 20 consecutive trading
days exceeds or equals the conversion price.
</P>
<P>
   If American Home Products were to convert the note, it would
increase its ownership in the company from 54.11 percent to 55.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the close of the AHP financing, Immunex has about $640
million in cash and current assets.

LEHTINEN, FORSBERG HAVE COMPETITION DEEPER THAN NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jere Lehtinen remembers playing against Peter
Forsberg way back when, back before Forsberg became a $38 million,
NHL poster boy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty long ago, eh?'' said Lehtinen, a
less-than-$2-million-a-season winger in Dallas. ``I don't know how
many years, 10 maybe. I was like 16, 17. I think we play every year
after that, and of course, I keep track of him because he's such a
good player ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen let his thought trail into silence, a hint of animosity
tinged his words. His familiarity with Forsberg began in games
between Sweden and Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg's a Swede. Lehtinen's a Finn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they like each other very much,'' Stars winger
Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``It's an extra little thing and you can
notice it. It's definitely a Finn-Swede thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So no,'' Lehtinen said, the two players are ``not like
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Finns and Swedes have issues, kind of like Baby Boomers and
Gen-Xers do. So a sort of national-trash talk begins, on topics
from politics to weather to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than if you play against some other country,''
Lehtinen admits, ``because we are neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems neighborly familiarity also breeds rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen and Forsberg once again renew the Finn-Swede thing when
the Avalanche meet the Stars in Game 1 of the Western Conference
finals scheduled for 6:30 p.m. tomorrow at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Forsberg has his rival beat in marketability, becoming
an NHL superstar while media guys struggle to pronounce Lehtinen
(leh-TIH-nehn) even though Lehtinen won the Selke Trophy last
season as the game's best defensive forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen has had his rival's number in face-to-face matchups, as
Forsberg has struggled against Dallas. The Swede has zero goals and
four assists in the past two seasons playing against Lehtinen and
his Stars teammates.
</P>
<P>
   His usual defender?
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I see with Lehtinen is there's a rivalry that goes
deeper than just the NHL,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It's
like: `Not on my shift.' When you give Lehtinen a challenge, he
really embraces that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forsberg presents a Jaromir Jagr-like challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He had eight points in Colorado's last four games of the Western
Conference semifinal series against Detroit, including game-opening
and game-clinching goals in a series-clinching 5-2 victory in Game
6.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, and his linemates Mike Modano and Brett Hull, likely
will be asked to slow Forsberg and his linemates Valeri Kamensky
and Claude Lemieux in this series, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real big key,'' Modano said of Forsberg. ``He controls
the tempo of the game when he's on the ice with his patience, with
his strength on the puck, with his ability to make passes and make
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to hold onto it as long as he wants to. When he's
doing that, it allows time for Lemieux andKamensky and those guys
to get open and find ice. Those two guys feed a lot off Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen does, too.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to play Forsberg. It is a chance to prove he's just as
good and another chance for him to prove that Finland's better than
Sweden. Lehtinen takes this chance very seriously. Just ask his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we played, Forsberg gave him a pretty good
shot,'' Langenbrunner said. ``Jere usually just shrugs those off,
but he turned around and whacked him pretty good. It's fun to
watch. It's good to see Jere play that way, with a little
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like friends.

PUTTER SAVES SINGH'S OPENING R0UND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Early this month, Vijay Singh finished in a
tie for fifth at the Shell Houston Open, his second consecutive
top-10 finish and fourth of the year. So, what did he do to
celebrate?
</P>
<P>
   He took two weeks off to practice his putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving Houston, where I putted really badly, I told myself,
`If I want to win tournaments, I can't do it by putting the way I
did in Houston, or the way I did two weeks before that \Rat
Greensboro, N.C\.S,'' Singh said. ``I had two weeks off and ... all
I did was putt for a long time. I think I should do more of that
rather than just going out and hit balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in the first round of the MasterCard Colonial at
Colonial Country Club, Singh's dedication to his short game paid
off. He holed putts of 20, 25 and 10 feet for birdies on the back
nine after dropping a 30-footer for eagle at No. 1 en route to an
opening round 3-under-par 67 and a tie for second place, one shot
behind first-day leader Steve Flesch.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only Singh's putting that worked. He employed a deft
short game overall, getting up and down from precarious positions
at the 12th, 15th and 16th holes to save his round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted really good today,'' Singh said. ``Today was probably
the best short-game round I've had for a long time. I did miss a
lot of greens, but I got up and down a lot. Considering all that,
I'm pleased to finish 3 under.''
</P>
<P>
   A good short game was the requirement of the day as the gusty
winds made club selection difficult and landing anything close to
the pin a near impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult day,'' said Singh, the defending PGA
champion who won earlier this year at the Honda Classic in Florida.
``The winds were all over the place. I think it's the hardest round
of golf I've played, considering the wind. It wasn't consistent. It
was gusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh said judging distances presented pros with a quandary all
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick a right club even from 110 yards away,'' he
said. ``It's more or less gusting and you're hoping the wind will
stay the same way you think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Singh mastered Colonial's greens, he said they were
difficult to navigate, too, because they are firm and getting
firmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking a right club and trying to stop it on the green is
another thing,'' he said. ``I think it's going to be a very
high-scoring tournament.''

OTHERS GONE WITH THE WIND, BUT NOT COURSE-WISE SLUMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was a swirling wind, a mocking wind. It
was the kind of day where the golfers at Colonial didn't know
whether they needed a 3-wood or a windsock.
</P>
<P>
   If cussing were allowed on the PGA Tour, we would have a page
full of it today.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we bring you the continuing exploits of golfer Jeff
Sluman, the human windsock.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-7 and an unimposing 140 pounds, Sluman strikes you as
the kind of guy who should have been tethered to the No. 9
flagstick yesterday, rather than ensconced near the top of the
MasterCard Colonial leader board.
</P>
<P>
   But, indeed, there he sits _ yet again.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the fickle gusts made par a precious novelty,
Sluman shot a 3-under 67, slipping in under the Doppler radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days like today,'' Sluman explained, ``if you understand
the trajectory of the shots you hit, that's the key to playing
Colonial well all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in other words, was not the day to tee it high and
let it fly. Those mighty thrusts were last seen headed toward the
Fort Worth Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly and Paul Stankowski each shot 80. There are
trajectories ... and then there are trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   But though he has never won here, Sluman continues to be a
veritable Colonial Merlin. In 12 tries, he has six finishes in the
top 14, including a second place in 1996 and a third to Tom Watson
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate here,'' Sluman said. ``I think I've played
well just about every time I've been here. I think generally I have
a pretty good feel of how to play the golf course well.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for any of the other players,'' Sluman said,
issuing his disclaimer. ``But it's my opinion that any time you're
in Texas and the wind starts blowing like this, if the golf course
will let you and you can hit it close to the ground, you need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluman was making his seemingly annual visit to the media
interview room, as the leaders are urged to do. In last year's
Colonial, Sluman lashed down rounds of 67-67-66-69 for his
third-place check. In 1997, he put together scores of 66-69-68-70.
In 1996, he shot 69-67-70-68, missing the stylish plaid jacket by
two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Sluman, in a nutshell, hasn't been over par at Colonial in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I love it here,'' he said yesterday. ``I love par 70s.
That's my type of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial's reputation as a course where the driver might not be
the savviest choice in the golf bag doesn't faze the 41-year-old
Sluman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys actually might \Rthink it is\S,'' said the
Rochester, N.Y., native. `` But those will probably be the guys
who'll be packing up tomorrow at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   To record his 67, Sluman had to chip in _ twice _ from 15 feet.
He birdied the 420-yard seventh hole, reaching with a 3-wood and
sand wedge. A driver and 3-wood left him with a 12-foot putt for an
eagle on the par-5 11th, but he had to settle for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as short as some people believe,'' Sluman offered.
</P>
<P>
   He meant ``short'' off the tee. But let's be blunt here: Sluman
looks like he could fit in Daly's golf bag. He has freckles and
could pass for the club pro at Mayberry Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to interview someone truly meaningful, he said, talk
to his wife Linda. She is Dr. Sluman, a medical oncologist,
treating cancer patients in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does the important things,'' Jeff said. ``She saves lives.
I just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluman, however, has belted out a modestly successful 19-year
career on the golf tour. His career earnings total more than $7
million and his victory at the Sony Open in Hawaii last January was
his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 events this year, the consistent Sluman has missed a cut
only once.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his name remains curiously missing from the Colonial Wall
of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would nag me if, maybe, I had lost by a shot after I had
missed a back-handed putt in the first round, or something like
that,'' he said. ``But if I shot 12 or 13 under and a guy shot
better than me, then I would just shake your hand and say
congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done it here before. But Jeff Sluman has conquered the
gusts at Colonial so often over the past four years, his time seems
due. \Ntagtop:Gil LeBreton, (817) 390-7760

FLESCH FIRES 66 DESPITE UNPREDICTABLE GUSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One by one, they scaled the MasterCard
Colonial leader board, only to be blown back to the pack by
swirling, 25 mph wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoch briefly separated himself from the field, but
surrendered five strokes to par over his final seven holes. Several
other golfers exchanged the lead like unwanted Christmas presents
on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, second-year pro Steve Flesch seized control of the
tournament with back-to-back birdies while playing in the
next-to-last group of yesterday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch's 66 marked the best effort by any golfer during the
highest-scoring opening round at Colonial in 10 years. Of 112
starters, only 15 broke even-par 70 on a day when Colonial played
to a scoring average of 72.38. It marked the fewest sub-par rounds
to open a Colonial since 1989, a fact that provided a pleasant
surprise for Flesch as he prepared for a 2 p.m. tee time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the wind, you always think someone is going to get
really low out here every day,'' said Flesch, who offset two bogeys
with six birdies to finish at 4-under par. ``I figured someone
would have gotten to 5 or 6 under by the time I started. But I
looked up on the board and the best I saw was 2 under. I was
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start late, that gives you a whole different mindset
than seeing a 9 under up there, like we did last week \Rat the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic\S. You see something like that and think, `If
I don't shoot 4 or 5 under, I'm going to get lapped out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Flesch who did the lapping with some crisp
short-iron play. Of his six birdie putts, none traveled longer than
15 feet and four were from four feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   His birdie-birdie finish allowed Flesch, the 1998 PGA Tour
rookie of the year, to carve out a one stroke lead over PGA champ
Vijay Singh (3 under) and Jeff Sluman (3 under). He stands two
strokes ahead of a six-player group at 2 under, highlighted by
Steve Elkington and John Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Among first-round leaders at PGA Tour events this season, only
frontrunners at the Masters (3 under) found themselves closer to
even par than Flesch after 18 holes. Singh said he was not
surprised by the fact that bogeys (422) outnumbered birdies (238)
by almost a 2-1 margin in yesterday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hardest round of golf I've played this year,''
said Singh, who drained birdie putts of 20 and 25 feet, as well as
an eagle putt from 30 feet at No. 1. ``You couldn't really pick the
right club, even when you were 100 yards away. The wind changed
direction, it seemed like, nearly every other shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluman, who chipped in twice for birdies during his opening
round, said he frequently found himself between clubs because of
gusts that shifted from Southeast to Southwest at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trajectory of your shot is the key on a day like this. You
can't let the ball get hung up in the wind,'' said Sluman, who
predicted the winning total for 72 holes could be no more than
8-under if similar conditions prevail through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Flesch finds himself halfway home. He began his day with
a 10-foot par save at No. 1, then peppered approach shots within
four feet of the cup at Nos. 2, 7 and 8, setting up
momentum-turning birdies. But the biggest birdies proved to be from
12 and 15 feet, respectively, on the two closing holes.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch's secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate not to hit a lot of half-shots out there,''
Flesch said. ``On most of my birdies, I could take full swings with
the approach. When you have the wind blowing like that, you don't
want to have to finagle an 8-iron, 9-iron or pitching wedge because
you might not make a very good swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should a player rest too comfortably with the lead when 61
pursuers are within six strokes after 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the chance to be leading overnight, it builds more
confidence,'' Flesch said. ``But the way these scores are bunched,
this tournament is wide open. We have three more long days here at
Colonial.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll seem even longer, rest assured, if they continue to
include swirling, 25 mph wind gusts.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a vote of 73-25, the Senate Thursday night
passed a broad juvenile crime bill that contained an array of new
gun-control measures, the fruit of the most significant debate over
gun control in Congress in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures ranged from a requirement that licensed dealers
sell child safety devices with every handgun to mandatory
background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun shows. The
amendments to the juvenile crime bill also restricted the access
that children under 18 have to semi-automatic assault weapons and
banned the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than any of these measures was the fact
that they came up for consideration _ and, in some cases, drew
bipartisan support _ at all. That fact reflected an undeniable
shift in the political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Although surprising momentum has grown in the Senate in recent
weeks for gun control measures, they are still relatively modest
and fall short of proposals for more stringent regulation. Yet the
progress represents the biggest victory for the gun control
advocates in five years, and they come as a new political center is
developing on guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had once chalked up the loss of their majority in
Congress in 1994 to their advocacy for gun control, suddenly sensed
that the issue had turned in their favor and pressed forward with
gun-control proposals. Many Republicans acquiesced, more skittish
about seeming soft on gun control than alienating the gun lobby or
their most conservative, rural constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But the most charged moment of the day came hours before the
bill's passage, when Vice President Al Gore made a rare Senate
appearance and cast a tie-breaking vote that enabled a Democratic
gun-control amendment to prevail over a less stringent Republican
version.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-50 vote on the amendment, which would require background
checks with the sale of firearms at gun shows, reversed the outcome
of a similar vote last week and was easily the most stunning of a
string of Democratic victories on gun control in the Senate over
the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided Gore, whose campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination has yet to catch fire, with a heady
triumph. Democrats believe that American sentiment about firearms
has turned toward their party's advocacy of tighter restrictions,
and Gore got to carry that banner by playing the knight who arrived
in the nick of time to save a teetering cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voted less than four hours after bullets ripped through yet
another high school, in Conyers, Ga. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said
the shooting was a factor in his decision to switch his vote in
favor of his party's measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, for his part, was visiting Littleton, Colo.,
where the shooting deaths of 15 people at a high school last month
altered the political climate enough to make Thursday's events in
the Senate possible. The legislation faces uncertain odds in the
House, where there have been conflicting signals about lawmakers'
receptiveness to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' said Gore, a
radiant smile glued to his face, at a news conference after he left
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   More somberly, Gore added, ``Now I personally would like to
dedicate my tie-breaking vote to all of the families that have
suffered from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours later, after debates and votes on less heavily
freighted amendments, the Senate passed the juvenile crime bill,
73-25. The core of the bill, which became a vehicle for several
gun-control amendments and the most significant gun-control debate
in Congress in half a decade, calls for $1 billion in federal
grants to toughen prosecution of juvenile crime and enhance efforts
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill before the House Judiciary Committee does not
have gun-control measures in it. But the committee's chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced Thursday that such amendments would
be considered when the committee met to reshape the bill in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time in Gore's vice presidency that he
broke a tie in the Senate, over which the vce president technically
presides.
</P>
<P>
   As votes on the last of several gun-control amendments trickled
in around midday, Gore took a seat at the head of the chamber. When
it became clear that a tie was likely, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., giggled and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the vice
president. Other Senate Democrats rushed over to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans have a 55-to-45 advantage in the Senate,
six Republicans who have repeatedly broken party ranks on gun
control sided with Democrats Thursday, while only one Democrat, Max
Baucus of Montana, sided with Republicans. That created the tie.
</P>
<P>
   On the final bill, 31 Republicans and 42 Democrats voted in
favor of passage, while 23 Republicans and two Democrats voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republicans who opposed it did so largely on ground that
Democrats had succeeded in amending the bill to include both new
gun-control measures and a greater emphasis on prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Senate voted on the gun show amendment,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called a news conference to
raise a different issue: the leaking of nuclear secrets during the
Clinton administration to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the success of the Democratic gun-show amendment,
which he opposed, Lott said that the Democrats' campaign for gun
control was largely political preening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns don't cause people to do these things,'' Lott said.
``Something in their beings is doing it. When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a statement released in Littleton, said, ``I
applaud the Senate for today's historic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official described the Lott news conference as
an attempt to divert attention away from his party's gun-control
``debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gun-show amendment, which would mandate
background checks on all people buying weapons at these shows,
joined a series of a half dozen gun-control measures that have
passed as amendments to the juvenile crime bill. Many of the
measures garnered broad Republican support, an unmistakable sign of
changed times.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Democratic gun-show amendment was the last
strange twist in a bizarre chain of gun-show votes that had
Republicans switching their course or tweaking their position from
one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic gun-show amendment first came up for a vote
a week ago, Senate Republicans defeated it, 51-47, in a largely
party-line vote. Instead, they approved a rival Republican
amendment that called for voluntary background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Senate Republicans rethought their position and
passed a new gun-show amendment that they said made background
checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that the combined Republican amendments
actually relaxed existing gun-control regulations in other areas.
So the Republicans came back with a third amendment, intended to
address concerns about the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment passed Thursday. But only minutes later, the
original Democratic amendment, modified slightly and reintroduced,
supplanted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new outcome was explained in part by the presence of two
Democrats _ Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Daniel
Inouye of Hawaii _ who had been absent last week but voted in favor
of the amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critically, Sen. Cleland of Georgia, one of only two
Democrats who had opposed the measure last week, changed his vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that, because of subtle revisions to the original
Democratic amendment, he had almost firmly decided to switch his
vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that awaking Thursday morning to news of the
shooting in his home state erased any tiny, lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to occur in my own state, in my own back yard,
reinforced and steeled my commitment,'' Cleland said. ``It pushed
me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat to vote against his party Thursday was Max
Baucus of Montana, whose position suggested the degree to which
geography trumps party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six Republicans who joined Democrats last week and
again Thursday were from the Midwest, where support for easy access
to firearms is not as fierce as in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio.
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator John Warner of
Virginia also voted for the Democratic amendment.
</P>
<P>
   These senators said they had problems with several aspects of
the Republican gun-show measures that even a third amendment did
not fix. The measures, for example, would have made it less
cumbersome for licensed gun dealers to sell weapons in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also would have shortened from three business days
to 24 hours the amount of time given to vendors at gun shows to
conduct background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big loophole,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had lobbied against the
Democratic gun-show amendment and, after the vote, said that the
Senate had not addressed a larger problem: lax enforcement of
existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that the association's influence was clearly
waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen today now is, for the first time in a major
kind of gun-control issue, rejection of the National Rifle
Association and a vote for common sense,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control measures in the juvenile crime bill include a
requirement that licensed gun dealers sell child safety devices
with every handgun; a prohibition on gun ownership for anyone who
commits a violent crime as a juvenile, and new restrictions on the
purchase and possession of semi-automatic assault rifles for
children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus' vote suggested the degree to which geography could trump
party affiliation on gun-control issues.
</P>

AT LAST, CHARISMATIC LOOKS TO BE FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charismatic, the onetime claimer who won the Kentucky Derby at
odds of 31-1 and two weeks later won the Preakness at 8-1, was back
in his barn at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., on Thursday
preparing for the Belmont Stakes two weeks from Saturday.
Charismatic will probably face a full field of 15 rivals, but will
no longer be a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to do a lot,'' said his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas,
who has swept the Triple Crown with two horses in the same year but
never with one. ``The big story line is going to be, can he come
back from two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, three weeks? We'll let
him dictate his own schedule leading to the Belmont. We're probably
looking at a light work Monday or Tuesday, then another light work
Monday or Tuesday the following week.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charismatic tries the mile-and-a-half Belmont, he will not
be running at long odds. He will be the favorite at maybe 2-1 as he
tries to sweep the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 horses have done it, and none since Affirmed in 1978.
Fourteen horses failed to do it when they lost the Belmont,
including two in the final strides in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the unusual feats of durability in recent years,
Charismatic has handled this series of races: fourth in the Santa
Anita Derby on April 3, first in the Lexington Stakes on April 18,
first in the Kentucky Derby on May 1 and first in the Preakness on
May 15. Then it's the Belmont on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont a Possibility for Silverbulletday
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 fillies have run in the Belmont Stakes in 130 years,
only two have won it, and none has won it since Tanya, 94 years
ago. So it is not considered very likely that Silverbulletday will
buck those odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we would want to do that to her,'' her
trainer, Bob Baffert, said from Churchill Downs. ``We'd have to
figure out if she'd like to go a mile and a half and see how she's
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He said after the Preakness that he would not try
Silverbulletday against colts until later this summer, maybe in
Monmouth Park's Haskell Invitational in August, when she would be
older and the money greener: $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But he got caught in a war of words this week about running in
the Belmont. The prize might be the Horse of the Year title. The
rub might be Bob Lewis, who owns Charismatic but is also a major
client of Baffert's. Lewis has said, in effect, that the more the
merrier. But it is not clear if Baffert would want to ruin Lewis'
shot at the Triple Crown or wants to tempt fate by breaking the
pattern of success for his prize filly.

 &HT;    Every school's dread erupts into reality in Georgia shooting
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Exactly one month after the fatal shootings in
Littleton, Colo., a suicidal high school student, angry over
breaking up with his girlfriend, turned his anger on the world
Thursday, shooting six of his classmates and emotionally scarring
countless others.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, a
middle-class community about 25 miles east of Atlanta. Five victims
suffered minor injuries, and a 15-year-old, Stephanie Laster,
underwent surgery after a bullet struck her in the buttocks and
entered her intestines.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, the 15-year-old unleashed a barrage of
bullets into a crowd of students waiting for school to start. Known
to talk big about his guns, friends said, the boy started shooting
at about 8 a.m. into a crowd of about 300 students in the lobby
near the cafeteria. Authorities say he was looking to shoot the boy
who had stolen his girl, though that person was not in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled youth surrendered in tears minutes after firing. By
the end of the day, he was charged with aggravated assault. As the
rapid-fire shots ruptured the morning calm, panicked students
dropped to the floor, leapt behind tables, or ran out the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' sophomore Kylie Forrester
said, describing the gunshots that chased the students outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole school, everybody, was just roaring out of the
school,'' said Amy Ladd, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the cautious wake of Columbine, some signs of trouble
were seen and apparently ignored at Heritage. The day before the
shootings, classmate Nathaniel Deeter heard the distraught youth
speaking of his failed romance, saying he wanted to take his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago he spoke of bringing a gun to school. ``I told him it
was stupid,'' said Deeter, who didn't think enough of the threat to
tell school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the troubled boy's grades and his relationship with his
parents were suffering, and he had told several fellow students he
carried a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Police say he rode on the school bus with the .22-caliber rifle
stuffed in a book bag. He had sawed off much of the wooden stock to
make it fit.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read said one charge of
aggravated assault was filed in Juvenile Court against the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected that multiple aggravated assault charges,
possibly as many as 30, will be brought in Juvenile Court. And he
said he will move to transfer the charges to Superior Court,
possibly next week, where the 15-year-old could be charged as an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school, breathless students hugged one another for
comfort. A half dozen linked hands in a circle and bowed their
heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Some at first thought the firecracker-like clamor was a prank,
coming on the last day of senior class, when yearbooks and prom
pictures were to be handed out. The day before, 2,000 crickets were
released in the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Deeter recalled chatting with his classmate 10 minutes before he
started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you had broken up with your girlfriend,'' Deeter had
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm real mad about it,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   The boy looked distant and removed as he spoke of the failed
relationship, a romance of two years that had ended this week,
Deeter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was thinking about something else,'' said
Deeter, who moved away.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later came the gunfire. ``He shot the kid next to
me in the foot,'' Deeter said of the boy, who was wearing jeans and
a baggy, blue pullover.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be firing quickly and randomly. Deeter said he
screamed at him: ``What are you doing?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was shooting, it was as though he was looking right
through people,'' Jason Cheek and Brian Barnhardt were shot in the
buttocks. Ryan Rosa, a junior, was shot in the right ankle. Cania
Collins was shot in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Hoy thought the first shot was a firecracker. The second
sounded real enough, and the third shot sliced into his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to run, but it started hurting pretty bad,'' said
Hoy, 18. ``I took off my boot and blood was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and parents got him and the other injured students to
the front lawn, from where they were rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished shooting, the former Boy Scout, described by
students as quietly rebellious, dropped his rifle and backed his
way outside. He pulled out a handgun and put it in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 minutes, a few teachers repeatedly asked him to
put down the gun and step away from it. The youth didn't say a
word, as if in a daze, and kept the gun in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Then a teacher walked up to him and said, ``Let me have the
gun.'' According to senior Joe Watts, who watched from a window,
the teen handed the revolver to the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant Principal Cecil) Brinkley put his arm around him,''
Watts said. ``The guy started crying and saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so
scared.'''
</P>
<P>
   That the shooting happened in suburban Atlanta, in a school
known for parental involvement and good academics, has heightened
fear in many parents, students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are no longer immune to guns, drugs and violence,''
said Pam Riley, executive director of the Center for the Prevention
of School Violence in North Carolina. ``But I don't think that all
schools should panic and close. Then the terrorism will win out.
What we need to do is provide ways for kids to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting shattered what should have been a gorgeous last day
of school for Heritage seniors. Some had thought of taking the day
off. It was a sun-drenched morning filled with the promise of
summer. Graduation awaits next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they had finally shaken off the anxiety
that followed the killing of 15 people at Columbine High School in
Colorado, a school similar in many ways to Heritage. Both schools
serve predominantly white, suburban, middle-class neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage High School was named one of the top 10 schools in the
metro Atlanta area by U.S. News and World Report. About 80 percent
of Heritage graduates go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   The school has video surveillance cameras in the hallways and an
armed sheriff's deputy on duty.
</P>
<P>
   After the carnage at Columbine, Heritage was among many metro
Atlanta school who felt the reverberations. Letters were sent out
to parents assuring them the school was safe. But, like many
schools, Heritage has endured bomb threats in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though school will be closed at least today, many students said
they would be frightened to enter those doors again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of thought it could happen here. It could happen
anywhere,'' said Shayna McClelland. ``I don't feel safe here
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not'' going back to Heritage, said Julie Kull. ``I'm
home-schooling or something. I'm not going back there.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I just want to know why.''
</P>
<P>
   With television crews broadcasting the frightened faces of
Heritage students, a collective angst swept through many schools
and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Principals across metro Atlanta scrambled to figure out what to
do next and how to prevent a similar occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, already in a heightened state of concern since
Columbine, suggested simply canceling the rest of the school year,
bringing down the curtain on a year brimming with fear. Others
called for metal detectors and more police in the schools, outcries
that have been echoed for weeks following Columbine and the spate
of bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
   School safety has been catapulted to the top of the social
agenda. After Thursday's shootings, Cobb County school officials
are considering asking for additional police support in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Security was doubled at McCleskey Middle School in Cobb, with a
sheriff's deputy joining the campus officer. At Cobb's Walton High,
side entrances to the school were sealed off and visitors were not
allowed on campus Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Warr, principal at Sandy Creek High School in north
Fayette County, plans to address the student body today. He said he
will urge students to help keep the school safe by breaking their
code of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell them there's a difference between childish
tattling and passing on critical information that someone is
considering something serious such as suicide or murder,'' Warr
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the horror and fear and desire to stop such incidents
has brought people together. That process began right at the time
of the shootings, as students such as Greg Bluemling assisted a
girl who had been shot. He and other students helped her into a
room, where they applied pressure to stop the bleeding. A teacher
came in with a first aid kit and they used gauze to stanch the
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, people gathered to pray at the Church in the
Now's youth ministry, where they prayed for the students and the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely seeing the glass half full, and I'm so
relieved we are not planning a funeral,'' said Bishop Jim Earl
Swilley.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes planned to meet today with the families of
students injured in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating not to have an easy solution,'' Barnes said.
``I want to give the people a solution, but this will take more
than just me. This is not the time to have a knee-jerk reaction,
but to ponder the long-term solutions that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's crime claimed more than just six victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real heartbreaking, it really was _ even for the ones
who didn't know who got shot,'' said Amber Barnhart, standing
outside Rockdale Hospital on Thursday afternoon. Her brother Brian
was among the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say they've had more of these threats and problems
than they can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's springtime, when there are pranks and high spirits
anyway, and unfortunately we have this horrible tragedy at
Columbine hanging over us. And we have students who are perhaps
unstable themselves,'' said Tim Callahan, spokesman for the
Professional Association of Georgia Educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school year cannot end soon enough,'' he added.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, is
advocating that the alliance needs to begin soon to assemble 45,000
to 50,000 troops on Kosovo's borders, American and NATO officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The force would be intended to increase pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, to accept NATO's terms for a
settlement. It is one of three things _ including the use of Apache
helicopters in Albania and tougher steps to cut off Yugoslavia's
supply of oil _ that Clark sought to bolster the military campaign.
In conversations with U.S. officials, he warned that NATO might not
prevail with air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you prepare for ground forces, among other things, you make
Milosevic contemplate the consequences of not going along with the
political objectives'' of NATO's campaign, one official said,
describing Clark's message.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to move ahead with the deployment came at a time
when diplomatic efforts to forge a solution were developing on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, met outside
Moscow Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had just returned from talks with Milosevic in
Belgrade, where Goran Matic, an influential Minister Without
Portfolio, said, ``I think we can expect a political settlement in
the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomacy and Clark's visit to Washington _ his first since
NATO's summit here a month ago _ came at a time of divisions within
NATO about the course of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and other capitals, political pressure has grown
to end the conflict. Earlier this week, Britain called on NATO to
do basically what Clark is proposing: build up allied forces in
Albania and Macedonia as a way to increase pressure on Milosevic.
After President Clinton declined to rule out ground troops on
Tuesday, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, bluntly and
forcefully derided the use of ground troops and said his country
would block NATO from fighting any war on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The force Clark is considering would be intended to enter Kosovo
only after the bombing ended, officials here said. The deployment
of the force, which would need the approval of NATO's 19 members,
would also leave open the option of a ground invasion should the
air campaign ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton said the alliance needed to stay ``focused
and patient'' while it pursued its goal: allowing Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians to return to their villages and live with a degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the campaign is working,'' he said. ``Each day we
hear reports of desertions in the Serbian army, dissension in
Belgrade, unrest in Serbian communities. President Milosevic should
know that he cannot change the fundamental terms that we have
outlined, because they are simply what is required for the Kosovars
to go home and live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke after meeting at the White House with his national
security advisers to discuss NATO's progress. Clark did not attend
that meeting, nor did he appear in public.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he spent the day across the Potomac River in closed
meetings at the Pentagon with Secretary of Defense William Cohen;
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton; the
vice chairman, Gen. Joseph Ralston, and the senior officers of the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and the Pentagon have portrayed the campaign as a
success, Clark provided a more sober assessment of its status and
its prospects, officials familiar with the meetings said. While
Clark said nearly two months of bombing had exacted a heavy toll on
Yugoslavia's armed forces, he warned that it might not be enough to
force Milosevic to relent.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the general said he could not guarantee that
NATO objectives would be met by the bombing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Clark did not propose using ground forces to drive Yugoslavia's
military and police units from Kosovo. The officials said there is
virtually no possibility that the alliance would approve a land
war, especially given Chancellor Schroeder's forceful remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's staff has also updated NATO's plans for the size of the
force that would be needed to repatriate refugees, to 48,000, from
28,000 estimated as the air war began.
</P>
<P>
   While the exact mission and composition of the force still must
be approved by NATO's political leaders, Clark has proposed
starting to build up the force within the next few weeks, even
before a diplomatic solution is reached, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the force would not be designed to evict Yugoslav
forces from Kosovo, Clark and other NATO leaders are said to
believe that the simple presence of thousands of allied ground
troops, including as many as 7,000 Americans, would intimidate
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In his meetings Thursday, Clark emphasized that NATO needed to
consider what steps it will take as winter edges closer, raising
the specter of hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees in
threadbare camps in Macedonia, Albania or, worse, still in the
hills and forests of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the NATO allies, Britain has argued most forcefully for
ground troops, saying NATO needed to begin deploying at least a
vanguard by June in order to be ready for either a settlement or
the possibility of a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's view, the officials said, was that ``preparations are
more likely to bring the political solution you want.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether NATO, let alone the Clinton
administration, will agree.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night Cohen released an unusual statement saying
Clark had ``made no request for the deployment of ground troops and
no request for any change in NATO's policy.'' But Cohen did not
address the general's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark has advocated a tougher approach before, only to
have NATO or Washington overrule him or scale back his proposals.
NATO's political leaders are still wrangling over the details of
enforcing a naval blockade of oil. They have rejected Clark's
request to use force.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has also withheld approval of using two dozen
Apache helicopters and long-range rockets sent to Albania more than
a month ago. On the early buildup of ground forces, one military
official questioned the effectiveness of the threat to Milosevic.
``You don't pretend you are preparing to do something you're not
going to do,'' the official said. ``You encourage him to call your
bluff.''

LET'S DO THE HUMANE THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of the mindless fun of playing along with ESPN's
SportsCentury Top 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century, aside
from trying to belch it fast three times after downing a Big Gulp,
is trying to guess who'll come next.
</P>
<P>
   After Oscar Robertson was announced as No. 36, I made up a rough
list to see how many true athletes were left that could fill the
other 35. I came up with about 40 names.
</P>
<P>
   Stupidly, I didn't bet on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 35, the '73 Triple Crown winner Secretariat will be
featured on today's regular weekly segment at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention Secretariat is A HORSE?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Mickey Mantle came in at No. 37. Sandy Koufax
was No. 42. Sorry, guys. You were great. But a horse _ he was
better than you.
</P>
<P>
   Will John Elway make the list? If not, you're gonna have to be
the one to tell him he's been bumped for that logo on the side of
his helmet. Too bad for him; he has the teeth but was born with two
fewer legs.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Secretariat isn't just any horse. But he was, by
all accounts, still a horse, genetically created in this case to do
one task. Two other equines _ Man O'War at No. 84 and Citation at
No. 97 _ also made ESPN's list of the top 100. But that's when the
horsing around should have been stopped.
</P>
<P>
   You let one animal in, you've opened the barn door _ donkeys,
dogs, chickens and pigs. All of which are some things these
athletes have been CALLED at one point, but, in reality, THEY
weren't the actual beast. And that was an important distinction.
Aside from what former boxer John ``The Beast'' Mugabi or ex-relief
pitcher Brad ``The Animal'' Lasky might say.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Secretariat, but there's got to be some strict rules here
if this ESPN end-of-the-century gimmick is going to fly. We
suggest:
</P>
<P>
   1) Anything with a tail _ out.
</P>
<P>
   2) Something that can be turned into another form of athletic
equipment doesn't qualify. Think horsehide, pigskin and baseball
gloves. And who-knows-what's been used to string tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   3) If it can't be interviewed, it can't be on the list. So,
again, Steve Carlton has no shot.
</P>
<P>
   4) Something that gives rides to undersized men and women can't
be on the list. Same for anything that grew up in a petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   5) You can't include something that can only count on two things
in life _ death and a taxidermist.
</P>
<P>
   Or why not just go with Webster's definition: An athlete is ``a
person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games
requiring physical strength, agility or stamina.'' A horse is a
horse, a horse of course.
</P>
<P>
   We watch Kentucky's Demolition Derby each year and get chills
when that pack of 238 round the final turn and begin jousting for
position. But there's no mistake _ these are horses, with humans on
top of them. Or, in the case of that pre-Preakness race, with
humans in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Horses can spur emotions. We don't discount that, either. In the
ESPN special tonight, TV journalist Jack Whitaker says it about
Secretariat's 31-length win at Belmont that clinched the Triple
Crown: ``Everybody was speechless. Then, when it all set in, people
were crying. I actually saw people crying at this event. It was
such an overwhelming thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Jack, you know this was taking place AT A RACE TRACK. How
many of those were people who were also tearing up betting slips,
distraught because their horses didn't come in?
</P>
<P>
   Two other things to consider, then we'll let it slide. One is,
you can't be an athlete if you're injected with drugs. And on the
flip side, athletes aren't put down. After a hoof disease,
Secretariat was given a lethal injection in 1989. That makes him
the only Top 50 athlete ever to experience such a thing. O.J.
Simpson, at No. 49 on the list, could have been the second.
</P>
<P>
   Those forward-thinking humans who determined this list _ ESPN
recruited what it calls ``a distinguished panel'' of 48
journalists, historians, observers and administrators _ were
obviously pulling a prank when they wrote in Secretariat. Who'd
have thought not only Price and Waterhouse would take them
seriously but so would the ESPN researchers who had to find tape
for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Take off the blinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The only guidelines these experts were given was to vote on
athletic ability alone. For that reason, there's a chance neither
Jackie Robinson nor Arthur Ashe will make the list, insiders have
informed us. That alone would be the real shame. Almost as pitiful
as when Jesse Owens actually raced against horses to make some
extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   With all the lists of the greatest this-and-that we've had to
endure just because we're unfortunate enough to be alive at the
century's end, this list is fast moving up to the top my new list:
worst ideas for lists to mark the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   There's time to fix it, if ESPN gets off its high horse.
Reconvene the elders and have them vote just on ATHLETES this time.
Go ahead and keep Willie Shoemaker and Eddie Arcaro up there. The
beastmasters deserve their due.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Lou Gehrig will be No. 34 on ESPN's list. Shouldn't
he have been closer to, say, the top 20? That's what the debate
should be. We shouldn't have to worry about whether the Iron Horse
has lost out to the actual thing. &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ There's a certain rustic charm about Speedvision's half-hour
``Speed Shop'' (weekdays, 3 p.m.). Think QVC meets Fred Sanford.
Want a blown oil pan from Al Hofmann's actual Funny Car? Funny, but
the other day, they were selling 'em, item AHU-005, for $400 (plus
shipping and handling). And it's autographed. Less pricey but just
as race-worn-beat-up-chic are blown main caps, pistons and
connecting rods right off Hofmann's engine block ($59.95 each).

__ Extended, albeit irregular, weeknight sports segments on

WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ ``Are you beyond criticism? . . . How much does it hurt when
people write things that aren't flattering?'' probed Gary Miller,
the host of ESPN's ``Up Close,'' to his guest Monday. ``Umm. . . it
used to bother me, but I think I know, I understand who's watching
and the general appeal that I have and you're not going to please
everyone all the time. I only get upset when people get their facts
wrong when they come after me and then I go after them and they
backpedal pretty quick. But that's fine. I think the viewers enjoy
what I do. . . .'' In essence, it was the perfect wrap-up question
from the inquisitive Miller, after career clips were shown, after
he talked about how loyal his company has been to him, all ``the
greats'' he's met in his very lucky career and a graphic of the six
movies he's appeared in. Oh, the guest? Chris Berman. Which made
this show possibly _ no, definitely _ the lowest point in ESPN's
near 20 years of broadcasting. The next will be when Miller is
forced to book and then pretend to interview another member of
ESPN's Insane Clown Posse. &QL;

GOLDMAN SACHS LIKELY TO SEEK BUYER FOR N.Y. JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Hess' death two weeks ago stirred speculation
about who would be the New York Jets' next owner. Although Hess'
will has not been filed, the family's anticipated hiring of the
investment firm Goldman Sachs to identify a buyer clarifies a
belief that Hess did not want to pass the team to his family as a
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs handled the sale of the Cleveland Browns for the
National Football League last year. The process took several months
and starred six candidates, including Alfred Lerner, who paid $530
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets should attract at least as many suitors because of the
allure of owning an NFL team in the country's biggest market. One
of those bidders could be Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan, who
bid on the Browns with his brother, Larry. Both men declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula was part of the Dolans'
bid in Cleveland, and would have run the expansion team's
operations. If Shula were part of a successful Dolan acquisition of
the Jets, he would undoubtedly conflict with Bill Parcells, the
team's football czar.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have said nothing about the timing of the expected
sale, or about the intentions of the Hess estate. A lawyer who
represents the family declined to comment on when the will would be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're dealing with a degree of secrecy but a
sequence of events that will have to occur,'' said Jets president
Steve Gutman Thursday during a screening of the team's 1998
highlight video.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement from the Jets about the logistics of the
expected sale could come as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One person who is unlikely to have an interest in buying the
team is John Hess, 44, who succeeded his father as the chairman and
chief executive of Amerada Hess, an independent oil and gas
company.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Hess is described as similar to his father in his
encyclopedic knowledge of the oil business, attention to detail,
sense of humor and devotion to his family.
</P>
<P>
   They also share an aversion to the news media. Leon Hess rarely
spoke to reporters beyond a friendly greeting; John's spokesman at
Amerada Hess did not respond to a request for an interview. The
company's Web site contains no personal information about John
Hess, but financial records show he was paid $1.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   John Hess is Harvard-educated and speaks several Arabic
dialects. Leon Hess took over his father's bankrupt fuel-delivery
business in 1933 and never attended college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like his father, John is tireless,'' said Nicholas Brady, a
board member of Amerada Hess, and a former Treasury Secretary.
``They're the same in their preoccupation with business. It's a way
of life for John.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hess stepped down as the company chairman in 1995 but came
to work every day as chairman of the executive committee. Father
and son worked closely, the elder Hess acting as chief adviser and
remaining a formidable presence at the offices on Sixth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Leon ran the company it was totally his, but when he
passed it to John, he really did it,'' said former New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, who serves on the board of Amerada Hess. ``I wondered
if Leon would really let go. But he did.''
</P>
<P>
   William Johnson, a board member who is the chairman of H.J.
Heinz, said, ``Leon was very deferential to John and John consulted
him on every decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been roiled by low oil prices, which have forced
John Hess to restructure the company and make cutbacks. Last year,
the company lost $458.9 million on revenues of $6.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between the Hesses involved the Jets. Although
Leon Hess was deeply passionate about the team, John Hess is not,
or at least not enough to want to take over the team. Father and
son watched every home game together in the owner's box at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon hurt when the team lost,'' said Kean, the president of
Drew University and an executor of the Hess estate. ``He'd turn to
me and say, `Here we are, suffering again.' John rooted for the
Jets, his kids are rooters, but it wasn't the same for John as it
was for Leon.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady added: ``I'd guess John wasn't as interested in the Jets
as his father. Leon was clear that he didn't want his family
involved in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hess was an occasional visitor to the Jets' training
complex at Hofstra University and after each home game he joined
players in the locker room. John Hess has rarely, if ever, been
seen at Hofstra or in the Jets' locker room, and is not remembered
for having attended NFL owners' meetings. &QL;

ONCE FEARED, DE LA HOYA FIGHTS TO REGAIN RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Oscar De La Hoya awoke five weeks ago,
startled by a realization: he was no longer the fighter that he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit me; what am I doing boxing?'' he said. ``I'm not a
boxer. I'm a fighter. What am I doing boxing guys like Pernell
Whitaker and Ike Quartey?''
</P>
<P>
   So, De La Hoya, undefeated in 30 fights, will unveil what he
calls ``his new old style'' against Oba Carr (48-2-1) at the
inaugural boxing show at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough with all that boxing stuff,'' De La Hoya said. ``Let's
just take care of the job and just fight. Let our fists do the
talking. Whoever is left standing is the winner. I'm finally happy
with my boxing. I'm going to be a real fighter. Not this
up-on-the-toes boxing stuff. Still a smart fighter, but I'm going
to be a real fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, 26, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion,
has the ability to both box and slug. So, his decision to go back
to being a banger is one that most likely will satisfy his ego.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's longtime trainer, said he supports
De La Hoya's more aggressive offensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been happy with his boxing for the last three
years,'' Alcazar said. ``He had so many different people around him
telling him to do one thing this way or that way. I felt like I had
built up a wall and I kept trying to knock it down. Finally, three
weeks ago, he just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said that he began taking it out on his sparring
partners. De La Hoya has gone through a few trainers in the last
four years, including Jesus Rivera and Emanuel Steward. It was
Steward who had advised De La Hoya to become more aggressive and
look for knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar said he agreed with Steward's approach, but De La Hoya
and his father, Joel Sr., fired Steward because Steward did not
want De La Hoya sparring too many rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years of his career, fighting as a
lightweight, De La Hoya knocked out 18 of his 20 opponents. As a
welterweight he has knocked out four of his seven opponents, but
only David Kamau and Julio Cesar Chavez in a spectacular way.
Alcazar said that De La Hoya had not looked like a banger since he
fought Rafael Ruelas on May 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, De La Hoya has felt like he was slipping as a feared
fighter. Even his sparring partners were taking advantage of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having sparring partners for a while making me go
backwards,'' De La Hoya said. ``That had never happened to me in
four or five years. I was losing total respect, the respect that I
had four years ago. I'm going to make sure that it's back after
this fight. My opponents are going to feel that stiff jab against
and that hard left to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a veteran whose only losses have been to Quartey and Felix
Trinidad, will not allow De La Hoya to have his way. And De La Hoya
does not expect him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a veteran fighter with a lot of experience. I have to
place that fight right up there, because every opponent I have
turns it up and becomes a different opponent,'' De La Hoya said.
``They want to be the first to hurt Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya believes that his new approach is going to be a boon
to his already skyrocketing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a big difference in my boxing career,'' De La Hoya
said. ``I'm finally happy with everything inside the ring, because
I'm doing what I want to do.'' &QL;

FEDERAL JUDGE DENIES DISABLED GOLFER'S REQUEST TO USE A CART IN
QUALIFIER FOR U.S. OPEN   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.C.)   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge Thursday denied a disabled professional golfer's
request to use a cart in a local qualifier for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Miller ruled in South Bend, Ind.,
that Ford Olinger of Warsaw, Ind., would not be allowed to use a
cart under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he did not consider the Casey Martin case in making
his decision. Miller said the two cases were different because
Martin's suit sought to use a cart on the PGA Tour, not just for a
single event.
</P>
<P>
   In denying Olinger's request Miller wrote in his ruling that
athletic competition presented a different concern for the ADA than
the workplace. Olinger argued that a degenerative hip disorder made
walking 18 holes nearly impossible for him, but Miller agreed with
the U.S. Golf Association's contention that walking was a
fundamental aspect to competitive golf and that allowing Olinger to
ride a cart would provide him an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of an athletic competition,'' Miller wrote, ``is to
decide who, under conditions that are about the same for everyone,
can perform an assigned set of tasks better than any other
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Olinger had successfully sued the USGA last year to use a cart
in a local qualifier for the U.S. Open, but he did not qualify for
the section, shooting a 12-over 83.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that
makes it painful for him to walk long distances, won a suit last
year to ride a cart on the PGA Tour under the disabilities act. The
PGA Tour has appealed that ruling and oral arguments were heard
earlier this month before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
but a decision is not expected for months.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA will honor its agreement with Martin to allow him to
ride in this year's U.S. Open at Pinehurst, N.C., while his suit is
under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's case with the USGA appears to be on solid ground even
though an outside counsel for the USGA suggested otherwise earlier
this week. Lee Abrams, a lawyer, said that if he won the case
against Olinger, Martin may have to walk. &QL;

WAITING FOR PATAKI: CITY HALL HOLDS BREATH, FEARS WORST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Traditional salutations are no longer offered around
Rudolph Giuliani's City Hall these days. Instead of ``Good morning,
that's a nifty tie,'' one is more likely to hear variations of the
following:
</P>
<P>
   Hear anything? Whaddaya hear? Anything?
</P>
<P>
   The context is understood. The questions center on trying to
divine what Gov. George Pataki is up to with the political speech
he plans to make on Monday, the details of which are being guarded
as though a leak might compromise national security. The governor's
aides will only issue assurances that what he has to say is Very
Important.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the governor's intention or not, the extraordinary
secrecy has spurred fevered speculation within the Giuliani
administration, ranging from convoluted analysis to panicked
suspicion. But the curiosity is understandable. If just one of the
several rumors about the nature of the speech is true, it will have
a direct impact on the political future of Giuliani, who is
considering a run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday alone, the following rumors were uttered on the steps
and in the corridors of City Hall: The governor is endorsing Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas for president; he plans to run for
president himself; he is running for the Senate, believing that he
alone can beat Hillary Rodham Clinton, a possible Democratic
candidate, and that the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno,
will succeed him; he is endorsing Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island
for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more. That former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato is running
again. That Pataki is endorsing Elizabeth Dole for president. And
this: that the governor's wife, Libby Pataki, will be running for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary understanding of politics, or just common sense,
would lead most people to eliminate several of these options.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an endorsement of Bush is considerably more likely
than a run for the Senate by Mrs. Pataki, and D'Amato is said to be
content with his lucrative post-Senate career as a rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the announcement turns out to be, several in City
Hall expect that the governor's speech will be designed in some way
to undermine the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   First, the governor's camp and the mayor's camp do not like each
other for reasons that range from distrust to competition; about
all they share is political paranoia. Second, impishness is not a
characteristic often attributed to the governor. But when he
announced his coming announcement earlier this week, he refused to
say outright that he had no plans to challenge Giuliani for the
Republican nomination for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Third, dozens of the state's Republican leaders and elected
officials have been invited to attend Monday's speech. Everyone, it
seems, except Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Giuliani's camp even detect a sinister message in both
the timing and the location of the governor's announcement. It is
to be held in the very same ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel
and Towers that Giuliani is scheduled to use for his annual
birthday fund-raising event the very next night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of the announcement and the place of the
announcement are clearly designed to steal some of the thunder from
the mayor's big fund-raiser the next day,'' said a Giuliani aide.
``I don't believe in coincidence. And it's hard to believe that the
governor decided to do this at the same hotel the day before,
unless there was some ulterior motive behind the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Several state Republican leaders said that aides to the mayor
had sought them out, asking for intelligence. But they said they
knew as much as the aides did, which is to say nothing. Brendan
Quinn, the executive director of the Republican State Committee,
spoke for many when he said, ``I don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Mahoney, a political consultant close to the Pataki
administration, brought a John le Carre-like level of secrecy to
his ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even off the record tell you whether I know or don't
know,'' the adviser said. ``I am totally noncommunicative on this
one subject. If I make any informational statements, they provide
clues. And I'm not in the clue business today.''
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy and the urgency have annoyed some Republicans.
County leaders from around the state find themselves putting up
their own money for transportation and hotel accommodations to
attend a meeting whose purpose is unknown to them. Several leaders
expressed concern that the Pataki camp might have outsmarted itself
by overselling what could turn out to be an anticlimactic
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some dissatisfaction about the way this is being
done,'' said one official from upstate. ``The timing, the
secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the announcement, absent any leaks, the rumors are sure to
continue. The Pataki camp supposedly has ordered balloons for
Monday's event at the Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balloons?'' one person asked. ``Why balloons?''

EXPECT MORE ACQUISITIONS AND DEALS, AMAZON SHAREHOLDERS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What do Beanie Babies, a 5-pound porcelain bust of
Star Wars character Boba Fett and an autographed Albert Einstein
photograph have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They're some of the trinkets that Amazon.com chief executive
Jeff Bezos has bought in the past couple of months on his company's
new online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 Amazon.com investors got a rare glimpse into Bezos'
personal collection of pop-culture detritus on Thursday at the
company's second annual shareholder's meeting, held at the Sea4tee
Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders _ some who came from as far away as New York
City and Allentown, Pa., _ had a lot more than Boba Fett and Beanie
Baby dolls on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping sites, discounted books, credit card fraud,
employee morale, stock market volatility, competition, and of
course, profitability, were all major topics addressed.
</P>
<P>
   One issue, which re-surfaced several times at the 90-minute
meeting, was Amazon.com's switch from being the world's biggest
bookseller to what is essentially a giant online retailer with
interests in music, videos, groceries, drugs and pet supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, which recorded a $61.7 million loss in the first
quarter, has been on a buying spree of late, taking minority stakes
in online retailers HomeGrocer.com, drugstore.com and Pets.com.
Bezos said Amazon will continue to expand its product offerings
through investments and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is focusing on all of the insurmountable
opportunity that we see,'' said Bezos. ``There is so much Internet
opportunity that now is the time to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Amazon.com's expansion efforts will bring continued
losses, many shareholders said they believe it is the right
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com is essentially the new Kmart model, they can sell
everything,`` said Carole Kitchell of Seattle. ``If that means
losing money in the short-term, I am OK with that.``
</P>
<P>
   Scott Moyer, a stockholder from Allentown, Pa., who was
attending the meeting with his 9-year-old son, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always worried when a company is losing money,'' Moyer
said. ``But you have to look to the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Bezos is doing. Amazon.com, which has
acquired 6.1 million customers in the past 12 months, will continue
to ally with thousands of partners in an attempt to build out
product categories.
</P>
<P>
   The company's $1.4 billion cash reserve could be a huge
advantage in its expansion efforts if the Internet bubble were to
burst, Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bottom drops out of the Internet market then there may
be companies, that could be purchased with cash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos did not shed any light on possible acquisitions or product
categories, saying only that Amazon is interested in partners who
are fanatical about customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Other topics Bezos addressed at the meeting:
</P>
<P>
   _The decision to offer a 50 percent discount on all books on the
New York Times best-sellers lists: ``The reason we are making the
shift in pricing is because we believe a rapid shift from off-line
to online (shopping) benefits us at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   _Comparison shopping sites which allow users to cruise the
Internet for discounted prices. ``It is a concern for us. But it is
a concern the way gravity is for Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   _Retaining employees who are worth millions of dollars. ``You do
end up in a situation where you have a large number of volunteers
and that is a little scary. What you have to do is try to build a
company where the right people want to stay for the right reasons
... and the wrong kind of people are rejected out like a virus in a
healthy immune system.
</P>
<P>
   _Competitive threats from traditional retailers and online
upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surrounded by ever-growing competition and we sort of
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   _On Barnes &AMP; Noble last November purchasing Ingram Book Group,
Amazon.com's main book distributor. ``No one is comfortable having
one of their major competitors as their supplier.''

   STUDIO CITY, Calif. _ With his easy manner and casual dress, Dan
Chuba looks more like a Silicon Valley nerd than a Hollywood mogul.
But Chuba, at 38 already a veteran of special-effects wizardry, and
his partners at Hammerhead Productions are counting on their
mastery of digital technology to help them build the new model of
the 21st-century Hollywood studio.
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of a white stucco mansion on four acres
overlooking the San Fernando Valley, the four-year-old company has
already produced one low-budget film, ``Shadowbuilder,'' and has 10
projects in development and one, a more elaborate feature called
``Supernova,'' in production.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Hammerhead is doing special-effects work on
other people's movies, has a deal to make music videos and is
building a Web site to sell its special-effects software and tapes
and disks of its films.
</P>
<P>
   Chuba contrasted all his activity with the sadder realities at
the major studios, most of which are sharply cutting production
budgets. ``The studios are leveraged out,'' he said. ``They don't
have control of the pipeline. They are reducing their quantities of
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people still need the product,'' he continued. ``Someone
has to do it, and it's creating all sorts of opportunities for
independent players like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the entertainment industry, and even in its Los
Angeles heartland, independents, particularly those with strong
technical or artistic assets, share a sense that the major studios
are slowly losing their grip on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many are encouraged by the recent successes of such outsiders as
the New York-based Miramax, owned by Walt Disney but kept on a very
loose leash, which dominated this year's Academy Awards. And they
point to the hits churned out by the computer animation leader,
Pixar, and most of all, to the growing dominion of George Lucas'
Industrial Light and Magic over a wide swath of moviedom.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles of not so long ago, when giants like Walt
Disney, Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner bestrode the industry, such
thoughts would have been treated as all but treasonous. The big
studios in those days controlled the most advanced facilities and
the skilled labor necessary to make high-quality feature films.
</P>
<P>
   But today, some entrepreneurs at independent firms regard
mainline studios as technologically backward, artistically
tone-deaf and poorly managed. Worst of all, said Carl Rosendahl,
president of Pacific Data Images, the effects house where Chuba got
his start, the studios have allowed their historic brands and
images to wither.
</P>
<P>
   ``The identity of the studios used to be strong in the '30s and
'40s,'' Rosendahl said in his airy offices in Palo Alto, 400 miles
north of Hollywood. ``MGM did musicals, another did monster movies,
Disney did Walt's movies. But now they don't have it. Disney isn't
even doing its own best work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosendahl, whose company produced the hit animated film ``Antz''
last year and is working on ``Shrek,'' for release at the end of
2000, conceded that even the best-financed independents still need
the major studios to help distribute and market completed films.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Data Images' films are distributed by Dreamworks SKG,
which also owns part of Pacific. Pixar, whose ``Toy Story'' and ``A
Bug's Life'' have been big animated success stories, relies on
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   But over time, even this dependence could be reduced. The
emergence of digital distribution of films over satellite links,
Rosendahl suggests, could reduce the cost of distributing films by
tens of millions of dollars. And videos increasingly offer a direct
distribution pipeline to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, only a handful of non-majors, like Troma of New
York, are truly independent of studio power.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the major studios _ including Dreamworks, the
youngest and widely considered the most creative of the majors _
still dominate film production, especially big-budget blockbusters,
which are made mainly through co-production deals. Independent
studios are a force principally in the lower-budget niches for
B-movies and ``art house'' films and in animation.
</P>
<P>
   One way the independents are weaning themselves from the
traditional studio system is by diversifying their work beyond
simply producing filmed entertainment. Companies like Pacific Data
Images and Hammerhead operate broadly as creators of creative
content for what might be called the cultural-industrial complex.
They delve into everything from commercials and theme park rides to
Internet entertainment, computer games and music videos.
</P>
<P>
   This versatility helps smooth out the feast-or-famine nature of
film work, supplies a useful flow of cash and helps companies build
technical expertise and flexibility, according to Scott Ross,
president of Digital Domain, a large effects house in Venice,
Calif. With 350 employees, Digital Domain produces CD-ROMs, makes
commercials and works on theme entertainment attractions in
addition to its film work.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's increasing reliance on technology also plays into
the independents' hands, because they generally have cost
advantages over the studios. Hammerhead's Chuba estimates that his
company can produce effects for roughly half of what it would cost
a major studio to do the work in-house.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving force behind what Ross calls ministudios _
specialist companies like his that are moving into mainstream
feature production _ goes beyond cost. It arises from a realization
that, while it can be dazzling fun to make effects, producing
feature films remains one of the most potentially lucrative and
prestigious parts of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here want to work on feature films,'' said
John Hughes, president of Rhythm and Hues, the Los Angeles-based
special effects shop that earned an Academy Award for its work on
the hit comedy ``Babe.'' ``That's what they came here for in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if making films has not lost its allure for new
entertainment entrepreneurs, doing so at the traditional studios
certainly has. Legendary for bickering, bureaucracy and management
by financiers rather than auteurs, the studios can be much less
appealing to hot young talent than the less structured, more
entrepreneurial firms like Hammerhead or Santa Monica Studios,
another effects house-turned-ministudio.
</P>
<P>
   Chuba said talented animators also prefer basic working
conditions at Hammerhead's Studio City headquarters, with its pool
and sweeping views, to life on the crowded, sprawling lots at
Universal, Disney or Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like this kind of space, and working with interesting
people, and that draws them to operations like ours,'' he said.
``It's collaborative, it's technologically cutting-edge and its
fun. We still have the feel of the Rebel Alliance.''

KNICKS DEFEAT HAWKS, 77-70 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, the hip-hop
additions to the New York Knicks, combined to make the Atlanta
Hawks look a little too old, a little too outdated to keep up with
their youth on Thursday night _ and for that matter, maybe in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   The two gave the Knicks, a team that could have become
complacent after their Game 1 victory on Tuesday, a confident strut
as they left the Georgia Dome on Thursday night with a 77-70
victory and a commanding 2-0 lead in their four-of-seven-game
second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have a chance to sweep the Hawks in Madison Square
Garden with Game 3 on Sunday and Game 4 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that a mentally drained Allan Houston, who
scored just 2 points, missed his first five shots, was careless
with the ball and was benched for most of the game. Coming off the
bench, Sprewell scored 31 points _ matching his Game 1 total _ and
Camby had 11 points and 13 rebounds. Patrick Ewing, meanwhile,
scored 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly, no doubt about it,'' Sprewell said of the game.
``But we did something we hadn't done in the regular season, and
that's finish in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the series, Sprewell said, ``It's intense, and it's
everything I expected it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks nudged ahead in this defensive, ugly struggle when
the Hawks' Steve Smith, who had another miserable night and scored
only 9 points, turned the ball over late in the third quarter. An
aware Chris Childs picked it up and delivered a pass to a sprinting
Sprewell, who put down a two-handed dunk at the end of the third
quarter to give the Knicks a 54-52 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That lead swelled to 64-58 when Camby put down a hard dribble
and flew through the air like a condor, floating over the
long-limbed Dikembe Mutombo and put down a one-handed dunk with 7
minutes 30 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelenting, Sprewell then scored 5 straight points to give the
Knicks a 69-58 lead with five minutes remaining. There was nothing
the Hawks could do as a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel a little faster,'' Sprewell said, ``but they have
the guy Mutombo waiting there in the center, so it's not so easy
once you get by the initial defender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks shot just 30 percent. Smith was 2 for 16, Mutombo was
3 for 9 and Mookie Blaylock scored 17 points but was 7 for 20.
Mutombo had 17 rebounds but only 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks wanted to approach this game as a chance to push the
Hawks to the edge of the cliff. But early on, the shine was off and
the energy pumping through the Knicks was as flat as Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   It was like the aftermath of the Knicks' Game 1 victory over the
Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the Knicks weren't trying, but they didn't seem
as desperate as the Hawks after taking Game 1 of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to come up with the touch and focus he had during his
34-point performance in Game 1 in Atlanta, Houston missed his
opening four shots and turned the ball over three times in the face
of Hawks' double teams in just 13 first-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Houston's sidekick, Sprewell, itching to make an
impact off the bench. The Knicks had missed all but 1 of their
first 15 shots and had watched the Hawks build a 13-2 lead before
Sprewell stepped in to stop the madness.
</P>
<P>
   In his first minute on the floor, he started an 11-1 run with a
steal and ended the first half with 17 points. With Camby running
by his side and coming up with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots,
Sprewell and his young buddy delivered their team a 38-36 lead at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   That low score was reflective of defense, the Hawks' strategy to
slow down the game and sloppiness, a trend that continued in the
third quarter. With Sprewell on the bench to start the period, the
Knicks fumbled the ball away and lost their lead as the Hawks
scraped up a 42-42 tie.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sprewell and Camby who formed a bench combination that
overwhelmed the Hawks in the first half. Although they were getting
back better in transition than they had in Game 1 _ and disrupted a
number of fast-break opportunities _ the Hawks had no counter for
Sprewell and Camby.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' Smith was smothered at every opportunity and finished
the first half 1 for 9. Mutombo was trying to keep up with the
active Camby, who competed with him blocked shot for blocked shot.
With a live Camby, Ewing was able to float away from Mutombo and
knock down a couple of jumpers to provide a backdrop to Sprewell's
show.
</P>
<P>
   Without concern for life or limb, Sprewell routinely drove into
the elbows of Mutombo, changed his shot and drew a foul in the
process. He went to the free-throw line 10 times in the first half,
hitting 7 foul shots. The Hawks, as a whole, went to the line just
11 times.

MTV IS BUYING TWO SERVICES FROM TCI MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks before it is to unveil a new online music venture,
MTV Networks announced Thursday that it was acquiring music
services on the Internet and on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, a division of Viacom, will acquire Sonicnet, one of the
first Internet sites dedicated to music, and the Box, a
pay-per-view cable television music service. In exchange, MTV will
give a 10 percent stake in its online service to the owner of the
two properties, TCI Music, a company based in New York that
provides audio and video music through cable, satellite and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, said the online music
division would be spun off as a separate publicly traded company in
the next nine to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   TCI Music, a division of Liberty Media Group of Englewood,
Colo., also announced that it would change its name to Liberty
Digital. Liberty Media, a cable television programming distributor,
is part of the huge cable company TCI, which was bought by AT&AMP;T
Corp., although Liberty Media continues to operate independently.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Freston called the online music business
``ripe for consolidation'' as the major music labels seek ways to
distribute music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Online commerce will be an important piece of MTV Networks' new
online music venture, which is to be started next month. In
addition, Freston said there were plans to create an interactive
television channel selling tickets, music and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is, anyone who can drive traffic is going to be
in a position to sell a lot of merchandise, a lot of tickets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's flagship music channel is available on television in 300
million homes around the world, and Freston said an expanded online
presence was a logical next step. He spoke by telephone from
Singapore, where MTV will start a Web site for the Asian market on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said traditional media companies were
realizing the power television has to send viewers to the online
medium, as well as the power of the Internet to extend what they
can offer viewers in the finite time permitted by television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online can support strategies in ways broadcast can't,'' said
Mark Hardie, a senior analyst for Forrester Research of Cambridge,
Mass. ``You don't have the air time for all you're trying to air.''
An online presence allows television programmers to direct viewers
to their computers for additional services, particularly electronic
commerce and eventually, as higher-speed connections become more
widely available, music videos.

NO EXPLANATION ON PAYMENT TO POLICE INFORMANT AS YET BY MORGAN
STANLEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the swirling allegations and counterclaims that
surround a racial discrimination lawsuit filed against Wall Street
powerhouse Morgan Stanley Dean Witter by a former employee, one
question stands out: Why did the firm pay $10,000 to a police
informant involved in the employee's arrest last year?
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has yet to offer a full explanation or to provide
supporting invoices or tax documents that would show that the
payment was made for a legitimate business purpose, lawyers
involved in the matter said. The Manhattan district attorney's
office announced an investigation of the firm this week, months
after it learned of the $10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to explain the payment leaves Wall Street's richest
securities firm under a cloud. A discrimination lawsuit filed
Wednesday by Christian Curry, the former employee, cites the
payment as evidence that Morgan Stanley conspired to entrap him
after his lawyer let the firm know that they were contemplating the
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley denies that allegation and said that it would
soon explain the payment. Morgan Stanley legal counsel plan to meet
with representatives of the district attorney's office as early as
next week, lawyers close to the matter said. The firm will say
nothing about the payment now, citing the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The payment is at the center of a complex situation that began
in April 1998, when Morgan Stanley dismissed Curry, a Columbia
University graduate who at the time was employed as an analyst in
the firm's real estate finance division. Curry was discharged
several days after pictures of him appeared in a gay pornographic
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who is black and has said all along that he is not gay,
contends that Morgan Stanley dismissed him because of race and
perceived sexual orientation. His lawsuit cites what it terms
numerous counts of racial discrimination; it says, for example,
that he was excluded from participating in banking deals and
business dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said it discharged Curry because he abused his
expense account, that charges of racial discrimination in the
lawsuit are without merit, and that the firm will defend itself
vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be explained are the events surrounding Curry's
arrest by undercover detectives last August, several months after
the dismissal. At the time, prosecutors said Curry was caught in
the act of paying an undercover officer to plant fake e-mails in
the Morgan Stanley computer system that would support his claim of
racism and homophobia at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution dropped that case this week. In doing so,
the prosecutors disclosed that Morgan Stanley had paid $10,000 to a
police informer, Charles Joseph Luethke, who was involved in
Curry's arrest. Prosecutors said Morgan Stanley executives, even as
they provided evidence damaging to Curry in the weeks following his
arrest, did not tell the police or prosecutors about their contacts
or their financial arrangements with Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Morgan Stanley executives have told prosecutors that
the payment had nothing to do with Curry, lawyers involved in the
matter said. They said that the firm had said that the payment was
related to a business arrangement with Luethke that had no
connection with Curry's arrest. But the lawyers said the district
attorney's office was skeptical of that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has asked Morgan Stanley to
provide invoices or tax documents required for business
transactions, lawyers involved said, but added that to their
knowledge Morgan Stanley had yet to provide the requested
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office declined to comment Thursday on
the status of the investigation or the likelihood of any indictment
against Morgan Stanley executives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reaction to the Curry case filled online business chat rooms
devoted to Morgan Stanley Wednesday and Thursday. One popular Web
site for company gossip called VaultReports.com carried numerous
messages from anonymous people who said they were Morgan Stanley
employees or clients. Many of the comments were sympathetic to
Curry and hostile to Morgan Stanley management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is getting to feel a bit like the Nixon White
House,'' one person who claimed to be an employee wrote. Another
said: ``I knew Christian Curry. He was a quiet, really nice guy. I
have to believe Morgan could have been a little less reactionary
about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   One message writer disagreed, speculating that Curry or his
supporters had planted messages on the site to make it appear that
Morgan Stanley employees doubted their own superiors.
</P>
<P>
   A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said that the firm had no comment
on messages posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that any employees who were contributing messages
to the site must have been doing so from home, because the site was
formally banned from Morgan Stanley's office Internet system a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The firm routinely bans access to Web sites that employees have
no business gaining access to while at work, she added.
