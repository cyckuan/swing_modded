 WEBVAN SEES REVENUES, LOSSES GROW  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Webvan Group has delivered groceries and other
goods to 87,000 Bay Area households so far this year, giving the
Internet grocer first-quarter revenues of $16.3 million, up 79
percent from the preceding quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Foster City, Calif., company spent more on marketing and
advertising to snare those customers. Its loss widened to $57.8
million (18 cents per share) from $11.7 million (21 cents) in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-forma loss, which excludes noncash compensation and
related expenses, was $38.7 million (12 cents), up from $25.7
million (9 cents) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat both Webvan's own forecasts and Wall Street's
expectations. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had
predicted a pro-forma loss of 13 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan opened for business in the Bay Area, its first market, in
June, so year-to-year comparisons are not applicable.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is on track for rapid national expansion
that will put it in 15 markets by the end of 2001. Webvan will
launch its service in Atlanta in May; it said it is serving 200
test customers there. A Chicago opening is planned for the third
quarter. Seattle, Baltimore, and Bergen County, N.J., will come
online during the fourth quarter, executives said. The company also
has leases for distribution centers that will service New York
City, Dallas, Denver, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and
Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to build one of the largest companies to come out of
Silicon Valley,'' said chief executive George Shaheen. ``With
operating quarters like this, we feel well on our way to achieving
that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Although groceries account for the bulk of the company's
business, Webvan is using its delivery system to sell a variety of
other goods. It added books, office supplies, premium pet food,
postage stamps, BART tickets and bridge toll cards during the
quarter. Shaheen said the company plans to introduce apparel,
prescription drugs, electronics, cosmetics, CDs and videos in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to give a breakdown for grocery versus
nongrocery items. It said the average order size was $90.33, up
from $81.31 last quarter. Seventy-eight percent of customers
repeated their business.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call, analysts speculated that the company
is spending about $210 to acquire each new customer and is serving
about 2,200 customers a day. Shaheen said those estimates were ``in
the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's stock has taken the same Wall Street drubbing as other
Internet stores; it is down 61 percent for the year. But analysts
said it has brighter prospects than other e-tailers, pointing to
such factors as its door-to-door delivery, automated distribution
system, mix of products and good customer repeat rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone can give you a better deal on tuna fish over the
Internet but if you have to wait seven days for it, you're not
going to bother,'' said Peter Swan, an analyst with Pacific Growth
Equities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He considered the revenues ``fabulous,'' and was equally
enthusiastic about Webvan's 25 percent gross margins.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen predicted revenues would grow 40 to 50 percent in the
second quarter and would total $150 million to $160 million for all
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Results were announced after the market closed. Webvan rose 81
cents, to $6.31. In after-hours trading it went up an additional 3
cents.

 NET WORTH: BEAR MARKET SHUTTING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR IPOS  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Glub, glub, glub.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of more and more IPOs going underwater _ Wall
Street speak for stocks that sink below their initial public
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 156 Bay Area companies that went public this year or
last, 41 are trading below their IPO prices. A full list is on Page
B2 and it includes high-profile sinkings like Palm, Webvan,
Pets.com, E-stamp, Salon.com, Fogdog, Quokka Sports, Women.com and
Next Card.
</P>
<P>
   The next sound you will hear is the IPO window slowly scraping
shut.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Tuesday, when the Dow and Nasdaq took investors on a
thrill ride, eight companies have postponed or withdrawn their
IPOs, including Rigel Pharmaceuticals and Linuxcare (both San
Francisco), Drugabuse Sciences (Menlo Park) and Lexar Media
(Fremont).
</P>
<P>
   Many deals are still getting done, but some at
lower-than-expected prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had nine deals priced this week. Four of the nine _
Corillian, Asiacontent.com, DDI and HealthStream _ were priced
below initial terms,'' says David Hirschkorn of IPO.com.
</P>
<P>
   And those outrageous first-day gains that IPO investors have
come to expect have shrunk to merely enormous.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of this year until the Nasdaq index peaked on
March 10, the average IPO soared 116 percent on its first day. From
March 13 through Wednesday, the average first-day return was just
42 percent, Hirschkorn reports.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Nasdaq rebounds quickly _ it's down 27 percent from
its high _ experts predict that only companies with big brand names
or really novel ideas will be able to go public in the next few
months. And even some of those may not keep investors' attention
for long.
</P>
<P>
   Web portal AltaVista, scheduled to premiere next week, ``will
struggle to hold its opening premiums,'' predicts David Menlow,
president of IPOfinancial.com.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, AT&AMP;T is expected to float the biggest IPO
ever when it issues a tracking stock for its wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T Wireless will probably do OK at the opening,'' he
predicts, but will have to be a long-term hold for most investors.
</P>
<P>
   Menlow says outrageous valuations ``are not a thing of the past,
but they are not a thing of the present.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, where IPOs have become as common as monster
homes and traffic jams, a prolonged slump in the new-issues market
could have an impact on things like home prices, car sales and job
hopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised to see anything happen over the next few
weeks, but if we move into an extended bear market, in three or six
months from now it will clearly ripple through the economy,'' says
Todd Carter, head of investment banking for Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of
the California Economy, thinks the IPO market will have minimal
effect on the local economy, outside of housing prices in Palo Alto
and Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is going on relative to stock valuations is not
affecting long-term prospects for the real economy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming amount of money that's earned by residents in
the Bay Area doesn't come from financial assets.'' And to the
extent that it does, most of it is coming from employees at places
like Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Intel and Applied Materials, who got
their stock five or 10 years ago. ``The number of people who work
at these companies dwarf the number of people at startups,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't hold your breath waiting for Bay Area home
prices to go down.
</P>
<P>
   Many people view the IPO slowdown as a natural and even healthy
reaction to what had become an overheated market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market is a filter, it has been very coarse,'' Carter
says. ``A lot of companies have been able to go public earlier in
their life cycle, placing more risk on the public investor who is
not always able to evaluate that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when the IPO window is almost shut, only the best
companies can squeeze through it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks and months, Menlow advises investors to
``look for IPOs that are priced at the upper end of filing range or
above it; those will get the most attention.''

METS SQUEAK PAST PHILLIES, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Rick Reed has been rewarded with a victory only
once this season, but each time he has pitched, he has lifted the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   He worked eight innings in the second game in Japan, giving the
Mets a chance to win and making the 12-hour flight back to New York
bearable. In his next start, last Friday, he beat the Los Angeles
Dodgers to give the Mets their only victory over a span of nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday night in Philadelphia, though he was not the
winning pitcher, Reed worked seven innings. He allowed one run and
put the Mets in position for a 2-1 victory over the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   With Armando Benitez working a scoreless ninth for the save, the
Mets avoided being swept by the Phillies and won for the first time
since Reed's last start.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the ninth inning of a 1-1 game, Jay Payton
singled to center field off Scott Aldred, the losing pitcher. It
was Payton's third single of the game, and when Mike Piazza lashed
a double to left-center with two out off Amaury Telemaco, Payton
raced home from first.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ron Gant threw to second baseman Mickey
Morandini, whose relay to the plate arrived just late as Payton
slid in safely.
</P>
<P>
   Reed entered the game with an 0.57 earned run average, best in
the National League, and he left it after seven innings with an
0.79 ERA. He has allowed only two earned runs in 222/3 innings.
Both runs have been on homers, the first to Gary Sheffield of the
Dodgers in the 2-1 victory Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal hit the second home run off Reed's first pitch
in the seventh inning on Thursday night. Lieberthal is a nemesis of
Reed's. The Phillies catcher has a .353 career average against the
Mets right-hander, and all six of his hits have been for extra
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal was robbed of a hit in the fifth inning when right
fielder Derek Bell made a diving stab of his line drive. Bell made
another fine catch on the next hitter, racing in and rolling to
grab a shallow liner by Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also had three singles, his second game in a row with three
hits. He hit a home run to win the Mets' Shea Stadium opener, but
until Wednesday he had not been hitting like one of the best
players in the league. He entered the game Wednesday with a .138
average.
</P>
<P>
   Bell led off the second inning with a single off the Phillies
starter Randy Wolf, who walked Benny Agbayani and Rey Ordonez to
load the bases for Reed. Reed flied out to center field, scoring
Bell to give the Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine used his first entirely right-handed
lineup of the season on Thursday night against the left-hander
Wolf. Melvin Mora replaced Robin Ventura at third base and batted
leadoff in place of left fielder Rickey Henderson. Agbayani made
his first start of the season in left field.

 LOW MILEAGE DOESN'T SLOW SUV BUYERS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jeanette Scott was poking around a Colma,
Calif., car dealership this week in search of new wheels for
herself and her 7-month-old son. Her interest was drawn to a Chevy
Astro van selling for about $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned toward the vehicle at its side: a
brand-spanking-new Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle going
for $46,000 and boasting an unimpressive 12 miles per gallon in
fuel performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' 19-year-old Scott observed. ``But it's too
expensive, and it's a gas-guzzler.''
</P>
<P>
   What if money wasn't a factor?
</P>
<P>
   ``If money wasn't a factor,'' she mused, her face lighting up,
``I'd definitely get one of these.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scott remains bound in her decision making by economic
constraints, nearly all those who do end up buying an SUV nowadays
have no such worries.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the key reason sales of SUVs continue to soar in the
Bay Area and throughout the nation _ despite their hefty price
tags, despite gas prices hovering near $2 a gallon, and despite
safety concerns that the behemoths can endanger occupants and other
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't looking at the gas crisis,'' said Lou Corbin,
sales manager at Serramonte Ford, the biggest Ford dealership on
the Peninsula. ``They aren't looking at inflation. They're taking
money from the stock market and buying SUVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, sales of SUVs jumped nearly 15 percent
during the first three months of the year, according to the
National Automobile Dealers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, SUVs costing about $35,000 and up now account
for roughly half _ and sometimes more _ of new-vehicle sales at
many dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, we had our best month in four years,'' said
Michael Herrera, sales manager at Stewart Cadillac Oldsmobile
Chevrolet in Colma. ``People aren't saying anything about gas
mileage at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Menlo Park, Calif., Mark Linton, sales manager at Anderson
Chevrolet, said fully three-quarters of all sales at his lot these
days are SUVs. ``We sell every single one we get,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Being in Silicon Valley, Linton added that his customers pay
entirely in cash for their big, shiny new toys ``all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the California State Automobile
Association, said concern about high gas prices doesn't even enter
the picture for most local SUV buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a booming economy,'' he observed. ``People feel
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of self-service unleaded gas in California
peaked a few weeks ago at a record $1.79 a gallon and has since
eased by a few cents, according to data compiled by the U.S.
Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But many Northern Californians have yet to feel any relief.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent survey of pump prices, the automobile
association found that the average cost of a gallon of gas in San
Francisco rose 4 cents, to $1.94.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost in San Jose, Calif., increased 3 cents, to
$1.88, while Oakland, Calif.'s average gas price climbed 3 cents,
to $1.87, and Santa Rosa, Calif.'s was up 4 cents, to $1.82.
</P>
<P>
   One would think that such considerations would be very much on
the minds of Bay Area SUV buyers.
</P>
<P>
   One would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even discussed,'' said Frank Fragomeni, general
manager of Stewart Infiniti in Colma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy's the best it's ever been,'' he said. ``Wages are
at an all-time high. Unemployment is at an all-time low. People are
going to enjoy life as they see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, dealers say, means the typical SUV customer is not
getting hung up on nagging questions about mileage. Nor is she (or
he; the gender breakdown among buyers is essentially even)
particularly troubled by reports that huge, road-hogging SUVs can
maul smaller vehicles during collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUV drivers are looking out for themselves,'' Fragomeni said.
``They're thinking about themselves when it comes to the safety
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety aspect clearly favors those behind the wheel of an
SUV. With average weights running about 1,000 pounds more than cars
and body frames as much as 28 inches off the ground, SUVs are
almost scientifically designed to prevail in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, however, this means an SUV will literally run over a
smaller vehicle. Studies have shown that in collisions between cars
and light trucks, including SUVs, 80 percent of subsequent
fatalities are to the car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   This has prompted automakers and federal regulators to debate
ways to improve road safety in light of the proliferation of SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   But for most if not all buyers, such issues are barely a blip on
the radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anyone say that they'd hate to get into an
accident because of what would happen to the other guy,'' commented
Herrera at the Stewart dealership. ``I never hear that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, dealers say they don't hear much from customers
regarding the way that massive SUVs all but blind trailing
motorists to impending road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that SUV buyers are unaware of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some say that they were looking forward to now
blocking someone else's vision,'' said David Dobby, a salesman at
Falore Chrysler Jeep Daewoo in Colma.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few facts regarding SUV safety, courtesy of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:
</P>
<P>
   -- About 36 percent of fatal SUV crashes in 1998 involved
top-heavy vehicles rolling over _ more than twice the rate for
cars.
</P>
<P>
   -- More than 2,000 deaths resulted that year when a light truck
or SUV hit the side of a car; only 276 deaths resulted when a car
hit a light truck or SUV.
</P>
<P>
   -- More than 1,500 fatalities were caused by light trucks or
SUVs hitting cars head-on; about 450 deaths occurred when a car ran
into the front of a light truck or SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Perry, general sales manager at Serramonte Dodge
Mitsubishi, said nearly all his SUV customers say safety is one of
their main considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be durability and off-road capability,'' he noted.
``Now, the majority never take their SUVs off the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel efficiency, Perry added, ``is never, ever a decision-making
factor,'' and ``very rarely is crash testing a subject that comes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these were not the most important points for 50-year-old
Evans Noble as she inspected a $39,000 Lexus SUV at Lexus of
Serramonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's roomy,'' she said of the large, plush machine. ``As long
as I'm comfortable, that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Katz, the dealership's general manager, said questions
about mileage or the safety of other motorists ``never come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, all dealers agree that SUVs are here to stay and
that the number of SUVs on the road will keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``BMW was the yuppie car in the '80s and '90s,'' said Serramonte
Ford's Corbin. ``People now want something they can get more use
out of.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast a satisfied look at the fat SUVs dominating his
showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here,'' Corbin said, ``everyone has money, and they
want to own what they want to own.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that.

 DRIVERS COMPLAIN ABOUT GAS PRICES, BUT DON'T CUT BACK  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carol Felton navigated traffic jams, open road
and twisting highway the other night during her 55-mile commute
home to Soquel, Calif., a seaside community just south of Santa
Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Living near the country is more important to her than the
hour-and-20-minute drive to work in Redwood City, Calif., and the
extra costs that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent gas price increase, which Felton calls outrageous,
has added significantly to those commute expenses. Although Felton,
a vice president at a public relations company, describes herself
as a thrifty person who cuts coupons, she drives as much now as she
did when gas was cheaper by nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like paying this at all,'' Felton said after partially
filling her 1994 Infiniti with premium unleaded at $2.12 a gallon,
then merging into the heavy traffic on Highway 101. ``But what else
can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after gas prices in the Bay Area began to
surge, car owners are still complaining. But as much as drivers
talk about reducing their fuel cost, they have so far avoided the
most obvious solution _ consuming less gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area public transportation agencies report increased
ridership, but that is true nearly every spring. Company van pools
are no busier than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traffic on the Bay Bridge has increased.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of sport utility vehicles are strong.
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association predicts a big summer travel
season.
</P>
<P>
   And tourists are still renting about 15 gas-guzzling Winnebagos
a day at Cruise America, a recreational home dealer in Oakland,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling fact is that gas deliveries, a key
indicator of gas consumption, have remained stable despite the
recent run-up in prices. Deliveries increased slightly, to an
average of 8.087 million barrels a day in the past two months
compared with 8.086 million barrels a day during the same period
last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Complex Reasons
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this unyielding appetite for gas are complex,
according to drivers, economists, psychologists and oil industry
experts. While the lack of an alternative to gas explains a lot
about consumer devotion, so does the inconvenience of public
transportation, habit and the sentiment that gas at $2 a gallon is
still affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't believe that the high prices will last,`` said
John Mowen, a marketing professor who specializes in consumer
behavior at Oklahoma State University and is president of the
Society for Consumer Psychology. ``So the net effect is that you
don't see much behavioral change, but you see a lot of griping.``
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very slow to change a fundamental lifestyle,``
Mowen added, ``and part of the fundamental lifestyle in this
country is the love affair with the car.``
</P>
<P>
   Felton, the commuter, provides a window into why many consumers
appear to disregard simple economic rules of price and demand.
While she has a handful alternatives to driving 625 miles a week,
they are generally more inconvenient than leaving her car parked at
home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most obvious ways for Felton to reduce her gas bill
to zero would be to use public transportation. Although such a trip
is feasible from Soquel to Redwood City, it would require taking
two buses, a train and then a shuttle, adding at least an hour to
her commute each way.
</P>
<P>
   Carpooling Won't Work
</P>
<P>
   Carpooling is another option that Felton has considered. But
arranging one, she said, would be difficult given her varying work
schedule and the frequency with which she needs a car during the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with carpooling is that I never know until the
last minute if I'll have a client meeting,`` said Felton, who was
unaware that private carpool agencies could help match her with a
driving partner. ``And these meetings can be all over the place _
San Jose, Fremont, Palo Alto _ so I can't take public
transportation to get to them.``
</P>
<P>
   Home Office Alternative
</P>
<P>
   While stopped in one of several traffic jams during her drive
home, Felton mentioned the possibility of working at home one day a
week. Though it is an appealing idea that could save about $12 in
gas per week, she said, something always comes up to ruin it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell myself that I'll stay at home next Friday,`` Felton
said. ``But no matter what I do, a meeting always comes up. I need
to block a day out on the calender and not let anything stop it.``
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Felton fills her car with gas twice a week for a
total of $70. The higher gas prices during the past two months have
probably cost her an extra $120.
</P>
<P>
   That is taking into account Felton's modest attempts to reduce
her gas bill. At times, she fills her car with midgrade unleaded
gas instead of more expensive premium, contrary to her car
manufacturer's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Felton also tries to buy gas near her home in Soquel, where
prices can be 10 cents a gallon cheaper than on the Peninsula,
where she works. On this evening, she bought gas near work, but
just a few gallons to get home.
</P>
<P>
   Such a measured reaction to high prices is not the tactic that
Felton, who often shops for bargains, takes in the grocery store.
When the price of fruit and meat rise, she simply stops buying.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have found that her pattern of gas buying is the one
followed by most Americans: Consumers tolerate higher gas prices
more than higher food prices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 10 percent increase in grape prices causes a
nearly 12 percent decline in demand, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. A similar increase in gas prices softens
demand by only 2 percent in the short term, according to Carol
Dahl, an economics professor at the Colorado School of Mines who
specializes in the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of Choice
</P>
<P>
   Felton's explanation for this phenomenon echoed that of the
experts. It all comes down to choice, she said, and a supermarket
is full of them while a gas station is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the price of chicken goes up, I buy turkey,`` Felton
said. ``With gas, the alternatives are not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the
University of California at Berkeley, agreed that reducing gas
consumption is difficult, especially for people who live in
outlying areas. But he added that today's prices are not high
enough to prompt most drivers to use less fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, gas prices adjusted for inflation and taxes are
about $1 a gallon cheaper now than the peak of a big gas-price
spike in 1981. In addition, gas currently accounts for only a
little more than 7 cents out of the 31 cents a mile it costs to
operate an average car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuneups, new tires, repairs and insurance cost much more,
Borenstein said. ``If you are a family going on vacation, driving
is still a lot cheaper than flying.``
</P>
<P>
   Boom Is a Factor
</P>
<P>
   Many experts cited the nation's economic health as a big factor
contributing to unwavering gas consumption. The average family's
income has grown significantly during the past five years, making
spending a few more dollars on gas per tank relatively
inconsequential, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider who buys many of the gas-guzzling vehicles, Borenstein
said. The average buyer of a Lexus, a luxury car with relatively
low gas mileage, has an income of $200,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, public reaction to high gas prices _ aside from
complaining _ is delayed by at least a year. Consumers often take
fuel efficiency into account when they are considering buying a new
car or moving to a new home that may be further from work.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl, the economist who said gas consumption declines only
marginally because of higher prices in the short term, said studies
show the long term is a different matter. The effect of people
buying smaller cars and moving closer to work causes gas
consumption to decline a total of 5 percent in the long run for
every 10 percent price increase, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change in behavior would presumably hinder sales of sport
utility vehicles. Currently, sales of those cars are at record
levels because of the strong economy and low interest rates,
according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller SUVs
</P>
<P>
   Yet within those results is perhaps a sign of things to come.
Sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles are
growing up to three times faster than the larger models.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a reaction to a 33 percent increase in gas prices
last year. Or it could simply be a change in consumer taste.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change in big car sales would follow a precedent set in
1996 and 1997, when gas prices rose by about 12 cents a gallon to
$1.30. Within a few months of the spike, cars with smaller engines
made up 5 percent more of total car sales than just before the
price increase, according to the National Automobile Dealers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't change the engine in the car they're driving,''
said Paul Taylor, an economist with the National Automobile
Association. ``They do it when they buy a new car later on.``
</P>
<P>
   Even though statistical data show that it takes consumers at
least several months to modify gas use, many people never change.
Felton, for example, said that she has no plans to move and that
her next car will probably be as large as the one she has now
because it is comfortable and spacious.
</P>
<P>
   Although she complains about gas prices now, she seems willing
to pay more, at least until BART comes to Santa Cruz. Asked whether
$3 a gallon would be too much, she said ``I don't know when I'd say
enough is enough.``

OSPREY PROGRAM EXPECTED TO SURVIVE CRASH THAT KILLED 19 MARINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Named after a hawklike bird of prey, Boeing's V-22
Osprey could more appropriately be called the Phoenix, the mythical
bird that rose from its own ashes to start another long life.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary tilt-rotor military troop transport that can
take off and hover like a helicopter but also flies like an
airplane at more than 300 miles per hour has survived a turbulent
history since a team from Boeing and Bell were awarded a
preliminary design contract nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have long argued that it is too costly and dangerous,
the unique technology unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just before the once-dead Osprey is supposed to soar into
full production later this year, more questions are being raised
about its safety following last Sunday's fiery crash of a V-22 in
Arizona that killed 19 Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause of the crash has not been determined, the
accident is not expected to disrupt the program in a major way
unless a serious design flaw is found.
</P>
<P>
   That's good for the Boeing Co., which is an equal partner in the
program with Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth. Each Osprey
cost around $44 million, and the Pentagon plans to buy 360 of the
craft for the Marines, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the Air Force's
special operations unit. Boeing and Bell also see a big overseas
market for the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to happen to this program in a dire sense,''
said a congressional staff member who closely follows the program.
He did not want to be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program will keep moving forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by industry analysts and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be killed. There are too many political oxen who
would be gored,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research, who has
followed the rise and fall of the Osprey program from its early
days. ``If this program became embarrassing politically then it
could be in jeopardy. But that's very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 Boeing workers make the fuselage and cockpit and
install avionics and flight control systems at the company's plant
in suburban Philadelphia. The structure is then flown in a military
transport plane to Fort Worth, where Bell completes assembly by
installing the wings, tail sections, rotor system and engines.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Bell are scheduled to produce seven Ospreys this year
and seven more next year. If full-rate production is approved as
expected by October, 30 Ospreys a year could be built beginning in
2003. Production would eventually peak at 46 a year, with the last
Osprey delivered to the Navy in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican and member of the
Senate Appropriations Committee's defense panel, told Defense News
earlier this week that any design failure would need to be fixed if
that is what caused the latest crash, but the program is too
important to be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique,'' she said of the Osprey. ``It's a new technology
for this type of plane to carry as much weight as it does, and we
need this in our arsenal for future security threats. We need to go
forward with the equipment after we know that it is operating
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   But that uniqueness is what critics say makes the V-22 too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 15 Ospreys have been built, including five production
craft. Three have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed Sunday was reported to be shifting from
aircraft mode to helicopter mode when it suddenly fell nose first
into the ground while landing at a small airport northwest of
Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The twin wing-mounted rotors can shift 90 degrees in about 12
seconds. The rotating engine nacelles, using computers, thus
convert vertical propeller lift into horizontal thrust.
</P>
<P>
   But the reverse transition from forward flight to hover is the
most dangerous time for the V-22. The wings lose lift. In 1992, a
prototype crashed while landing in Virginia, killing all seven
people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts note that the Harrier ``jump jet,'' a fighter
that can also take off and land vertically, has had the highest
Class A accident rate of any military tactical aircraft. (Class A
mishaps involve at least $1 million in damage or a fatality.)
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing and Bell say tilt-rotor technology has been perfected
after years of study and development, and that the Osprey is safe.
Bell has been working on tilt-rotor craft since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   An early tilt-rotor called the XV-3 was developed by Bell in the
mid 1950s. Bell followed that with the XV-15 project in the 1970s
as proof the concept could work as an eventual replacement of the
Marines' CH-46 Sea Knight transport helicopter, also built by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense began the Osprey program in 1981,
first under Army leadership but with the Navy and Marine Corps
later taking the lead in developing what was then known as the JVX
(joint-service vertical takeoff/landing experimental aircraft).
</P>
<P>
   In June of that year, a V-22 predecessor was demonstrated at the
Paris Air Show. Two years later, in April 1983, Bell and Boeing
were awarded a preliminary design contract. The contract to begin
full-scale development of the craft was awarded in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   There were already concerns about its costs when the prototype
rolled out in May 1988. The Army, which planned to buy 231 Ospreys,
dropped out, saying it could not afford the craft.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of the prototype came in March 1989, but by the
end of that year the Bush administration had decided not to go
forward with development. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney directed
that the Navy terminate all production contracts with Bell and
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Congress continued to approve money for the Osprey;
Cheney refused to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   The V-22 program became an issue in the 1992 presidential
campaign, with the Clinton campaign supporting development and the
Bush administration opposed. In October, just before the election,
Vice President Dan Quayle announced a contract award to the Bell
and Boeing development team. The Navy terminated the old contract
and awarded a new one for a cheaper and lighter V-22 variant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very strong politics kept this program alive,'' said Nisbet,
the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Though each Osprey is now projected to cost about $44 million,
the program costs are much greater.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense last year estimated it will cost about
$36.2 billion to produce and develop 458 Ospreys _ or about $80
million per aircraft. That figure, though, includes research and
development money that already has been sunk into the project, as
well as funding for operation and maintenance and spares.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost and concerns from critics about the safety of
the Osprey, the Marines want it. They have committed their future
aviation transport needs to the V-22 as a replacement for the
corps' aging fleet of Vietnam-era CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, a
version of Boeing's CH-47 Chinook.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey can carry 24 combat-loaded Marines.
</P>
<P>
   With a cruising range of more than 2,000 miles without
refueling, the Osprey can fly six times as far and about twice as
fast as the Sea Knight. But it is also several times as expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, the Marine Corps' aviation chief,
defended the V-22 at briefing for reporters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation absolutely needs the MV-22 (the Marine's label for
the Osprey),'' he said. ``Here you have an aircraft that can go
2,100 nautical miles at 300 knots. That's a great technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been three crashes, aviation experts point
out that the first, involving a prototype that crashed in Delaware
in 1991 minutes after taking off on its maiden flight, occurred
because a mechanic improperly wired the craft's gyros. No one was
killed in that accident.
</P>
<P>
   The crash in 1992 that killed seven was caused by an engine
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both fatal crashes are horrible and tragic, but when you
develop something like this that is revolutionary, you are going to
have some problems,'' said Christopher Bolkcom, military aviation
analyst with the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Osprey that crashed was one of five production
aircraft in service that have been undergoing operational
evaluation by the Marines. After those trials are completed this
summer, the Pentagon will decide whether to go ahead with full-rate
production and Congress would then have to approve the money.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., a big supporter of the Osprey, said it
is replacing a 40-year-old helicopter that is nearing the end of
its service life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got no place else to go if this doesn't work,'' said
Murtha, a former Marine and the ranking minority member of the
House Appropriations Committee's defense panel. ``We got a big-time
problem here if there's something wrong with it.''

LOS ANGELES SEEKS STATE LAW TO TRACK DOWN TAX DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Desperate for new sources of revenue, Los Angeles
city officials are pressing for state legislation that would help
them track down thousands of tax-dodging businesses and collect as
much as $66 million more a year.
</P>
<P>
   Already the City Council has plans to spend the money, although
a taxpayer watchdog group asserts the city's new tax collection
plan would invade people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an estimated 66,000 businesses avoid paying city
business taxes, but proposed legislation would give city officials
access to state Franchise Tax Board records to identify the
scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have responsible businesses paying their share and the
others basically thumbing their nose,'' said Councilwoman Laura
Chick. ``It's a very bad message to send to law-abiding citizens
and businesses that there's no consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will collect an estimated $314 million in business
taxes this fiscal year from the more than 230,000 registered
businesses, ranging from small, home-based operations paying the
minimum $200 to major corporations paying more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than a third of businesses operating within city
limits simply don't pay - and the city has been ineffective in
getting compliance.
</P>
<P>
   To change that, the City Council is championing a new effort by
Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, and the chances of passage
are good, officials said. Cedillo said the legislation likely won't
hit the state Senate floor until late summer.
</P>
<P>
   One statewide taxpayer watchdog group said the legislation
``smacks of big brotherism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association, said the release of the state's tax information to the
city amounts to a violation of privacy and that the cities will use
the information to go after tiny, home-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities are flush with cash; they are just looking for
more,'' Coupal said.
</P>
<P>
   Not according to council members, who already have plans for the
new money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to have the businesses that are honoring their
obligation subsidize the businesses that aren't,'' said Councilman
Michael Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   The council sent a measure to two committees, including the ad
hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, that proposes funneling most
of the anticipated dollars into a program to simplify the city's
maze of business tax codes.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Chick said, the city should use the bulk of the
dollars to upgrade its antiquated tax computer system and improve
city services to lure new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good faith effort to say that the top priority for
these funds is to further business tax reform efforts,'' Chick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the architect of the city's business tax
reform efforts, supports dedicating the funds to the reform
movement, said Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo. Plus, several local
business groups support the state measure, including the Central
City Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there is a benefit if we can see tax reform as a
result,'' said Hilary Norton Orozco, legislative affairs director
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   One of the businesses that already pay taxes has other thoughts
on how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Beck, owner of a bicycle repair shop, said the city should
use the money to provide low-interest loans and other aid to the
law-abiding small business owners who now are shouldering the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, that's where the tax money comes from,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, the council has lifted its longstanding
opposition to related legislation that helps shield free-lance
screen writers and musicians from paying local business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of negotiations with writers' union and
business leaders and city finance authorities, the council on
Tuesday unanimously agreed to support AB 83, which defines certain
types of employment that are sheltered from local government
business tax.
</P>
<P>
   Local writers, who objected to paying the tax as independent
contractors, were pushing the legislation. However, city officials
objected to an earlier version that limited the city's ability to
require permits and licenses from home-based workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a great step,'' said Cheryl Rhoden,
Writers Guild of America spokeswoman.

DOCUMENTS REVEAL PERSONAL STRUGGLE BEHIND PLAYER'S SUMMER-LEAGUE
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With its teal three-point arcs and tight,
bleacherless sidelines, the Guardian Angels Church gym on Westport
Road was familiar to Schlagle High School senior Andre Williams.
But the ``coach'' he met on the night of May 27, 1998, was not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different type of coach for a different kind of game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running drills with summer-league coach Myron Piggie,
Williams and an uncle met with private investigator Ted Knox.
Beginning at 7:30 p.m. and for the next two hours, they discussed
how to tape record Piggie offering Williams $100 a week to play on
his summer-league team.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would ultimately lead to a two-year federal
investigation that would shake college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Knox had been hired by Tom Grant, the chief executive officer of
LabOne Inc. whose family foundation once sponsored Piggie's
summer-league team. Knox remembers Williams as skittish that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little nervous, but he listened to what he needed to
do,'' Knox told The Kansas City Star. ``I assured him we would be
there for him.... Andre just wanted to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox put a tape recorder on Williams' home phone the next day.
The ensuing tapes resulted in the indictments unveiled Thursday
against Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorney, Williams, now a freshman at Oklahoma State
University, declined to comment for this article, saying it is time
to get on with his life. Piggie was in federal custody Thursday and
could not be reached for comment. Piggie's attorney declined to
comment after his initial court appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' account, however, is set out in detail in documents
prepared with his cooperation and released to The Star recently by
Oklahoma State. The letters and reports, based on interviews with
Williams by university officials, were prepared in December and
January as they appealed Williams' suspension for NCAA rules
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other interviews, Grant foundation records and
information from Thursday's federal charges, it's now possible to
paint the richest public picture yet of how authorities think
Piggie operated.
</P>
<P>
   And they show why the NCAA ended up suspending seven big-time
college players this past season amid a searing reassessment of
amateur basketball.  &LR; brk:Unlikely duo and the dream team
</P>
<P>
   Williams' meeting in Guardian Angels Church gym with the private
investigator had its roots at least three years before in the
flourishing relationship between an unlikely pair: Tom Grant and
Myron Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   The streetwise coach and the Johnson County multimillionaire had
teamed up to attract high school basketball players to teams
sponsored by Grant. Such nonscholastic teams have become
increasingly important to players eager to hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   At times the two wrangled wayward players, making sure they made
it to practice, and class.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through June 1998, Grant's foundation wrote checks to
Piggie totaling $184,435 covering salary and expenses, Thursday's
indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the focus of Piggie's and Grant's attention wasn't
Williams but rather JaRon Rush, a restless high school phenom whom
Grant had taken into his home and treated like a son.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 letter to the NCAA, Grant described his feelings about
Piggie:
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked with me in trying to help JaRon become a
responsible adult,'' Grant wrote. ``Myron is not an educated man,
but he has a good heart and works every afternoon with JaRon on
helping him improve his game....Myron has been a positive influence
on JaRon....''
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1997, the grooming of Rush had begun to pay
off. Piggie assembled what is remembered as a summer-league dream
team _ including Rush, Williams and future NBA players Korleone
Young and Corey Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   That 1997 summer team appeared unstoppable as it began the
national circuit of Amateur Athletic Union tournaments and shoe
company events _ a whirlwind of games played before top college
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the country's best college prospects under his
wing, more money started coming Piggie's way. Nike Inc. signed him
to a consulting contract worth up to $425,000, and sports agents
began giving him money to represent their interests in the amateur
basketball community, according to the federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said in an interview last week that the attention began to
change Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy who suddenly had all these college basketball
coaches calling him on a daily basis,'' Grant said. ``And then (CBS
basketball commentator and Nike consultant) George Raveling would
call him three or four times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Raveling was unavailable for comment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The money also had its effect. In 1997, Piggie bought two houses
and leased a Toyota Land Cruiser, Jackson County records show.
</P>
<P>
   But late 1997 also brought the first hints of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That fall The Basketball Times published an article that
contained allegations Piggie had taken the Nike shoes he was
supposed to pass on to athletes for free and instead sold them for
personal profit, an allegation Piggie has denied in the past. The
article also contained details of his criminal history,
specifically a felony drug conviction in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confronted him in the fall of 1997 about the article,''
Grant said in the interview. ``I knew he had a criminal background,
but I didn't know how extensive. He denied all the allegations
against him about dealing the shoes. I was close to the guy. I
believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Piggie's denials, Grant withdrew support for Piggie's
traveling team, but agreed to pay him for six months under a
``severance'' agreement.  &LR; brk:`Lack of trust'
</P>
<P>
   Piggie soon started assembling his next summer team, then
sponsored only by Nike. Schlagle's Williams was a natural prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a supporting player on Piggie's dream team the
summer before, he had developed into a big-time college prospect.
He again began playing for Piggie in the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams had worries off the court. According to the
Oklahoma State records, he was concerned that he didn't have the
grades to graduate from Schlagle that May, much less qualify
academically for college.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie's solution ultimately contributed to Williams'
disenchantment with his coach. He suggested to Williams and his
uncle, Al Collins, that Williams spend an additional year in an
East Coast prep school to sharpen his grades. Furthermore, Piggie
promised to ``get him into'' Hargrave Military Academy, Oklahoma
State letters assert.
</P>
<P>
   But as weeks passed, Williams and his uncle grew frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma State administrator wrote that ``whenever Andre or
Mr. Collins asked Piggie what Andre's status was at Hargrave,
Piggie would respond `I'm taking care of it.' To make a long story
short, Piggie made unfulfilled promises to Andre and delayed his
opportunities to get into a prep school or other education
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   To paper over the rift, according to the Oklahoma State
documents, Piggie began giving Williams money. MORE

YANKEES BEAT RANGERS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball seemed like a burden to Paul O'Neill at the
beginning of last season. He did not hit the ball hard very often,
and when he did, there was always someone making a diving catch at
the other end. At the height of his struggles, he acknowledged he
had thoughts of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   But he is back at 37, hitting and running as if he might last
past his 40th birthday. O'Neill had three hits on Thursday night
against former teammate Kenny Rogers, spurring both of the Yankees'
rallies as they beat Texas, 5-1, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A bases-loaded triple by Jorge Posada in the sixth capped the
second rally sparked by O'Neil, broke a 1-1 tie and thrust Orlando
Hernandez to victory.
</P>
<P>
   The only real blemish on the pitching line of Hernandez was an
unearned run: El Duque toyed with the Rangers, allowing just one
hit to the last 29 batters he faced, three hits in eight innings,
and improved his record to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases with one out in the second inning,
on an error by Tito Martinez at first and two walks. Blowing on his
hand before each pitch, Hernandez fell behind in the count three
balls and one strike against Tom Evans, then pumped a high fastball
that Evans fouled off.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez fired his next pitch just a little higher, out of the
strike zone. Evans swung underneath and missed, a strikeout. It was
a classic example of Hernandez using a hitter's own aggressiveness
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton, the Texas lead-off hitter, followed and hit a
groundball at Alfonso Soriano, a relatively easy chance. But this
is Soriano's first week as a third baseman and once again he
misplayed the ball, which ricocheted off him and into the air. All
the runners were safe, a run scoring. The Yanks' third basemen have
six errors in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez recovered, retiring Chad Curtis on a roller back to
the mound, and as Soriano ran off the field, he tapped Hernandez on
the backside.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hernandez needed reassurance. In his first three
starts, he has pitched in four bases loaded situations, all with
less than two out, and he has allowed just two runs _ the first on
an infield single last week, the other on Soriano's error.
Opponents are 1 for 10 against Hernandez with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers pitched pretty well, too, holding the Yankees to a run in
the first five innings. But O'Neill, who singled and stole a base
and scored in the first inning, singled to left field, his third
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams coaxed a walk from Rogers, and O'Neill and
Williams advanced to second and third on a groundout. Roberto Kelly
walked after falling behind 0-2 to load the bases, bringing Posada
to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bosman, the Texas pitching coach, went to the mound to
speak with Rogers, and as he did so, Curtis sprinted to center
field, to speak with Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   What Curtis said to Mateo was unclear, but when play resumed,
the Rangers' center fielder was shifted toward right-center _ and
Posada slashed a line drive toward left center that Mateo could not
reach.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, Williams and Kelly all scored, Posada slid into third
with a triple and three runs batted in. Posada subsequently scored
when Shane Spencer grounded the ball through the Rangers' drawn-in
infield. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Desperate for new sources of revenue, Los Angeles
city officials are pressing for state legislation that would help
them track down thousands of tax-dodging businesses and collect as
much as $66 million more a year.
</P>
<P>
   Already the City Council has plans to spend the money, although
a taxpayer watchdog group asserts the city's new tax collection
plan would invade people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an estimated 66,000 businesses avoid paying city
business taxes, but proposed legislation would give city officials
access to state Franchise Tax Board records to identify the
scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have responsible businesses paying their share and the
others basically thumbing their nose,'' said Councilwoman Laura
Chick. ``It's a very bad message to send to law-abiding citizens
and businesses that there's no consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will collect an estimated $314 million in business
taxes this fiscal year from the more than 230,000 registered
businesses, ranging from small, home-based operations paying the
minimum $200 to major corporations paying more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than a third of businesses operating within city
limits simply don't pay - and the city has been ineffective in
getting compliance.
</P>
<P>
   To change that, the City Council is championing a new effort by
Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, and the chances of passage
are good, officials said. Cedillo said the legislation likely won't
hit the state Senate floor until late summer.
</P>
<P>
   One statewide taxpayer watchdog group said the legislation
``smacks of big brotherism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association, said the release of the state's tax information to the
city amounts to a violation of privacy and that the cities will use
the information to go after tiny, home-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities are flush with cash; they are just looking for
more,'' Coupal said.
</P>
<P>
   Not according to council members, who already have plans for the
new money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to have the businesses that are honoring their
obligation subsidize the businesses that aren't,'' said Councilman
Michael Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   The council sent a measure to two committees, including the ad
hoc Committee on Business Tax Reform, that proposes funneling most
of the anticipated dollars into a program to simplify the city's
maze of business tax codes.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Chick said, the city should use the bulk of the
dollars to upgrade its antiquated tax computer system and improve
city services to lure new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good faith effort to say that the top priority for
these funds is to further business tax reform efforts,'' Chick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the architect of the city's business tax
reform efforts, supports dedicating the funds to the reform
movement, said Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo. Plus, several local
business groups support the state measure, including the Central
City Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there is a benefit if we can see tax reform as a
result,'' said Hilary Norton Orozco, legislative affairs director
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   One of the businesses that already pay taxes has other thoughts
on how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Beck, owner of a bicycle repair shop, said the city should
use the money to provide low-interest loans and other aid to the
law-abiding small business owners who now are shouldering the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, that's where the tax money comes from,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, the council has lifted its longstanding
opposition to related legislation that helps shield free-lance
screen writers and musicians from paying local business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of negotiations with writers' union and
business leaders and city finance authorities, the council on
Tuesday unanimously agreed to support AB 83, which defines certain
types of employment that are sheltered from local government
business tax.
</P>
<P>
   Local writers, who objected to paying the tax as independent
contractors, were pushing the legislation. However, city officials
objected to an earlier version that limited the city's ability to
require permits and licenses from home-based workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a great step,'' said Cheryl Rhoden,
Writers Guild of America spokeswoman.

DEVILS TOP PANTHERS IN FIRST GAME OF PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils started their
Stanley Cup playoffs in an ideal manner by scoring two goals on
their first four shots. When they built a three-goal lead later in
the first period, it looked as if they would treat their fans to a
lopsided victory. But the Devils' early intensity evaporated
quickly and they barely held on Thursday night for a 4-3 victory
over the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Devils did not look convincing, the victory at
Continental Arena put them on the right track to shed their recent
history of early playoff exits. But their fans seem wary; they drew
a crowd of 15,024, which was 4,016 short of a sellout. The Devils
had asked their supporters to wear white, but only a small segment
chose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils succeeded in limiting Pavel Bure, the league's
leading goal scorer with 58 goals, to only an assist. To neutralize
Bure, the Devils relied mostly on Scott Stevens, their captain and
spiritual leader, who also scored the game's crucial first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, Sergei Brylin and Scott Gomez scored the other
goals for the Devils against Panther goalie Mike Vernon, who could
have prevented two of the goals. Vernon faced 33 shots and had no
memorable saves.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the ice, Martin Brodeur had an average game
by his standards. He allowed goals by Rob Niedermayer, Peter
Worrell and Mike Sillinger. Brodeur, who faced 23 shots, should
have prevented Worrell's goal, which eluded him over the glove from
far away on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Losing their intensity rather abruptly after gaining an early
lead is likely to be one of the matters Coach Larry Robinson will
discuss with his players, who engaged the Panthers in pushing and
shoving matches at the conclusion of the game. The Devils took a
1-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils came out bursting with enthusiasm and mindful of
their stigma: early exits in the playoffs in the last three
seasons. Stevens, who scored two goals in last spring's first-round
elimination by the Pittsburgh Penguins, opened the scoring just 98
seconds into the game. Taking the puck from a face-off that Bobby
Holik won, Stevens found the upper right corner from the left
circle with a blistering shot that gave Vernon no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd barely had time to settle down beforeSykora gave the
fans more reason to roar. He scored with a backhander as he came
around the goal from right to left, making the score 2-0 with 4:02
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Things got even better for the Devils with 4:32 left in the
first, when Brylin beat Vernon over the left shoulder from the left
circle after the Panthers had several chances to clear their zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lost their focus for the rest of the period and paid
the price as goals by Niedermayer and Worrell closed the gap to a
goal before the first intermission. Niedermayer scored the first
from close range on the left with 4:05 left, and Worrell beat
Brodeur over the glove from the left circle moments after he came
out of the penalty box, with 16.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell's goal, his first ever in the playoffs, was a shot that
Brodeur should have handled. The Devils' goalie made up for it by
denying Bure from point-blank range on the right just 72 seconds
into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   An unassisted goal by Gomez from the left circle that Vernon
should have stopped extended the Devils' lead at 7:21, but the
Devils looked unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   They had difficulty in their zone for most of the second period,
but the only blemish against them came with 6:10 left when
Sillinger jumped on a rebound from a shot by Bure to bring the
Panthers to within a goal. &QL;

U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY POSTPONES CHINA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has postponed a
trip to China this weekend, apparently unable to round up enough
members of Congress willing to accompany him on the politically
sensitive visit.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was meant to sway members of the House of
Representatives who remain undecided about granting Beijing
permanent normal trade relations, a move that would pave the way
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. But some House
members who were considering the trip were apparently spooked by
organized labor's demonstrations and intense lobbying against the
trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Without enough members to justify the visit, Daley has decided
to consolidate his visit with a similar mission planned later this
month by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a Commerce Department
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote next month on whether to grant
China permanent trade status, an integral part of China's efforts
to join the World Trade Organization. China signed an agreement
with the United States last year granting wide trade concessions as
one of the terms of its membership in the organization, with the
condition that Washington remove what Beijing considers a
humiliating annual congressional review of its trade status. The
annual review was put into place after China's violent suppression
of pro-democracy activity in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not lift the annual review and grant Beijing
permanent trade status, China could still enter the World Trade
Organization with support from the Clinton administration. Allowing
China into the global trade group without lifting the annual review
would give Beijing the right to exclude the United States from
trade benefits offered to other members.
</P>
<P>
   But further delaying China's membership would strain relations
with countries that are eager to benefit from the trade concessions
that China would make as a member, and it would infuriate Taiwan,
whose membership in the group is being held up until China joins.

NO QUICK FIX FOR BAKER'S BLAHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vin Baker is calling this descent into basketball
oblivion ``a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in a slump, however, would seem to indicate light at the
end of the tunnel. The end of this tunnel, for whatever reason,
does not seem near.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a slump, how come this downward spiral seems more
like a continuation of the dog days Baker had last season, when he
came back from the NBA lockout overweight and out-of-shape?
</P>
<P>
   How come, given an opportunity to put it back together last
summer during an Olympic qualifying tournament, Baker was dogged by
more criticism for his inconsistent play, his lethargy?
</P>
<P>
   What's going on doesn't seem like a player in a slump. This has
more the feel of a pattern, a trend. And it's looking like a long,
protracted problem for which neither Baker nor the people who pay
his $87 million contract have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes this very uncomfortable public meltdown so
serious. Is Baker solely responsible for his woes? Or have the
Sonics failed to manage him effectively?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're honestly trying to help every way we can. We're still
optimistic something will work,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said
Thursday, one day after making good on his threat to remove Baker
from the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a normal ebb and flow for players to have ups and
downs. This is an extreme case. We still have confidence that he
will revert to form. That's what we're trying to do. In the
meantime, we have to march forward,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation just got tougher.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 110-83 victory Wednesday over the Timberwolves was a
nice breakout game, stubbing a losing trend that had the Sonics
dropping nine of their past 11. But Minnesota was lackluster at
best. And what happens when rookie Lazaro Borrell and second-year
players Shammond Williams and Rashard Lewis aren't the answer?
</P>
<P>
   Once you bench a guy, how do you bring him back, especially if
the player's most glaring problem allegedly is confidence?
</P>
<P>
   Another question:
</P>
<P>
   What if Baker ultimately believes Westphal has made a value
judgment about Baker's lifestyle and that judgment has affected the
way Westphal is coaching Baker?
</P>
<P>
   Baker has little else left to believe. His game has disappeared,
not to mention his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, after Baker played 14 disastrous minutes
against the Timberwolves, the four-time NBA All-Star who will
represent the U.S. in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney could not
wipe his eyes fast enough to keep back the tears.
</P>
<P>
   He is in obvious pain, and some of it he will not open up about.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his feelings that not enough plays are being called for
him and that Westphal has failed to effectively manage him are
true.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, these feelings are a form of denial. It depends on
which side is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Does Baker have set plays for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he does,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I don't discount anything (as to how Baker is
characterizing his lack of shots). Certainly, there's a lot of
frustration. I think we've tried a lot of different things. We'll
continue to try a lot of different things,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is wrong with Baker _ and it is something _ he is far
too easy, nice, unaggressive, soft or whatever to vent about the
root of his alarming problems, even if his representatives say it
is all about the lack of shots, the lack of plays called for Baker,
the way he has been allowed to drift into ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal refused to talk about whether Baker has correctly
assumed that Westphal has stopped believing in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothetical question I'm not going to answer,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to talk about whether he has backed off from calling
plays for Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in really getting into that. If that's the
way he feels, then there's not much I can do about that except help
make him be as successful as he can,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear. The drain of whatever problem Baker is
having has forced Westphal to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings are important but, at a certain point, winning is
more important than feelings,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to feel I don't have confidence in them,
but I can only put five guys out there at once. If I'm doing the
best thing for the team and somebody loses their confidence because
of that, all I can say is I hope they play better and everyone will
have more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the only comparable situation to this is when
Kendall Gill had what was disclosed as a case of manic-depressive
illness. Later, of course, it was discovered that a deep conflict
existed between Gill and George Karl. Karl did not like something
he saw in Gill. Gill knew the coach had no respect for him. The
relationship was damaged beyond repair. Gill was traded.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sonics center Horace Grant was so stumped by team
chemistry and the string of losses he suggested the team needed Dr.
Joyce Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   How much of this chemistry and rotation confusion is about Baker
and how much is about a faltering relationship between the players
and the coach remains to be seen. A post-playoff dissection of what
happened is sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Westphal is at least publicly saying there is
hope Baker will return to form, which could be construed as some
measure of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We projected Vin to be an All-Star player this year. I don't
think he's too old. I don't think there's any reason why he
shouldn't have great years ahead of him,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you talk to him, he would admit there's a
confidence problem. The criticism has gotten him down and makes it
even tougher. It's been a downward spiral. We hope to help him
reverse that. We've done everything we know to do to make that come
about. But his effectiveness has diminished for whatever reason.
We're hopeful it will increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Westphal ever seen an NBA player fall so far from his best
days?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty severe drop-off right now,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the pattern, who's to say it's over?

<P>
   DETROIT _ Opening-night jitters. It was as big a concern as the
Red Wings' power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings naturally had a few before Thursday's Game
1 of the best-of-seven series at Joe Louis. And despite the 2-0
loss to open the series, Kings general manager Dave Taylor said he
was pleased the team remained aggressive against one of the NHL's
most explosive teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to stay away from the penalties early and we
did that somewhat,'' Taylor said. ``Our guys read the papers like
everyone else. They see that nobody gives us a chance in this
series. You can buy into that or you can work through it. That was
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is the league's best team with the man advantage,
converting more than 20 percent of the time. But the Kings held
them scoreless in six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play is such a weapon for them,'' captain Rob Blake
said. ``We took a few bad ones and they were very physical early.
But we maintained our composure and that obviously is a good sign.
We were jittery before the game, but we weren't intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookie's lament: Jere Karalahti, playing in his first playoff
game, allowed Detroit to score its first goal when Vyacheslav
Kozlov fired the puck off Karalahti's backside and passed Stephane
Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw it,'' he said. ``I've never seen one ever. It just
hit right here and went in.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Karalahti was trying to get into the NHL after his
career was derailed by drug charges in his native Finland. After a
shaky start at midseason, he has played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at the beginning,'' he said. ``They
always talk about the intensity of the playoffs, but until you're
here you don't really know. It was incredible. I thought we played
well. We were ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Out of line:Down the stretch, the Kings most successful
combination was Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray. But with the return
of Ziggy Palffy (sprained right shoulder) and Bryan Smolinski
(sprained right knee), the Kings' first two units returned their
regular lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel played with Palffy and Luc Robitaille, who did not get
shots on goal until the third period. Smolinski played 20 minutes
but also did not get off a shot until the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they were out of sync,'' Stumpel said of Palffy
and Smolinski. ``Detroit just controlled the middle and I think
they frustrated us. We need to take control of the middle more. But
that is always tough against the Red Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray didn't get a shot all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played a little together,'' Stumpel said. ``That's not
the way it is lined up now. I think we did well together because we
go back a long way. We played together in Boston and here. We have
played well, but it is exciting to have Ziggy back. He means so
much to us and he will do something before this is over.''

USC LOOKS FOR MORE KICK IN OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coaches will officially be allowed to evaluate
high school talent May 1, but the Trojans coaching staff will have
another job when spring practice ends this weekend. Coach Paul
Hackett would like to see if there are any potential kickers left
who could join the team for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see if anyone is out there who fell through the
cracks,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have two scholarships available, and with the
kicking performances in spring inconsistent at best, they will
apparently try to see if there are any candidates who could help
the team.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's scrimmage, junior kicker David Newbury made just 1
of 4 field-goal attempts and senior David Bell was 0 for 1. At the
end of Thursday's practice, Newbury was 2 for 2 and Bell was 0 for
2.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nickels on track: There is a chance walk-on wide receiver
Matt Nickels could receive a scholarship, based on his impressive
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a valid guy to consider changing the rule,''
said Hackett, who has never given a walk-on a scholarship in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Nickels has created a niche for himself as a possession
receiver, and played well in both scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think I have a role,'' Nickels said. ``It's as a
blocking receiver and a possession receiver. I'm definitely not a
breakaway receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   He should enter fall training camp no worse than USC's fifth
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll be even higher than that,'' Nickels said. ``It
would be a dream come true (to get a scholarship). It would make
all the hard work worthwhile. I just want to be on the field, even
if I don't get a scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickels, a high school teammate of quarterback Carson Palmer at
Santa Margarita, played two years at Dartmouth before transferring
to USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Several players are scheduled to undergo
post-spring surgery. Defensive tackle Ennis Davis (Reseda High)
will have arthroscopic surgery on his elbow, and defensive tackle
Ryan Nielsen (Royal of Simi Valley) will have arthroscopic surgery
on his shoulder. Hackett said both should be fully recovered for
summer workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Zeke Moreno (pulled groin) and free safety Kevin
Arbet (turf toe) will be held out of Saturday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who recently underwent arthroscopic knee surgery
is Banning tailback Chris Howard, who will enter USC in the fall.
Howard is expected to compete for playing time with sophomore
Sultan McCullough and junior Malaefou MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   __ Most improved player? Hackett singled out defensive end Bobby
DeMars (Westlake) as a player who made one of the biggest
improvements this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't block him,'' Hackett said. ``He's made a move.
Bobby DeMars has had a spring-and-a-half.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player Hackett has been pleased with is defensive end
Sultan Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing the best football since I've been here,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other players Hackett said have surprised him are linebacker
Kori Dickerson, offensive tackle Jacob Rogers, offensive guard
Trevor Roberts and center Lenny Vandermade.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a wrap: USC concludes spring drills Saturday with an
11:30 a.m. practice. About 30 minutes will be spent scrimmaging.
</P>
<P>
   As spring winds down, USC seems to be doing better in the
penalty department. The Trojans had just eight in last weekend's
102-play scrimmage, and only one in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   __ Swim with Mike: USC's 20th annual ``Swim with Mike''
fund-raiser will take place Saturday at the McDonald's Swim Stadium
from 8 a.m.to 4 p.m. Proceeds go to scholarships for former high
school or college athletes who have suffered debilitating illness
or injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turf change: When USC plays Penn State in the Kickoff Classic
on August 27, there will be one major difference from the last time
the teams met in the game in 1996. The Meadowlands is installing
natural grass in the stadium and it will be ready for the game.
</P>
<P>
   USC will play just one game (at Oregon) on artificial turf this
season.

MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS CONCERNED BY TURMOIL AROUND ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add quote in 4th graf) (Sidebar with CUBAN-BOY; also see CUBAN-BOY-MEDIA,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mental health experts who met earlier this week with the family
of Elian Gonzalez said Thursday they were worried that the boy was
being worn down by the public drama being played out on his
doorstep. What Elian needs most of all, they said, is to be
reunited with his father quickly, and to see that the adults in his
world can work together in his best interests.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said they were troubled by the television footage of
Elian waving to the crowds outside his great-uncle's house in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a progressive deterioration,'' said Dr. Paulina
Kernberg, a a child psychoanalyst in the department of psychiatry
at at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and one of three
doctors asked to meet with the boy's family by the federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``He is more subdued,''
Kernberg said. ``He is kind of limp. And when he is asked to greet
the crowds, he does it in a kind of automatic way.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of Elian, aired Thursday on television stations
across the nation, in which the boy told his father, ``Papa, I
don't want to go to Cuba,'' also disturbed the experts, one of whom
said the videotape was ``almost exploitative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the child has become an object for a cause, and not
a child,'' said Dr. Lourdes Rigual-Lynch, director of mental health
for the division of community pediatrics of Montefiore Medical
Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg put it more succinctly: ``This has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigual-Lynch and Kernberg met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's
father, his current wife, Nercy Carmenate Castillo, and the
couple's new baby in Washington. They also met briefly Monday with
Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, at the Miami hospital where
his daughter, Marisleysis, was recovering from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The INS also called in Dr. Jerry Wiener, a professor emeritus in
psychiatry and behaviorial sciences at George Washington University
in Washington. The three experts were asked to develop a plan for a
``cooperative reunion'' between Elian's father and his Miami
family, Kernberg and Rigual-Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigual-Lynch said that both she and Kernberg were positively
impressed by the meeting with Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to us to be extremely caring, very emotional, very
smart,'' Rigual-Lynch said. ``We got an extremely positive feeling
that this was a very good family.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Juan Miguel Gonzalez seemed very willing to meet
with the relatives in Miami and told the two doctors that before
Elian came to the United States, they had been on good terms and
talked frequently by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father said he was willing to make peace with his
relatives as soon as he was reunited with his son. ``He said, `As
long as I have my child, we can all be family again,'''
Rigual-Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Lazaro Gonzalez was more difficult, the two
experts said. Lazaro Gonzalez, Rigual-Lynch said, seemed reluctant
to compromise and demanded that any meeting with Elian's father
take place at his house in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty,'' Rigual-Lynch said, Elian's family members in
Miami ``kept stalling us and there were so many delays. Basically,
we felt that they did not want to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the relatives in Miami also failed to produce the
records of meetings they said Elian had had with mental health
specialists there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly asked for them,'' Rigual-Lynch said. ``But they
never gave us anything. We can't say they exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The two experts said they were convinced that Elian's relatives
in Miami love him and have good intentions. But the combination of
of politics and family relations, and the intrusion of lawyers,
political activists and television cameras into the negotiations
over Elian's future have made the situation difficult, adding to
the trauma the boy has already experienced, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults have a responsibility to give the child a model of
the world that is not filled with hatred and destruction,''
Kernberg said. ``They need to show that they are giving him safety
and security and that they love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, she said, has not yet been able to mourn his mother's
death and will need help coming to terms with that loss.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Wallerstein, founder and director of the Center for
the Family in Transition in Corte Madera, Calif., said she feared
that the model of adult society that Elian appeared to be absorbing
was one of ``a group of people who cannot resolve their issues
except savagely, of adults who behave with passion and who threaten
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein went on, saying: ``Somebody has got to show enough
civilization to be able to sit down and negotiate a solution, and
then together to convey it to the little boy. Someone has to say,
`We both love you,' and in some way to show him an example of
adults who can behave with intelligence and rationality.''

STUDY FINDS THE SEA CONTRIBUTES TO OZONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sun and sea that give Southern California its
healthy allure also help add to its dirty reputation for smog,
according to a report released today.
</P>
<P>
   Atmospheric chemists and mechanical engineers at the University
of California, Irvine, said they have discovered salty ocean air,
carbon monoxide and nitrogen react with the sun to create a noxious
pollutant, ozone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the winds are transporting these particles to the basin,''
said Donald Dabdub, co-lead researcher on the report published in
today's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty strong argument that there is a lot of salt
playing a role in this particular geographic area,'' said Dabdub, a
mechanical and aerospace engineering professor at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   As influential as the South Coast Air Quality Management
District might be, officials said there is little they can do to
regulate the ocean as a pollution source.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing where the ozone is coming from, however, is invaluable
for predicting pollution, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for us, even though we can't control sea salt,
to account for all those things that make up air pollution,'' said
AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is exactly how much ozone the ocean and sun
contribute. The differences between what ozone levels the AQMD's
computer models predict for any given day and what is actually
measured on those days is not great, Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we have accounted for all the atmospheric
chemistry, but we do want to take a look at this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dabdub said the next step in the research, pioneered by
co-author Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, is to measure the impact of salt
air on the air quality of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The UCI team found that airborne microscopic droplets of salt,
known chemically as sodium chloride, split apart in sunlight. The
chlorine atoms in the salt air glom on to other chlorine atoms. In
a complex reaction, they mix with gases formed by auto and
industrial emissions to produce more ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, said Dabdub, in unpopulated places like the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, the chlorine atoms split off but, by
themselves, reduce the amount of ozone in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Benson, a professor emeritus of chemistry at the
University of Southern California, said the finding is significant
``because it widens the net of what's going on around us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells us is that we'd better not worry about needles
in the haystack,'' Benson said. ``There are plenty of things in
life that affect us.''

DOCUMENTS REVEAL PERSONAL STRUGGLE BEHIND PLAYER'S SUMMER-LEAGUE
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With its teal three-point arcs and tight,
bleacherless sidelines, the Guardian Angels Church gym on Westport
Road was familiar to Schlagle High School senior Andre Williams.
But the ``coach'' he met on the night of May 27, 1998, was not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different type of coach for a different kind of game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running drills with summer-league coach Myron Piggie,
Williams and an uncle met with private investigator Ted Knox.
Beginning at 7:30 p.m. and for the next two hours, they discussed
how to tape record Piggie offering Williams $100 a week to play on
his summer-league team.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would ultimately lead to a two-year federal
investigation that would shake college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Knox had been hired by Tom Grant, the chief executive officer of
LabOne Inc. whose family foundation once sponsored Piggie's
summer-league team. Knox remembers Williams as skittish that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little nervous, but he listened to what he needed to
do,'' Knox told The Kansas City Star. ``I assured him we would be
there for him.... Andre just wanted to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox put a tape recorder on Williams' home phone the next day.
The ensuing tapes resulted in the indictments unveiled Thursday
against Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorney, Williams, now a freshman at Oklahoma State
University, declined to comment for this article, saying it is time
to get on with his life. Piggie was in federal custody Thursday and
could not be reached for comment. Piggie's attorney declined to
comment after his initial court appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' account, however, is set out in detail in documents
prepared with his cooperation and released to The Star recently by
Oklahoma State. The letters and reports, based on interviews with
Williams by university officials, were prepared in December and
January as they appealed Williams' suspension for NCAA rules
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other interviews, Grant foundation records and
information from Thursday's federal charges, it's now possible to
paint the richest public picture yet of how authorities think
Piggie operated.
</P>
<P>
   And they show why the NCAA ended up suspending seven big-time
college players this past season amid a searing reassessment of
amateur basketball.  &LR; brk:Unlikely duo and the dream team
</P>
<P>
   Williams' meeting in Guardian Angels Church gym with the private
investigator had its roots at least three years before in the
flourishing relationship between an unlikely pair: Tom Grant and
Myron Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   The streetwise coach and the Johnson County multimillionaire had
teamed up to attract high school basketball players to teams
sponsored by Grant. Such nonscholastic teams have become
increasingly important to players eager to hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   At times the two wrangled wayward players, making sure they made
it to practice, and class.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through June 1998, Grant's foundation wrote checks to
Piggie totaling $184,435 covering salary and expenses, Thursday's
indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the focus of Piggie's and Grant's attention wasn't
Williams but rather JaRon Rush, a restless high school phenom whom
Grant had taken into his home and treated like a son.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 letter to the NCAA, Grant described his feelings about
Piggie:
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked with me in trying to help JaRon become a
responsible adult,'' Grant wrote. ``Myron is not an educated man,
but he has a good heart and works every afternoon with JaRon on
helping him improve his game....Myron has been a positive influence
on JaRon....''
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1997, the grooming of Rush had begun to pay
off. Piggie assembled what is remembered as a summer-league dream
team _ including Rush, Williams and future NBA players Korleone
Young and Corey Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   That 1997 summer team appeared unstoppable as it began the
national circuit of Amateur Athletic Union tournaments and shoe
company events _ a whirlwind of games played before top college
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the country's best college prospects under his
wing, more money started coming Piggie's way. Nike Inc. signed him
to a consulting contract worth up to $425,000, and sports agents
began giving him money to represent their interests in the amateur
basketball community, according to the federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said in an interview last week that the attention began to
change Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy who suddenly had all these college basketball
coaches calling him on a daily basis,'' Grant said. ``And then (CBS
basketball commentator and Nike consultant) George Raveling would
call him three or four times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Raveling was unavailable for comment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The money also had its effect. In 1997, Piggie bought two houses
and leased a Toyota Land Cruiser, Jackson County records show.
</P>
<P>
   But late 1997 also brought the first hints of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That fall The Basketball Times published an article that
contained allegations Piggie had taken the Nike shoes he was
supposed to pass on to athletes for free and instead sold them for
personal profit, an allegation Piggie has denied in the past. The
article also contained details of his criminal history,
specifically a felony drug conviction in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confronted him in the fall of 1997 about the article,''
Grant said in the interview. ``I knew he had a criminal background,
but I didn't know how extensive. He denied all the allegations
against him about dealing the shoes. I was close to the guy. I
believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Piggie's denials, Grant withdrew support for Piggie's
traveling team, but agreed to pay him for six months under a
``severance'' agreement.  &LR; brk:`Lack of trust'
</P>
<P>
   Piggie soon started assembling his next summer team, then
sponsored only by Nike. Schlagle's Williams was a natural prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a supporting player on Piggie's dream team the
summer before, he had developed into a big-time college prospect.
He again began playing for Piggie in the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams had worries off the court. According to the
Oklahoma State records, he was concerned that he didn't have the
grades to graduate from Schlagle that May, much less qualify
academically for college.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie's solution ultimately contributed to Williams'
disenchantment with his coach. He suggested to Williams and his
uncle, Al Collins, that Williams spend an additional year in an
East Coast prep school to sharpen his grades. Furthermore, Piggie
promised to ``get him into'' Hargrave Military Academy, Oklahoma
State letters assert.
</P>
<P>
   But as weeks passed, Williams and his uncle grew frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma State administrator wrote that ``whenever Andre or
Mr. Collins asked Piggie what Andre's status was at Hargrave,
Piggie would respond `I'm taking care of it.' To make a long story
short, Piggie made unfulfilled promises to Andre and delayed his
opportunities to get into a prep school or other education
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   To paper over the rift, according to the Oklahoma State
documents, Piggie began giving Williams money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre describes his relationship with Myron Piggie as one with
a lack of trust for each other,'' another university official
wrote. ``He feels the cash payments were given in order to try to
re-establish some trust.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal indictment, Williams in the spring of
1998 traveled to a Virginia tournament and received $100 from a
Piggie associate.
</P>
<P>
   Two more payments amounting to $150 came on trips to Indiana and
Kansas, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Oklahoma State letter, ``the other two payments
were given directly from Piggie to Andre when Piggie shook his hand
and the cash was in the palm of his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams said he received an offer of weekly stipends of at
least $100, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Williams refused the weekly stipends and quit Piggie's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre indicated that a term like `you scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours' may have been used, but that this phrase meant
little to him because of the lack of trust,'' an Oklahoma State
administrator wrote. ``That is, he had no intention of ever having
a future relationship with Myron Piggie.''  &LR; brk:Trouble sets in
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about his academic future and concerned that the
payments taken from Piggie might harm his college eligibility,
Williams appeared at Grant's Mission Hills home for a talk in the
spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged,'' Grant said of the alleged payments.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Grant had hired Knox, who met Williams and his
uncle at the Westport Road gym that May night.
</P>
<P>
   With the permission of his mother, Williams began recording his
phone calls with Piggie, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant doesn't apologize for asking an 18-year-old high school
student to tape record a convicted drug felon, though he's uneasy
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat naive,'' Grant said. ``I thought if I gave
these tapes to the NCAA, (Piggie) would just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox said that because he has testified before a federal grand
jury he couldn't discuss the contents of the tapes, which are in
the hands of federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But the recordings show Piggie urging Williams to pass up a
summer job and receive money to play on Piggie's team, said John
Osgood, Grant's attorney. The indictment also says Piggie made such
an offer.
</P>
<P>
   With that success, Knox ratcheted up his surveillance plan.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Knox wired Williams with a miniature body
microphone for personal meetings with Piggie. For one planned
meeting at the McDonald's restaurant on the Country Club Plaza,
Knox positioned telephoto cameras and video equipment in a van
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But Piggie missed each of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Grant said, he called Piggie, and taped the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not going to give you any more money, you're
paying basketball players,' '' Grant recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie denied it vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Myron, buddy, we taped you,' '' Grant said. ``He
wasn't very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox and Grant then approached the NCAA, hoping they could push
Piggie out of amateur basketball. They were disappointed with the
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they had no jurisdiction over a (summer league)
coach,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, in June 1998, Knox reported Piggie to
FBI agents, who took several months to review the information and
research the law. Grant first appeared before a federal grand jury
in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, FBI agents interviewed JaRon and his brother Kareem Rush,
a freshman at the University of Missouri, and uncovered the
information that eventually led to their NCAA suspensions for parts
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moving methodically, prosecutors and agents from the FBI and the
IRS spent a year scouring tax records and documents from Grant's
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And Piggie saw his fortunes wane.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, he was arrested and later convicted for
carrying a concealed weapon in Kansas City. A month later, Nike
canceled Piggie's consulting contract. According to the indictment,
Nike was convinced he had been profiteering on shoes. A Nike
spokesman says the company has never taken legal steps to recover
its loss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Piggie faced a lawsuit from an unpaid creditor and a
repossession action for two leased Toyota Land Cruisers and a
Corolla. He also was convicted of misdemeanor assault for closing a
garage door on a Jackson County sheriff's deputy who came to his
home to take the cars.  &LR; brk:Question of fairness
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the relationship with Piggie, Grant's
interest in Williams continued. He underwrote the entire cost of
Williams' school year at an East Coast prep school, Maine Central
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   While there, Williams won a citizenship award and organized a
basketball tournament to raise money for the school's needy student
assistance fund. He also helped lead the MCI basketball team to a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant's tuition payments created new problems for Williams
after he enrolled at Oklahoma State University in 1999. While
school investigators investigated the payments to Piggie, Williams
voluntarily disclosed Grant's support.
</P>
<P>
   The school responded by suspending Williams from the basketball
team after only five games and reporting him to the NCAA for
possible rules violations. While the school argued for a mild
penalty, the NCAA appeared ready to extend that penalty to a year
and require him to repay $20,000 in MCI tuition.
</P>
<P>
   School officials mounted a furious effort to get him reinstated,
noting that Williams voluntarily disclosed the tuition payments and
had cooperated fully in a much more serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for Andre's commitment to eligibility rules, his honesty
and his courage, the current federal and NCAA investigations into
illegal and improper conduct into Kansas City-area, AAU-sanctioned
summer basketball might not be occurring,'' an Oklahoma State
official wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA relented, at least partly, limiting Williams'
suspension to the five games he already had sat out and ordering
him to pay a $5,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams rejoined the Cowboys for their run through March
Madness.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to disciplinary action against Williams and his
former Kansas City teammates, brothers JaRon and Kareem Rush, the
NCAA suspended five other big-time basketball players for taking
improper benefits while in high school or for dealing with sports
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Grant understands the Piggie saga still has a ways to run. He's
not completely happy with the way it has turned out thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Only the kids have been made to pay for the mistakes of the
grownups, he said, and he called on NCAA officials to apologize to
Williams and rescind the $5,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reported (Piggie's) actions and this is the reward he
gets from the NCAA?'' Grant said. ``It's important they do that.
How can this be equitable?''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Baseball, hot dogs and Orel Hershiser. Bunting,
balloons and Orel Hershiser. Fireworks, marching bands and Orel
Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Home opener at Dodger Stadium and the Bulldog on the mound. The
combination just feels so correct, at one stage in spring training
the club's braintrust let its heart take over and considered
setting up the entire pitching rotation to give the 41-year-old
right-hander the stage today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed that,'' Hershiser said this week. ``That's just not
the way you go about things. That doesn't make for good team
chemistry. That doesn't make for a good chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   But things like this just seem to magically work out for
Hershiser, and the pitching-staff juggling that followed Kevin
Brown's injury and Sunday's snow-out in New York have landed the
right man in the right place at the right time for the Los Angeles
Dodgers' game against the Cincinnati Reds this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in the wilderness _ Cleveland, San Francisco,
New York Mets _ Hershiser should get a throaty welcome back from
56,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great for the fans to remember the Dodgers of
old,'' general manager Kevin Malone said, meaning the World Series
champion 1988 Dodgers. ``When you think of the Dodgers, you think
of winning, and he represents that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, as you might expect, prefers not to be thought of as
a museum piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't some victory tour or a nostalgia thing because I'm
wearing a Dodger uniform again. This is an intense athlete going
out to try to beat you,'' he said during the Dodgers' series
against the Giants in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hershiser also is blessed with the kind of intense
self-awareness more common in politicians and artists than in
athletes, who tend to leave to others the task of putting their
accomplishments in historical context. So Hershiser understands
perfectly the nostalgia attached to his start today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first reason it exists is that there hasn't been a world
championship in Los Angeles since '88. Second reason it exists is I
was a big part of that team,'' said Hershiser, who struck out the
Oakland A's Tony Phillips to end that World Series, and all these
years later remains the last Dodgers pitcher to win a postseason
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third reason it exists is the club has been sold from Mr.
(Peter) O'Malley. Fourth reason it exists is there was a kneejerk
(public) reaction to the people who purchased the club from Mr.
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the way we're going to erase that is we're going to have a
good year this year and there will be a new level of nostalgia.
That will erase most of what I represent. Or it will add to it, if
I'm a big part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you'd forgotten, Hershiser actually talks that way, in
organized thoughts and sentences, often leaving sportswriters
slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the '88 team succeeded, we kind of put the
Garvey-Russell-Cey-Lopes infield in the background,'' Hershiser
said. ``There hasn't been a new kid in town to draw the attention
away from the '88 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, two years after I left, (Hideo) Nomo would have had a Cy
Young year, and the Dodgers would have gone off and won the world
championship, and Pedro Martinez had stayed with the club, and this
dynamic pitching staff had carried them to three or four
championships . . . I'd be old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Old news with a Cy Young Award, a 23-win season and a record
59-inning shutout streak, all from 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has a tendency to make you think about `Where were
you then?' '' said Hershiser, who, as he spoke, sat at a card table
in the Pacific Bell Park visitors' clubhouse. ``The game is so
long, and there are dead points in it, and conversations come up.
And people want to talk about positive things in contrast to the
negative that might be going on the field. So when is the last
positive thing they can talk about? Gibby's (Kirk Gibson's) name
comes up, I'm sure. Steve Sax's name comes up, my name comes up,
Mickey Hatcher's name comes up, Mike Scioscia's name comes up.
That's given us some life.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hershiser begins an unusual attempt to kick dirt into his own
deep footprints on Los Angeles baseball history. A 2000 Dodgers
championship, and the sweet memory of 1988 fades just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment the task is to make the bitter memory of 1998-99
fade just a bit. A new managing partner, Daly, and a revamped
Dodger Stadium, now boasting luxury suites, will greet the
opening-day fans.
</P>
<P>
   And an old Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to restore whatever it is we're looking to
restore with one player in one day or over one homestand,''
Hershiser said, separating the nostalgia from the practical
significance of today's start. ``You're going to do it by
consistently having quality and integrity in the way you go about
your business, from Mr. Daly to the guys down in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's magic in the 2000 Dodgers, this is the day and
he's the man to find it.

TIGERS SHUT OUT MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The easy move would be to dump on Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Price wouldn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mesa, after all, who brought a scoreless pitching duel to
an end by giving up an eighth-inning RBI double to Juan Gonzalez,
the key hit in the Detroit Tigers' 2-0 win over the Seattle
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Price, the Mariners pitching coach, isn't much for doing things
the easy way. He is mindful that Mesa can still be a force out of
the Seattle bullpen. Mesa, after all, saved 33 games last year and
still throws in the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   If fact, Price said it's been Mesa's penchant to rely on
throwing hard that has ultimately made the veteran less dependable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost confidence in Mesa at all,'' Price said. ``He's
got the ability. He can throw the ball as hard as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to get him back to pitching, not just throwing.
When he comes in throwing all hard stuff, he's not using all the
weapons he has in his arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa entered the game in the eighth inning. Reliever Arthur
Rhodes, who'd successfully used hard stuff to pitch the Mariners
out of a jam in the seventh inning, walked Shane Halter to start
the eighth. Enter Mesa to face Gonzalez, although Gonzalez had
never really solved the left-handed Rhodes in the past (2-for-23,
.087).
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle manager Lou Piniella is a great believer in the
percentages, which say a right-handed pitcher has the best chance
to get a right-handed hitter out. Hence Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   He missed with a fastball, then came back with another fastball.
Gonzalez, who won two league Most Valuable Player awards with Texas
by gobbling up fastballs, lashed this one to right-center. Halter
scored the game's first run, and later in the inning, Gonzalez's
pinch-runner, Karim Garcia, scored on a Dean Palmer sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I brought Mesa in, I told him that he had to keep the
ball down,'' Piniella said. ``Gonzalez can't run right now. If we
keep the ball down, we've got a good shot at a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mesa's second pitch was mid-thigh hard stuff, the double
play became a double _ even for Gonzalez, who is essentially
playing on one leg because of hamstring troubles. And the game,
doable to that point for Seattle, slipped away from the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for Jose to be hit hard like this,'' Price
said. ``To me, this calls for a change of plans. He needs to back
off throwing the hard stuff all the time. When you throw hard stuff
in the same zone all the time, you're not making it difficult
enough on the batter.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pitching made it plenty tough on Seattle batters
Thursday night, although it could be said that the Mariners made it
hard on themselves by engaging the pitches served up by Detroit
starter Hideo Nomo with too much passion on a night when some
reserve was indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chased a lot of pitches,'' Piniella said. ``Too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle flirted with scoring from the first inning, when Mark
McLemore and Alex Rodriguez were each thrown out stealing, to the
last, when David Bell, who'd ripped the ball twice for hits early
in the game, bounced into a game-ending double play with two on.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, waiting in the on-deck circle when the game ended,
expressed the evening's frustrations by arching his back backward,
his bat still on his shoulder and his face locked in a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners left 11 men on base, but it seemed like they'd left
the 101st Airborne stranded out between first and third. Seattle
continued an early season trend to the downside by going 0-for-10
with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's best chance to score came in the sixth inning, when
the Mariners loaded the bases on a hit by Bell and two walks by
Nomo. That brought up John Olerud, who would wind up with six hits
in the three games. This time, however, the best that Olerud could
manage was a short fly ball to left field.
</P>
<P>
   With McLemore, one of the fastest of the Mariners, on third
base, third base coach Larry Bowa bucked the odds and challenged
outfielder Bobby Higginson's arm by sending McLemore. Catcher Brad
Ausmus took a perfect one-hop throw from Higginson, and even a
jolting shoulder from McLemore couldn't dislodge the ball from
Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the throw is left or right, then there's a chance (to
score),'' McLemore said, ``but the throw was right there. I was
trying to jar the ball loose, but he got the ball early enough that
he braced himself good.''
</P>
<P>
   If McLemore's effort was futile, it probably should never have
come into play. Bowa said he knew sending McLemore was a
low-percentage move, but given the state of the Mariners'
non-offense, a low-percentage move seemed to be the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the blame for that one,'' Bowa said. ``I thought I'd
try to make them make a perfect throw. They did. I was watching us
strand runners all night. If we'd been swinging the bats well, I
never would have even thought about sending Mac home.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's offensive slump isn't a one-time wonder. The Mariners
have a winning record at 5-4, but the club is hitting only .252,
11th in the 14-team American League. And with men in scoring
position, the average plummets to .087 (2-for-23).
</P>
<P>
   That's sickly under any circumstances, moreso for a club that
hit over .300 in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   As Piniella will be the first to attest, this is not spring
training. But the time for experimenting isn't over. Charles Gipson
will start at third base and Stan Javier in left field tonight in
Toronto in the endless quest for offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still playing around with the lineup, trying to find a
combination that will swing the bat,'' Piniella said.

 HULL STEPS UP, STARS DOMINATE TO TAKE 2-0
LEAD (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Deep down, the Stars knew they were kidding themselves
if they thought they could repeat as Stanley Cup champions without
getting Brett Hull involved. Well ... Consider him involved. Hull
scored a goal and assisted on another in the Stars' 3-0 victory
against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 2 of the best-of-seven
first-round series last night at Reunion Arena. The victory didn't
merely serve notice to the Oilers that their season is on the verge
of being over, but to the rest of the NHL as well that the Stars
are pretty serious about this whole The Cup Stays Here'' thing.
More and more,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said when asked if
this season's team has a look of last season's. \RJamie
Langenbrunner\S said it before the playoffs. Everyone in this room
is going to be disappointed if we don't get to the end. I think we
have a team capable of getting to the end.'' The Stars have won
nine consecutive playoff games against the Oilers and take a 2-0
series lead into Sunday's game in Edmonton. What the Stars liked in
Game 1 _ the stifling defense, timely goaltending and a guy named
Mike Modano _ were once again present and dominant in Game 2. What
was missing in Game 1 _ an involved Hull, a flying Joe Nieuwendyk
and more goals _ were added for Game 2. Oh yeah, and they're set to
get their best puck-handling defenseman, Sergei Zubov, back for
Game 3. So is this Stars' team capable of repeating as Cup
champions? The way \RDerian\S Hatcher is playing, the way Modano is
playing and Eddie is on the top of his game, they seem to be on top
of a lot of things'' Oilers coach Kevin Lowe said. But it's a long,
hard road.'' Once again, the Stars dominated the game from the
get-go. But late in the second period, they were a mistake away
from a tie game. While the Stars were playing quite well with a 1-0
lead, a second goal had the power to totally demoralize the Oilers.
Hull obliged. In a goal reminiscent of his Stanley Cup-winning goal
in Game 6 against Buffalo, Hull floated right to the edge of the
crease, found the loose puck and put in over Oilers goalie Tommy
Salo at 17:55 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   His feet weren't in the crease this time, not that it would've
mattered if they were. I told him the other day, `Geez, Hully, you
got the best shot in the game. Use it,' '' Stars winger Kirk Muller
said. We need him contributing.'' Hull played a big role on the
Stars' first goal, too. Modano started the play by carrying the
puck into the Stars' zone. As the Oilers' defense converged on him,
he threaded a pass between his legs to a waiting Hull. Hull faked
the shot and passed to winger Muller, who beat Salo high and stick
side at 15:33 of the first period. Hully's just a worker,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. This is not a series right now for the
faint of heart and Hully really dug in with the rest of us.'' The
back-to-back games were supposed to favor the younger, spritely
Oilers. They didn't. The Pittsburgh Peguins had as many goals in
their game against Washington (seven) as the Oilers had shots in
the first two periods. Their power play was ineffective at best,
demoralizing at worst. They got one shot on four power-play
opportunities. Yes, the Stars defense was that stifling. Captain
Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk once again led the charge with
17 hits while logging almost 60 minutes of ice. The game got
chippier and chippier as it went on, but the Stars didn't back
down. The Oilers finished with 17 shots. All of which were stopped
by Stars goalie Ed Belfour. He got his eighth career playoff
shutout and his fifth as a Star. We take a lot pride in shots on
goal,'' Modano said. We get excited about it. We like that
challenge. We like to smother them and frustrate them. When you can
roll four lines out there at them, it's pretty robotic after a
while.'' And unlike in Game 1, the Stars weren't content with a
one-goal lead. After Hull scored to make it two, Stars winger Scott
Thornton added another. His goal at 6:22 of the third period all
but finished the Oilers and served notice to the rest of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, of course, wasn't buying into talk of repeats just
yet. We've played two hockey games. That's where we are so far.''
The Oilers on the other hand see that same something that helped
the Stars win the Cup last season. I think that's obvious,'' Oilers
center Doug Weight said. That's no secret. That's why they won last
year. And that's been the story of the first two games.'' nn

   Once again, the Stars dominated the game from the get-go. But
late in the second period, they were a mistake away from a tie
game. While the Stars were playing quite well with a 1-0 lead, a
second goal had the power to totally demoralize the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull obliged.
</P>
<P>
   In a goal reminiscent of his Stanley Cup-winning goal in Game 6
against Buffalo, Hull floated right to the edge of the crease,
found the loose puck and put in over Oilers goalie Tommy Salo at
17:55 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   His feet weren't in the crease this time, not that it would've
mattered if they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the other day, `Geez, Hully, you got the best shot
in the game. Use it,' '' Stars winger Kirk Muller said. ``We need
him contributing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull played a big role on the Stars' first goal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Modano started the play by carrying the puck into the Stars'
zone. As the Oilers' defense converged on him, he threaded a pass
between his legs to a waiting Hull. Hull faked the shot and passed
to winger Muller, who beat Salo high and stick side at 15:33 of the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hully's just a worker,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``This is not a series right now for the faint of heart and Hully
really dug in with the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back games were supposed to favor the younger,
spritely Oilers. They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Peguins had as many goals in their game against
Washington (seven) as the Oilers had shots in the first two
periods. Their power play was ineffective at best, demoralizing at
worst. They got one shot on four power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars defense was that stifling. Captain Derian Hatcher
and Richard Matvichuk once again led the charge with 17 hits while
logging almost 60 minutes of ice. The game got chippier and
chippier as it went on, but the Stars didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers finished with 17 shots. All of which were stopped by
Stars goalie Ed Belfour. He got his eighth career playoff shutout
and his fifth as a Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot pride in shots on goal,'' Modano said. ``We get
excited about it. We like that challenge. We like to smother them
and frustrate them. When you can roll four lines out there at them,
it's pretty robotic after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike in Game 1, the Stars weren't content with a one-goal
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Hull scored to make it two, Stars winger Scott Thornton
added another. His goal at 6:22 of the third period all but
finished the Oilers and served notice to the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, of course, wasn't buying into talk of repeats just
yet. ``We've played two hockey games. That's where we are so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers on the other hand see that same something that helped
the Stars win the Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's obvious,'' Oilers center Doug Weight said.
``That's no secret. That's why they won last year. And that's been
the story of the first two games.''

LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITOR AND PUBLISHER TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Parks, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, told his top
lieutenants on Thursday evening that he and the publisher, Kathryn
S. Downing, would leave their posts after the completion of the
sale of the newspaper's parent company, the Times Mirror Co., to
the Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune is expected to take control within the next two
weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   John S. Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, has agreed to
replace Parks. John Puerner, the president and publisher of The
Orlando Sentinel, a Tribune Co. newspaper, will replace Downing,
Parks said, according to two Times editors briefed on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, who was appointed last June by the Times Mirror's chief
executive, Mark H. Willes, and Parks, who had served as editor for
more than two years, were both scarred by last fall's Staples
Center controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Downing had decided to share with the arena's owners the revenue
from special Sunday magazine covering the arena's opening. After he
discovered the arrangement, Parks made no move to scuttle the
magazine or inform readers of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, after the announcement of Tribune's purchase of
Times Mirror, which also publishes The Sun, Newsday, and several
smaller newspapers, Jack Fuller, the president of Tribune's
publishing division, said at a Times staff meeting that The Times
newsroom would be run from Los Angeles, not the Tribune Co.'s
Chicago headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave no guarantees that Parks and Downing would keep
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll himself, asked to confirm the widespread rumor of his
appointment, said politely, ``I'm afraid I can't help you.'' Parks
did not return a phone call to his office late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One newsroom executive at The Baltimore Sun, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Carroll's most likely successor would
be the managing editor, William Marimow, if Tribune executives did
not choose to look for outside candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an official announcement in the next few days
seems unlikely, since the Tribune Co.y does not yet have legal
control of Times Mirror and its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who will have the job of rebuilding the confidence of
the Times' newsroom in its management, has been The Sun's editor
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   During six years at the newspaper from 1966 to 1972, he had
served as a reporter in Vietnam, the Middle East and Washington.
From 1972 to 1991, he worked as an editor for Knight-Ridder
newspapers, first at The Philadelphia Inquirer, and later as the
top editor of the Lexington Herald-Leader.
</P>
<P>
   John Arthur, a managing editor at the Times, said late Thursday
evening, ``Michael Parks was an excellent editor under very
difficult circumstances.''

HIGH SCHOOL HOCKEY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN TEXAS, SUPPORTERS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK MAUCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of spectators from North Crowley and Arlington wedged
into the stands, while face-painted fans from L.D. Bell and Trinity
waited for the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Pep rallies were held, banners were hung, and cheerleaders urged
on their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Your typical Texas high school football or basketball game?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, this is typical of high school hockey in Fort
Worth-Dallas, Houston, Austin, Midland-Odessa, and perhaps your
town in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that high school hockey is here to stay,''
said Jerry Nichols, coach of the Arlington Wolverines. ``They'd
better get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport appears to be most popular in Fort Worth-Dallas, where
29 varsity teams participate in the Southwestern Bell Metroplex
High School Hockey League. In addition, the league is the only one
in Texas that has a junior varsity division, and it contains 25
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has 18 varsity teams, Austin and Midland-Odessa each
have four. San Antonio has two and San Angelo, Temple-Belton and
Lubbock might have teams next season.
</P>
<P>
   Eight teams are scheduled to compete today through Sunday at the
Dr Pepper StarCenter in the Texas Amateur Hockey Association State
High School Hockey Tournament. That's twice the number of teams in
the entire state four years ago when the Fort Worth-Dallas league
started with teams from Carroll, Coppell, Dallas Jesuit and Plano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey is basically still something new and exciting to most
folks in Texas and everyone wants to be a part of it,'' said Kent
Holmes, director the Southwestern Bell League. ``Certainly the
success of the \RStanley Cup champion\S Stars has helped because a
winning team attracts attention to a sport, but the minor-league
teams around the state have to be commended as well for the way
they are marketing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of high school hockey has also caught the attention
of the University Interscholastic League, the state's governing
body for high school sports. Athletic director Charles Breithaupt
said his office regularly gets calls asking when the UIL will
sanction the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we'll have an official proposal in June,''
Breithaupt said. ``Our athletics committee and policy committee
will give us direction, perhaps ask for a survey, and report back
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leagues seem to be very well organized.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of the sport could be an obstacle for many school
districts, Breithaupt said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the average rate for ice time in Fort Worth-Dallas
is $250 an hour and the average cost for a player to participate in
the Southwestern Bell League is about $300 per season. Those
expenses, combined with the cost of equipment _ about $500 for
forwards and defensemen and around $1,500 for a goalie _ are
factors the UIL will consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, I just don't see schools voting in a sport
so expensive,'' Breithaupt said. ``The demand may become so strong
some day that they have to, but now, budgets are tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Breithaupt suggested that more school districts in cities with
minor-league teams try to form teams since playing venues already
exist.
</P>
<P>
   New StarCenters are scheduled to open in Euless later this month
and in Duncanville in October, and one already exists in Irving.
Plus, Holmes said the Southwestern Bell League has potential use of
six other facilities for teams in Fort Worth, Grapevine, North
Richland Hills, Plano, Addison and a facility being built in
Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there are four venues with perhaps one more on the
way, Interscholastic Hockey League director Bill Justice said, and
Central Texas Hockey League director Lance Kappell said Austin has
one high school facility with no more planned.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to the UIL does not guarantee sanctioning. Wrestling
was the last sport the organization sanctioned, in 1998. Grapevine
wrestling coach Steve Wills said it took about 20 years for the
sport to reach that level and his advice to those wanting hockey to
be sanctioned is to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is reasonable. If it takes less, they'll be
fortunate,'' Wills said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin wrestling coach Tony Warren said, ``It's simple. If the
demand is there, it will pass. School districts have to get
involved now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of school districts kept saying when we were pushing
wrestling that they'd have a team if it went UIL. We kept telling
them that if they'd come along, it would go UIL.''
</P>
<P>
   Breithaupt said the UIL isn't looking for a specific number of
participating schools. He noted that soccer was basically a sport
played only by Class 5A schools when it was sanctioned in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   If the UIL sanctions hockey, changes will come. Among the most
significant, teams could no longer practice or play on Sunday and
coaches would have to be teachers employed by their district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caution people to be careful what they wish for,'' Trinity
coach Keith Andresen said. ``There's not a lot of teachers who can
coach hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, consolidated teams, such as those in Arlington and North
Crowley, would be broken up. The UIL would require each team to
represent one school.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Bell League has a policy that consolidated
teams have to begin breaking up into school teams after three
years. In Houston and Austin, it's four years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the teams in the state tournament, six are one-school teams.
Dallas Episcopal and North Crowley are consolidated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen teams in the Southwestern Bell League come from a
single school, while Houston has eight, and Austin has one.
</P>
<P>
   Kappell said his league strictly enforces a no-pass//no-play
rule, as does the Houston league. In the Southwestern Bell League,
the decision is left up to each team, but most coaches enforce
no-pass/no-play, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the leagues are going to have to be on the same page
rules-wise for the UIL to seriously consider us,'' Kappell said.
</P>
<P>
   Elite players are taking the sport more seriously on the high
school level, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like club hockey, but high school is the coolest,'' said
Trevor Ludwig, the son of former Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig.
``It's just neat to know that your friends are in the stands
cheering you on and you're going to see them in school the next
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes coached Plano to a state championship last season before
becoming league director. He said his players received letter
jackets and that other schools such as Trinity and Dallas Jesuit
have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   North Crowley coach Joe Cocchiarella said he believes the sport
will spread to smaller towns. Then, he said, the UIL will have to
take a long, hard look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the Springtowns, the Weatherfords and Aledos having
teams,'' Cocchiarella said. ``When they do, it'll be a UIL sport.
Popular public opinion is going to demand it be sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:A growing sport Across the state, high school hockey
has grown rapidly in the past four years. In the 1996-97 season,
the Fort Worth-Dallas area had four teams. Houston started with six
in 1997-98. Here's a breakdown of high school hockey sites and the
number of teams today: Fort Worth-Dallas _ 29 varsity teams, 25
junior varsity Houston _ 18 varsity teams Austin _ 4 varsity teams
Midland-Odessa _ 4 varsity teams San Antonio _ 2 varsity teams
Possible for next season _ San Angelo, Lubbock and Temple-Belton

HFRANK JEWETT MATHER III, 89, DEVELOPER OF TAGGING SYSTEM FOR BIG
OCEAN FISH
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Jewett Mather III, a scientist who developed the first
tagging program for large pelagic, or open- ocean, fish, died on
March 27 in Falmouth, Mass. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Mather's passion for fishing lured him from a career as a naval
architect into the field of fisheries research. He started working
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts in
1945 as a research assistant and began the cooperative game fish
tagging program there in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   This program continues today under the direction of the U.S.
National Marine Fisheries Service. Mather's research into the
fisheries of large pelagic fish _ tuna, marlin and sailfish _
prompted the first active conservation measures for the Atlantic
bluefin tuna by the United States, which led to the Atlantic Tunas
Convention Act of 1976.
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1977, Mather was a member of the Expert Panel for
the Facilitation of Tuna Research of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1978, he was scientific adviser to the U.S.
delegation to the International Commission for the Conservation of
Atlantic Tuna. In this capacity, he worked on numerous advisory
committees and working groups and was one of the major forces that
led the commission to enact the first management measures ever for
the Atlantic bluefin tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Mather received degrees from Williams College in 1933 and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937. An avid sailor in
his youth, he designed ships for the war effort from 1941 to 1945.
Late in his life, in 1999, Mather's efforts to save South Florida
fishing and wildlife earned him the Herman Lucerne Memorial Award
from the Metropolitan South Florida Fishing Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mather is survived by his wife, Natalie N. Mather of Key
Biscayne, Fla., and Woods Hole; his children, Willia V. Mather of
Dolores Hidalgo, Mexico, Lee Townley of Brunswick, Maine, Catherine
Whited of Unity, Maine, Arden Edwards and Richard Edwards Jr., both
of Woods Hole, and eight grandchildren.  &QL;

KINGS HAVE NO EXCUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ They could have looked at Bryan Smolinski and Ziggy
Palffy and said it was not their night. They could have looked at
the Detroit Red Wings and said it's not their year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings know if they want to make the playoffs more than a
novelty, they can't make excuses about Thursday's 2-0 loss in Game
1 of their opening-round series at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski played on a torn right-knee ligament, Palffy played
with a sprained right shoulder. A year ago, they were New York
Islanders and far from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were homelast year, too, but rookie coach Andy Murray
made sure this year they were not just happy to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well enough to stay close, but we didn't play well
enough to win,'' he said. ``It's encouraging to be competitive with
a team as good as Detroit with all their history. But we didn't
come here to just show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their fourth best point total (94) in franchise history,
the Kings did arrive as heavy underdogs. They also hadn't won in
the playoffs since Game 1 of the 1993 final against Montreal, a
string of eight games that now stands at nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings were second in the league with 108 points. They
also won the Stanley Cup two consecutive years before going out in
the second round last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't that far away tonight,'' said Smolinski, a Michigan
native. ``For the knee it seemed like business as usual, but it
will be better and so will the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the game, the Kings were smothered at center ice, and
that enabled Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood to record his
seventh career playoff shutout. Osgood had been viewed as a weak
link for the Red Wings after an inconsistent second half. But
Detroit's defense made that all go away as they did about the
absence of league MVP candidate Steve Yzerman, who was out with the
flu and a tender knee.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two periods, they held the Kings top snipers _
Palffy, Luc Robitaille and Glen Murray _ without a shot.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Red Wings had a lead they would never give up.
Vysheslav Kozlov fired a puck off the backside of defenseman Jere
Karalati and past Kings goaltender Stephane Fiset just 1:43 into
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lucky goal,'' said Fiset, who stopped 29 of 31 shots.
``But he took a shot at the net and when you do that, you never
know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset also was spectacular in goal, turning back what could have
been a critical second-period break away by Sergei Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a guy like that coming at you, you just stand your
ground,'' Fiset said. But it was Fedorov on defense that made a
difference, stopping Ian Laperriere on a breakaway in the second.
Fedorov also scored the Wings' second goal, an empty netter after
Fiset was pulled with 53 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov's goal was his 39th in the postseason. Kozlov's was his
37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are guys who have been doing this a long time,'' said
Palffy, who was playing in his first playoff game. ``Sure, we were
a little nervous at first, but I never thought we were intimidated.
We belong here, not doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, injured March 15 against the Mighty Ducks, said he was
happy to get five extra days rest when the Kings scratched him the
last Sunday's final regular season game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better,'' Palffy said of the shoulder. ``And Saturday
it will be even stronger. This game was everything people said it
would be. The intensity was incredible. But I never felt like we
didn't have a chance. We were in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille finally got a chance to tie the game with 6:43 left
when he whistled a shot from the point with Murray in front. But
Osgood made the stop and controlled the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy might have had the best scoring chance of the night
midway through the third period. He circled in front of Osgood and
had an open look at the net. But center Brent Gilchrist pulled him
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game we play in the playoffs,'' Detroit
coach Scotty Bowman said. ``We play this way and then we break
out.''

ADAMS PROVES A RELIEF FOR L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Terry Adams is a big part of what Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson keeps promoting as both a new and improved
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the one-time Cubs closer, looked the part Thursday in the
conclusion of Wednesday's rain-suspended game.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander entered in the sixth with the bases loaded and
one out, and would have pitched out of the inning without allowing
a run if third baseman Adrian Beltre had cleanly handled a sharp
grounder and turned the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Adams did allow an RBI single to Rich Aurilia but finished off
the inning without allowing another run and then threw a perfect
seventh to earn the victory in the Dodgers' 6-5 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adams did a hell of a job,'' Johnson said. ``He came in a
tough situation and really gave them nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams is now 1-0 with a 2.35 ERA in four games, having allowed
four hits in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Because the first game picked up in the bottom the sixth inning,
Adams barely had time to sit before he was called on to take over
for Jeff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ' ``You kind of feel like a starter,'' Adams said. ``As soon as
I sat down, I had to get up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first situation I've been in with the bases
loaded. I thought I pitched pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers rallied on an RBI single by Mark Grudzielanek,
Todd Hundley's sacrifice fly and a run-scoring Adrian Beltre
infield single, another part of the Dodgers revamped bullpen, Mike
Fetters, gave up one run on two hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants put two on with two outs in the ninth against closer
Jeff Shaw before he got Jeff Kent to fly out and earn his third
save.
</P>
<P>
   __ Work in progress: With Kevin Brown on the 15-day disabled
list, Johnson is attempting to figure out the various pieces to his
pitching staff. The Dodgers need a starter for Saturday, and
Johnson said he will likely call up right-hander Eric Gagne to
pitch against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get him in the mix,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous-looking Williams, who lasted only a third of an inning
to open the sixth of the suspended game, could also start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was expected to make the rotation out of spring but
suffered through a disappointing exhibition season (0-2, 15.63 ERA
in four games).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to what I can do to strengthen and solidify the
rotation with some young arms,'' Johnson said. ``Who can stand up
and help this ballclub and burn some innings?''
</P>
<P>
   Someone will have to be sent down to make room for Gagne, and
Johnson said it might not necessarily be Carlos Perez. Johnson said
reliever Onan Masaoka (6.74 ERA in four games) has struggled and
might benefit from being sent down to get more work.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he would prefer to have a left-hander in the
rotation, but once again, they are at a premium in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tidbits: Gary Sheffield has hit safely in all nine games and
Shawn Green in eight consecutive. . . . Devon White missed his
second game with a sore back. . . . In honor of Todd Hollandsworth
bizarrely going out to center in the fifth inning Wednesday night
sucking on a lollipop, the Dodgers PR staff passed out suckers to
the L.A. media corps Thursday.!dlim!!end! &QL;

HOWARD SIMON, 37, PLAYWRIGHT WHO HAD JUST FOUND SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard Simon, a playwright whose first major New York
production opened on Sunday night, died on Wednesday at New York
Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 37 and lived in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was septic shock brought on by streptococcus
meningitis, said Tracy Simon, his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who attended Morehouse College and studied in New York
University's graduate-level dramatic writing department, was the
author of at least nine plays, several of which were produced in
small theaters around the country. Last month he began rehearsals
for ``James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire,'' starring Charles Reese,
which is receiving an Equity-scale production at Abrons Art Center
at the Henry Street Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The play chronicles a night in Baldwin's life prior to a 1963
meeting with Robert Kennedy. David DeWitt, writing in The New York
Times, called the play ``funny, thrilling and wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon never saw his reviews, however. During the rehearsal
process, he had begun to suffer from severe headaches and a loss of
equilibrium, Reese said, and he was admitted to the hospital on
April 1. A day later, he fell into a coma and never regained
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   A Cleveland native, Simon initially followed a career as a
teacher, working in New York City public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he was accepted to NYU's graduate writing program,
where he studied with Tony Kushner, Maria Irene Fornes and Migdalia
Cruz. He received his master's degree in 1997 and his thesis play,
``One of the Children,'' was subsequently given a reading at SoHo
Rep.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his stage plays, Simon had also showed promise in
television writing. His teleplay ``Just Passin' Through,'' about a
black man impersonating a white man during the 1963 civil rights
march on Washington, was nominated for a regional Emmy award in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, he is survived by his grandparents,
Margie and Henry Simon, and his father, Howard Acoff, all of
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In his stage biography, Simon concludes with a lengthy quote
from Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, the educator. ``It is not a calamity to
die with dreams unfulfilled,'' the quote reads. ``But it is a
calamity not to dream.''

HERTZBERG SWORN IN AS CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sacramento, Calif. _ The San Fernando Valley gained a key
political power hitter on its state team Thursday as Assemblyman
Robert M. Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was sworn in as speaker, promising
a bigger share of the budget for his home community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Fernando Valley did not lose an assemblyman today,
they gained a speaker,'' Hertzberg said at a stately Capitol
ceremony that drew scores of elected officials and business leaders
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg's leadership position in the state Legislature's lower
house gives the moderate Democrat vast new decision-making
responsibility over prioritizing bills and directing resources to
finance them.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech during the installation ceremony, he outlined a
long agenda from improving the legislative process to improving the
state's educational system, particularly community colleges, and
providing more affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of business leaders and elected officials from the Valley
made the trip to Sacramento for the swearing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic step for the cityhood struggle,'' said
Richard Close, who chairs Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment and sees Hertzberg as a key ally in the effort to
secede from the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is the crown jewel of the Valley in Sacramento, and
hopefully he'll be able to help us cut through so much of the
bureaucratic red tape for cityhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said Hertzberg can help the Valley get a fairer share of
state resources but can do little about the real problem: ``City
officials who decide on resource distribution still want to keep
all the good stuff on the other side of Mulholland Drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonny Herman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association, also came to the state capital to attend a
1,500-person party in Hertzberg's honor and shared Close's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Valley, the bottom line is that we need more dollars to
go into infrastructure improvements and if anyone can streamline
the process to make it happen, it's Bob,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg is the first speaker from the Valley since Bob Moretti
in 1974, and the first Jewish speaker in 73 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg's predecessor, Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, is
being forced from the Assembly after this year because of term
limits. He served two years as speaker and is running for mayor of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Hertzberg has already been taking on the duties of his
predecessor, a close ally who helped drum up support that led to
Hertzberg's unusual unanimous election to the speaker post in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Hertzberg announced strong Assembly support
for an additional $1.4 billion in education spending on top of Gov.
Gray Davis' proposed budget plan. Even with the additional funds,
California would fall below the national average for per-student
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is infrastructure,'' Hertzberg said. ``It is an
embarrassment that in ... California, we invest less in our
schoolchildren than all but a handful of other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who attended the swearing in and has called education his
top priority, said in an interview that he supports Hertzberg's
spending proposal, especially since the 2000-01 state budget is
expected to yield a surplus in excess of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we'll see increased spending on education and I think
we can expect to see more initiatives like the one Bob has
presented,'' Davis said. ``I look forward to working with him to
get the budget done on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after being sworn in, Hertzberg appointed
Assemblyman Dennis A. Cardoza, D-Turlock, to replace him as chair
of the Rules Committee, which mandates how the Assembly operates.
</P>
<P>
   At his swearing in, Hertzberg set several priorities for when
the Legislature reconvenes April 24, including setting up a special
watchdog office to ensure state departments are implementing laws
on time. He also said initiatives are forthcoming to increase
spending on affordable housing and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Another priority, Hertzberg said, will be to continue to take
steps to ensure that Democrats and Republicans in the Assembly can
work together to move laws forward instead of stalling them with
partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge to support a culture that honors each member of this
House as an individual - a member of this House first, and a member
of his or her own party, second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who control 32 of the 80 seats in the Assembly, are
not expected to unseat enough Democrats in the upcoming November
elections to make the vote even.
</P>
<P>
   And for all his talk of bipartisanship, Hertzberg's No. 1
priority as speaker is to maintain the Democratic Party's
stranglehold on power in the Assembly.

DODGERS SWEEP GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers survived snow, rain,
the opening of Pacific Bell Park, being gone from home almost two
months, and Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   All and all, a pretty good trip.
</P>
<P>
   Now this afternoon they finally get to play a game at home,
feeling tired but pretty good about themselves after taking one
game from the Giants 6-5 Thursday night and then bringing off a
three-game sweep with an 11-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers assured themselves of a winning trip with the
victory in the first game, completing the game suspended because of
rain the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win a pennant in April, but you can look
back on these as big games later,'' said reliever Terry Adams, who
earned the victory in suspended game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers started Perez in the regularly scheduled game, and
if truth be told, crossed their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers having to fly out immediately following their
mini-doubleheader to play an afternoon home opener, manager Davey
Johnson sat three normal starters in Thursday's second game _ Eric
Karros, Kevin Elster and Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   But this new lineup quickly went after Giants starter Mark
Gardner, scoring six runs before Perez had to throw a single pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The first six Dodgers reached base before the Giants could
record an out.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield's single scored one, Adrian Beltre's hit drove in
two more, Dave Hansen's single scored another, Chad Krueter's
ground out scored a fifth and Jose Vizcaino's base hit scored the
inning's final run.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had his gift.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got two more in a hurry when Barry Bonds hit a
two-run homer that landed two-thirds up the right-field foul pole
in the bottom of the inning, but Perez would skate out of trouble
for most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was ticketed for the minors until Kevin Brown broke his
right pinkie finger, and Thursday's start was termed a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Before being lifted for a pinch hitter, Perez went six innings.
He allowed three runs on six hits and one walk. He struck out
three, was far from overpowering, but effective enough.
</P>
<P>
   The only other run he allowed came on Marvin Benard's solo home
run in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Calvin Murray hit a two-run homer off reliever Onan
Masaoka in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Before all that, they picked up Wednesday's game _ suspended
because of rain _ with the Dodgers leading 3-2 going into the
bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants immediately scored two runs off Jeff Williams,
who walked two and gave up a pair of hits before a quick exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the kid was a little nervous,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, though, quickly came back with three runs of their
own. The previous night _ stay with us, though, same game _ they
loaded the bases three times (twice with no outs), but scored but a
lone run each time.
</P>
<P>
   A new night brought a different result. Against reliever Ben
Weber, Todd Hollandsworth opened with a single, took second on a
wild pitch and scored on a Mark Grudzielanek single.
</P>
<P>
   A Sheffield single and a walk to Karros loaded the bases, with
Hundley's sacrifice fly scoring one and Beltre's infield single
driving in what would prove the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scraped a final run against Mike Fetters after Beltre
failed to cleanly field a potential double-play ball for the second
time in two innings, but this game _ this series _ was going to
belong all to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were looking at 0-3 in their new park, and 58 days
after they last saw it, the Dodgers were headed home.

McCOMB MAKES BIG PUSH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; When Doug McComb arrived at Irwindale Speedway on Saturday, he
had a feeling that little was going to stop him. The 23-year-old
Thousand Oaks resident brought his NASCAR Super Stock entry to the
track knowing his 1976 Chevy Nova needed some brake work.
</P>
<P>
   What he wasn't expecting was having to make an emergency trip to
an auto-parts store to buy a brake cylinder and then having to
install it between qualifying sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-thinking adjustments in the pits led to victory lane for
McComb. He won for the first time this season at Irwindale, holding
off late-charging T.K. Karvasek from North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very little time to set up,'' said McComb, a Thousand
Oaks High graduate. ``We qualified with no brakes and the car had a
bad push. We adjusted the rear stagger, but it still had a push for
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The little push forced McComb into third place early in the 40-
lap race. But as he worked his way to the front, he could feel
pressure from Steve Gilmore of Granada Hills and Karvasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little bit of door-to-door racing,'' McComb said.
``I had a lot of fun watching the race in my rear-view mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's win was the third for McComb at Irwindale. He
won two races and finished fourth in points in 1999, the year the
half-mile track opened. In 1998, McComb was second in rookie points
in the NASCAR Super Street Stock division at Mesa Marin Raceway in
Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale, Todd Burns of Riverside won the
NASCAR Late Model main event, Mike Mocaby of Bell Gardens won the
American Race Trucks main event and Mike Wright of Joshua Tree won
the MSRA Pro-4 Modifieds main event.
</P>
<P>
   Racing continues at Irwindale on Saturday with NASCAR Super Late
Models, Super Stocks, Grand American Modifieds, Legends Cars and
Ultra Wheel Spec Trucks. Gates open at 5 and racing starts at 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hornaday moving up: Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale had his best
finish of the season in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series on
Saturday at the Bell South Mobility 320 in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Hornady, the series rookie, finished third behind a pack of
first- year racers that filled half the top-10 spots. A trio of
rookies, including Kevin Harvick of Bakersfield, followed in fourth
to sixth. Harvick was fourth. Additionally, rookie Jimmie Johnson
was 10th.
</P>
<P>
   With his podium finish, Hornaday jumped into sixth place in the
series points standings and increased his lead in the rookie
standings to 23 points. Harvick is second in rookie points with 80.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Busch series is Saturday for the Touchstone
Energy 300 at Talledega Speedway in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ventura Raceway: Clark Templeman III of Santa Clarita won for
the second week in a row in the Sprint division at Ventura Raceway
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Marty Desbrow of Ojai collected his first win
of the season in the I-4 Modified class and Craig Germanetti of
Carpinteria, the track's defending street stock champion, won for
the first time this season. &QL;

RIVALRY GONE RETRO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time was the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati
Reds would stage civic rallies and a series would break out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ventured to Cincinnati and Walter Alston would get
booed; the Reds traveled to L.A. and Pete Rose would get pelted in
the outfield with fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s there was no richer rivalry in baseball than the
one between L.A. and Cincinnati. ``The Giants are supposed to be
the Dodgers' natural rivals,'' Reds manager Sparky Anderson said at
the time, ``but I don't think the feeling is there anymore. It's
not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the two teams squared off, it was a clash of titans, of
cultures, of sensibilities. It was the Queen City vs. the city of
celluloid Kings; lunch-pail mores vs. laissez-faireism; small town
vs. sprawling city; superior pitching vs. peerless hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven years between 1972 and 1978, Cincinnati or Los
Angeles represented the National League in the World Series. The
two teams distanced themselves from the rest of the West on the
diamond and also in the stands, where they routinely ranked one-two
in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Dodgers, the Big Red Machine might have
steamrolled through the 1970s, its success so off the charts, those
Cincinnati teams would have gone down in pop culture as the Bee
Gees of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Reds were more like Andy Gibb, brightening
the era like a shooting star. In 1975, Cincinnati won the first of
back-to-back world titles, turning back Boston in a seven-game
World Series after streaking by the Dodgers on the wings of a
celestial midseason stretch in which the Reds won 41 of 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, many Cincinnatians are saying the
updated, upgraded Big Red Machine will tear through this decade and
leave more of a mark than it did in the `70s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interest in this year's team is so high that Elder High,
a Catholic school in the Western Hills section where Rose was
reared, scheduled a teachers in-service day on Reds' opening day
this year so the students wouldn't have to choose between classes
and history.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Cincinnati's (and Ken Griffey Sr.'s) prodigal son,
Ken Jr., was such a landmark event in the city, ``parents were
going to pull their kids out of school, anyway, so why have
school?'' reasoned Elder's principal, Tom Otten.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. is his father's son but not your father's Red. The
Reds of the '70s were so conservative the players were forbidden
from growing facial hair. Rose, the embodiment of the Big Red
Machine, was such a traditionalist he once cut short a photography
shoot when the photographer playfully turned the bill of Rose's cap
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Rose screamed, recoiling. ``I never, ever, wear a
baseball uniform like a clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr., the new face of the franchise, has no such
compunctions. Since his Seattle days, he has tried to move fashion
forward by wearing his cap backward.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffey Jr. accepted much less than market value to return
to his hometown, it raised expectations to a level not seen in
these parts since Griffey's father's first full season with the
Reds in 1975. And not just among the local populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the start of one of the greatest seasons any Cincinnati
team has ever had,'' said outfielder Dmitri Young before the Reds
lost five of their first nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Young's heart was in the right place even if he started the
season out of position, at first base, because of Sean Casey's
broken thumb.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't worry about having to eat his words. Once Griffey
Jr. adjusts to National League hitting, the Kid and his supporting
cast ought to be all right. The Retro Red Machine's lineup, from
Pokey Reese to Michael Tucker, has the power to give opposing
pitchers fits.
</P>
<P>
   All eight players in the every-day lineup hit at least 10 home
runs in 1999, an executioners row not seen in Cincinnati since the
mid-1970s when George Foster, Cesar Geronimo and Ken Griffey Sr.
averaged 57 RBI collectively while batting sixth, seventh and
eighth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder second baseman Joe Morgan was quoted at the time as
saying, ``I feel we have the perfect lineup. There are no outs
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Rose and Morgan got the hits and Johnny Bench and Tony
Perez got them home. Twenty-five years later, the Reds are counting
on Reese and Barry Larkin getting on base and Griffey Jr., Dante
Bichette and Casey driving them home.
</P>
<P>
   Those `70s Reds, anchored by Gold Glove givens Morgan, Bench and
shortstop Dave Concepcion, were airtight defensively.
</P>
<P>
   These Retro Reds have the Tupperware seal, to be sure. Reese has
been called ``the best fielding second baseman I've ever seen'' by
no less an authority than Marty Brennaman, who has been
broadcasting Reds games for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you agree with him (Anderson, for one, does not,
deferring to Morgan), there's no disputing that Reese, like Morgan,
makes fielding look like ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Reese, Larkin and Griffey Jr. are Gold Glove winners. Together
they form a midsection as strong as a weightlifter's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds could stand to beef up their starting rotation. Pete
Harnisch and Denny Neagle are fierce competitors, but they don't
command fear, fame or even fitness (both battled shoulder problems
last year).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jack Billingham, Don Gullett and Clay Kirby weren't
exactly household names in the `70s and they turned out to be
useful cogs in the Big Red Machine. The bullpen carried the
pitching staff then, and now Scott Williamson and Danny Graves
headline a relief corps that led the majors last year with a 3.36
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about the Retro Red Machine: It has a sleek look.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Griffey Jr., arguably the greatest player of his
era, makes all the difference. Like the new VW bug, these Retro
Reds look, on the surface, to be an improvement over the original.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take our word for it. ``Cincinnati is back,'' said
former skipper Anderson, now retired and living in Thousand Oaks.
``I've already said the Reds and the Yankees will meet in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dodgers-Reds rivalry that will be renewed today? The
pitching isn't there anymore for the Dodgers so neither is the
feeling. While general manager Jim Bowden was busy recreating the
past, you see, the Dodgers were simply living in it.

<P>
   CHINA-POPULATE (Lufeng, China) _ In a country best known for its
excruciatingly tough one-child policy, large young families today
are scattered throughout the countryside. Although, technically,
rural families can have only up to two children _ and then only if
the first child is a girl _ families with three, four, five or more
children are now the norm in many areas, including this southern
coastal region of Guangdong. The size of the rural population boom
is unclear because many ``illegal'' children are born in secret,
their births never officially registered. And so, as China prepares
this year to conduct its once-a-decade census, the true size of the
world's most populous country remains in doubt. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.

<P>
   COAL-ASH-ENVIRON (Farmersburg, Ind.) _ It is bad enough, people
here say, that their beloved Indiana countryside has been gouged by
strip mines. What could be worse, they fear, is what the coal
company wants to put back in the holes. What worries people is
something called coal ash, which is what is left after coal is
burned in the power plants that still generate more than half of
the electricity used in the United States. Across the country, more
than 100 million tons of the ash are produced each year, and until
now, it has been treated as essentially benign. But almost
overnight, the question of coal ash and how to handle it has become
the subject of a hot environmental debate. By Douglas Jehl.

<P>
   SCI-MOST-DISTANT-OBJECTS (Undated) _ Astronomers working on a
vast survey of the heavens have discovered the most distant object
ever detected, a fiery, reddish dot called a quasar that emitted
its light less than a billion years after the universe was born.
But in a measure of how efficiently telescopes have begun plumbing
the deepest reaches of the cosmos, astronomers on the project said
that they could break their own record within days or weeks as the
survey continues its sweep across the sky. What made the find
extraordinary, they said, was the discovery of dozens of other
quasars that are nearly as distant, allowing scientists to begin
piecing together a kind of census of regions of the universe that
were once entirely inaccessible. By James Glanz.

   GORE-ENVIRON (Washington) _ Republicans can barely control their
glee as Al Gore's ``Earth in the Balance'' is reissued, asserting
that it will cast the presumptive Democratic nominee as a dangerous
environmentalist extremist. Democrats counter such attacks have
failed before _ remember ``ozone man?'' in 1992 _ and Gore will
only look prescient for anyone going back to his 1991 environmental
manifesto. A look at the political maneuvering around this book,

Gore asserts that he stands by what he wrote. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-PRESS (Washington) _ Throughout the primary season George
W. Bush seemed almost reclusive in comparison with the
ultra-accessible John McCain. Though regular, his meetings with
reporters were quite controlled and he never held the sort of
free-wheeling sessions that McCain did. But since being assured of
the nomination, Bush has begun to open up, talking more often with
reporters and becoming, in stark contrast with his opponent, Al
Gore, the accessible candidate of the 2000 campaign. A political

   FARM-SUBSIDIES _ Congress once again is spreading billions to
fertilize American agribusiness. House and Senate negotiators
agreed on Wednesday to a new $7.1 billion bailout for farmers. But
that money was supposed to be drying up by now. Four years ago, the
Republican Congress proclaimed an end to what their speaker, Newt
Gingrich, called the ``East German socialist'' farm programs of the
New Deal. Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the
Republicans' Freedom to Farm Act. But Congress has since repeatedly
passed emergency increases in spending for agriculture. And the
subsidies have been an unfailing spring, now flowing faster than
ever. By Tim Weiner.

companies to dot-com concerns, some people are finding the promised
land is not what they had expected. Not everybody finds it easy to
adjust to bosses who will not focus, workspaces that double as
kennels and a culture in which the fun is compulsory. Some are even

riches is too high. By Laura Holson and Katie Hafner.

coffee around here cost 40 cents and looked like motor oil cut with
a dollop of Elmer's glue. This syrupy concoction can still be had

teenagers and older, upwardly mobile workers nowadays flock to
trendy cafes to ponder dating or dot-coms over pricey coffee
concoctions. By Wayne Arnold.

the attic: The big money is in the airwaves. For the last five and
a half weeks, some of the world's leading telecommunications
companies have been battling for licenses to operate a new
generation of mobile phones and other wireless devices in Britain _
something seen as only the precursor of a much broader war for the
airwaves of Europe. By Alan Cowell.

   PALM-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ Looking at Palm Inc.'s share
price since it went public last month, you might think something

cheating makes it one of the most amazing tales that Wall Street
and corporate America have served up in years. By Floyd Norris.

   NY-UPTOWN-ART (New York) _ Fifth Avenue's Museum Mile officially

Manhattan's most distinctive museums and a scattering of hard

   VIRGINIA (Undated) _ Present-day Virginia is a perfectly
respectable state, but in Colonial times and through the early 19th
century, Virginia was a powerhouse, unsurpassed in population,
wealth, political influence and taste. Later, during the Civil War,
it was the colossus of the Confederacy and the key battleground of
the war. A result, for visitors today, is that Virginia's
historical and architectural riches are inexhaustible. Nowhere is
this more apparent than in Fredericksburg (population 19,000), a
wonderful small town midway between Washington and Richmond. Its
compact historic district, attractions and accessibility make
Fredericksburg an ideal weekend destination. By Richard Ruda.

ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES DEFY RENO AS COURT ISSUES STAY

</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Cuban flag was hoisted high by Cuban exiles Thursday
in a temporary victory over the governments of Fidel Castro and the
United States as Elian Gonzalez's relatives first defied a deadline
to give up the boy and then won an emergency stay that will delay
any action for at least the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   As 4,000 demonstrators cheered and chanted in the streets of
Little Havana outside the house of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, the boy's relatives ignored the order by Attorney General
Janet Reno to take Elian from the home by 2 p.m. and deliver him to
a nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just an hour or so later, lawyers for the great-uncle
obtained an emergency, temporary stay from the 11th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals, one that prevents Elian's father from taking the
boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A single appellate judge ordered the emergency stay and asked
the Justice Department to delay any efforts to take the boy until
the entire court could review the emergency petition.
</P>
<P>
   The stay blocks Elian from leaving the country while the full
panel considers an injunction that would keep him in the United
States until a full hearing before the 11th Circuit on May 11. It
does not specifically bar the government from returning Elian to
his father. But government officials said Thursday that they would
not try to take the boy away in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   It should take the appellate court three or four days to rule on
the emergency stay, said a Justice Department spokeswoman. The
appellate court also asked the government to file an answer to the
family's petition by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the 2 p.m. deadline was just the latest, and the most
audacious, defiance of the federal government by a family that had
seemed reconciled to losing the boy just a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day came to comply with a government order to hand
over Elian, Lazaro Gonzalez just said no. The government did not
immediately move to take Elian, and the standoff of more than four
months continued.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the news, Cuban-Americans ran down the streets,
laughing and screaming ``Justice! Justice! Justice!'' An elderly
woman in Little Havana grabbed a stranger's arm and, making
fluttering motions in the air with one hand, asked: ``Elian no fly
away now? Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Car horns pounded the air in Little Havana. Demonstrators
produced a dummy of Fidel Castro, stabbed it with flags, and then
ripped off its head.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed a clear, if temporary, defeat of an attorney
general who has been hung in effigy here for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to work through an extraordinary tragedy without
having to cause further harm to the boy,'' Reno said at a news
conference two hours before the deadline, in which she made it
clear that the government would not try to remove Elian
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is
waiting for a reunion with his son, more demonstrators called to
him to defect. He responded with a one-handed obscene gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Elian had appeared on television, speaking
directly to his father. ``Papa, I don't want to go to Cuba,'' he
said in Spanish, wagging his finger in the air like an adult
lecturing a child. ``I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now and then Elian, who was chewing gum, looked off-camera to
someone standing nearby. ``If you guys want to, you guys stay
here,'' he said, apparently referring to his father, stepmother and
half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   The home videotape of Elian, which was released by the family
and shown on several networks, carried a logo from the Spanish
language channel Univision.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, replied by
saying that the Miami relatives have exploited the boy and damaged
him, emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Lazaro Gonzalez defied the nation's chief law
enforcement officers and publicly and belligerently refused to turn
Elian over to his father,'' Craig said. ``Lazaro Gonzalez broke the
law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, when Elian was found floating off the
coast of South Florida after a failed crossing from Cuba resulted
in the deaths of his mother and 10 others, Reno has been flexible
with the Miami family, frequently extending deadlines for handing
over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Reno flew to Miami to meet with Lazaro
Gonzalez, Elian and other family members, in what many political
experts called an extraordinary gesture.
</P>
<P>
   But talks late into the night produced no agreement, and left
Lazaro Gonzalez so angry that he vowed that, if government
officials were going to have Elian the next day, they would have to
come into his home and take him.
</P>
<P>
   That puzzled many people who have heard him say over and over
that he does not want to traumatize the child by having him endure
such an abrupt, ugly separation from the Miami family that has
cared for him, bought him clothes and toys and even built him a
swing set in their yard.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez said that such a traumatic event would be better
than having the boy feel that he had been betrayed by his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been criticized by many people, both in and outside
South Florida, for her apparent, seemingly fathomless patience.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, some officials expressed
disappointment over her failure to return with Elian and said that
her high-profile effort had apparently accomplished little except
to further galvanize Miami's Cuban-American community against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the aides said the government had been left to seem
impotent and vacillating. Reno had allowed the relatives to flout
the law without facing the consequences, the critics said.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general, who was much more hotly criticized for
the way federal agents responded to Branch Davidians in Waco,
Texas, in 1993, resulting in a deadly fire, said any effort to take
Elian from Miami will be thoughtful, reasoned and measured.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, seemed weary of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to do everything I can to stay out of it,''
Clinton said. ``But it is our obligation to uphold the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd of demonstrators, several people said they had
shown Reno and Clinton that they simply would not be allowed to
have Elian. Some even chanted ``War! War! War!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it have to take all these Cubans to tell the
government that they're not practicing by their own rules,'' said
Jose Cabrera, a food service distributor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it was a peaceful, even carnival atmosphere,
where demonstrators stopped chanting to eat cherry snow cones and
take pictures of celebrities like Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, along with Garcia and Estefan, pleaded with the
swelling crowd for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want no violence,'' said Estefan, the singer who is an icon
in Miami, her hometown. ``We are a peaceful community.''
</P>
<P>
   But every few minutes seemed to bring another contradiction.
Family members asked for peace from the crowd even as they said
federal officials would have to enter the highly charged atmosphere
to take the boy away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to come get him,'' said Marisleysis
Gonzalez, Lazaro's 21-year-old daughter and the person who has been
closest to Elian here in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But that confrontation never came. Even though police used
barricades to block miles of the Little Havana neighborhood and had
dozens of officers standing by, the worst that happened was sunburn
and sore feet and hoarse voices. The crowd dwindled as the night
wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, the family must decide if it wants to have
federal agents come in and take the boy and carry him into a street
where thousands of people wait. They say they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing now depends on how the family handles it in
the last two minutes'' of that possible confrontation, said Angel
Calzadilla, a police officer in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators have said throughout the standoff that non-Cubans
would never understand why it is so hateful to them to have to give
up the child to a government that imprisoned and abused them and
their relatives and forced them into exile.
</P>
<P>
   To them, this is not just something that interrupts their
regularly scheduled programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real life,'' said Yaumary Marin, an insurance sales
agent who lives in Hialeah, Fla., and took the day off to come to
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   People carried signs that spelled out their long-running hatred
of the dictator. ``Elian's parole was signed by his mother's bloody
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's options seem to be running out. In Florida state
court, a judge rejected their request that the local court
intercede. The judge, Jennifer D. Bailey, ruled that she had no
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few more days, Miami's exiles are beating their
nemesis in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Amaro, an electrician who lives in Kendall, southwest of
Miami, brought her 5-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter to the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hope today,'' Amaro said.

<P>
   Might the Cold War's first frontier in Asia, and now all but its
last redoubt anywhere, be about to fall?
</P>
<P>
   If their summit goes ahead as planned, in June the leaders of
divided Korea will meet face-to-face for the first time ever, 50
years to the month after the Korean War began.
</P>
<P>
   As the Berlin Wall was to Europe, so the demilitarized zone
between the Koreas _ actually, the world's most heavily fortified
border _ still is to Asia: a symbol of conflict barely suppressed,
and of the divide between freedom and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a dangerous anachronism. An anachronism because
everywhere but North Korea (and Cuba), Marx has been shouted down
by the market.
</P>
<P>
   And dangerous because North Korea is armed to the teeth,
bellicose and tottering. Just a few months ago, it was threatening
to rain destruction on the neighborhood. Tomorrow, it could just as
easily collapse in violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, America, Japan, even China, virtually the only
friend North Korea has left, have been telling it to take its
finger off the trigger, reduce tensions with South Korea and start
trading goods, not threats.
</P>
<P>
   Even if nothing more comes out of it than an agreement to keep
the dialogue going, the June summit will be a start. Yet, when the
estranged leaders of the Koreas do meet, their talks are likely to
be fraught with difficulty, since all they know of each other is
seen down the barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is the first difficulty: without a reduction in
military tensions on the peninsula, another crisis could be just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to exaggerate the gulf between the Koreas.
South Korea's is a feisty economy that has survived East Asia's
financial troubles; its equally lively democrats were this week
slugging it out in parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, last holdout of Stalinism, is slowly emerging from
a mostly man-made famine that has killed hundreds of thousands of
people. Its politics is communist-cum-feudal.
</P>
<P>
   The place needs a radical economic shake-up to survive, but
reform could equally spell doom for its decrepit regime. So far it
has resisted even the limited contacts that would come from
allowing long-divided families to write or meet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if North Korea wants a new start in relations with the
South, this is as safe a time as any for it to crawl out of its
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Although the South still officially dreams of reunification, the
scale of North Korea's problems makes the dream seem like a
nightmare. Rather than nudge the North to collapse, South Korea is
offering huge dollops of investment to prop it up.
</P>
<P>
   Others are equally keen to see North Korea totter on. America
has 37,000 troops in the Korean firing line.
</P>
<P>
   China has no wish to watch the North collapse into the arms of
the capitalist South. And Japan knows that when reunification
eventually comes, it will be asked to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Is North Korea seriously looking for a way out of its mess?
South Korea is dangling plenty of generous carrots _ aid, trade and
expensive infrastructure projects _ that the North badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   But, before handing anything over, the South's president, Kim
Dae Jung, would be wise to insist that any such good turn by his
country gets another from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, South Korea has proffered food, fertilizer and the
like to coax the North into a little bit more contact, only to see
the North pocket as many goodies as it can, while conceding nothing
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bad behavior has often brought North Korea the best
rewards, as outsiders, including America, have sought to buy off
what they fear might be worse behavior to come. As a result, the
Koreas have staggered from crisis to crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What South Korea is now offering is hugely more generous. But,
while working to get concessions that will ease the harshness of
the divide, it also needs to press North Korea to do things to
break this dangerous cycle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the needed changes is for North Korea to uphold the 1994
agreement, negotiated by America, that freezes the North's
production of plutonium, from which nuclear bombs can be made, and
offers in return two western-designed, less proliferation-prone
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring
the freeze, North Korea has done nothing to enable it to
investigate past plutonium-dabbling, though it must do so
eventually, if the deal is not to collapse. And the North still
refuses to let the agency check its other nuclear sites, although
its safeguards agreement stipulates that it should.
</P>
<P>
   A second matter for discussion is North Korea's military
ambitions. Another nuclear crisis on the peninsula, prompted
perhaps by another test-firing of North Korea's increasingly
long-range rockets, would quickly destroy all hopes of narrowing
the North-South divide.
</P>
<P>
   The summit agenda, however, should not neglect more mundane
military matters. South Korea's capital, Seoul, is within easy
range of the thousands of artillery pieces and hundreds of
thousands of soldiers dug in on the North Korean side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting either side to disarm. But the North has
balked even at exchanging military information and observers.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-War borders are dangerous places. The one between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact bristled with weapons too. Yet timely arms-control
and confidence-building agreements helped make its eventual
dismantling an entirely peaceful affair.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of several troubling issues for the southern Mr. Kim to
think about during his journey north. &QL;

<P>
   Fannie and Freddie sound like a sweet couple living down the
street. But in America they are more likely to own the mortgage on
your and your neighbors' house.
</P>
<P>
   For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two of America's biggest
financial institutions _ and also two of its most indebted, with
around $1 trillion of debt between them.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae is the Federal National Mortgage Association, Freddie
Mac the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. They dominate
America's mortgage market, a preeminence that is becoming
controversial because these ``federal agencies'' are assumed
(despite official denials) to be guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie stand accused of using their ``government
guarantees'' to steal business from unambiguously private lenders.
One think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, says they are on
course to ``nationalize'' the mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressmen now wish to change the law to tame these
monsters before they stick the taxpayer with a bill reminiscent of
the savings-and-loan bust in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea behind Fannie and Freddie was innocuous
enough. It was to provide liquidity to mortgage lenders, and so
help people to buy homes, at a time when private markets could not
stump up enough money.
</P>
<P>
   But today the financial markets are more than able to deliver.
What the federal mortgage agencies do now is to distort the private
market. This is a perfect example of what people mean when they
talk of moral hazard caused by government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   As state enterprises go, the two agencies are mongrels rather
than thoroughbreds. Starting life as pure government bodies, Fannie
and Freddie have since been allowed to sell shares. They are now
among the most profitable companies quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``quasi-public'' status has only aggravated the moral
hazard, for they now combine the incentives (and pay) of the
private sector with the protection of the public sector, and impose
none of the constraints associated with either.
</P>
<P>
   If the modern version of the American Dream is to privatize
gains and socialize risks, then Fannie and Freddie are certainly
living it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: exempt from state and local taxes, they also have less
onerous capital-adequacy requirements than private rivals. And Wall
Street is urging them into more profitable, but riskier,
activities.
</P>
<P>
   What public enterprise can match Franklin Raines, boss of Fannie
Mae, who is paid $14 million a year, with share options on top? Or
provide the American president with such generous patronage (he
appoints five members of their boards)? Or allow such huge scope
for making political donations to congressmen from both parties?
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie have exploited fully the edge they get from
the belief that they are government-guaranteed. Borrowing at almost
the same rates as the Treasury, they earn a fortune by investing
the money in higher-yielding mortgages and mortgage-backed
securities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, they have increased their borrowing and
lending spectacularly. Without the ``guarantee,'' the risks of
mortgages would surely have raised borrowing costs, and reduced
their lending.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts that the financial markets believe that the
government stands behind the federal mortgage agencies were
dispelled recently when a senior official told Congress that the
government did not guarantee their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads between Treasuries and Fannies and Freddies immediately
widened. Only soothing noises from the Treasury (but not a
retraction) calmed the markets down.
</P>
<P>
   Credit creation by the federal mortgage agencies has been
accused of inflating a credit bubble. To meet their ambitious
profit-growth targets, Fannie and Freddie will need to undertake
ever riskier lending, and to retain ownership of a growing
proportion of mortgages. They will find it ever harder to hedge
away their risks.
</P>
<P>
   So any downturn in the housing market could easily cause one or
both of them to stumble, with knock-on effects throughout the
economy. Any bill would almost certainly go to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative, although Fannie and Freddie's pervasive
political connections will doubtless seek to stop it: to privatize
them fully. Then they could borrow only at interest rates that
reflect their true riskiness, forcing them to cut lending.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie may sound like kindly old codgers. But they
are more like spoiled rich kids, at risk of getting out of control.
Congress should force them to leave home before they do serious
damage to themselves and the economy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the imperfections of Latin American democracy, much
progress has been made in the past two decades in the conduct of
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, these are normally fraud-free in voting and
vote-counting. And, despite concerns about unequal financing, they
are, in broad terms, fair.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those claims holds true for last Sunday's
presidential election in Peru. In its lack of fairness and
openness, it marked a big step backwards for the region, comparable
only to the chaotic contest in the Dominican Republic in 1994 and
the notorious presidential election in Mexico in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began with the determination of President Alberto
Fujimori to seek a third consecutive term, which all but his own
acolytes rightly held to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was a charade. Fujimori's people abused the
resources of the state, offering food and land to voters. The main
television channels ignored the opposition candidates, and refused
to accept their paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in Alejandro Toledo, an economist of Andean Indian
descent, a popular opponent to Fujimori emerged. Sample counts by
reputable observers and polling companies showed Fujimori ahead,
but with less than the absolute majority required for outright
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a run-off against Toledo seems to have rattled
Fujimori. Not only did observers report fraud at some polling
stations, but the official vote count was a travesty.
</P>
<P>
   Partial results showing Fujimori within a hair's breadth of
victory were announced, even as the computer centers supposedly
counting them were closed for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo's supporters took to the streets, foreign governments,
led by the United States, warned Fujimori that unless a second
round were held, Peru could face international ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to do the trick: after much delay, on April 12 the
authorities eventually said that Fujimori had fallen just short of
outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori enjoys some genuine popular support, and for
understandable reasons: he has brought peace, stability and growth
to his country. But he has also built an autocracy, reliant on a
sinister intelligence boss and a handful of favored military
chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   His regime is cleverly based on the appearance of the rule of
law and utterly devoid of the independent institutions that make
such rule a reality to be relied upon. That has now become his
greatest liability.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a truly independent election authority means that,
even if Fujimori had in fact won the election, nobody could believe
him _ not a propitious way to start a new term.
</P>
<P>
   Instability, disorder and violence would be real threats if
Peru's next government were to lack legitimacy. Outsiders were
therefore right to insist on a second vote. But it must be held
under fairer conditions than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates should have equal access to the media. More
international observers will be needed, to cover polling stations
in remote, army-controlled areas, and with the power to watch over
the electoral authority's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the United States has been reluctant to push Fujimori
hard. He has been a reliable ally against drug-trafficking, his
country a bulwark of apparent stability in the troubled Andean
region. And he has lacked a credible opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments no longer apply. Resolute outside pressure could
yet ensure that some good comes from Peru's election.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, an inveterate talker with occasionally populist
tendencies, is not beyond criticism. But the surge of popular
support for his candidacy shows a powerful democratic impulse in
the Peruvian people.
</P>
<P>
   And there is another lesson for Latin America: in a region of
strong presidencies and otherwise weak institutions, it is folly
for an incumbent to seek a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori might have been stepping down this year to some acclaim
in the history books. Instead, his reckless pursuit of permanent
power risks undermining many of his achievements. &QL;

<P>
   ``Nuke the whales'' was a popular slogan among the
politically-incorrect in the 1980s. That is going a bit far. But
the issue of whether and how to protect ``charismatic megafauna''
(whales, elephants, tigers and so on) raises strong passions.
</P>
<P>
   These passions are now on view in Nairobi, at a meeting of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
that ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question is whether exploiting wild animals
destroys them or helps to preserve them. Most wildlife-conservation
problems are about habitat destruction. Preserve the habitat and
you preserve the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But a few creatures are in danger from people independently of
their habitat. Whales supply large amounts of meat. Tigers have
body parts that the ignorant believe will enhance sexual potency.
And elephants, the animals generating most heat in Nairobi, yield
ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists no longer throw up their hands in horror at the
very idea of wildlife being exploited (for anything other than
tourism, which was always alright).
</P>
<P>
   Now even drawing-room greens accept that conserving wildlife
requires that the people living nearby have a stake in its
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes the argument over elephants so ironic. It is
not between western do-gooders and hungry Third-Worlders; it is
between two groups of Third-World countries that see each other's
plans as inimical to their financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Those countries that wish to reopen the ivory trade _ Botswana,
Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe _ claim to have elephants coming
out of their ears. They are culling them in order to match numbers
to available habitat, so why not turn a profit on the tusks?
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, however, elephants are rarer. The Kenyans fear that
restarting the trade is too risky. Until 1989, limited trading in
ivory was permitted. Then it was banned entirely. Surprisingly, the
price of ivory responded by dropping, rather than rising, and
poaching fell off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the southern African states were allowed a one-off sale
to Japan of ivory stockpiled from culls. This seems (although the
evidence is disputed) to have stimulated poaching again; illegal
ivory was traded under cover of the legal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's elephant population fell from 40,000 in 1970 to 5,000 in
1988, and only began to rise when the trading ban was enforced.
Another big bout of poaching now could wipe it out.
</P>
<P>
   That is the nub of the Kenyan objection to resuming the ivory
trade. But it seems harsh to punish those who have done well for
their elephants by supporting those who, for whatever reason, have
let their populations shrink.
</P>
<P>
   There may, however, be a way out. Poachers are interested only
in ivory, which is valuable and easy to carry off. So trade in
other products, notably leather, could be permitted at once.
</P>
<P>
   Second, better monitoring of where elephant products come from,
and of the extent of poaching, is required.
</P>
<P>
   The existing CITES system, known as MIKE (Monitoring of the
Illegal Killing of Elephants) is widely seen as a laughingstock,
because it is underfinanced and not all countries give it
full-hearted support.
</P>
<P>
   A recent infusion of European Union money should change that,
but better management is also required. This should be assisted by
DNA tests to allow a tusk to be traced to a particular place. And
Japan, the main market for ivory, must be leaned on to enforce its
ivory-trading laws.
</P>
<P>
   Better monitoring should reduce poaching and smuggling to
acceptable levels, allowing legal trade to proceed without
stimulating the illegal sort. The carrot of legalized trading
should encourage all countries to give full backing to MIKE.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea would be for rich countries to club together to buy
part of the surplus southern African ivory before the trade ban is
lifted. That would give the poor countries some cash; and the rich
ones would get their money back when trading resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the trade would then be seen to be in
everybody's interests _ including the elephants'. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aptly enough, 2000 looks set to be a wonderful year for the
world economy. That, at any rate, is what the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts in its new global economic forecasts,
published this week.
</P>
<P>
   America is still booming, and the Fund expects it to sustain for
a while yet its recent miraculous performance. Europe, with lots of
ground to make up, has begun to surge as well.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, for those who see diminishing poverty as the chief
blessing of economic growth, the recovery in emerging economies
that were battered by the financial gales of 1997 and 1998 now
looks firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   In East Asia, especially, things are going better than almost
anybody expected even six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lately it has begun to seem that the emerging-markets crash of
the late 1990s _ which once appeared to endanger the global economy
_ will soon be regarded as a mere blip in the ongoing ``Asian
miracle.'' Even Japan's grossly mismanaged economy is beginning to
hobble forward.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it is a marvelous prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Maybe: there is nothing plain wrong in these
predictions. But at times like these, forecasts of this kind (no
fault of the Fund) are especially prone to mislead. Taken at face
value, they give no sense of the risks attached to the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The risks this time are big and getting bigger. And the
continuing flow of good news makes it less and less likely that
governments will take the steps that they otherwise might feel
obliged to in order to ward off the danger.
</P>
<P>
   This is no doubt a pity, but it was ever thus, and it explains a
fairly reliable law of economics: the bigger the boom, the crueller
the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economic center of gravity, from which much of this
good news flows, is, needless to say, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last October, the IMF's economists predicted that
America would grow by 2.6 percent in 2000. That would have been an
impressive performance by any standards _ this is the ninth year of
America's current economic expansion, remember _ especially when
combined, as the Fund said it would be, with an unemployment rate
pressed down to an extraordinary low of 4 percent, and an inflation
rate of just 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Fund now expects America to grow by a stunning 4.4
percent this year, and with inflation no higher than in its earlier
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   That revision transforms the global outlook, not just because
the United States accounts by itself for about a quarter of global
GDP, but also because galloping demand in America will keep
exerting a strong pull on economic activity in other regions, where
it continues to be needed.
</P>
<P>
   This only goes to show that, taking a longer-term view than the
Fund does in its forecasts, no question matters as much in judging
the prospects both for the United States and for the rest of the
world as whether the new-paradigmists are right about what is
happening in America.
</P>
<P>
   If they are, and America's sustainable long-term rate of growth
has increased by a full percentage point or more, the outlook for
everybody is doubly fine.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when reality dawns on Wall Street, as it will, and
investors understand that not even a fabulous ``new economy'' can
plausibly justify the recent frenzy of speculation, the letdown may
be comparatively gentle.
</P>
<P>
   The financial shock to the United States and the rest of the
world would be fairly mild.
</P>
<P>
   The second benefit is bigger: America's productivity revolution,
if that is what it is, should be exportable around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, the United States has markets for labor and capital, an
approach to government and all manner of other customs and economic
institutions that are peculiarly well-adapted to embracing radical
economic change.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new economy,'' such as it is, will diffuse with time
around those parts of the world that are willing to accept it, just
as earlier waves of technology-driven progress have done.
</P>
<P>
   If the new-paradigmists have got it wrong, however, the danger
is clear. The dawning of reality on Wall Street might then be
brutal.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between expected and actual earnings might be so large
as to cause a collapse in share prices, with severe turbulence
following across all the world's financial markets; and America's
external deficit, which grows apace despite surging productivity,
may prove hard to finance without a sharp fall in the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the prospect of a global supply-side miracle
would have been snatched away.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment it is wise, as most economic historians will tell
you, to remain somewhat agnostic about the new economy: the
evidence to settle the question will not be in for a good while
yet.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to be an economic historian to know that it
is also wise, while hoping for the best, to plan for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The new mood of optimism about the world's economic prospects
may prove self-defeating _ even on the assumption that the
new-paradigmists' claims are true _ if it means that steps to make
international financial markets safer, or to make Europe's
economies fiscally robust and more receptive to change, or to
strengthen corporate, financial and political governance in
emerging economies, are not taken. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   These things need to happen anyway. Good news creates an
especially favorable opportunity to respond to such challenges.
Unfortunately, it also subdues the will.
</P>
<P>
   The recent record of economic reform in the places that need it
most is decidedly mixed. There has been plenty of talk about new
financial ``architecture'' _ and there will be plenty more,
protesters permitting, when finance ministers meet in Washington
this weekend _ but there has been little action.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's appetite for fiscal reform, which is urgently needed in
view of demographic trends, has diminished since the advent of the
euro, and may disappear altogether as the cyclical upswing flatters
the public accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the developing world, industrial and financial reform has
sometimes been impressive by earlier standards, yet remains sadly
inadequate in relation to what is actually required.
</P>
<P>
   Were governments not so susceptible to complacency, the rosy
outlook for 2000 would be much easier to enjoy. &QL;

WHY AREN'T U.S. TAXPAYERS WHINING?: IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is spring and tax-filing time. Fruit-tree blossoms flutter on
to the freshly-cut grass. Completed IRS 1040 forms lie sprinkled on
the floor. Taxpayers whistle blithely while they fill in the still
uncompleted ones.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not. The American tax code remains as horribly
complicated as ever. But in a country built on a tax revolt it is
remarkable that, as the April 17 tax-filing deadline approaches,
the United States is gripped by a surge of contentment over tax.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes's attempt to become president on the promise of a
flat tax went nowhere. Republican congressmen, even those who
believe that government is a sin, are proposing smaller tax cuts
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, to be sure, wants a big tax cut; but this seems
to worry rather than excite voters. In poll after poll, tax cuts
come way down on the list of voters' concerns, somewhere above the
cost of Pokemon cards. Which is, at least when you first look at
it, rather odd.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans never tire of pointing out, the federal tax
burden now is higher _ over 20 percent of national income _ than it
was 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan came to office, promising to
slash federal taxes after the success of California's tax-cutting
Proposition 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Internal Revenue Service collected $1.7 trillion.
This sum was larger than Britain's entire gross domestic product
and enough to ensure that America had a budget surplus for the
third year running.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth isn't there a clamor to cut taxes? The popular
response is: it's the economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are doing so well these days that they don't need a
big tax cut. Inflation and unemployment are low; incomes are
rising.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan came to office, it was a different story: inflation
was 13 percent; unemployment was 7 percent; output was stagnant.
Tax cuts were then seen as a way to stimulate the economy. That
hardly seems necessary now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 325) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly something in this, and it means that, if
prosperity were all there was to it, you would expect demand for
tax cuts to rise again as soon as growth starts to falter. But that
may not be all there is to it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In three different ways, taxpayers' expectations may be changing
so as to mute the tax clamor, at least partly, even after the next
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   First, voters may have become more cynical about tax cuts. They
have listened to people saying ``read my lips, no new taxes'' and
have reasonably concluded that a politician promising big tax cuts
is either lying or cannot keep his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even if voters are just as gullible as ever, they are
now, on average, older, nearer retirement and more concerned about
the Social Security and Medicare programs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This concern helps to make sense of what is otherwise a puzzling
finding: that nearly everyone thinks taxes are too high, even
though no one seems unduly concerned about cutting them (70 percent
said taxes were too high in a recent Economist poll).
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is that voters do care about taxes, but are more
worried about the solvency of Social Security and the cost of the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   It is a triumph of the Clinton administration's ability to
associate ``tax cuts'' in people's minds with ``lower social
services'' and ``higher debt burden'' even at a time of budget
surpluses. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third, people may no longer judge the weight of their tax burden
on the scales of income alone. They also take into account total
wealth, including the huge capital gains they have made over the
past five years in the stock markets. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This may not actually make much sense. With a few exceptions
(notably inheritance duties), people's tax bills are based on their
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than half of all Americans now own shares, mostly
through pension plans, so it is inevitable that their stock market
gains make them feel wealthier, and their tax burden lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you measure taxes as a share not of income alone, but
of income plus the change in households' net worth, the tax burden
is falling. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All these are reasons for thinking that taxpayers may be
changing their minds about what counts as ``too much'' tax. It
certainly makes any tax revolt harder to foresee.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition to all this, a more fundamental change is
reconciling people to their apparently high tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Most people aren't paying these high overall taxes. Much of the
tax burden in super-capitalist, anti-egalitarian, winner-takes-all
America falls on, er, the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class and poor are paying less than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, America's super-rich _ the wealthiest 1
percent of taxpayers _ paid 19 percent of all federal taxes. Now
they pay a third. The share paid by the merely wealthy _ the top 5
percent _ has risen from just over a third to just over half during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the middle class and the poor are paying far less.
Those with so-called median incomes, the midpoint in the income
scale, or the middle of the middle class, now have their lowest
income-tax burden since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   And families at the bottom are doing even better. The Earned
Income Tax Credit _ a sort of reverse income tax for the working
poor _ means that those getting half the median income get paid
more in EITC credits than they pay out in income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the vast majority of taxpayers are not bothered by the
increasing tax burden: they are not bearing it.
</P>
<P>
   And the rich can afford to. Earnings at the top have shot up
over the past 20 years and, in the age of the longest-ever economic
expansion, when the gap between rich and poor has yawned ever
wider, few rich Americans are likely to start complaining
vociferously about their tax bill getting in the way of that new
kitchen in their (second) house in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the top marginal rate has come down from 70 percent in
1980 to 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the years of tax revolt seem to have achieved a
remarkable (and unintended) outcome: in the country thought of as
friendlier to the rich than almost any other, there has been a huge
swing in the tax burden away from the poor and towards the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Marx might have asked for a little more; a few European thinkers
will doubtless whimper about the need for a third way. But,
fiscally speaking at least, America seems to be making the rich
pay.
</P>
<P>
   And _ except possibly on tax-filing day _ almost everyone is
satisfied with this new state of affairs. &QL;

   CLEMSON AND LITCHFIELD BEACH, S.C. _ Stanley Schuman was on his
knees, gardening, when he accidentally invaded the space of a
fire-ant colony. It was a serious mistake. Weeks later, his legs
still sported blotchy red stings.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Dr. Schuman is one of the world's experts on
the ferocious creatures, and the havoc they wreak.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that each spring some part of America gets into an
undue panic about the arrival of fire ants tends to obscure two
harsher truths: they are spreading relentlessly; and they are
pretty nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Their venom, thought to be unique in the animal kingdom,
consists overwhelmingly of an unpleasant, pepper-like substance. By
the time you feel it, the fire ant may already have bitten you
three times.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the bee which dies for the cause when it stings you,
the fire ant can run off and bite you again tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants move collectively in a ``boiling'' pattern; a
seemingly insignificant disturbance near a fire-ant mound may
instantly set off a wave of coordinated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants can kill household pets, deer fawns and lambs.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the human population, including Dr. Schuman,
suffer only a sharp annoyance from a fire-ant attack. Around 15
percent get a swollen limb for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But one or two in every hundred, if stung badly enough, can
experience a constricted throat, shocks to the heart and even
death.
</P>
<P>
   The dead victim's skin shows no reaction. ``You can't even tell
in an autopsy. It's the perfect murder,'' Dr. Schuman cheerfully
explains.
</P>
<P>
   The invader is believed to have arrived in the United States
70-80 years ago via Mobile, Ala., probably in a ship's ballast.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Brazil and Argentina, the fire ant faced
well-established predators that kept its numbers in check. The
United States had no such defenses, and the fire ants spread like
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, fire-ant country covers all of southeastern United
States, from Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Inadvertent transport by humans has helped the ant to reach as
far away as California. Given time, the critter may eventually
colonize the Pacific Coast up to Canada and most of the Atlantic
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Like high-tech armaments, the ants are also getting steadily
more sophisticated. One emerging problem is hybridization between
the fire ant's red and black varieties, which has given the ant new
and apparently useful genetic adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse is the emergence of colonies that operate with more
than one queen. Multiple-queen colonies can produce far more than
the 350,000 eggs per year that colonies with one queen usually
churn out. Moreover, the presence of two or more queens seems to
help colonies recover from an attack by pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sending 30,000 people to hospital every year, fire ants
are hurting the economy. They damage the nursery and sod-growing
industry, which is worth $200 million a year in South Carolina
alone.
</P>
<P>
   They love electrical wiring; when they eat through wires, they
can put large appliances out of action.
</P>
<P>
   A study reckoned that, all in all, they cost South Carolinians
$80 per household last year. Texans have to fork out even more.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the fire ants is not easy. Edward Wilson of Harvard, who
knows more about this subject than almost anybody else, once called
the decades-long war against them ``the Vietnam of the insect
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular techniques such as feeding them grits, the hot breakfast
cereal popular in the South, have now been proved ineffective; fire
ants don't eat solid food. Using gasoline is both risky and
environmentally harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense, it seems, is to spread soybean oil baited with
a slow-acting pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news. Allergy tests and desensitization
regimes _ if ordered by doctors, which is a big if _ identify and
fortify the people most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   And the counterattackers have imported some clever tricks from
the ant's native habitat. One involves putting an ant-specific
disease into the ant-mounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a parasitic fly that lays its larvae inside the ant's
head. The larvae eat through the inside of the head until it falls
off, and the other ants remove the carcass. Fine, if grisly.
</P>
<P>
   But the fly method, tested twice with some success last year,
suffers from the problem of rearing enough flies. You need 3,000 to
make a serious assault. An entomologist, Clyde Gorsuch, says that
``we don't know where the flies rest, or where they come from, or
how long they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle continues. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Since it came into force in 1994, the North
American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has tranformed many aspects
of economic life in Mexico, and has helped the country achieve
several years of steady growth. Yet some Mexican habits remain
defiantly unreformed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boasts of ministers that they have created a
deregulated market economy, monopoly and official patronage still
count for much in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more starkly illustrated than in the current row
over competition in the telecoms industry.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after its privatization, that industry is still
dominated by Telmex, the former state-owned monopoly, whose
controlling shareholder is Carlos Slim, Latin America's richest
man.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex enjoyed a de facto monopoly (except in mobile phones)
until 1997, when the long-distance market was opened up. The first
local service customers were signed up by competitors only last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Telmex still has 75 percent of Mexico's long-distance
business, 95 percent of its fixed lines, and four-fifths of its
mobile-phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   One result of that stranglehold is that Mexico has fewer
telephone lines per person than other Latin American countries _
even Brazil, which privatized its telephones only in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government eventually set up a proper regulator for
the telecoms industry (known as Cofetel) in 1996, this body has
long been accused of being soft on Telmex. And at the slightest
hint of pressure, Telmex has won injunctions from the country's
supine courts to protect its privileged position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mexico's competition commission declared that Telmex
had ``market dominance,'' a finding that allowed Cofetel to impose
tougher rules on it than on its competitors. So far Cofetel has not
done so.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after talks broke down between Telmex and the other
companies on issues such as interconnection rates (what
long-distance providers must pay Telmex to connect calls through
its local network), the agency at last said it would step in.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Cofetel, the odds were always stacked against it.
Telmex accounts for nearly 30 percent of the value of Mexico's
stock market, and Slim, who heads a diversified conglomerate with
businesses ranging from retailing to Internettery, has huge
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Telmex's power allows it to behave like a bully. Some
Telmex customers have been told that their lines will work properly
only if they use Telmex handsets, which is illegal under the
competition law.
</P>
<P>
   One Telmex engineer admitted to a customer that, if she used
another long-distance provider, such things as digital services
provided by Telmex would _ deliberately _ not work properly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Telmex's main competitors, Avantel and Alestra (in
which, respectively, MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T have large
shareholdings) are up to their own tricks.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is known as bypass, or disguising long-distance
calls as local ones to avoid paying interconnection fees. They are
also trying some political pressure of their own, through their
American shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade
representative, threatened to take a telecoms complaint against
Mexico to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such pressure may not help. Telmex, in which SBC
Communications, an American company, has a 9 percent shareholding,
has used anti-American propaganda to attack its competitors in the
past. And Telmex's supporters point out that its rivals hardly lack
their own local political connections.
</P>
<P>
   Avantel's Mexican shareholder is Banamex, the country's biggest
bank. Alestra is backed by Grupo Alfa, a powerful industrial
conglomerate. Defenders of Telmex thus have little sympathy for its
competitors' cries of unfair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   With such heavyweights as these in the ring, it is no surprise
that even President Ernesto Zedillo has preferred to look on in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Those really hurt by these bullying tactics, however, are
consumers. Lack of tougher regulation is one reason why some
potential competitors to Telmex have yet to offer local service,
despite having held licences for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though competition has made life cheaper for businesses that
make a lot of long-distance calls, ordinary people still pay high
prices for lines and local calls.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner Telmex is reined in, the better for them. Better
still, a tough line in favor of competition in such a big industry
would send a ringing message to monopolies in other branches of the
economy. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ There is an adage that Russia is never as strong, or as
weak, as it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kremlin's new occupants may be repeating it to
themselves under their breath as they try to keep within reasonable
limits the surge of exuberance that often takes hold of Moscow's
ruling class in spring.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants have several
reasons to be tempted into euphoria, and several reasons to be
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economy. Especially if they are not examined too
closely, Russia's financial statistics continue to look better than
the wildest optimist could have predicted at the time of Moscow's
financial crash in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is widely agreed that a windfall from rising oil
revenues has simply masked a continuing failure to make any serious
structural reforms, a number of indicators _ industrial production,
budget revenues and foreign-exchange reserves _ still look rosy,
even as crude-oil prices tumble from their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kasyanov, the deputy prime minister responsible for the
economy, gloated to a group of American businessmen this week that
in the first quarter of this year the government had achieved a
budget surplus of 4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   On shakier ground, he argued that because the new government, at
least in the short term, was awash with revenue, it would be less
reliant on the patronage of politically-minded tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   The same mood of defiant optimism is discernible in Russia's
view of the world, even though the government was stung when the
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe voted last week to
suspend Russian participation unless it behaved better in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet chortling in the Kremlin this week as the German
government squirmed with embarrassment over a revelation that its
intelligence chief had paid a friendly visit to the Russian side of
the Chechen war front.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American visitors to Moscow have been complimented by
their Russian hosts for the ``understanding'' their country has
shown for Russia's policy in Chechnya: such a welcome change from
the pesky moralizing of West Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen also cite as a sign of fresh confidence the
apparent readiness of parliament, after seven years' prevarication,
to heed the Kremlin's wishes and ratify the Start-2 agreement to
slash the nuclear arsenals of America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever impression Putin makes in western countries _ such as
Britain, where he is due on April 16 _ there is still some
skepticism at home about his ability to impose his authority on
rival centers of power in Russia, including regional barons and the
``oligarchs,'' as the political tycoons are known.
</P>
<P>
   Putin-watchers are trying to work out which of the two forces
that propelled this obscure, middle-ranking intelligence officer to
supreme power will have more clout: the armed services or the
financial, media and raw-materials empire of the arch-oligarch,
Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost a year since Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister, fell from power after he blessed an investigation into
the financial dealings at Aeroflot, the airline Berezovsky
controls.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumors in Moscow this week that this probe had
started again _ and there was mystery over Berezovsky's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Putin has in recent days suffered a blow to his
domestic credibility: the withdrawal of his nominee, Valentina
Matviyenko, from next month's contest for the governorship of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The city's current boss, Vladimir Yakovlev, humiliated Putin in
1996 by trouncing his mentor, Anatoly Sobchak.
</P>
<P>
   For Putin, building up his own authority and keeping rivals in
check is not just a matter of point-scoring or personal
satisfaction. It is almost a prerequisite for his political
survival _ and for his ability to promote Russia's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   However good the numbers now look, the economy will badly need
investment over the next few years, as Soviet-era industrial plant
and infrastructure rust away.
</P>
<P>
   But little cash will come unless the division of political and
judicial power between Moscow and the regions is better defined.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the deadly effects of squabbling between Russia's
overmighty barons and the fragility of the economic upturn have
been shown up by a row between two of the country's most powerful
economic companies: the electricity-grid operator, Unified Energy
Systems (UES), run by Anatoly Chubais, and Gazprom, the gas
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom sharply cut supplies to UES this month, pleading that it
could not fulfil its lucrative export contracts while keeping
demand satisfied at home; Chubais would simply have to rely on
costlier energy, such as coal and oil, to keep the power on.
</P>
<P>
   The row, at least provisionally settled by a Kremlin compromise
this week, highlighted one of the economy's most serious worries _
the risk of power cuts. Even in the giddy atmosphere of Russia's
spring, that sort of battle is serious enough to dampen anyone's
euphoria. &QL;

   ISTANBUL _ It is another night of devotion at the ancient tekke,
as buildings that house dervish communities are known, in
Istanbul's Uskudar district.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful are beginning to file in. Trendy bankers, waddling
old peasant women and earnest teenagers remove their shoes, then
bow reverently before an old man sitting cross-legged on a
green-carpeted floor.
</P>
<P>
   His disciples consider him the spiritual successor of Mevlana
Celalettin Rumi, the Afghan-born Sufi mystic who founded the
dervish order late in the 11th century after Christ, preaching love
and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A rhythmic ``Allah! Allah!'' comes from the lips of his
followers as they shake their heads from side to side in the throes
of an ecstatic trance. A few rise to don flowing robes and conical
hats.
</P>
<P>
   To the haunting sound of the ney, a Turkish flute, the dervishes
slowly and gracefully begin to whirl.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing odd about the scene, repeated for centuries in
tekkes across Turkey. But closer scrutiny reveals that _ unusually
_ these spinning figures include females, banned from taking part
in the rituals since a 17th-century ruling by orthodox elders of
the order.
</P>
<P>
   And the women are not swathed in traditional white but in bright
pinks, oranges and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Just as incongruously, a giant portrait of Ataturk, the ardently
secular founder of modern Turkey, gazes down benignly at the flock,
alongside likenesses of the white-bearded Mevlana and the Shia
prophet Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first actions taken by Ataturk, after he came to
power in 1923, was to ban the shadowy Islamic brotherhoods,
including the mild Mevlevis, the name for followers of Mevlana.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Didem Edman, a vivacious young architect who became the
country's first female semazen, as whirling dervishes are called,
sees nothing odd about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ataturk,'' she says, ``is as holy to us as Allah, Muhammad,
Ali and our own exalted Mevlana. Ataturk saw men and women as
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such behavior has set off a furor among more
conservative dervishes, who accuse the Contemporary Lovers of the
Mevlana, as the new group is known, and its guru, Hasan Cikar, of
apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women whirling together? No!'' thunders Nail Kesova, a
leader of a rival, strictly male, assembly of whirlers known as the
Galata, after another district of Istanbul on the other side of the
Bosporus. ``It should not be!''
</P>
<P>
   So have the tarikats, the Sufi brotherhoods that still thrive
despite Ataturk's ban, become the new battleground where Turkey's
pro-secular generals will have to take on the religious
conservatives?
</P>
<P>
   By embracing Ataturk, Cikar's dervishes so far are on the right
side of the soldiers, who have again begun to crack down on Islamic
groups, tarikats included.
</P>
<P>
   But the row between the dervishes may also be about something a
lot less spiritual or doctrinal: money.
</P>
<P>
   The funky, mixed-sex dervishes are already pulling in many more
tourists and cash than their stern, all-male rivals at the Galata.
</P>
<P>
   Cikar loftily brushes aside such explanations with one of his
master's sayings: ``From God we receive. To man we give. We keep
nothing to ourselves.'' &QL;

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ When Thabo Mbeki bumped into Robert Mugabe during
coffee breaks at the G-77 summit of developing countries in Havana
this week, the air must have turned frosty.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of South Africa and Zimbabwe are not on good
terms. Mbeki is the widely respected, fairly elected leader of
Africa's richest and most powerful nation. Mugabe is, in the words
of Desmond Tutu, a former archbishop of Cape Town, ``almost a
caricature of all the things people think black African leaders
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mugabe proceeds to wreck the Zimbabwean economy by printing
money, pursuing a senseless war in Congo and encouraging mobs to
seize commercial farms, the repercussions are felt throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Watching demonstrators in Harare pummelled by club-wielding
thugs, foreign fund managers often see not chaos in Zimbabwe, but
chaos in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Mugabe defy his own laws and scorn the property rights
of Zimbabwean citizens, potential investors keep their wallets
shut.
</P>
<P>
   Southern African stock markets, currencies and trade all begin
to wobble as Mugabe pursues his stubborn way.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the only country with the muscle to make Mugabe
behave. The government insists that its diplomats are working
tirelessly and noiselessly to urge sanity on Comrade Bob.
</P>
<P>
   A discreet approach, it argues, is less likely to provoke its
volatile neighbor than the loud insults emanating from Britain.
European countries, by cutting off aid to Zimbabwe, risk sparking
an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Given Zimbabwe's record of not paying its electricity bills,
South Africa would be justified in switching off the supply. But it
does not, for fear of losing 8 billion rand ($1.3 billion) in
annual cross-border trade and gaining a flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   If keeping Zimbabwe afloat means subsidizing a despot, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is satisfied with this softly-softly approach.
Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, complained this
week that quiet diplomacy had yet to yield visible results.
</P>
<P>
   He called for South Africa to mediate between the Zimbabwean
government and opposition, which, he said, are not talking to one
another. He also wants South Africa to use its influence to make
sure that the election, now promised for May (but which could be
postponed), actually takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wakeford, head of the South African Chamber of Business,
has urged Mbeki publicly to distance himself from what is going on
in Zimbabwe. But one reason why Mbeki may be afraid to chide Mugabe
is that the Zimbabwean invasions of white-owned land are evoking
sympathy among black South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Several parliamentarians have pledged their support to the
Zimbabwean squatters. Worse, a recent survey suggested that a slim
majority of South Africans, especially poor ones, believe that the
``war veterans'' were right to seize the whites' land.
</P>
<P>
   A recent opinion poll of 1,900 Zimbabweans found that only 30
percent of them wanted all the white farms to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Revealingly, almost three-quarters of the people asked blamed
the government, rather than white farmers, for the fact that land
reform had still not been accomplished 20 years after independence.
Many realize by now that much of the land acquired for distribution
among the poor has gone to Mugabe's prosperous friends.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government is acutely aware of the hunger for
land among its own rural blacks. The first law passed by the
African National Congress in 1994 was to allow families who had
been evicted during the apartheid years to reclaim their ancestral
property.
</P>
<P>
   The law is well-meaning. Current owners are to be compensated at
market prices. If they do not wish to sell, or if claimants prefer,
evicted families can receive cash compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling-block to land reform in Zimbabwe is both
corruption and inefficiency; in South Africa, it is inefficiency
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63,400 claims lodged with South Africa's land commission,
only 4,000 have been settled, benefiting 13,500 households. Most
claimants may well die before hearing a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   To speed things up, South Africa's land minister, Thoko Didiza,
is making the process less legalistic. Giving people the exact
piece of land from which their parents were evicted is difficult.
There is often no written proof of who owned what, or who is
related to the original owner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to untangle this mess, Didiza is starting
simply to buy land and give it to relatively poor people who
demonstrate that they can make use of it. Some 55,000 households
have benefited from this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   An even better idea _ distributing idle state land (of which
there is a lot) among the landless _ has barely taken off.
</P>
<P>
   The government's priority is to create a class of black
commercial farmers: those who already have money qualify for bigger
handouts. However, if South Africa wants to avoid Zimbabwe's
crisis, it may have to concentrate on helping the truly destitute. &QL;

<P>
   Not so long ago, BP Amoco was being feted by ``ethical
investment'' funds and environmental groups. In spite of being one
of the world's biggest purveyors of fossil fuels, the firm has made
some surprisingly green investments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BP now controls Solarex, the world's biggest
solar-energy company. And it has voluntarily decided to curb
emissions of greenhouse gases, and is building an internal
carbon-trading scheme.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising, then, that the firm should now be under attack
from activist groups on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a curious coalition ranging from the American
Anti-Slavery Group and the International Campaign for Tibet to
Friends of the Earth is threatening a boycott of BP's gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a group led by Greenpeace barracked BP's annual
general meeting on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks are a bit unfair. The wrath of the American
groups, for example, is really directed at China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), which they believe is involved in human-rights
atrocities and environmental misdeeds everywhere from Tibet to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   This group mobilized opposition to last week's flotation of
PetroChina, a division of CNPC, and nearly sank it. BP attracted
their ire when, in a friendly gesture to Beijing, it bought a big
tranche at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace usually throws tomatoes from the outside at annual
meetings of oil firms. This time, it won the support of Trillium
Asset Management, an American firm specializing in socially
responsible investment, which has become a big shareholder in BP.
</P>
<P>
   Trillium put forward a resolution at the AGM that BP's resources
should be redirected from Alaska to its solar-energy venture. Even
its sponsors acknowledged that the measure was never likely to
pass, but was designed to win publicity for the plight of cuddly
polar bears.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was meant to highlight how vulnerable the Arctic is
to global warming generally, and not just to BP's Alaskan projects,
which are not demonstrably dirtier than others.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that BP's green credentials have faded? In
truth, no: the solar-energy company flourishes, and the firm's
commitment to carbon reduction still wins praise in many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew it wasn't going to be easy to plough a straight
furrow, but we will continue to try,'' says one company official.
As these incidents show, it is not easy being green _ especially if
you are an oil giant. &QL;

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Sometimes, obstacles create opportunities. So it
has been in South Africa's information technology (IT) business.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate South Africa hungers for new technology. Combined with
other cumbersome labor laws, ``affirmative action'' prompts
companies to replace people with machines wherever practical.
</P>
<P>
   A bank that fails to hire or promote a black cashier may be
subject to a racial-discrimination lawsuit. An automatic teller, by
contrast, works 24 hours a day and never sues.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Nedcor, the South African bank with the most
admired IT systems, has shaved 25 percent off its operating costs
over the past three years through automation.
</P>
<P>
   Stannic, the vehicle-finance arm of Standard Bank, recently
closed all 46 of its offices, laid off more than 900 people and
moved its operations to call centers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Banking is not the only business using IT to replace people.
J.D. Group, a retailer of sofas, washing machines and other chunky
consumer durables, has so many branches in remote places with poor
telecommunications that it rented part of a satellite to let its
computers talk to each other uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of J.D.'s skilled white managers have emigrated; the firm
has replaced them largely with software.
</P>
<P>
   Tasks such as controlling stocks and making sure that indebted
customers do not fall behind on payments are now largely automated.
The number of employees has been cut from 13,000 in 1993 to 9,500
today.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just companies that yearn for IT. South Africa has
many more mobile telephones and computers than the rest of the
continent (indeed, there are three times as many mobile-phone
subscribers in South Africa as in the rest of Africa put together),
and that creates opportunities for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Firms are already drooling at the prospect of wireless
application protocol (WAP) technology, which will allow people to
gain access to the Internet via their mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Old Mutual, an insurer, recently started to allow customers to
buy and sell unit trusts over the Internet, using WAP.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Brozin, head of Nando's, a fast-food chain, believes that
WAP will reassure potential customers who fear to disclose their
credit-card numbers online. Since users already have a mobile-phone
account, he hopes to sell home-delivered chillied chicken burgers
via mobiles, and simply add the price to the monthly telephone
bill.
</P>
<P>
   IT also provides a flexible career path for young whites.
Unwelcome in the public service, they are more likely than blacks
to seek marketable skills, such as accountancy or computing.
</P>
<P>
   Young programmers can easily find work in South Africa. Or they
can emigrate. Or they can enjoy the best of both worlds by
telecommuting to California, earning dollars but paying rent in
rand.
</P>
<P>
   The IT firms that provide the know-how for all this are among
the most popular companies on Johannesburg's stock exchange.
Dimension Data (Didata), the country's largest IT firm, is valued
at 50.8 billion rand ($7.7 billion); Datatec, the fastest-growing
over the past five years, has vaulted from 40 million rand in 1994
to 12.6 billion rand today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the escalating demand in South Africa, the industry
suffers from several of the handicaps that plague so many of the
country's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Didata and Datatec now do most of their
business overseas. Datatec does not plan to list abroad, but two of
its subsidiaries will probably soon list on Nasdaq and in London.
</P>
<P>
   Didata hopes to move its primary listing to London later this
year, because it is easier to raise money there, and because its
employees in Asia and Europe do not want their share options
denominated in rand.
</P>
<P>
   Also, South African IT professionals often emigrate. Jeremy Ord,
chairman of Didata, argues that it is easier to retain staff if he
can offer them jobs in London or Singapore. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   More serious is the effect of Telkom, the state telephone
monopoly. In theory, the Internet ought to allow South African IT
companies to overcome the drawback of being far from big markets.
In practice, bandwidth is roughly 30 times as expensive in South
Africa as it is in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Telkom, not one of our South African clients is
globally competitive,'' complains Ord.
</P>
<P>
   The monopoly is due to end in 2002 or 2003, but real
deregulation may come slowly. The government is reluctant to lose
control of Telkom, partly because it is a useful way of delivering
contracts to black business. &QL;

<P>
   Helping the cluster of small IT firms to grow will be difficult.
South Africa has yet to see an Internet start-up boom like that in
America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Johannesburg's venture capitalists are fewer and less
venturesome than those in California. The most prolific backers of
small IT firms have generally been large IT firms such as Didata
and Datatec.
</P>
<P>
   There are still relatively few 20-something millionaires, such
as Mark Shuttleworth, a Capetonian whose Internet security software
firm, Thawte, is valued at 3.5 billion rand, or Nicolaas Vlok,
whose software firm, Idion, is valued at 1.3 billion rand.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttleworth sold his company to an American rival; he would
probably have raised far less by listing in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no vibrant growth of IT companies run or
staffed by blacks. Most of South Africa's successful IT firms are
as white as traditional cricketing trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of education under apartheid, few black South Africans
yet have computing skills. Those blacks who make it to university
tend to study literature or social sciences, often with the aim of
entering government. &QL;

</P>

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Most black-run IT firms survive by doing business with the
government or with state-owned firms, which give preference to
black tenders. Some of them were formerly white-owned, bought by
``black empowerment'' holding companies in order to leverage black
ownership into government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Empowerment Trust (CET), a firm that has close links with
the ruling African National Congress, has one subsidiary that
supplies cables to Telkom, and another that is bidding for a
government contract to introduce electronic payment systems for
minibus taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Nissen, the chairman, argues that South Africa needs a
black-run IT firm to rival Didata and Datatec. But he complains
that white IT bosses are reluctant to surrender control of their
companies. Odd, that. &QL;

<P>
   MIDLAND, TEXAS _ In the spring of 1948, George Bush stood on an
airport runway in west Texas awaiting the arrival of his wife and
two-year-old son, who is now running for president.
</P>
<P>
   He had arrived in the area two weeks ahead of his family, to
begin a career as an oilman in a booming region with seemingly
endless opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, Vincent Matthews looks out of the window
of his office in Midland and ponders a bleaker future: ``These
days, what is going to bring a George Bush to this barren place?''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Center for Energy and Economic Diversification,
Matthews has the job of helping to build a less oily future for
west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of Texas basks in high-tech euphoria, but oil
production in the Permian basin has declined for the past 25 years
and little new industry has moved in to take its place.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of ``the oil patch'' depend on the countries around
the Persian Gulf, thousands of miles away, whose decisions set the
price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midland needs to change,'' says Matthews, ``but Midland
doesn't like to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are pretty bleak. Oil output in Texas reached its
peak in 1973, when 656 million barrels were produced. Since then
production has declined each year: it was only 312 million barrels
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The big oil firms have scaled back their operations, putting
their money into cheaper drilling sites elsewhere. Their place has
been taken by smaller producers operating ``stripper'' wells, which
now account for 83 percent of the wells in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These produce less than ten barrels a day, are expensive to
operate, and are the first to be closed when oil is cheap. About
135,000 of America's stripper wells were stopped in 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the fact that, when the price of
oil rises, the industry tends to forget its problems. For a time
earlier this year there was once again talk of the worst being
over.
</P>
<P>
   When the price of West Texas Intermediate rose to $32 a barrel
in early March, it became profitable for independent producers to
reopen wells they had shut in the days of $10 oil. In March, there
were 286 rigs drilling for oil in Texas, up from the 1999 average
of 227.
</P>
<P>
   Even the current price of $24 or so offers some comfort. In some
ways, a volatile price is as bad as a low one, particularly for
small independent producers. As one of them puts it, ``How can I
plan a major project when I have no idea where the price of oil
will be a year from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Companies now have great trouble trying to persuade Wall Street
to reinvest in the business of finding and extracting domestic oil.
Capital investment in this field shrank by more than a fifth last
year, and is not expected to increase dramatically in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The big companies' exploration budgets are all down. That hits
the drilling-equipment and servicing firms that make up such a
large part of the west Texas economy.
</P>
<P>
   The recent meeting of the OPEC countries has raised hopes that
oil will stay above $20 a barrel at least for the rest of this
year. Nevertheless, many producers in west Texas feel powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment is reinforced by the fact that labor, as well
as capital, is now in short supply. Thousands of families left the
region during the oil bust of the late 1990s in search of more
stable jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimates that
the number of employees in the industry fell from 350,000 in 1997
to 284,000 in 1999. So far this year, the higher price has added
only 7,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If its oil-dependent economy is so troubled even when the price
is up, what can west Texas do?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution is a more diversified economy. But it is
far from clear that the oil patch can attract much in the way of
new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a technology company locate in Midland instead of
Austin?'' asks Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many people were equally skeptical about Austin and
Houston 15 years ago. During the oil and property bust of the
1980s, both cities had a bad time until the high-tech renaissance
came their way.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that west Texas cities such as Midland and
Odessa, unlike Austin and Houston, do not have a large pool of
well-educated workers suitable for new-economy jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They lack both large universities and a serious white-collar
industry. And today's ambitious youngsters find little appeal in
the region's flat, desolate landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the big oil companies could attract lots of
young Ivy Leaguers by offering them a good living and a safe place
to raise their families. That is how East-Coast ways came to the
oil patch; Midland even found itself with a polo club.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little to pull anyone into the region now that the
big boys have gone. Bush the Elder once made a stunning fortune
here. By the time his son launched his oil career in the 1970s, the
prospects had dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Having found only a succession of dry holes, George W. Bush gave
up, and decided to make money in baseball. And that was the
beginning of another story. &QL;

<P>
   Might the Cold War's first frontier in Asia, and now all but its
last redoubt anywhere, be about to fall?
</P>
<P>
   If their summit goes ahead as planned, in June the leaders of
divided Korea will meet face-to-face for the first time ever, 50
years to the month after the Korean War began.
</P>
<P>
   As the Berlin Wall was to Europe, so the demilitarized zone
between the Koreas _ actually, the world's most heavily fortified
border _ still is to Asia: a symbol of conflict barely suppressed,
and of the divide between freedom and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a dangerous anachronism. An anachronism because
everywhere but North Korea (and Cuba), Marx has been shouted down
by the market.
</P>
<P>
   And dangerous because North Korea is armed to the teeth,
bellicose and tottering. Just a few months ago, it was threatening
to rain destruction on the neighborhood. Tomorrow, it could just as
easily collapse in violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, America, Japan, even China, virtually the only
friend North Korea has left, have been telling it to take its
finger off the trigger, reduce tensions with South Korea and start
trading goods, not threats.
</P>
<P>
   Even if nothing more comes out of it than an agreement to keep
the dialogue going, the June summit will be a start. Yet, when the
estranged leaders of the Koreas do meet, their talks are likely to
be fraught with difficulty, since all they know of each other is
seen down the barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is the first difficulty: without a reduction in
military tensions on the peninsula, another crisis could be just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to exaggerate the gulf between the Koreas.
South Korea's is a feisty economy that has survived East Asia's
financial troubles; its equally lively democrats were this week
slugging it out in parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, last holdout of Stalinism, is slowly emerging from
a mostly man-made famine that has killed hundreds of thousands of
people. Its politics is communist-cum-feudal.
</P>
<P>
   The place needs a radical economic shake-up to survive, but
reform could equally spell doom for its decrepit regime. So far it
has resisted even the limited contacts that would come from
allowing long-divided families to write or meet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if North Korea wants a new start in relations with the
South, this is as safe a time as any for it to crawl out of its
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Although the South still officially dreams of reunification, the
scale of North Korea's problems makes the dream seem like a
nightmare. Rather than nudge the North to collapse, South Korea is
offering huge dollops of investment to prop it up.
</P>
<P>
   Others are equally keen to see North Korea totter on. America
has 37,000 troops in the Korean firing line.
</P>
<P>
   China has no wish to watch the North collapse into the arms of
the capitalist South. And Japan knows that when reunification
eventually comes, it will be asked to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Is North Korea seriously looking for a way out of its mess?
South Korea is dangling plenty of generous carrots _ aid, trade and
expensive infrastructure projects _ that the North badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   But, before handing anything over, the South's president, Kim
Dae Jung, would be wise to insist that any such good turn by his
country gets another from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, South Korea has proffered food, fertilizer and the
like to coax the North into a little bit more contact, only to see
the North pocket as many goodies as it can, while conceding nothing
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bad behavior has often brought North Korea the best
rewards, as outsiders, including America, have sought to buy off
what they fear might be worse behavior to come. As a result, the
Koreas have staggered from crisis to crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What South Korea is now offering is hugely more generous. But,
while working to get concessions that will ease the harshness of
the divide, it also needs to press North Korea to do things to
break this dangerous cycle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the needed changes is for North Korea to uphold the 1994
agreement, negotiated by America, that freezes the North's
production of plutonium, from which nuclear bombs can be made, and
offers in return two western-designed, less proliferation-prone
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring
the freeze, North Korea has done nothing to enable it to
investigate past plutonium-dabbling, though it must do so
eventually, if the deal is not to collapse. And the North still
refuses to let the agency check its other nuclear sites, although
its safeguards agreement stipulates that it should.
</P>
<P>
   A second matter for discussion is North Korea's military
ambitions. Another nuclear crisis on the peninsula, prompted
perhaps by another test-firing of North Korea's increasingly
long-range rockets, would quickly destroy all hopes of narrowing
the North-South divide.
</P>
<P>
   The summit agenda, however, should not neglect more mundane
military matters. South Korea's capital, Seoul, is within easy
range of the thousands of artillery pieces and hundreds of
thousands of soldiers dug in on the North Korean side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting either side to disarm. But the North has
balked even at exchanging military information and observers.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-War borders are dangerous places. The one between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact bristled with weapons too. Yet timely arms-control
and confidence-building agreements helped make its eventual
dismantling an entirely peaceful affair.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of several troubling issues for the southern Mr. Kim to
think about during his journey north. &QL;

<P>
   Fannie and Freddie sound like a sweet couple living down the
street. But in America they are more likely to own the mortgage on
your and your neighbors' house.
</P>
<P>
   For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two of America's biggest
financial institutions _ and also two of its most indebted, with
around $1 trillion of debt between them.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae is the Federal National Mortgage Association, Freddie
Mac the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. They dominate
America's mortgage market, a preeminence that is becoming
controversial because these ``federal agencies'' are assumed
(despite official denials) to be guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie stand accused of using their ``government
guarantees'' to steal business from unambiguously private lenders.
One think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, says they are on
course to ``nationalize'' the mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressmen now wish to change the law to tame these
monsters before they stick the taxpayer with a bill reminiscent of
the savings-and-loan bust in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea behind Fannie and Freddie was innocuous
enough. It was to provide liquidity to mortgage lenders, and so
help people to buy homes, at a time when private markets could not
stump up enough money.
</P>
<P>
   But today the financial markets are more than able to deliver.
What the federal mortgage agencies do now is to distort the private
market. This is a perfect example of what people mean when they
talk of moral hazard caused by government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   As state enterprises go, the two agencies are mongrels rather
than thoroughbreds. Starting life as pure government bodies, Fannie
and Freddie have since been allowed to sell shares. They are now
among the most profitable companies quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``quasi-public'' status has only aggravated the moral
hazard, for they now combine the incentives (and pay) of the
private sector with the protection of the public sector, and impose
none of the constraints associated with either.
</P>
<P>
   If the modern version of the American Dream is to privatize
gains and socialize risks, then Fannie and Freddie are certainly
living it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: exempt from state and local taxes, they also have less
onerous capital-adequacy requirements than private rivals. And Wall
Street is urging them into more profitable, but riskier,
activities.
</P>
<P>
   What public enterprise can match Franklin Raines, boss of Fannie
Mae, who is paid $14 million a year, with share options on top? Or
provide the American president with such generous patronage (he
appoints five members of their boards)? Or allow such huge scope
for making political donations to congressmen from both parties?
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie have exploited fully the edge they get from
the belief that they are government-guaranteed. Borrowing at almost
the same rates as the Treasury, they earn a fortune by investing
the money in higher-yielding mortgages and mortgage-backed
securities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, they have increased their borrowing and
lending spectacularly. Without the ``guarantee,'' the risks of
mortgages would surely have raised borrowing costs, and reduced
their lending.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts that the financial markets believe that the
government stands behind the federal mortgage agencies were
dispelled recently when a senior official told Congress that the
government did not guarantee their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads between Treasuries and Fannies and Freddies immediately
widened. Only soothing noises from the Treasury (but not a
retraction) calmed the markets down.
</P>
<P>
   Credit creation by the federal mortgage agencies has been
accused of inflating a credit bubble. To meet their ambitious
profit-growth targets, Fannie and Freddie will need to undertake
ever riskier lending, and to retain ownership of a growing
proportion of mortgages. They will find it ever harder to hedge
away their risks.
</P>
<P>
   So any downturn in the housing market could easily cause one or
both of them to stumble, with knock-on effects throughout the
economy. Any bill would almost certainly go to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative, although Fannie and Freddie's pervasive
political connections will doubtless seek to stop it: to privatize
them fully. Then they could borrow only at interest rates that
reflect their true riskiness, forcing them to cut lending.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie and Freddie may sound like kindly old codgers. But they
are more like spoiled rich kids, at risk of getting out of control.
Congress should force them to leave home before they do serious
damage to themselves and the economy. &QL;

<P>
   For all the imperfections of Latin American democracy, much
progress has been made in the past two decades in the conduct of
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, these are normally fraud-free in voting and
vote-counting. And, despite concerns about unequal financing, they
are, in broad terms, fair.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those claims holds true for last Sunday's
presidential election in Peru. In its lack of fairness and
openness, it marked a big step backwards for the region, comparable
only to the chaotic contest in the Dominican Republic in 1994 and
the notorious presidential election in Mexico in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began with the determination of President Alberto
Fujimori to seek a third consecutive term, which all but his own
acolytes rightly held to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was a charade. Fujimori's people abused the
resources of the state, offering food and land to voters. The main
television channels ignored the opposition candidates, and refused
to accept their paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in Alejandro Toledo, an economist of Andean Indian
descent, a popular opponent to Fujimori emerged. Sample counts by
reputable observers and polling companies showed Fujimori ahead,
but with less than the absolute majority required for outright
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a run-off against Toledo seems to have rattled
Fujimori. Not only did observers report fraud at some polling
stations, but the official vote count was a travesty.
</P>
<P>
   Partial results showing Fujimori within a hair's breadth of
victory were announced, even as the computer centers supposedly
counting them were closed for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo's supporters took to the streets, foreign governments,
led by the United States, warned Fujimori that unless a second
round were held, Peru could face international ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to do the trick: after much delay, on April 12 the
authorities eventually said that Fujimori had fallen just short of
outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori enjoys some genuine popular support, and for
understandable reasons: he has brought peace, stability and growth
to his country. But he has also built an autocracy, reliant on a
sinister intelligence boss and a handful of favored military
chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   His regime is cleverly based on the appearance of the rule of
law and utterly devoid of the independent institutions that make
such rule a reality to be relied upon. That has now become his
greatest liability.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a truly independent election authority means that,
even if Fujimori had in fact won the election, nobody could believe
him _ not a propitious way to start a new term.
</P>
<P>
   Instability, disorder and violence would be real threats if
Peru's next government were to lack legitimacy. Outsiders were
therefore right to insist on a second vote. But it must be held
under fairer conditions than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates should have equal access to the media. More
international observers will be needed, to cover polling stations
in remote, army-controlled areas, and with the power to watch over
the electoral authority's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the United States has been reluctant to push Fujimori
hard. He has been a reliable ally against drug-trafficking, his
country a bulwark of apparent stability in the troubled Andean
region. And he has lacked a credible opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments no longer apply. Resolute outside pressure could
yet ensure that some good comes from Peru's election.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, an inveterate talker with occasionally populist
tendencies, is not beyond criticism. But the surge of popular
support for his candidacy shows a powerful democratic impulse in
the Peruvian people.
</P>
<P>
   And there is another lesson for Latin America: in a region of
strong presidencies and otherwise weak institutions, it is folly
for an incumbent to seek a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori might have been stepping down this year to some acclaim
in the history books. Instead, his reckless pursuit of permanent
power risks undermining many of his achievements. &QL;

<P>
   ``Nuke the whales'' was a popular slogan among the
politically-incorrect in the 1980s. That is going a bit far. But
the issue of whether and how to protect ``charismatic megafauna''
(whales, elephants, tigers and so on) raises strong passions.
</P>
<P>
   These passions are now on view in Nairobi, at a meeting of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
that ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question is whether exploiting wild animals
destroys them or helps to preserve them. Most wildlife-conservation
problems are about habitat destruction. Preserve the habitat and
you preserve the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But a few creatures are in danger from people independently of
their habitat. Whales supply large amounts of meat. Tigers have
body parts that the ignorant believe will enhance sexual potency.
And elephants, the animals generating most heat in Nairobi, yield
ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists no longer throw up their hands in horror at the
very idea of wildlife being exploited (for anything other than
tourism, which was always alright).
</P>
<P>
   Now even drawing-room greens accept that conserving wildlife
requires that the people living nearby have a stake in its
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes the argument over elephants so ironic. It is
not between western do-gooders and hungry Third-Worlders; it is
between two groups of Third-World countries that see each other's
plans as inimical to their financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Those countries that wish to reopen the ivory trade _ Botswana,
Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe _ claim to have elephants coming
out of their ears. They are culling them in order to match numbers
to available habitat, so why not turn a profit on the tusks?
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, however, elephants are rarer. The Kenyans fear that
restarting the trade is too risky. Until 1989, limited trading in
ivory was permitted. Then it was banned entirely. Surprisingly, the
price of ivory responded by dropping, rather than rising, and
poaching fell off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the southern African states were allowed a one-off sale
to Japan of ivory stockpiled from culls. This seems (although the
evidence is disputed) to have stimulated poaching again; illegal
ivory was traded under cover of the legal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's elephant population fell from 40,000 in 1970 to 5,000 in
1988, and only began to rise when the trading ban was enforced.
Another big bout of poaching now could wipe it out.
</P>
<P>
   That is the nub of the Kenyan objection to resuming the ivory
trade. But it seems harsh to punish those who have done well for
their elephants by supporting those who, for whatever reason, have
let their populations shrink.
</P>
<P>
   There may, however, be a way out. Poachers are interested only
in ivory, which is valuable and easy to carry off. So trade in
other products, notably leather, could be permitted at once.
</P>
<P>
   Second, better monitoring of where elephant products come from,
and of the extent of poaching, is required.
</P>
<P>
   The existing CITES system, known as MIKE (Monitoring of the
Illegal Killing of Elephants) is widely seen as a laughingstock,
because it is underfinanced and not all countries give it
full-hearted support.
</P>
<P>
   A recent infusion of European Union money should change that,
but better management is also required. This should be assisted by
DNA tests to allow a tusk to be traced to a particular place. And
Japan, the main market for ivory, must be leaned on to enforce its
ivory-trading laws.
</P>
<P>
   Better monitoring should reduce poaching and smuggling to
acceptable levels, allowing legal trade to proceed without
stimulating the illegal sort. The carrot of legalized trading
should encourage all countries to give full backing to MIKE.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea would be for rich countries to club together to buy
part of the surplus southern African ivory before the trade ban is
lifted. That would give the poor countries some cash; and the rich
ones would get their money back when trading resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the trade would then be seen to be in
everybody's interests _ including the elephants'. &QL;

GREAT NEWS FROM THE IMF. BUT COMPLACENCY CAN BE DANGEROUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aptly enough, 2000 looks set to be a wonderful year for the
world economy. That, at any rate, is what the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts in its new global economic forecasts,
published this week.
</P>
<P>
   America is still booming, and the Fund expects it to sustain for
a while yet its recent miraculous performance. Europe, with lots of
ground to make up, has begun to surge as well.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, for those who see diminishing poverty as the chief
blessing of economic growth, the recovery in emerging economies
that were battered by the financial gales of 1997 and 1998 now
looks firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   In East Asia, especially, things are going better than almost
anybody expected even six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lately it has begun to seem that the emerging-markets crash of
the late 1990s _ which once appeared to endanger the global economy
_ will soon be regarded as a mere blip in the ongoing ``Asian
miracle.'' Even Japan's grossly mismanaged economy is beginning to
hobble forward.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it is a marvelous prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Maybe: there is nothing plain wrong in these
predictions. But at times like these, forecasts of this kind (no
fault of the Fund) are especially prone to mislead. Taken at face
value, they give no sense of the risks attached to the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The risks this time are big and getting bigger. And the
continuing flow of good news makes it less and less likely that
governments will take the steps that they otherwise might feel
obliged to in order to ward off the danger.
</P>
<P>
   This is no doubt a pity, but it was ever thus, and it explains a
fairly reliable law of economics: the bigger the boom, the crueller
the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economic center of gravity, from which much of this
good news flows, is, needless to say, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last October, the IMF's economists predicted that
America would grow by 2.6 percent in 2000. That would have been an
impressive performance by any standards _ this is the ninth year of
America's current economic expansion, remember _ especially when
combined, as the Fund said it would be, with an unemployment rate
pressed down to an extraordinary low of 4 percent, and an inflation
rate of just 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Fund now expects America to grow by a stunning 4.4
percent this year, and with inflation no higher than in its earlier
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   That revision transforms the global outlook, not just because
the United States accounts by itself for about a quarter of global
GDP, but also because galloping demand in America will keep
exerting a strong pull on economic activity in other regions, where
it continues to be needed.
</P>
<P>
   This only goes to show that, taking a longer-term view than the
Fund does in its forecasts, no question matters as much in judging
the prospects both for the United States and for the rest of the
world as whether the new-paradigmists are right about what is
happening in America.
</P>
<P>
   If they are, and America's sustainable long-term rate of growth
has increased by a full percentage point or more, the outlook for
everybody is doubly fine.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when reality dawns on Wall Street, as it will, and
investors understand that not even a fabulous ``new economy'' can
plausibly justify the recent frenzy of speculation, the letdown may
be comparatively gentle.
</P>
<P>
   The financial shock to the United States and the rest of the
world would be fairly mild.
</P>
<P>
   The second benefit is bigger: America's productivity revolution,
if that is what it is, should be exportable around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, the United States has markets for labor and capital, an
approach to government and all manner of other customs and economic
institutions that are peculiarly well-adapted to embracing radical
economic change.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new economy,'' such as it is, will diffuse with time
around those parts of the world that are willing to accept it, just
as earlier waves of technology-driven progress have done.
</P>
<P>
   If the new-paradigmists have got it wrong, however, the danger
is clear. The dawning of reality on Wall Street might then be
brutal.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between expected and actual earnings might be so large
as to cause a collapse in share prices, with severe turbulence
following across all the world's financial markets; and America's
external deficit, which grows apace despite surging productivity,
may prove hard to finance without a sharp fall in the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the prospect of a global supply-side miracle
would have been snatched away.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment it is wise, as most economic historians will tell
you, to remain somewhat agnostic about the new economy: the
evidence to settle the question will not be in for a good while
yet.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to be an economic historian to know that it
is also wise, while hoping for the best, to plan for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The new mood of optimism about the world's economic prospects
may prove self-defeating _ even on the assumption that the
new-paradigmists' claims are true _ if it means that steps to make
international financial markets safer, or to make Europe's
economies fiscally robust and more receptive to change, or to
strengthen corporate, financial and political governance in
emerging economies, are not taken. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   These things need to happen anyway. Good news creates an
especially favorable opportunity to respond to such challenges.
Unfortunately, it also subdues the will.
</P>
<P>
   The recent record of economic reform in the places that need it
most is decidedly mixed. There has been plenty of talk about new
financial ``architecture'' _ and there will be plenty more,
protesters permitting, when finance ministers meet in Washington
this weekend _ but there has been little action.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's appetite for fiscal reform, which is urgently needed in
view of demographic trends, has diminished since the advent of the
euro, and may disappear altogether as the cyclical upswing flatters
the public accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the developing world, industrial and financial reform has
sometimes been impressive by earlier standards, yet remains sadly
inadequate in relation to what is actually required.
</P>
<P>
   Were governments not so susceptible to complacency, the rosy
outlook for 2000 would be much easier to enjoy. &QL;

WHY AREN'T U.S. TAXPAYERS WHINING?: IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is spring and tax-filing time. Fruit-tree blossoms flutter on
to the freshly-cut grass. Completed IRS 1040 forms lie sprinkled on
the floor. Taxpayers whistle blithely while they fill in the still
uncompleted ones.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not. The American tax code remains as horribly
complicated as ever. But in a country built on a tax revolt it is
remarkable that, as the April 17 tax-filing deadline approaches,
the United States is gripped by a surge of contentment over tax.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes's attempt to become president on the promise of a
flat tax went nowhere. Republican congressmen, even those who
believe that government is a sin, are proposing smaller tax cuts
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, to be sure, wants a big tax cut; but this seems
to worry rather than excite voters. In poll after poll, tax cuts
come way down on the list of voters' concerns, somewhere above the
cost of Pokemon cards. Which is, at least when you first look at
it, rather odd.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans never tire of pointing out, the federal tax
burden now is higher _ over 20 percent of national income _ than it
was 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan came to office, promising to
slash federal taxes after the success of California's tax-cutting
Proposition 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Internal Revenue Service collected $1.7 trillion.
This sum was larger than Britain's entire gross domestic product
and enough to ensure that America had a budget surplus for the
third year running.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth isn't there a clamor to cut taxes? The popular
response is: it's the economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are doing so well these days that they don't need a
big tax cut. Inflation and unemployment are low; incomes are
rising.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan came to office, it was a different story: inflation
was 13 percent; unemployment was 7 percent; output was stagnant.
Tax cuts were then seen as a way to stimulate the economy. That
hardly seems necessary now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 325) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly something in this, and it means that, if
prosperity were all there was to it, you would expect demand for
tax cuts to rise again as soon as growth starts to falter. But that
may not be all there is to it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In three different ways, taxpayers' expectations may be changing
so as to mute the tax clamor, at least partly, even after the next
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   First, voters may have become more cynical about tax cuts. They
have listened to people saying ``read my lips, no new taxes'' and
have reasonably concluded that a politician promising big tax cuts
is either lying or cannot keep his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even if voters are just as gullible as ever, they are
now, on average, older, nearer retirement and more concerned about
the Social Security and Medicare programs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This concern helps to make sense of what is otherwise a puzzling
finding: that nearly everyone thinks taxes are too high, even
though no one seems unduly concerned about cutting them (70 percent
said taxes were too high in a recent Economist poll).
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is that voters do care about taxes, but are more
worried about the solvency of Social Security and the cost of the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   It is a triumph of the Clinton administration's ability to
associate ``tax cuts'' in people's minds with ``lower social
services'' and ``higher debt burden'' even at a time of budget
surpluses. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third, people may no longer judge the weight of their tax burden
on the scales of income alone. They also take into account total
wealth, including the huge capital gains they have made over the
past five years in the stock markets. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This may not actually make much sense. With a few exceptions
(notably inheritance duties), people's tax bills are based on their
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than half of all Americans now own shares, mostly
through pension plans, so it is inevitable that their stock market
gains make them feel wealthier, and their tax burden lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you measure taxes as a share not of income alone, but
of income plus the change in households' net worth, the tax burden
is falling. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All these are reasons for thinking that taxpayers may be
changing their minds about what counts as ``too much'' tax. It
certainly makes any tax revolt harder to foresee.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition to all this, a more fundamental change is
reconciling people to their apparently high tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Most people aren't paying these high overall taxes. Much of the
tax burden in super-capitalist, anti-egalitarian, winner-takes-all
America falls on, er, the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class and poor are paying less than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, America's super-rich _ the wealthiest 1
percent of taxpayers _ paid 19 percent of all federal taxes. Now
they pay a third. The share paid by the merely wealthy _ the top 5
percent _ has risen from just over a third to just over half during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the middle class and the poor are paying far less.
Those with so-called median incomes, the midpoint in the income
scale, or the middle of the middle class, now have their lowest
income-tax burden since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   And families at the bottom are doing even better. The Earned
Income Tax Credit _ a sort of reverse income tax for the working
poor _ means that those getting half the median income get paid
more in EITC credits than they pay out in income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the vast majority of taxpayers are not bothered by the
increasing tax burden: they are not bearing it.
</P>
<P>
   And the rich can afford to. Earnings at the top have shot up
over the past 20 years and, in the age of the longest-ever economic
expansion, when the gap between rich and poor has yawned ever
wider, few rich Americans are likely to start complaining
vociferously about their tax bill getting in the way of that new
kitchen in their (second) house in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the top marginal rate has come down from 70 percent in
1980 to 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the years of tax revolt seem to have achieved a
remarkable (and unintended) outcome: in the country thought of as
friendlier to the rich than almost any other, there has been a huge
swing in the tax burden away from the poor and towards the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Marx might have asked for a little more; a few European thinkers
will doubtless whimper about the need for a third way. But,
fiscally speaking at least, America seems to be making the rich
pay.
</P>
<P>
   And _ except possibly on tax-filing day _ almost everyone is
satisfied with this new state of affairs. &QL;

   CLEMSON AND LITCHFIELD BEACH, S.C. _ Stanley Schuman was on his
knees, gardening, when he accidentally invaded the space of a
fire-ant colony. It was a serious mistake. Weeks later, his legs
still sported blotchy red stings.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Dr. Schuman is one of the world's experts on
the ferocious creatures, and the havoc they wreak.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that each spring some part of America gets into an
undue panic about the arrival of fire ants tends to obscure two
harsher truths: they are spreading relentlessly; and they are
pretty nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Their venom, thought to be unique in the animal kingdom,
consists overwhelmingly of an unpleasant, pepper-like substance. By
the time you feel it, the fire ant may already have bitten you
three times.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the bee which dies for the cause when it stings you,
the fire ant can run off and bite you again tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants move collectively in a ``boiling'' pattern; a
seemingly insignificant disturbance near a fire-ant mound may
instantly set off a wave of coordinated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants can kill household pets, deer fawns and lambs.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the human population, including Dr. Schuman,
suffer only a sharp annoyance from a fire-ant attack. Around 15
percent get a swollen limb for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But one or two in every hundred, if stung badly enough, can
experience a constricted throat, shocks to the heart and even
death.
</P>
<P>
   The dead victim's skin shows no reaction. ``You can't even tell
in an autopsy. It's the perfect murder,'' Dr. Schuman cheerfully
explains.
</P>
<P>
   The invader is believed to have arrived in the United States
70-80 years ago via Mobile, Ala., probably in a ship's ballast.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Brazil and Argentina, the fire ant faced
well-established predators that kept its numbers in check. The
United States had no such defenses, and the fire ants spread like
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, fire-ant country covers all of southeastern United
States, from Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Inadvertent transport by humans has helped the ant to reach as
far away as California. Given time, the critter may eventually
colonize the Pacific Coast up to Canada and most of the Atlantic
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Like high-tech armaments, the ants are also getting steadily
more sophisticated. One emerging problem is hybridization between
the fire ant's red and black varieties, which has given the ant new
and apparently useful genetic adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse is the emergence of colonies that operate with more
than one queen. Multiple-queen colonies can produce far more than
the 350,000 eggs per year that colonies with one queen usually
churn out. Moreover, the presence of two or more queens seems to
help colonies recover from an attack by pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sending 30,000 people to hospital every year, fire ants
are hurting the economy. They damage the nursery and sod-growing
industry, which is worth $200 million a year in South Carolina
alone.
</P>
<P>
   They love electrical wiring; when they eat through wires, they
can put large appliances out of action.
</P>
<P>
   A study reckoned that, all in all, they cost South Carolinians
$80 per household last year. Texans have to fork out even more.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the fire ants is not easy. Edward Wilson of Harvard, who
knows more about this subject than almost anybody else, once called
the decades-long war against them ``the Vietnam of the insect
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular techniques such as feeding them grits, the hot breakfast
cereal popular in the South, have now been proved ineffective; fire
ants don't eat solid food. Using gasoline is both risky and
environmentally harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense, it seems, is to spread soybean oil baited with
a slow-acting pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news. Allergy tests and desensitization
regimes _ if ordered by doctors, which is a big if _ identify and
fortify the people most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   And the counterattackers have imported some clever tricks from
the ant's native habitat. One involves putting an ant-specific
disease into the ant-mounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a parasitic fly that lays its larvae inside the ant's
head. The larvae eat through the inside of the head until it falls
off, and the other ants remove the carcass. Fine, if grisly.
</P>
<P>
   But the fly method, tested twice with some success last year,
suffers from the problem of rearing enough flies. You need 3,000 to
make a serious assault. An entomologist, Clyde Gorsuch, says that
``we don't know where the flies rest, or where they come from, or
how long they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle continues. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Since it came into force in 1994, the North
American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has tranformed many aspects
of economic life in Mexico, and has helped the country achieve
several years of steady growth. Yet some Mexican habits remain
defiantly unreformed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boasts of ministers that they have created a
deregulated market economy, monopoly and official patronage still
count for much in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more starkly illustrated than in the current row
over competition in the telecoms industry.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after its privatization, that industry is still
dominated by Telmex, the former state-owned monopoly, whose
controlling shareholder is Carlos Slim, Latin America's richest
man.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex enjoyed a de facto monopoly (except in mobile phones)
until 1997, when the long-distance market was opened up. The first
local service customers were signed up by competitors only last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Telmex still has 75 percent of Mexico's long-distance
business, 95 percent of its fixed lines, and four-fifths of its
mobile-phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   One result of that stranglehold is that Mexico has fewer
telephone lines per person than other Latin American countries _
even Brazil, which privatized its telephones only in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government eventually set up a proper regulator for
the telecoms industry (known as Cofetel) in 1996, this body has
long been accused of being soft on Telmex. And at the slightest
hint of pressure, Telmex has won injunctions from the country's
supine courts to protect its privileged position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mexico's competition commission declared that Telmex
had ``market dominance,'' a finding that allowed Cofetel to impose
tougher rules on it than on its competitors. So far Cofetel has not
done so.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after talks broke down between Telmex and the other
companies on issues such as interconnection rates (what
long-distance providers must pay Telmex to connect calls through
its local network), the agency at last said it would step in.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Cofetel, the odds were always stacked against it.
Telmex accounts for nearly 30 percent of the value of Mexico's
stock market, and Slim, who heads a diversified conglomerate with
businesses ranging from retailing to Internettery, has huge
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Telmex's power allows it to behave like a bully. Some
Telmex customers have been told that their lines will work properly
only if they use Telmex handsets, which is illegal under the
competition law.
</P>
<P>
   One Telmex engineer admitted to a customer that, if she used
another long-distance provider, such things as digital services
provided by Telmex would _ deliberately _ not work properly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Telmex's main competitors, Avantel and Alestra (in
which, respectively, MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T have large
shareholdings) are up to their own tricks.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is known as bypass, or disguising long-distance
calls as local ones to avoid paying interconnection fees. They are
also trying some political pressure of their own, through their
American shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade
representative, threatened to take a telecoms complaint against
Mexico to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such pressure may not help. Telmex, in which SBC
Communications, an American company, has a 9 percent shareholding,
has used anti-American propaganda to attack its competitors in the
past. And Telmex's supporters point out that its rivals hardly lack
their own local political connections.
</P>
<P>
   Avantel's Mexican shareholder is Banamex, the country's biggest
bank. Alestra is backed by Grupo Alfa, a powerful industrial
conglomerate. Defenders of Telmex thus have little sympathy for its
competitors' cries of unfair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   With such heavyweights as these in the ring, it is no surprise
that even President Ernesto Zedillo has preferred to look on in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Those really hurt by these bullying tactics, however, are
consumers. Lack of tougher regulation is one reason why some
potential competitors to Telmex have yet to offer local service,
despite having held licences for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though competition has made life cheaper for businesses that
make a lot of long-distance calls, ordinary people still pay high
prices for lines and local calls.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner Telmex is reined in, the better for them. Better
still, a tough line in favor of competition in such a big industry
would send a ringing message to monopolies in other branches of the
economy. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ There is an adage that Russia is never as strong, or as
weak, as it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kremlin's new occupants may be repeating it to
themselves under their breath as they try to keep within reasonable
limits the surge of exuberance that often takes hold of Moscow's
ruling class in spring.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants have several
reasons to be tempted into euphoria, and several reasons to be
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economy. Especially if they are not examined too
closely, Russia's financial statistics continue to look better than
the wildest optimist could have predicted at the time of Moscow's
financial crash in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is widely agreed that a windfall from rising oil
revenues has simply masked a continuing failure to make any serious
structural reforms, a number of indicators _ industrial production,
budget revenues and foreign-exchange reserves _ still look rosy,
even as crude-oil prices tumble from their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kasyanov, the deputy prime minister responsible for the
economy, gloated to a group of American businessmen this week that
in the first quarter of this year the government had achieved a
budget surplus of 4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   On shakier ground, he argued that because the new government, at
least in the short term, was awash with revenue, it would be less
reliant on the patronage of politically-minded tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   The same mood of defiant optimism is discernible in Russia's
view of the world, even though the government was stung when the
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe voted last week to
suspend Russian participation unless it behaved better in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet chortling in the Kremlin this week as the German
government squirmed with embarrassment over a revelation that its
intelligence chief had paid a friendly visit to the Russian side of
the Chechen war front.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American visitors to Moscow have been complimented by
their Russian hosts for the ``understanding'' their country has
shown for Russia's policy in Chechnya: such a welcome change from
the pesky moralizing of West Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen also cite as a sign of fresh confidence the
apparent readiness of parliament, after seven years' prevarication,
to heed the Kremlin's wishes and ratify the Start-2 agreement to
slash the nuclear arsenals of America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever impression Putin makes in western countries _ such as
Britain, where he is due on April 16 _ there is still some
skepticism at home about his ability to impose his authority on
rival centers of power in Russia, including regional barons and the
``oligarchs,'' as the political tycoons are known.
</P>
<P>
   Putin-watchers are trying to work out which of the two forces
that propelled this obscure, middle-ranking intelligence officer to
supreme power will have more clout: the armed services or the
financial, media and raw-materials empire of the arch-oligarch,
Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost a year since Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister, fell from power after he blessed an investigation into
the financial dealings at Aeroflot, the airline Berezovsky
controls.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumors in Moscow this week that this probe had
started again _ and there was mystery over Berezovsky's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Putin has in recent days suffered a blow to his
domestic credibility: the withdrawal of his nominee, Valentina
Matviyenko, from next month's contest for the governorship of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The city's current boss, Vladimir Yakovlev, humiliated Putin in
1996 by trouncing his mentor, Anatoly Sobchak.
</P>
<P>
   For Putin, building up his own authority and keeping rivals in
check is not just a matter of point-scoring or personal
satisfaction. It is almost a prerequisite for his political
survival _ and for his ability to promote Russia's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   However good the numbers now look, the economy will badly need
investment over the next few years, as Soviet-era industrial plant
and infrastructure rust away.
</P>
<P>
   But little cash will come unless the division of political and
judicial power between Moscow and the regions is better defined.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the deadly effects of squabbling between Russia's
overmighty barons and the fragility of the economic upturn have
been shown up by a row between two of the country's most powerful
economic companies: the electricity-grid operator, Unified Energy
Systems (UES), run by Anatoly Chubais, and Gazprom, the gas
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom sharply cut supplies to UES this month, pleading that it
could not fulfil its lucrative export contracts while keeping
demand satisfied at home; Chubais would simply have to rely on
costlier energy, such as coal and oil, to keep the power on.
</P>
<P>
   The row, at least provisionally settled by a Kremlin compromise
this week, highlighted one of the economy's most serious worries _
the risk of power cuts. Even in the giddy atmosphere of Russia's
spring, that sort of battle is serious enough to dampen anyone's
euphoria. &QL;

   ISTANBUL _ It is another night of devotion at the ancient tekke,
as buildings that house dervish communities are known, in
Istanbul's Uskudar district.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful are beginning to file in. Trendy bankers, waddling
old peasant women and earnest teenagers remove their shoes, then
bow reverently before an old man sitting cross-legged on a
green-carpeted floor.
</P>
<P>
   His disciples consider him the spiritual successor of Mevlana
Celalettin Rumi, the Afghan-born Sufi mystic who founded the
dervish order late in the 11th century after Christ, preaching love
and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A rhythmic ``Allah! Allah!'' comes from the lips of his
followers as they shake their heads from side to side in the throes
of an ecstatic trance. A few rise to don flowing robes and conical
hats.
</P>
<P>
   To the haunting sound of the ney, a Turkish flute, the dervishes
slowly and gracefully begin to whirl.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing odd about the scene, repeated for centuries in
tekkes across Turkey. But closer scrutiny reveals that _ unusually
_ these spinning figures include females, banned from taking part
in the rituals since a 17th-century ruling by orthodox elders of
the order.
</P>
<P>
   And the women are not swathed in traditional white but in bright
pinks, oranges and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Just as incongruously, a giant portrait of Ataturk, the ardently
secular founder of modern Turkey, gazes down benignly at the flock,
alongside likenesses of the white-bearded Mevlana and the Shia
prophet Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first actions taken by Ataturk, after he came to
power in 1923, was to ban the shadowy Islamic brotherhoods,
including the mild Mevlevis, the name for followers of Mevlana.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Didem Edman, a vivacious young architect who became the
country's first female semazen, as whirling dervishes are called,
sees nothing odd about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ataturk,'' she says, ``is as holy to us as Allah, Muhammad,
Ali and our own exalted Mevlana. Ataturk saw men and women as
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such behavior has set off a furor among more
conservative dervishes, who accuse the Contemporary Lovers of the
Mevlana, as the new group is known, and its guru, Hasan Cikar, of
apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women whirling together? No!'' thunders Nail Kesova, a
leader of a rival, strictly male, assembly of whirlers known as the
Galata, after another district of Istanbul on the other side of the
Bosporus. ``It should not be!''
</P>
<P>
   So have the tarikats, the Sufi brotherhoods that still thrive
despite Ataturk's ban, become the new battleground where Turkey's
pro-secular generals will have to take on the religious
conservatives?
</P>
<P>
   By embracing Ataturk, Cikar's dervishes so far are on the right
side of the soldiers, who have again begun to crack down on Islamic
groups, tarikats included.
</P>
<P>
   But the row between the dervishes may also be about something a
lot less spiritual or doctrinal: money.
</P>
<P>
   The funky, mixed-sex dervishes are already pulling in many more
tourists and cash than their stern, all-male rivals at the Galata.
</P>
<P>
   Cikar loftily brushes aside such explanations with one of his
master's sayings: ``From God we receive. To man we give. We keep
nothing to ourselves.'' &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ When Thabo Mbeki bumped into Robert Mugabe during
coffee breaks at the G-77 summit of developing countries in Havana
this week, the air must have turned frosty.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of South Africa and Zimbabwe are not on good
terms. Mbeki is the widely respected, fairly elected leader of
Africa's richest and most powerful nation. Mugabe is, in the words
of Desmond Tutu, a former archbishop of Cape Town, ``almost a
caricature of all the things people think black African leaders
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mugabe proceeds to wreck the Zimbabwean economy by printing
money, pursuing a senseless war in Congo and encouraging mobs to
seize commercial farms, the repercussions are felt throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Watching demonstrators in Harare pummelled by club-wielding
thugs, foreign fund managers often see not chaos in Zimbabwe, but
chaos in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Mugabe defy his own laws and scorn the property rights
of Zimbabwean citizens, potential investors keep their wallets
shut.
</P>
<P>
   Southern African stock markets, currencies and trade all begin
to wobble as Mugabe pursues his stubborn way.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the only country with the muscle to make Mugabe
behave. The government insists that its diplomats are working
tirelessly and noiselessly to urge sanity on Comrade Bob.
</P>
<P>
   A discreet approach, it argues, is less likely to provoke its
volatile neighbor than the loud insults emanating from Britain.
European countries, by cutting off aid to Zimbabwe, risk sparking
an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Given Zimbabwe's record of not paying its electricity bills,
South Africa would be justified in switching off the supply. But it
does not, for fear of losing 8 billion rand ($1.3 billion) in
annual cross-border trade and gaining a flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   If keeping Zimbabwe afloat means subsidizing a despot, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is satisfied with this softly-softly approach.
Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, complained this
week that quiet diplomacy had yet to yield visible results.
</P>
<P>
   He called for South Africa to mediate between the Zimbabwean
government and opposition, which, he said, are not talking to one
another. He also wants South Africa to use its influence to make
sure that the election, now promised for May (but which could be
postponed), actually takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wakeford, head of the South African Chamber of Business,
has urged Mbeki publicly to distance himself from what is going on
in Zimbabwe. But one reason why Mbeki may be afraid to chide Mugabe
is that the Zimbabwean invasions of white-owned land are evoking
sympathy among black South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Several parliamentarians have pledged their support to the
Zimbabwean squatters. Worse, a recent survey suggested that a slim
majority of South Africans, especially poor ones, believe that the
``war veterans'' were right to seize the whites' land.
</P>
<P>
   A recent opinion poll of 1,900 Zimbabweans found that only 30
percent of them wanted all the white farms to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Revealingly, almost three-quarters of the people asked blamed
the government, rather than white farmers, for the fact that land
reform had still not been accomplished 20 years after independence.
Many realize by now that much of the land acquired for distribution
among the poor has gone to Mugabe's prosperous friends.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government is acutely aware of the hunger for
land among its own rural blacks. The first law passed by the
African National Congress in 1994 was to allow families who had
been evicted during the apartheid years to reclaim their ancestral
property.
</P>
<P>
   The law is well-meaning. Current owners are to be compensated at
market prices. If they do not wish to sell, or if claimants prefer,
evicted families can receive cash compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling-block to land reform in Zimbabwe is both
corruption and inefficiency; in South Africa, it is inefficiency
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63,400 claims lodged with South Africa's land commission,
only 4,000 have been settled, benefiting 13,500 households. Most
claimants may well die before hearing a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   To speed things up, South Africa's land minister, Thoko Didiza,
is making the process less legalistic. Giving people the exact
piece of land from which their parents were evicted is difficult.
There is often no written proof of who owned what, or who is
related to the original owner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to untangle this mess, Didiza is starting
simply to buy land and give it to relatively poor people who
demonstrate that they can make use of it. Some 55,000 households
have benefited from this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   An even better idea _ distributing idle state land (of which
there is a lot) among the landless _ has barely taken off.
</P>
<P>
   The government's priority is to create a class of black
commercial farmers: those who already have money qualify for bigger
handouts. However, if South Africa wants to avoid Zimbabwe's
crisis, it may have to concentrate on helping the truly destitute. &QL;

<P>
   Not so long ago, BP Amoco was being feted by ``ethical
investment'' funds and environmental groups. In spite of being one
of the world's biggest purveyors of fossil fuels, the firm has made
some surprisingly green investments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BP now controls Solarex, the world's biggest
solar-energy company. And it has voluntarily decided to curb
emissions of greenhouse gases, and is building an internal
carbon-trading scheme.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising, then, that the firm should now be under attack
from activist groups on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a curious coalition ranging from the American
Anti-Slavery Group and the International Campaign for Tibet to
Friends of the Earth is threatening a boycott of BP's gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a group led by Greenpeace barracked BP's annual
general meeting on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks are a bit unfair. The wrath of the American
groups, for example, is really directed at China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), which they believe is involved in human-rights
atrocities and environmental misdeeds everywhere from Tibet to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   This group mobilized opposition to last week's flotation of
PetroChina, a division of CNPC, and nearly sank it. BP attracted
their ire when, in a friendly gesture to Beijing, it bought a big
tranche at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace usually throws tomatoes from the outside at annual
meetings of oil firms. This time, it won the support of Trillium
Asset Management, an American firm specializing in socially
responsible investment, which has become a big shareholder in BP.
</P>
<P>
   Trillium put forward a resolution at the AGM that BP's resources
should be redirected from Alaska to its solar-energy venture. Even
its sponsors acknowledged that the measure was never likely to
pass, but was designed to win publicity for the plight of cuddly
polar bears.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was meant to highlight how vulnerable the Arctic is
to global warming generally, and not just to BP's Alaskan projects,
which are not demonstrably dirtier than others.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that BP's green credentials have faded? In
truth, no: the solar-energy company flourishes, and the firm's
commitment to carbon reduction still wins praise in many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew it wasn't going to be easy to plough a straight
furrow, but we will continue to try,'' says one company official.
As these incidents show, it is not easy being green _ especially if
you are an oil giant. &QL;

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Sometimes, obstacles create opportunities. So it
has been in South Africa's information technology (IT) business.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate South Africa hungers for new technology. Combined with
other cumbersome labor laws, ``affirmative action'' prompts
companies to replace people with machines wherever practical.
</P>
<P>
   A bank that fails to hire or promote a black cashier may be
subject to a racial-discrimination lawsuit. An automatic teller, by
contrast, works 24 hours a day and never sues.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Nedcor, the South African bank with the most
admired IT systems, has shaved 25 percent off its operating costs
over the past three years through automation.
</P>
<P>
   Stannic, the vehicle-finance arm of Standard Bank, recently
closed all 46 of its offices, laid off more than 900 people and
moved its operations to call centers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Banking is not the only business using IT to replace people.
J.D. Group, a retailer of sofas, washing machines and other chunky
consumer durables, has so many branches in remote places with poor
telecommunications that it rented part of a satellite to let its
computers talk to each other uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of J.D.'s skilled white managers have emigrated; the firm
has replaced them largely with software.
</P>
<P>
   Tasks such as controlling stocks and making sure that indebted
customers do not fall behind on payments are now largely automated.
The number of employees has been cut from 13,000 in 1993 to 9,500
today.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just companies that yearn for IT. South Africa has
many more mobile telephones and computers than the rest of the
continent (indeed, there are three times as many mobile-phone
subscribers in South Africa as in the rest of Africa put together),
and that creates opportunities for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Firms are already drooling at the prospect of wireless
application protocol (WAP) technology, which will allow people to
gain access to the Internet via their mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Old Mutual, an insurer, recently started to allow customers to
buy and sell unit trusts over the Internet, using WAP.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Brozin, head of Nando's, a fast-food chain, believes that
WAP will reassure potential customers who fear to disclose their
credit-card numbers online. Since users already have a mobile-phone
account, he hopes to sell home-delivered chillied chicken burgers
via mobiles, and simply add the price to the monthly telephone
bill.
</P>
<P>
   IT also provides a flexible career path for young whites.
Unwelcome in the public service, they are more likely than blacks
to seek marketable skills, such as accountancy or computing.
</P>
<P>
   Young programmers can easily find work in South Africa. Or they
can emigrate. Or they can enjoy the best of both worlds by
telecommuting to California, earning dollars but paying rent in
rand.
</P>
<P>
   The IT firms that provide the know-how for all this are among
the most popular companies on Johannesburg's stock exchange.
Dimension Data (Didata), the country's largest IT firm, is valued
at 50.8 billion rand ($7.7 billion); Datatec, the fastest-growing
over the past five years, has vaulted from 40 million rand in 1994
to 12.6 billion rand today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the escalating demand in South Africa, the industry
suffers from several of the handicaps that plague so many of the
country's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Didata and Datatec now do most of their
business overseas. Datatec does not plan to list abroad, but two of
its subsidiaries will probably soon list on Nasdaq and in London.
</P>
<P>
   Didata hopes to move its primary listing to London later this
year, because it is easier to raise money there, and because its
employees in Asia and Europe do not want their share options
denominated in rand.
</P>
<P>
   Also, South African IT professionals often emigrate. Jeremy Ord,
chairman of Didata, argues that it is easier to retain staff if he
can offer them jobs in London or Singapore. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More serious is the effect of Telkom, the state telephone
monopoly. In theory, the Internet ought to allow South African IT
companies to overcome the drawback of being far from big markets.
In practice, bandwidth is roughly 30 times as expensive in South
Africa as it is in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Telkom, not one of our South African clients is
globally competitive,'' complains Ord.
</P>
<P>
   The monopoly is due to end in 2002 or 2003, but real
deregulation may come slowly. The government is reluctant to lose
control of Telkom, partly because it is a useful way of delivering
contracts to black business. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helping the cluster of small IT firms to grow will be difficult.
South Africa has yet to see an Internet start-up boom like that in
America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Johannesburg's venture capitalists are fewer and less
venturesome than those in California. The most prolific backers of
small IT firms have generally been large IT firms such as Didata
and Datatec.
</P>
<P>
   There are still relatively few 20-something millionaires, such
as Mark Shuttleworth, a Capetonian whose Internet security software
firm, Thawte, is valued at 3.5 billion rand, or Nicolaas Vlok,
whose software firm, Idion, is valued at 1.3 billion rand.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttleworth sold his company to an American rival; he would
probably have raised far less by listing in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no vibrant growth of IT companies run or
staffed by blacks. Most of South Africa's successful IT firms are
as white as traditional cricketing trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of education under apartheid, few black South Africans
yet have computing skills. Those blacks who make it to university
tend to study literature or social sciences, often with the aim of
entering government. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950, OR CONTINUE TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Most black-run IT firms survive by doing business with the
government or with state-owned firms, which give preference to
black tenders. Some of them were formerly white-owned, bought by
``black empowerment'' holding companies in order to leverage black
ownership into government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Empowerment Trust (CET), a firm that has close links with
the ruling African National Congress, has one subsidiary that
supplies cables to Telkom, and another that is bidding for a
government contract to introduce electronic payment systems for
minibus taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Nissen, the chairman, argues that South Africa needs a
black-run IT firm to rival Didata and Datatec. But he complains
that white IT bosses are reluctant to surrender control of their
companies. Odd, that. &QL;

<P>
   MIDLAND, TEXAS _ In the spring of 1948, George Bush stood on an
airport runway in west Texas awaiting the arrival of his wife and
two-year-old son, who is now running for president.
</P>
<P>
   He had arrived in the area two weeks ahead of his family, to
begin a career as an oilman in a booming region with seemingly
endless opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, Vincent Matthews looks out of the window
of his office in Midland and ponders a bleaker future: ``These
days, what is going to bring a George Bush to this barren place?''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Center for Energy and Economic Diversification,
Matthews has the job of helping to build a less oily future for
west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of Texas basks in high-tech euphoria, but oil
production in the Permian basin has declined for the past 25 years
and little new industry has moved in to take its place.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of ``the oil patch'' depend on the countries around
the Persian Gulf, thousands of miles away, whose decisions set the
price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midland needs to change,'' says Matthews, ``but Midland
doesn't like to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are pretty bleak. Oil output in Texas reached its
peak in 1973, when 656 million barrels were produced. Since then
production has declined each year: it was only 312 million barrels
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The big oil firms have scaled back their operations, putting
their money into cheaper drilling sites elsewhere. Their place has
been taken by smaller producers operating ``stripper'' wells, which
now account for 83 percent of the wells in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These produce less than ten barrels a day, are expensive to
operate, and are the first to be closed when oil is cheap. About
135,000 of America's stripper wells were stopped in 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the fact that, when the price of
oil rises, the industry tends to forget its problems. For a time
earlier this year there was once again talk of the worst being
over.
</P>
<P>
   When the price of West Texas Intermediate rose to $32 a barrel
in early March, it became profitable for independent producers to
reopen wells they had shut in the days of $10 oil. In March, there
were 286 rigs drilling for oil in Texas, up from the 1999 average
of 227.
</P>
<P>
   Even the current price of $24 or so offers some comfort. In some
ways, a volatile price is as bad as a low one, particularly for
small independent producers. As one of them puts it, ``How can I
plan a major project when I have no idea where the price of oil
will be a year from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Companies now have great trouble trying to persuade Wall Street
to reinvest in the business of finding and extracting domestic oil.
Capital investment in this field shrank by more than a fifth last
year, and is not expected to increase dramatically in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The big companies' exploration budgets are all down. That hits
the drilling-equipment and servicing firms that make up such a
large part of the west Texas economy.
</P>
<P>
   The recent meeting of the OPEC countries has raised hopes that
oil will stay above $20 a barrel at least for the rest of this
year. Nevertheless, many producers in west Texas feel powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment is reinforced by the fact that labor, as well
as capital, is now in short supply. Thousands of families left the
region during the oil bust of the late 1990s in search of more
stable jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimates that
the number of employees in the industry fell from 350,000 in 1997
to 284,000 in 1999. So far this year, the higher price has added
only 7,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If its oil-dependent economy is so troubled even when the price
is up, what can west Texas do?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution is a more diversified economy. But it is
far from clear that the oil patch can attract much in the way of
new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a technology company locate in Midland instead of
Austin?'' asks Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many people were equally skeptical about Austin and
Houston 15 years ago. During the oil and property bust of the
1980s, both cities had a bad time until the high-tech renaissance
came their way.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that west Texas cities such as Midland and
Odessa, unlike Austin and Houston, do not have a large pool of
well-educated workers suitable for new-economy jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They lack both large universities and a serious white-collar
industry. And today's ambitious youngsters find little appeal in
the region's flat, desolate landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the big oil companies could attract lots of
young Ivy Leaguers by offering them a good living and a safe place
to raise their families. That is how East-Coast ways came to the
oil patch; Midland even found itself with a polo club.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little to pull anyone into the region now that the
big boys have gone. Bush the Elder once made a stunning fortune
here. By the time his son launched his oil career in the 1970s, the
prospects had dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Having found only a succession of dry holes, George W. Bush gave
up, and decided to make money in baseball. And that was the
beginning of another story. &QL;

   Aptly enough, 2000 looks set to be a wonderful year for the
world economy, predicts the International Monetary Fund in its new
global economic forecasts, published this week. America is still
booming. Europe, with lots of ground to make up, has begun to surge
as well. In East Asia, things are going better than almost anybody
expected even six months ago. Altogether, it is a marvelous
prospect. But it would be wise to remember a reliable law of
economics: the bigger the boom, the crueller the crunch. &QL;

   While much of the rest of Texas basks in high-tech euphoria _
Austin and Houston, in particular _ oil production in the Permian
basin of West Texas has declined for the past 25 years and little
new industry has moved in to take its place. The fortunes of ``the
oil patch'' depend on the countries around the Persian Gulf,
thousands of miles away, whose decisions set the price of oil. If
its oil-dependent economy is so troubled even when the price is up,
what can west Texas do? &QL;

   There is an adage that Russia is never as strong, or as weak, as

Moscow's ruling class in spring. President-elect Vladimir Putin and

   Fannie and Freddie sound like a sweet couple living down the
street. But in America they are more likely to own the mortgage on
your and your neighbors' house. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are
two of America's biggest financial institutions _ and also two of
its most indebted, with around $1 trillion of debt between them. &QL;

   For all the imperfections of Latin American democracy, much
progress has been made in the past two decades in the conduct of
elections. Nowadays, they are normally fraud-free in voting and
voting-counting. Alas, neither of those claims holds true for last
Sunday's presidential election in Peru. In its lack of fairness and
openness, it marked a big step backwards for the region. &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden said
there is plenty of blame to go around for the team's disastrous
1999-2000 campaign, but in his opinion, a healthy amount belongs to
coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview Thursday, Sinden said he's had a
problem with the team's style of play for the three seasons Burns
has been at the helm. How that issue is resolved will go a long way
toward determining if Burns returns for the fourth year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can continue to play the way we play,'' said
Sinden. ``What changes it requires will have to be discussed
between the coach, myself, and (assistant GM Mike O'Connell). I
think it's foolish to think we can play in the same manner and turn
21 wins into 40 wins. It's just a manner of play that didn't work
last year. The question we have to ask ourselves is, `Was it just
an aberration that it didn't work or will it continue not to work?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the system wasn't a trap nor a forechecking scheme.
He feels the defensemen backed up too often, taking the safe route,
and that the only way the Bruins were able to get possession of the
puck was behind their own net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say we never get it at center ice or at their blue
line but (we need to get it) more often,'' he said. ``And check the
puck carrier sooner than we do. I think it was very difficult to
play defense on this team and very difficult to play goal. When we
were able to get possession or a turnover from the other team, we
had 200 feet to go. That's a long, long way and you have to be
talented to carry it 200 feet and not lose it on the way down. Some
do it with forechecking, some do it with the trap . . . but we
didn't play the trap and we didn't really forecheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he didn't say much in Burns's first two years for
two reasons _ the team was successful and management had given the
coaching staff an unusual level of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't liked it for three years but it worked and you kind
of overlooked a lot of it,'' he said. ``It's not that I detested
it. There are things about it. It happened with (Brian) Sutter, it
happened with Terry (O'Reilly). When you lose, you have to answer.
With Pat Burns, it was total autonomy, on everything. On every
single thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Burns had such power, Sinden said, ``He was coach
of the year twice (Burns won the award a third time in 1997-98),
you'd better let him do his thing. I'd had discussions with every
other coach about how the team was playing or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the Bruins didn't play five good games the entire
season. He said he discussed his concerns with Burns, but didn't
see any changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be because he didn't agree with me and that's fine,''
said Sinden. ``We had a couple of conversations about it, but I
didn't really feel that my input meant very much and that's not the
first time. Mike Milbury used to get mad at me in these meetings,
then he'd come back and say, `I'm going to try it, you could be
right but I hope you're not right because then I'd have to admit
you were right.' Some were right, some weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the lack of change angered him, Sinden said,
``When we lose, sure it does because you couldn't do any worse,
right? When we win, I still offer my advice but it doesn't mean
very much at that point. It might be the same advice.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe the style Burns employed, Sinden referred
to European systems that use terms such as a 1-2-1 or a 2-1-2
formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours as I saw it was a zero-five,'' he said, suggesting that
everyone was playing back. ``That may be the way we played the last
two years prior to it and got 90 points. I thought we were living
on a bit of borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some things where I don't feel we can be successful
unless we correct. That doesn't mean I'm right. If we don't correct
them, maybe we will be successful, but at this point, I don't think
we will. If the Patriots passed on first down every single time
they got possession for 16 straight games, you'd all say, `What the
hell kind of coach is that? What kind of system have they got?'
You'd demand a change but you can't see what I'm talking about on
the ice like we all can in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden acknowledged there was adversity all year, but said the
team overcame none of it. Even if the team had been healthy, which
it definitely was not, he said he'd still have a problem with the
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am upset with the way the team plays, who do I blame?''
he said. ``I mean the style, not the individual player and how good
they are, but the methods we use. If I don't think they're right
and we lose all the time, then someone has to at least take the
blame for the way we play. Not whether it's right or wrong, but he
has to be responsible for the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happens now? Burns has yet to talk with management to
try to resolve the situation. Sinden said that likely will come
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said anything about (Burns) not being here,'' he
said. ``All the talk about him not being here is not coming from
me. We haven't made any decision; we're going to talk about the
future. Maybe he doesn't want to stay. After I meet with Pat, I'll
have a better idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect things to go pretty smoothly. I think some of the
things I've told you I think have to happen with the team that he
will dispute and show me why he disputes it and he'll probably make
a good point. I suppose if everything I think has to happen and he
wants the opposite to happen, then we have to think about that.
Somebody has to decide what way we're going here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sinden finds out everyone's on the same page, he said that
would certainly be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to discuss it with (owner Jeremy Jacobs), as well. He
doesn't like the results of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much speculation we might say one thing or the
other just to remove the speculation. But as of now, at this point,
as far as I'm concerned, he's our coach.''

 &HT;    First, vitamins were our saviors; then the real truth came out
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My local supermarket has row upon row of vitamins,
minerals, extracts, compounds and mixtures that hint at curing or
preventing all known health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The section for these concoctions is located across the aisle
from medicines typically used for headaches, colds, sore throats
and such.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the aisle is for people who have an ailment they
want to get rid of. The other side is for people who are trying to
not get something they'll want to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   I've always figured that I'd wait until I got something unwanted
before I'd worry about it. Besides, I never trusted the claims that
swallowing so many milligrams of tree bark, weed pollen or
pulverized rock would be any better for me than the traditional
food sold in the store.
</P>
<P>
   For years I've listened to relatives, friends and even doctors
talk about antioxidants, free radicals and dietary supplements.
Back in the 1960s, free radicals were the hippies who hadn't been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I caved in and began taking some of the stuff
sold across the aisle from the aspirin, cough medicine and throat
lozenges.
</P>
<P>
   I now take a multivitamin tablet that contains most of the
elements in the periodic table. It's a huge pill.
</P>
<P>
   I also take a big vitamin C pill each morning. A motorcycle
racer out in California told me how important it is to take vitamin
C. I bought a big bottle.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-wife with several college degrees told me that I need to
take natural vitamin E and the mineral selenium.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what vitamin E is supposed to do or what the
difference is between natural vitamin E and unnatural vitamin E.
Nevertheless, I bought a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   I also bought a bottle of selenium. It sounds like a chemical
used to make nuclear weapons. It was on a shelf across from the
upset stomach medicine.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many pills, tablets and capsules on my bathroom
counter now that I take half of them in the morning and the other
half at night. This recent development comes after a lifetime of
resisting suggestions and warnings that I should take dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say whether the pills make any difference
except that they sometimes upset my stomach and cause me to buy the
upset-stomach medicine across from the selenium.
</P>
<P>
   About the time I lined my counter with supplements, a National
Academy of Sciences panel announced that there is no convincing
scientific evidence that taking large amounts of vitamins C and E
or the nutrients selenium and beta carotene can reduce the chances
of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease or
other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   This panel of scientific experts concluded that despite the
popular belief of ex-wives, doctors and others that high doses of
so-called antioxidants help prevent a variety of illnesses, there
is insufficient evidence to recommend that Americans get more of
these nutrients than is necessary to prevent basic nutritional
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said large doses of vitamins C and E and selenium can
be harmful rather than reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular
disease, cataracts, muscular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, cancer and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no evidence that vitamin E or other supplements
can reduce the effects of aging, according to the Institute of
Medicine panel, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences. Too
much vitamin E, however, can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that people should get their nutrients from
food, not pills. A balanced diet and adequate exercise should be
all most Americans need to maintain their health and prevent
disease.
</P>
<P>
   That's too easy.

 &HT;    Armed escorts ease fears of tourist roaming around egypt
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ For the benefit of any readers in danger of being
conscripted into distant and dangerous journeys, I am passing on
humanitarian advice gleaned from hard experience.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to join a tour group, make sure you know exactly
with whom you will be touring. When my wife signed on for a Nile
expedition, I was pleased to learn that our traveling companions
included Dr. Jim Waggoner, a noted Henry County veterinarian, and
his wife, Marjorie, a well-known goatkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Waggoners, fellow survivors of an arduous trip to China two
years ago, seemed to be sensible people. Mrs. Waggoner, unlike my
spouse, is kindly disposed toward goats and wouldn't be terribly
upset if a couple spent an afternoon snoozing on her bedroom
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when the Waggoners asked my wife if we would be
interested in joining them on a trip around the world next year.
Inviting my wife to go anywhere is tantamount to offering whiskey
to an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't we just love to go around the world?'' she asked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly,'' I answered. ``That way we could get all our
traveling over with in one shot and never go anywhere else for the
rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, after being airborne through several time zones en
route to Cairo, over the icy, shark-infested waters of the
Atlantic, the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea, while squeezed into
seats designed for ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' I made up
my mind that if I ever have to circle the globe it won't be at the
fat part.
</P>
<P>
   The only around-the-world trip I'd consider would be to fly to
the northernmost airport in Canada and go from there. That way we
could leave on Monday, be back on Saturday and not have to miss
church on Sunday, which at my age is something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo is quite pleasant. People are friendly to Americans and
anxious to try out their English. The weather on arrival was sunny
and crisp and reminded me of San Francisco on a good day.
Mosquitoes that nearly devoured our Dawsonville friend Bill Burt
when he visited a few years ago never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Palm trees, posh five-star hotels and the Nile River make the
new section of Cairo a mixture of Phoenix, Las Vegas and
Jacksonville, Fla. The Pyramids look pretty much like they do in
National Geographic, except bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Old Cairo is straight out of the picture books children study in
Sunday school. I half expected to meet Jesus and his 12 disciples
walking the dusty streets among camels, donkeys, bearded old men in
flowing robes and women cooking over open fires.
</P>
<P>
   Apprehensions about safety in Egypt were quickly erased. When we
boarded our van for an excursion to the Pyramids, our guide
introduced us to a handsome young man dressed in a blazer, white
shirt and tie, sharply pressed trousers and polished loafers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ali,'' she said. ``He is our security officer from the
tourist police.'' Ali unbuttoned his coat, smiled, and flashed a
large pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it give you a comfortable feeling to be so
well-protected?'' my wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``As Mrs. Sadat was saying to Anwar when the
parade was passing by ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking. If the whole Egyptian army couldn't keep
their president from being assassinated, what can Ali do for us?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pyramids in Giza, we were pleased to find a sizable army
of police officers, some afoot, some on horseback, all carrying
submachine guns. Outriders on camels patrolled a perimeter of sand
dunes.
</P>
<P>
   I caused a big commotion when I snapped a picture of four
tourist police in flak jackets standing beside an armored car. They
agreed not to take me into custody after Ali convinced them I was
only a dumb American tourist.
</P>
<P>
   When we reboarded the van the next morning to visit the tomb of
Mohammed Ali (not to be confused with the great boxer), our
personal Secret Service agent was missing. Our Egyptologist, a.k.a.
tour guide, explained that it was Ali's day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't worry,'' she said. ``The others are still with us.''
She pointed at a sedan trailing our van. ``There are three
policemen with guns in the car,'' she said. ``They were behind us
all day yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, there's no need for tourists to be apprehensive
in Egypt. The only thing not safe is the water.
</P>
<P>
   You might watch out for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which along with
McDonald's and Pizza Hut, is a hit with young people, to the
chagrin of the older generation. According to a consumer reporter
on Cairo television, Kentucky Fried Chicken isn't the real thing.
The chickens are genetically engineered and produced in
laboratories in the United States. They don't have heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that true?'' asked our young Egyptologist, who admits an
addiction to American fast food. She keeps menus in her nightstand
but only orders home delivery when her parents are away.

 &HT;    Caregiver stress comes in many forms
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In the past, long-term caregiving was a relatively
rare occurrence. The dramatic increase in life expectancy in the
past several decades, however, has produced longevity into the 80s,
90s and beyond. The cause of death has dramatically shifted from
acute, infectious diseases to chronic, long-term illnesses that,
because of their slow and progressive nature, require care for
several years or more.
</P>
<P>
   In caring for someone with a long-term disability, especially
difficulties such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the
following stressors have been noted:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress associated with the intensive care, both physical and
psychological, of the disabled person. Dressing, feeding, bathing
and close supervision of daily activities are a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress resulting from the feeling of isolation, detachment
from previous lifestyle and feelings of entrapment as a result of
the intensive demands of caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress resulting from change, often in the form of loss, in
the relationship with the disabled person. This factor is
especially significant in progressive disorders such as dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a list of some of the possible symptoms of
caregiver stress:
</P>
<P>
   _ A detachment and withdrawal from friends and activities that
formally provided healthy release.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chronic exhaustion, both physical and mental, often even after
adequate rest. Persistent feelings of irritability, loss of
control, helplessness and hopelessness and despondency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frequent feelings of an inability to deal with small
disappointments, everyday imperfection and minor upsets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Problems falling asleep, waking up in the middle of the night
worrying about things over which you have very little or no
control, waking up in the wee hours of the morning and not being
able to go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Development of stress-related physical problems such as
diarrhea, headaches, heart palpitations, back pain and dizziness.
Also, a higher susceptibility to colds or flu due to a compromised
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feelings of cynicism, sarcasm or futility about the present
and future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frequent displacement of anger and frustration onto loved
ones, friends or the disabled individual himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reliance on medication, alcohol or other unhealthy escapes in
order to attempt to dilute the pain and stress of caregiving.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Squeezing out lean abs for summer
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Summer is still two months away, but the season of
abdominal obsessions is in full swing at fitness centers.
</P>
<P>
   At Olympic Gym, owner Chip Marlin estimates that as many as 70
percent of his spring customers are trying to get lean and mean for
the upcoming swimsuit season. The goal for most of them is to lose
weight and add muscle tone. That includes sit-ups, crunches and leg
raises to develop flat, muscular stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working to tone up for the summer,'' Marlin said. ``I
can tell by their workout routines.''
</P>
<P>
   Print advertisements and television commercials for warm-weather
clothing are everywhere. Young models with washboard stomachs fill
magazine pages and dot television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Cortes, a dietician at Providence Healthcare Clinic,
says striving to lose body fat and add muscle tone is a good goal,
but not everyone is cut out to have a washboard stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful if we were all in perfect shape,''
Cortes said. ``But we have to be realistic. We have to say, `OK,
maybe I can't have a perfect stomach, but I can get in good
shape.'''
</P>
<P>
   Being realistic means understanding that as we get older, we
slowly lose muscle mass, she said. That means body fat percentages
tend to increase, making a ``six pack'' stomach harder and harder
to come by. Once people are out of their 20s, fighting against too
much body fat becomes a regular struggle for many, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not everyone is built the same, Cortes said. There are
four basic body types for humans: ectomorph (tall and thin),
ovarian (pear shaped with larger hips), mesomorph (stocky, muscular
build), and endomorph (pudgy). No matter how much some people with
ovarian or endomorph body types exercise and diet, it may be
difficult to achieve the kind of washboard stomachs seen on
19-year-old models in print advertisements and on television shows,
trainers and dieticians say.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes said there's nothing wrong with eating healthy and
exercising for a better looking stomach as long as you don't get
carried away. The positives to staying thin are more than just
aesthetic. Recent studies show correlations between abdominal fat
and heart attacks. Even though the challenge of staying fit can
increase with age, Cortes said a balanced diet and exercise routine
can help anyone achieve good health.

   ``It's up to the individual,'' she said. ``(Your health) doesn't
have to get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Clark, a personal trainer at Lakewood Tennis &AMP; Fitness
Center, estimates that business at his gym increases by 30 percent
in the spring. Most of his swimsuit-prep customers are looking to
trim extra fat from their waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   But transforming that trim stomach into a ``six pack'' is
another issue, Clark said. Not everyone is genetically cut out to
have a washboard stomach, but everyone can improve the way they
look and feel by watching their diets and exercising consistently,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can achieve a better-looking body and see
improvements if they work at it,'' Clark said. ``But it can't be
something that for a short period of time you say, `I'm going to
work at it.'''
</P>
<P>
   To counteract flab in the abs, personal trainers and dieticians
suggest a workout regiment with a variety of activities. First,
general weight training does a number of things on the road to
becoming ``cut,'' Marlin said. First, it adds definition and tone
to particular parts of the body. It also adds more muscle mass,
which increases a person's metabolism, helping to burn fat 24 hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin and Clark said the quick-fix ab machines sold on TV may
help develop abdominal muscles, but it takes much more than three
minutes a day on them to get a washboard stomach. Developing a
thin, muscular stomach requires two things: developed abdominal
muscles and lack of fat in the midsection.
</P>
<P>
   To focus on the midsection specifically, trainers suggest a few
simple exercises. Leg raises are one of the simplest ways to wake
up and develop those abdominal muscles. The raises involve laying
on your back with your hands beneath the hip area, near the small
of the back. Lift your legs 8 to 24 inches in the air and slowly
lower them to the ground. Repeat the motion eight to ten times. Try
a few sets, three or four times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Crunches also are highly recommended. For this exercise, remain
on your back, but pull your knees up, as if you're sitting in a
chair but your back should remain flat on the ground. Try putting
your feet up on a bench or chair to maintain proper posture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crunch or squeeze your torso up to a half sit-up position,
then back down. Leave your knees and legs in the air. Do not pull
your torso all the way up, as if doing a traditional sit-up. This
tends to overwork your lower back and take the demand off your
abdominal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   To augment weightlifting and exercises, trainers recommend some
type of a cardiovascular workout four times a week. Each workout,
designed to raise the heart rate but not over-stress your system,
should last somewhere between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on the
person's level of fitness. The workouts can include power walking,
cycling, jogging or aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Marlin and Clark suggest to help get a thin,
washboard stomach is to watch what you eat.
</P>
<P>
   Dieticians warn against high-sugar, high carbohydrate diets,
which can add fat to a physique. They suggest staying away from
things like soft drinks, fruit juices, bread and white rice.
Alternatives include oatmeal, brown rice, baked potatoes and sweet
potatoes, and green vegetables. Marlin also suggests steering away
from dairy products. If you can't stay away from milk, at least
switch to skim, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the greatest abs in the world, but if you don't
shrink the layer of fat between the skin and the abs, you won't
ever see them,'' Marlin said.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Squeezing out lean abs for summer
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Summer is still two months away, but the season of
abdominal obsessions is in full swing at fitness centers.
</P>
<P>
   At Olympic Gym, owner Chip Marlin estimates that as many as 70
percent of his spring customers are trying to get lean and mean for
the upcoming swimsuit season. The goal for most of them is to lose
weight and add muscle tone. That includes sit-ups, crunches and leg
raises to develop flat, muscular stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working to tone up for the summer,'' Marlin said. ``I
can tell by their workout routines.''
</P>
<P>
   Print advertisements and television commercials for warm-weather
clothing are everywhere. Young models with washboard stomachs fill
magazine pages and dot television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Cortes, a dietician at Providence Healthcare Clinic,
says striving to lose body fat and add muscle tone is a good goal,
but not everyone is cut out to have a washboard stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful if we were all in perfect shape,''
Cortes said. ``But we have to be realistic. We have to say, `OK,
maybe I can't have a perfect stomach, but I can get in good
shape.'''
</P>
<P>
   Being realistic means understanding that as we get older, we
slowly lose muscle mass, she said. That means body fat percentages
tend to increase, making a ``six pack'' stomach harder and harder
to come by. Once people are out of their 20s, fighting against too
much body fat becomes a regular struggle for many, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not everyone is built the same, Cortes said. There are
four basic body types for humans: ectomorph (tall and thin),
ovarian (pear shaped with larger hips), mesomorph (stocky, muscular
build), and endomorph (pudgy). No matter how much some people with
ovarian or endomorph body types exercise and diet, it may be
difficult to achieve the kind of washboard stomachs seen on
19-year-old models in print advertisements and on television shows,
trainers and dieticians say.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes said there's nothing wrong with eating healthy and
exercising for a better looking stomach as long as you don't get
carried away. The positives to staying thin are more than just
aesthetic. Recent studies show correlations between abdominal fat
and heart attacks. Even though the challenge of staying fit can

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Fighting the good fight, when your skin is your
enemy
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Laurel Garner really believes her body
is a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible blisters on her eye, thumb, back and gums have
popped out when she has been under intense emotional or physical
stress.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce, working two jobs, a car accident _ even the physical
stress of a tattoo _ resulted in horrible blistering that
eventually was diagnosed as a rare autoimmune disorder, pemphigus
vulgaris.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body sees my skin as an enemy,'' the Stuart woman says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not such a far-fetched concept.
</P>
<P>
   Garner's dermatologist, Dr. Marta Rendon, says at least 10
common skin disorders, including acne, dandruff and hives, are
either triggered or worsened by stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly how or why stress triggers these
diseases. And people don't have to have any psychological disorder.
It's just the way they deal with stress, how the stress affects
their body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient who fell off his ladder at work and was out of
a job. His psoriasis came out after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendon, who practices in Boca Raton, says that stress
management, biofeedback and relaxation tapes can help patients
manage their outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on giving them emotional support, explaining the
disease and the outcome, and giving them guidance. Sometimes, that
alone helps them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other dermatologists find stress management of little use in
controlling or preventing most skin disorders because, they say,
there are so many factors that lead to outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are psychological conditions _ where patients scratch
their faces excessively, for example _ where psychological
approaches are helpful, says Dr. Howard Green, division director of
dermatology for Intracoastal Health Systems in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And biofeedback as a preventative can be good if there is a
strong correlation between emotional and physical stress and the
condition. But it's strictly individual. And it's usually not that
straightforward. I'd downplay that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Rosenberg, also a West Palm Beach dermatologist, had
a similar viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that a dermatologic condition needs that approach,''
he said. ``Biofeedback would be unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Rendon: ``The issue is, it's very important to
recognize how stress affects your body and these diseases. Ones who
are severely affected might need stress management to deal with and
control their disease.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that she might approach diseases differently
than other dermatologists. For one thing, she is looking for a
therapist to join her practice, she said, so she can have a
``holistic approach, treating the whole patient.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she adds, ``There's plenty of data, especially on psoriasis
and eczema, that shows stress management affects the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garner _ Rendon's patient of four years _ says she is
happy with Rendon's approach and has discussed controlling stress
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives me such individual attention. If I'm hurting, she's
hurting. It's important to know she cares. The comfort she gives
you helps.''
</P>
<P>
   TOP 10 STRESS-RELATED SKIN DISEASES
</P>
<P>
   1. Cold sores: painful blisters on the lips or in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dandruff: common condition in which the scalp is dry and
scaling.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hyperhydrosis: excessive sweating.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pruritus: chronic itching that may be mild to intense, and
the scratch marks occasionally become infected.
</P>
<P>
   5. Hair loss and Alopecia Areata (round areas of hair loss).
</P>
<P>
   6. Acne: the general term for plugged pores, pimples, and deeper
lumps that may cause inflammation which, if severe enough, can
result in scars.
</P>
<P>
   7. Eczema: a red, itchy inflammation of the skin characterized
by red skin patches, pimples, crusts, or scabs occurring alone or
in combination.
</P>
<P>
   8. Psoriasis: an inflammatory skin condition characterized by
frequent episodes of redness, itching, and thick, dry, silvery
scales on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   9. Hives (Urticaria): raised welts of various sizes on the
surface of the skin that are often itchy.
</P>
<P>
   10. Rosacea: a skin inflammation characterized by a redness that
looks like a blush, pimples, knobby lumps on the nose, and thin red
lines due to enlarged blood vessels.

 &HT;    Wood can be expensive and here's why
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader e-mailed a request recently searching for
places that sell hardwood outside of, rather than in, Atlanta, on
the premise that prices would be cheaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help him, since I wouldn't drive the 50 to 75 miles
from the town he specified to buy wood unless I couldn't find it
closer. Also, I doubt that there's going to be any significant
difference in the price _ retailers in Hahira probably get their
wood from the same mills as retailers in Atlanta. The price of
wood, I've found, is pretty standard from store to store in a given
region.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a considerable amount of wood, and want the best
price for it, then the thing to do is buy it green. And if you live
in a rural area, or at least have a good bit of land on which to
construct drying facilities, you can do very well indeed.
</P>
<P>
   You might even want to get into the woodcutting business.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it from the top, most folks who decide they want to cut
their own wood buy a Wood-Mizer mill. Wood-Mizer
(www.woodmizer.com) makes a wide range of portable bandsaw mills
for turning logs into planks wherever the trees are felled. For the
most part, these remarkable mills will run a log through the blade
at a spacing you select, and do other fancy stuff. There is, of
course, the bare minimum of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you want to think carefully before you invest in one of
these machines. Some folks have gotten caught up in the romance of
woodcutting and ignored the down side of the business, such as it's
a lot of hard and heavy work and you've got to do a lot of it to
make any money. If you just want some wood cut up once in a while,
you'd probably do better to hire someone who has a Wood-Mizer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next two questions can be answered pretty much
together. First, where do you find a Wood-Mizer operator? And
second, where do you find green planks for sale?
</P>
<P>
   The best source I know of for both is the Georgia Agriculture
Department's Farmer's and Consumer's Market Bulletin. You can get a
free subscription to this wonderful little newspaper by calling the
Agriculture Department in Atlanta, or you can read it online at
www.agr.state.ga.us. There's always someone advertising hardwood
for sale, or raw logs or trees for sale, and often you'll find
Wood-Mizer operators offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   Now, assuming you have gotten this far, how do you dry your
green lumber?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on how fast you want it to get dry, and how much
expense and trouble you're willing to accept in the process. The
cheap, slow way is to sticker it in an open shed _ you just need
enough cover to keep the rain off _ for a year or two, depending on
the thickness of the planks, and when it has reached equilibrium
with the ambient moisture, bring it indoors in an unheated,
uncooled environment for another long stay.

from the town he specified to buy wood unless I couldn't find it
closer. Also, I doubt that there's going to be any significant
difference in the price _ retailers in Hahira probably get their
wood from the same mills as retailers in Atlanta. The price of
wood, I've found, is pretty standard from store to store in a given
region.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a considerable amount of wood, and want the best
price for it, then the thing to do is buy it green. And if you live
in a rural area, or at least have a good bit of land on which to
construct drying facilities, you can do very well indeed.
</P>
<P>
   You might even want to get into the woodcutting business.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it from the top, most folks who decide they want to cut
their own wood buy a Wood-Mizer mill. Wood-Mizer
(www.woodmizer.com) makes a wide range of portable bandsaw mills
for turning logs into planks wherever the trees are felled. For the
most part, these remarkable mills will run a log through the blade
at a spacing you select, and do other fancy stuff. There is, of
course, the bare minimum of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you want to think carefully before you invest in one of
these machines. Some folks have gotten caught up in the romance of
woodcutting and ignored the down side of the business, such as it's
a lot of hard and heavy work and you've got to do a lot of it to
make any money. If you just want some wood cut up once in a while,
you'd probably do better to hire someone who has a Wood-Mizer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next two questions can be answered pretty much
together. First, where do you find a Wood-Mizer operator? And
second, where do you find green planks for sale?
</P>
<P>
   The best source I know of for both is the Georgia Agriculture
Department's Farmer's and Consumer's Market Bulletin. You can get a
free subscription to this wonderful little newspaper by calling the
Agriculture Department in Atlanta, or you can read it online at
www.agr.state.ga.us. There's always someone advertising hardwood
for sale, or raw logs or trees for sale, and often you'll find
Wood-Mizer operators offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   Now, assuming you have gotten this far, how do you dry your
green lumber?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on how fast you want it to get dry, and how much
expense and trouble you're willing to accept in the process. The
cheap, slow way is to sticker it in an open shed _ you just need
enough cover to keep the rain off _ for a year or two, depending on
the thickness of the planks, and when it has reached equilibrium
with the ambient moisture, bring it indoors in an unheated,
uncooled environment for another long stay.

 &HT;    Photo exhibit captures ancient lessons of Bible, applies them to
modern times
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio _ A chance Internet encounter has led a
Middletown congregation to become the first church in America to
host a beautiful and unusual international photo exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words of Yesterday, Photos of Today,'' a collection of
photographs inspired by ancient Biblical quotations, is on display
at the Breiel Boulevard First Church of God, an evangelical
Christian church associated with the Church of God in Anderson,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit juxtaposes ancient Hebrew texts with contemporary
scenes from the Holy Land that illuminate them _ often with
jarring, thought-provoking results. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ A field of colorful flowers blooming in the Negev desert is
matched with this text from Isaiah: ``The wilderness and the
solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall
rejoice, and blossom as the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A taxi driver arguing about a ticket he's being given by a cop
is described by these verses from Job: ``Should he argue with
useless talk, Or with words which are not profitable?''
</P>
<P>
   _ A flashy rock singer in concert in Israel is matched with this
text from Psalms: ``Sing unto him a new song, play skillfully with
a loud blast.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A photo of Israel taken by astronauts from the U.S. Space
Shuttle has this accompanying text from Genesis: ``And God called
the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He
called Seas; and God saw that it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hogan, the church member responsible for bringing the
exhibit to town, says he can't help but believe ``there's something
bigger up there that's guiding all this.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started when Hogan and the other members of his committee
began working on their annual Easter musical multimedia
presentation. ``Jerusalem 2000 ... The Answer'' had been chosen as
this year's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was that we wanted to show how the things that
happened in Jesus' time are still the answers to today's
problems,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan got the task of coming up with the graphics for the
invitation _ an image that would that would illustrate both ancient
and contemporary Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member doing research on the Internet
discovered a photo of Jerusalem that seemed perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was photograph of new and old Jerusalem from the book,
`Testament of Israel','' says Hogan. He contacted the publisher and
requested permission to use the image for his church.
</P>
<P>
   The woman he contacted was Linda Majors, who represents the
publisher in America and wanted to know more about the
congregation's upcoming event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been my dream to start taking the exhibit to
churches,'' says Majors. ``It has had wonderful response in Jewish
communities, and it's going to be in three major cathedrals in
England this summer, but we hadn't yet scheduled it in an American
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the quotations are taken from the Old Testament, she
says, the book and exhibit are for Jews, Christians, Muslims,
``everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Majors says Hogan was so charming that she ended up suggesting
his church might want to host the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea, she says, came from John Wagner, former
president of Victor Hasselblad Inc., the Swedish camera company .
</P>
<P>
   ``His love of the Bible, Israel and photography came together to
create the book,'' Majors says. ``He worked with Professor Markham
Geller at the University College in London and together they picked
the quotations they loved. Then they went through 7,000 photographs
to find the perfect match for each one.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is made up of 30 of the book's images and represents
top Israeli and internationally known photographers. Majors says it
has proven particularly effective in motivating young people to
study the Bible: In some cities, youngsters have been asked to
enter a photo competition, digging up photos of their own and
matching them with appropriate biblical quotes.
</P>
<P>
   In Middletown, in addition to being on display before each of
the church's Easter performances, a community open house for the
exhibit will be held from 2-6 p.m. Sunday. The coffee-table art
book, priced at $60, will be available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to extend an open hand to our brothers and
sisters of other backgrounds,'' Hogan says. ``It's exciting to see
pictures of things mentioned in the Bible that we don't often see,
like the Sea of Galilee, the Dome of the Rock, the streets of
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his favorite photos, he adds, demonstrate that
friendships and personal connections can develop between people who
may be at odds in a larger sense. One example is a photo of a
Jordanian and Israeli soldier playing musical instruments together
accompanied by the text from Psalms: ``Behold, how good and how
pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan says the photos perfectly illustrate the concept his
church was trying to capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to show how Hebrew scriptures written
centuries ago still fit today.''

 &HT;    Dinosaur program gives high-tech glimpse of prehistoric beasts
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If nothing else, you have to give the folks who
made ``Walking With Dinosaurs'' credit for speaking with authority.
</P>
<P>
   The first line in the show, intoned by deep-voiced Avery Brooks,
goes: ``An asteroid plunged to Earth 65 million years ago. It ended
one of the most astonishing chapters in the history of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boom! Nothing ambiguous about that. None of that
gosh-what-killed-the-dinosaurs head-scratching you get down at the
natural history museum. The producers of this rich, astonishing
program do indeed speak with authority _ an assurance of fact and
interpretation that becomes immediately, breathtakingly apparent in
just the first few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We see dinosaurs _ what appear to be real, living, on-camera
dinosaurs _ going about the business of hunting, feeding, mating,
flying, swimming, nesting, hatching and fighting as though the
producers actually snuck up on the critters just as we're used to
seeing done in the educational nature shows we've grown up with.
</P>
<P>
   As any modern, movie-savvy kid knows, however, these
Brachiosaurs and Tyrannosaurus Rexes came out of a computer. The
quality-conscious producers of the three-hour show _ the Discovery
Channel, along with the BBC _ are well aware that their audience is
already used to seeing fossils spring to life on-screen, a la
``Jurassic Park,'' but wisely choose to let the story tell itself
without artificial jazzing up. ``Walking With Dinosaurs'' succeeds
because it never loses sight of the fact that it is trying to teach
more than entertain and recognizes that there is already spectacle
aplenty built into the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And they play that spectacle for all it's worth, making us
believe we're seeing it really happen. The team of consulting
paleontologists, sculptors, computer animators and digital guys
fashioned the prehistoric action in story cycles that focus on the
lives of animals who epitomize their period and all the change
going on around them.
</P>
<P>
   We go first to Arizona in 220 million B.C., in the area that
will be known much later as the Petrified Forest. It's the early
Triassic, and we meet four creatures and learn the ways of their
fascinating interactions.
</P>
<P>
   There are herds of slow-moving Placerias, distant ancestors of
the dinosaurs who look like hippos and are set upon by a 2-ton
early carnivore known as the Postosuchus. It, too, is lumbering and
sluggish _ able to prey easily on the Placerias, but unable to keep
up with a new kid on the block: The nimble, razor-toothed
Coelophysis, a streamlined hunter who is one of the first true
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the fast, relentless dinosaurs spells the
eventual end of the dull-witted reptiles who came before. But even
as we see the dinosaurs on the way up, we meet the doglike, hairy
Cynodonts _ half-reptile, half-mammal, the warm-blooded animals who
would eventually evolve into modern mammals.
</P>
<P>
   We watch as they pursue and feed upon each other, setting the
stage for what follows a few million years later _ the Age of
Dinosaurs in all its animatronic glory. Allosaurus does battle with
Stegosaurus; Diplodocus hatches from buried eggs and grows 2 tons a
year; Ornithocheirus and Rhamphorhynchus take to the air;
Tyrannosaurus does what we all know he does.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing a lot of this stuff already doesn't keep one from
enjoying seeing it all replayed in brilliant, living detail. Puffs
of steam billow from nostrils. Flesh sways with every heavy step.
Tails twitch, eggs glisten, eyes blink. A few of the animal sounds
_ yes, they all make noise _ sound a tad computerized, and at times
the John Williams-style score seems a bit too Hollywood for the
Discovery Channel. But the show is a winner, and you'll be
surprised at what you learn even if you thought you knew the
subject well.
</P>
<P>
   Parents will enjoy seeing how today's notions of dinosaurs vary
wildly from what we were taught years ago, when we were told these
thick-footed, plodding monsters needed to prop themselves on their
tails. Kids will enjoy finally getting an answer to the question
every one of them has asked at one time or another: What would it
be like to be able to go back and see the dinosaurs?
</P>
<P>
   Now they know.

their planning huddles, the determined looks as they gather courage
for the synchronized assault, their reckless confidence as they
throw their bodies at their father.'') or of discovering he is
perfectly happy living without a television (``Our mind connects
the dots, lending depth and perspective, and ultimately, meaning to
the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube. And yet, the experience
sedates us, engaging just enough of our senses to lull us into a
stupor.''). He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind
always seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what
might be called the universal. (Skube, Atlanta

use and language. It also includes a disturbing theme and images.

   ONLINE-ANTIQUARIANS (Undated) _ Ordinarily the antiquarian trade
is the dusty, genteel corner of the book market that attracts
fiercely independent booksellers. But now the dust motes are flying
with the emergence of Alibris, a virtual used bookseller with Wall
Street ambitions and Silicon Valley money. The hostilities that
Alibris has provoked among some traditional booksellers mirrors the
tensions that other industries are facing over issues of
consolidation and the loss of personal connections. By Doreen

 &HT;    ALABAMA PLANTS OVERWHELMED WITH SICK CHICKENS, REPORT FINDS
 &HT;    790&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Gold Kist Inc. poultry processing plants in
Alabama that supply chicken to school lunch programs nationwide
were overwhelmed earlier this year by diseased poultry, federal
investigators have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many birds condemned that they were filling up
the 'USDA condemned' barrel and spilling onto the floor,'' the
report, obtained by Cox Newspapers, says of conditions at Gold
Kist's Boaz plant.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the chickens arriving on Feb. 9 were
infected with a respiratory disease called airsacculitis that
leaves pus inside the carcass, one federal worker told an
investigator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of
Inspector General (OIG).
</P>
<P>
   At a plant in Guntersville that is using an experimental food
inspection system, the report found that Gold Kist failed to
identify substantial numbers of diseased carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the experimental program, company workers instead of
federal inspectors are supposed to find and remove substandard
poultry. But the report cited government records showing that on
Feb. 7, 28 percent of birds selected in government spot checks
after being approved by the company were diseased, typically with
airsacculitis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite conditions inside the plants, the inspector general's
office said it was dropping the matter because ``there is no
allegation of any deliberate violation of law or direct threat to
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bekkers, Gold Kist president and chief operating officer,
said in a statement posted on its Web site: ``As we have assured
our customers all along, Gold Kist Farms brand chicken products are
safe, wholesome and good to eat. We appreciate that this was
recognized in the OIG report.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Atlanta-based company refused to be
interviewed, offering instead to reply to written questions. Cox
Newspapers declined that offer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson at the inspector general's office in Washington
declined to discuss the March 3 report.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office launched its investigation in
early February after Cox Newspapers detailed allegations by several
federal food safety inspectors at the Guntersville and Boaz plants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to determining whether the inspectors' allegations
were true, the report says that Agriculture Department officials
asked the OIG to determine if ``internal agency documents (were
given) to the press.'' The report says it found ``no basis for
further investigation'' of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said that because of widespread disease in Gold
Kist chicken flocks, both processing plants were being inundated
with diseased poultry.
</P>
<P>
   While such birds are normally condemned, the inspectors said
that under the experimental food inspection system at the
Guntersville facility, some diseased poultry was being used to make
chicken nuggets for school lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken nuggets are not considered a threat to human health
because the poultry diseases cannot be transmitted to human beings.
However, inspectors said they considered carcasses with scabs,
sores and pus to be ``unwholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the inspectors' allegations were published,
Bekkers issued a press release defending the quality of his product
and charging that ``the public is being misled by a few
union-activist USDA poultry inspectors.'' He said that there was
``no factual support for their claims.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week after Bekkers' statement was issued, a Gold Kist
official acknowledged to an OIG investigator that ``airsacculitis
... had been moving through the flocks and infecting chickens.''
The name of the executive was deleted in the copy of the report
obtained by Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Billy, head of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, released a statement Feb. 11 saying the
government had ``excellent controls'' at the plant and that food
from the plant can be ``eaten with confidence.'' He also said, ``We
have no reason to believe products leaving these Gold Kist Plants
is anything other than safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the OIG's report quoted federal inspectors who were
complaining that ``they are not allowed to remove birds at any
point.'' The report lists the results of inspections made at
Guntersville on Feb. 5, 7 and 8. A sampling of chickens made by
federal inspectors _ after Gold Kist workers had supposedly culled
out diseased carcasses _ found that between 11 and 28 percent of
the birds were diseased. Federal rules permit a maximum of 3
percent of a sample to contain diseased birds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Agriculture Department's press office did not
respond to repeated requests for an interview with Billy.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The OIG's report raises questions about what exactly the
government means when it says food products are wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law forbids the sale of poultry for human consumption if
it is ``adulterated or misbranded'' at the time of sale. If it is
``unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human
food,'' it is considered ``adulterated.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report said that the ``inquiry did not disclose any
adulteration of product.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials have declined repeated requests
over several weeks to provide an explanation of the meaning of the
term ``wholesome'' in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, said
wholesome ``is meant to describe conditions that would not only
make the food unhealthy or unsafe, but also would be unappealing.
It is not food a consumer would knowingly want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The OIG report said that an inspector at the Boaz plant told
investigators about the chicken leaving the plant, ``as far as (he
or she) knows it is not unsafe, but (he or she) would not it it
personally. (He or she) thinks the public should know that sores
and scabs are going into it.''

IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE DULL  

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   April may or may not be the cruelest month, but it is without a
doubt the dullest.
</P>
<P>
   April 4-10 was National Reading a Road Map Week, ``dedicated to
promoting map-reading as an enjoyable pastime for drivers and
armchair travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not to be confused with National Folding Road Maps Week
(April 11-17), the motto of which is ``Happiness is knowing how to
fold a road map.''
</P>
<P>
   April 4 was Check Your Batteries Day, April 5-11 was Egg Salad
Week and April 19-25 is National Organize Your Files Week.
</P>
<P>
   If, after this, you have any energy left over (and I can't
imagine you would), you can celebrate the anniversary of the
invention of Teflon (April 6, 1938), the anniversary of the opening
of the first McDonald's (April 15, 1955) and, of course, the
anniversary of the metric system (April 7, 1795).
</P>
<P>
   This information is brought to you courtesy of my favorite
organization, the National Council of Dull Men, located,
appropriately enough, in Washington, D.C. (For those of us who find
writing a letter too stimulating, the group can be contacted on the
Web at http://dullmen.com/.)
</P>
<P>
   Like all worthwhile things in life, achieving a state of total,
irredeemable dullness requires a bit of effort. Men who are truly
committed to dullness travel all over the world, not to see the
sights or sample the cultures but to see if the airport
baggage-claim carousels turn in a clockwise or counterclockwise
direction. (They go clockwise at Washington's Dulles Airport, by
the way.)
</P>
<P>
   But just because we're dull, doesn't mean we don't like to
``party down.'' On New Year's Eve, for example, we spent the last
hours of 1999 practicing writing checks dated 2000 so we were able
to ``hit the ground running'' and make fewer mistakes when we wrote
out real checks with the new date.
</P>
<P>
   Many dull men are also rugged outdoorsmen, their favorite
activity being tractor-spotting. (Train-spotting is far too
reckless.)
</P>
<P>
   Dull men with a scientific bent tune in the Weather Channel at 6
a.m., watch for about an hour, then call around the country to find
out if the predicted weather is really happening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course dull men wouldn't be dull men if we didn't spend a lot
of time on the computer. One of our favorite Web sites is Cambridge
Coffee Pot - Live Cam Page, where you can watch coffee being brewed
and, if you're really lucky, watch it drip.
</P>
<P>
   Other favorite sites include Ice Fishing, the Journal of Mundane
Behavior, the National Association of Wheat Growers and, of course,
Spam.
</P>
<P>
   Although we may not look it, we dull men have active minds and
love to read. One of our favorite books is ``How to Rake Leaves''
by Leonard Koren and Suehiro Maruo. I am sad to report that this
book is currently out of print, despite finishing 1,828,062nd in
Amazon.com's sales ranking. It did, however, receive a 5-star
recommendation from reviewer Herb Stantwittle who called it an
``excellent reference work ... contains insight into bagging,
too!''
</P>
<P>
   Dull guys read dull books in order to collect dull tidbits of
information that they can share at parties that are insufficiently
dull. You probably did not know, for example, that nutmeg is
extremely poisonous if injected intravenously or that Heinz ketchup
leaves the bottle at a rate of 25 miles per year.
</P>
<P>
   If your dullness quotient were higher, you would probably know
that an ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain and that there is an
average of 178 sesame seeds on a Big Mac bun.
</P>
<P>
   Dull guys follow politics closely and are especially excited by
how dull this year's presidential race is shaping up to be. Dull
guys, as a group, feel sorry for President Clinton because he
wouldn't have had all that trouble with ``that woman'' if he had
been a duller guy.
</P>
<P>
   (Instead of cavorting about the Oval Office, a duller president
might have invited Monica to lunch with Janet Reno or helped her
write an essay on ``Her Proudest Achievement as a White House
Intern.'')
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, we dull guys are making ourselves heard, even if nobody
cares to listen.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exciting time to be dull, which is why I can't wait
until June, which is National Rest Areas Month. In the meantime,
I'll have to amuse myself the best I can, perhaps by watching some
paint dry.

SOUTHERN LAWMAKERS FACE CONFLICTING INTERESTS ON CHINA TRADE DEAL 
 
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington Bureau
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Despite the absence of a sizable union presence in
the region, some Southern lawmakers find themselves sympathetic to
labor's opposition to granting China permanent favorable trading
status.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans and Democrats object to China's poor
record of human rights abuses and its restrictions on religious
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year I look for any signs that China will stop these acts
against humanity,'' said Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., who has
voted against previous bills that have granted enhanced trading
status for China. He is still mulling this latest measure. Many
Republican leaders, along with President Clinton, argue that an
increased American presence in China through trade will expedite
reform there as well as open sales opportunities for American
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other lawmakers say that previous trade agreements, such
as NAFTA, have cost Southern workers jobs, particularly in the
textile and apparel industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Southeastern North Carolina, free trade has been anything
but free,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C. He said thousands of
textile jobs have been lost in his district since the NAFTA trade
deal was enacted with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very costly to many families,'' McIntyre said,
adding that a trade deal with China could bring much more of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., has supported an enhanced trade status
with China on an annual basis, but remains undecided about any
permanent status because that ``brings up entirely different issues
that we need to think through and discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE MARKET
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to win support for strengthening U.S. trade ties
with China and admitting China into the World Trade Organization,
the Clinton administration has compiled a report detailing how such
a development would benefit each state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not grant China (permanent trade status) then our
competitors in Asia, Europe and Latin America will reap the very
benefits we negotiated,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible benefits? Alabama, Florida and North Carolina,
where chemical products make up the bulk of exports to China, would
face low tariffs for such products, including insecticides.
Louisiana, where agricultural products make up 52 percent of its
exports to China, would no longer have to compete against export
subsidies on China's own farm products.
</P>
<P>
   And South Carolina, where industrial machinery and computers
comprise the single greatest share of exports to China, would face
an elimination of duties on most of those products.
</P>
<P>
   SPLIT PERSONALITY
</P>
<P>
   As the House quickly passed a measure that would funnel money to
states that crack down on criminals who possess guns, the White
House took a unique view.
</P>
<P>
   First spokesman Joe Lockhart assailed Republicans for engaging
in a ``cruel political trick'' by pursuing legislation that would
make law-enforcement money available to only a handful of states
while bottling up White House-backed gun controls. Florida, South
Carolina and Louisiana are among states that could get the money
due to their sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lockhart took credit for the approach, known as Project
Exile, calling it an administration idea first launched in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Project Exile started down in Richmond with our U.S.
attorney,'' bragged Lockhart. ``It has been replicated in other
cities around the country. These are programs that we support.''
</P>
<P>
   RAGIN' CAJUN
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., looks like the winner in what has been
a spirited battle to claim the helm of the influential House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert recently endorsed Tauzin's claim
that he enjoys the most seniority on that committee, in spite of
the fact that most of Tauzin's time there was as a Democrat before
he switched parties in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's show of support for Tauzin comes at the expense of
Republican Michael Oxley of Ohio, who is also lobbying for the
slot. Tauzin has also won friends in the GOP by hosting
fund-raisers for his colleagues and the GOP over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's confident that he's done everything necessary to
ensure that he'll be the next Commerce Committee chairman,''
spokesman Ken Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, one small hurdle. Republicans most stave
off what's expected to be a strong effort by Democrats this fall to
reclaim their majority in the House, an outcome that would render
Tauzin's own plans moot. Unless he switches parties again.

&HT;     ARCHAEOLOGIST PREDICTS NEW SURPRISES FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By BILL CRAIG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are there any more buried cities and treasure-laden
ancient tombs still waiting to be uncovered for science and the
popular imagination? A prominent archaeologist thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you settle on the fact that there can't be anything
bigger, something shows up,'' said Joe Seger, who teaches at
Mississippi State University and is president of the American
Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR). He will be in Washington this
weekend, joining other archaeologists and those interested in the
ancient Middle East, to celebrate the Boston-based ASOR's 100th
birthday and the sensational archaeological discoveries made in
that part of the world in the past century.
</P>
<P>
   Activities include a seminar Saturday at the Smithsonian
Institution cosponsored by The Smithsonian Associates. A series of
television programs on the Public Broadcasting System this spring
features famous excavations in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity audiences at lectures, the appearance of new popular
magazines, and frequent television programs on archaeological
subjects are evidence of the high public interest, Seger said.
College-level classes on archaeology fill up in a hurry, and
graduate students who pay their own way or have scholarships are a
valuable source of labor on archaeological digs that typically cost
$150,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But historically, funding has been a perennial problem for
archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is not very interested,'' Seger said, noting
that arts and historical foundations and some government sources
help scholars to ``cobble together'' support.
</P>
<P>
   Another ongoing and seemingly unsolvable problem for
archaeologists worldwide has been looting of sites, especially in
areas where nearby residents are poor and are tempted by the
lucrative international art market. To complicate the situation for
archaeologists, some collectors also finance excavations. Seger
said the disappearance of items from museums in Iraq, the site of
ancient Mesopotamia, as a result of the Persian Gulf War has been a
tragedy for science.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these and other problems, ``our enterprise is
flourishing,'' he said. New developments in computer technology
have brought dramatic changes to the field. On one recent
excavation, it was possible to be in contact with the dig team as
soon as discoveries were made. On a project at Petra, in Jordan,
excavators could reconstruct the image of a collapsed ancient
building as its toppled columns were uncovered, a job that used to
take months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen amazing things in terms of recording projects, as
well as gene and pollen analysis, and we're going to get more and
more of them,'' Seger said. ``We try to recover not just bones and
stones, but the character of materials and how people lived that
used them. I am an optimist. I think that, given the resources,
there are plenty of new frontiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria, for example, is an unknown region, he said, and there are
thousands of sites in Israel awaiting scientific examination.
</P>
<P>
   Three research centers are operated in association with ASOR, in
Israel, in Jordan and in Cyprus. The organization also supports
American archaeological research in Syria and Iraq and is working
on cooperative projects with the Palestine National Authority and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ASOR is involved with 30 sites now under excavation and 28
publication projects.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the centennial celebration it will sponsor a
symposium in Jerusalem May 26-31, and receptions in Nicosia,
Cyprus, on June 5 and in Amman, Jordan, on June 7.

&HT;     WITH SOFT-SHELL CRABS, THE SECRET'S IN THE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a romantic story, orchestrated, say watermen, by the moon
and the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-shell crabs are a delicacy that arrive with the first full
moon of spring. They are merely blue crabs that have shed, a
necessary process called molting that allows the crabs to grow.
Once a crab has filled its hard, outer shell, it splits at the back
seam (think Incredible Hulk) and struggles out of its old shell.
The new shell, already underneath, is soft and pliable and the crab
is left naked, without protection until the new, bigger shell
hardens, about 72 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency Web site explains that young
crabs, less than an inch across, molt every three to five days;
older crabs shed only once every 20 to 50 days, depending on water
temperature and available food. But any crabber who has been plying
the waters more than a couple of years will tell you more crabs
molt just before, during and after a full moon, than at any other
time during the lunar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use the moonlight to undress,'' jokes Rich Panella of The
Cousins Fish Market in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And while that may not be entirely true, there is a little game
of seduction going on.
</P>
<P>
   Male crabs continue to grow with each molting, according to the
EPA. But the females, once sexually mature, cease growing. Instead,
as the mature female crab approaches what is called the ``terminal
molt,'' she'll secrete a pheromone to attract a male. For three or
four days before and after her shedding, the male cradles her
beneath him to protect her from harm and shares his essence to
ensure crab lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Once mating has been achieved, the female crab rides the tides
offshore to saltier waters, more conducive to hatching.
</P>
<P>
   In order to prevent shells from hardening, watermen will place
crabs that show signs of molting in tanks of shallow, brackish
water. Once the crabs have shed, they are yanked from the tank
before their shell can begin to harden, usually within four hours.
Still alive, they are packed in wet sea grass and sold.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, soft shells are shipped from South Carolina.
As spring progresses, the harvest will move up the coast into the
Chesapeake Bay, where the full moon in May marks the height of soft
shell season.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't know where they come from, you have to really
love eating soft shells in order to cook them.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the price. This season, soft shells are selling
for as much as $4.75 per crab. Fortunately, most people only eat
two crabs per serving, and if you make a soft-shell sandwich,
you'll use only one.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cleaning process, something you'd be wise to
ask the fishmonger to do if you plan on cooking and serving them
the same day. If you need to keep them longer, leave them whole,
covered with moist newspaper or wet grass and refrigerate for up to
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Soft shells are most often served battered and fried, or floured
and sauteed in butter and oil. Since both methods involve placing a
hydrated product in hot fat, two things are inevitable: smoke and
splatters. Open the windows and grab the aloe. When cooking soft
shells, odds are you'll set the smoke alarms off and burn yourself
at least once. But many people would jump in the fryer themselves
for the taste of hot, tender soft-shell crab.

</P>
<P>
   Pat the crabs dry with paper towel. In a 12-inch skillet over
medium heat, heat the oil and butter. As the oil is heating up, dip
the crabs in flour, on both sides, and shake off any excess. Saute
the crabs, shell side down, over medium heat, for 3 to 4 minutes,
averting your face from the skillet as the crabs begin to cook
because they spatter like a volcano (after a few minutes the
sputtering settles down).
</P>
<P>
   With tongs, turn the crabs over and cook for another 3 to 4
minutes or until slightly red and firm. Spread both sides of the
roll with barbecue mayonnaise, set lettuce and tomato on one side
of the bread, top it with a crab and other half of the roll.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The new one-dollar Sacagawea coins are turning up
in some boxes of breakfast cereal. And presidents Abraham Lincoln
and Alexander Hamilton are younger looking in the portraits on the
new $5 and $10 bills coming into circulation May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been changing more things in your money than has ever
been done before at any one time in history,'' said Mary Ellen
Withrow. She should know: as U.S. Treasurer, Withrow's job is to
run the U.S. Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
   Withrow, who spoke earlier this week to about 235 credit union
managers in Albany, delighted the crowd with behind-the-scenes
money tales, including stories about the designs of the $100 and
$20 bills, and the changes in store for the $10 and $5 bills.
</P>
<P>
   She recounted the biography of Sacagawea, honored on the new
dollar coin released in January. Sacagawea acted as a guide to
explorers Lewis and Clark as they traversed new American wilderness
from 1804 to 1806. Withrow said she marveled at ``a 15-year-old
girl with a 2-month-old baby, taking off with a group of men, not
knowing where her next meal was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wanted to ensure the popularity of the coin, so
it made sure the brass-copper-manganese dollar works in vending
machines. Some coins were released through Wal-Mart stores to get
into broad circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea is also showing up as a prize in some cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in every 2,000 Cheerios boxes have them,'' Withrow said.

&HT;     NETWORKS NEED TO BEND THE RULES TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here should be the first, last and only rule posted on the desk
of every network executive:
</P>
<P>
   There Are No Rules.
</P>
<P>
   No question, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' opened the door.
The problem is, the networks walked through the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on with envy at the success of the ABC mega-hit, the
other networks jumped to the obvious conclusion: We need our own
game show. They were wrong, and the shows stunk.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of ratings, ``Falcone'' _ the CBS mob drama that ran
in eight installments over nine nights _ and last Sunday's live
production of ``Fail Safe'' on the same network, are closer to the
right idea.
</P>
<P>
   The real door ``Millionaire'' host Regis Philbin kicked in is
that networks have to throw out the rigid rules that have applied
to broadcasting since the days of radio. These edicts, written by
long-dead guys from the black-and-white era, should no longer apply
_ but do _ in the Technicolor, 500-channel universe:
</P>
<P>
   _ Series shows should run just once a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miniseries are the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer is a wasteland of reruns and should be ceded to cable.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nightly formula of comedy/comedy/drama/drama can't be
juggled.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ultimate goal is trotting out shows that have the best
shot at a long run and syndication (god bless ``Wings'').
</P>
<P>
   _ Cable is an entirely different animal, with programming that
can't be replicated on the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Throw the rules out. Every one of them. Cable never had 'em, and
is now putting on much of the best _ and most talked about _
programs on television, featuring movie actors who otherwise would
not deign to do television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever (a network) broke those rules, it was a stunt or an
event,'' said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study
of Popular Television at Syracuse University. ``The network era of
what we knew is over. Cable never had to follow (those rules) in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Event television'' is now the beacon, which is fine, except
it's mostly an artificial light. Everything on television is the
``event of the season/year/generation/millennium,'' so nothing is
an event. The networks should change that. They should offer real
events, and not of the Fox ``let's blow up a jet'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a series that features the best talent from television _
or the movies: A Tom Fontana or John Sayles or Oliver Stone behind
the camera, and your pick of talent _ a Samuel L. Jackson, a
Cameron Diaz, a Kevin Kline _ in front of it. Tell these talented
people to go out and make the best television series they can.
</P>
<P>
   But they have only eight or so episodes to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. That will be the series. The absence of a long-term
(usually five-year) commitment that a regular series commands will
draw in bigger and better names. The short run and quality will
earn the show event status, which will attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the bucks: The attraction will be a chance to tell a taut
story in more time than miniseries, movies, God or Kevin Costner
allow, without having to worry about keeping the engine going _ or
shackles on _ for two, three or four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a limited, or capped, series. ``The Prisoner''
essentially did it. ``Fawlty Towers'' did it. We are not asking for
something entirely new, only the discipline needed to make it, walk
away and make it truly an ``event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation is, `Hey, let's go on,''' said Kelly Kahl, vice
president for scheduling at CBS. ``The toughest thing, as in all of
this, is fighting these rules that have been around television.
Once you have the courage to break some of these rules, a lot of
them can come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about how much more revered ``Twin Peaks'' would be had it
lasted only for that first riveting season. Same goes for ``Oz'' on
HBO. You have to know when to fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make it work,'' said Todd Lituchy, vice president of
scheduling for UPN. ``You could attract bigger talent and it could
work because you could make an event out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason why it wouldn't work,'' he added, ``is if you
couldn't find production companies to deficit-finance when they
would have a lesser chance to recoup at the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Recouping your investment through syndication, the
golden parachute for production companies.
</P>
<P>
   To do these short series, they could be packaged under an
umbrella ``franchise,'' somewhat akin to what NBC did in the 1970s
with its ``NBC Sunday Mystery Movies'' (``Columbo,'' ``McCloud,''
``McMillan and Wife'').
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more opportunity to take risks and try new shows and
new scheduling strategies,'' Lituchy said.
</P>
<P>
   Take the risks in the summer, if you want. Cable has already
eroded the currency of the moribund fall/mid-season schedule.
``There are 52 seasons,'' Thompson said. ``They are called the
weeks of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In network television, innovation has usually and understandably
come from the network lagging in the ratings. It was third-place
NBC in the early 1980s that launched the genre-shaking ``Hill
Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' It was flailing ABC that
provided ``thirtysomething,'' ``Roseanne,'' ``The Wonder Years and
``Twin Peaks'' in the late '80s and early '90s. And CBS was later
playing catch-up with quirky shows like ``Northern Exposure'' and
``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   So look to UPN _ the wrestling network _ to attempt to mix it up
next season. The network is looking at a program called ``The
Choppy Show,'' which just as aptly could be called ``The
Chopped-in-Half Show'': The live-action half-hour comedy would in
fact be two 15-minute episodes bundled together, a la cartoons like
``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are changing somewhat,'' Lituchy said. ``The
networks are looking for event programming. Programmers are not
afraid to challenge the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   And such a challenge would surely qualify as an event.
</P>

   Basters, those clever little manual cooking accessories, not
only help to make a roasting bird golden brown, but can be used for
a few other conveniences around the house as well.
</P>
<P>
   A baster is a tube with a removable rubber bulb on one end for
sucking up cooking juices to squirt over a roasting fowl, or to
remove unwanted juices or fat.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there's more than one type of plastic baster
(prices are about $3.95).
</P>
<P>
   A metal baster ($19.95) with a rubber bulb is favored by many
chefs, because it's more durable, sanitary and won't absorb juices
and discolor.
</P>
<P>
   Basters also come in tempered glass with a rubber bulb ($9.95).
</P>
<P>
   Most basters suck up fat along with flavorful juices.
Tupperware's Healthy Baster ($13.50) has a dripless tip to keep fat
and liquids separate. The baster can also be used to pour crepe
batter, to artfully drizzle sauces, syrups and other liquid
toppings on desserts, or to decorate plates.
</P>
<P>
   A metal baster (or plastic, if you keep it away from the direct
flame) can also come in handy for barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   Basters can also be used beyond the kitchen:
</P>
<P>
   _ A squirt of hot (not boiling) water can thaw the trouble area
of frozen pipe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tips maven Heloise advises using a plastic turkey baster to
dispense controlled doses of a water/fertilizer mix to houseplants.
Just be sure not to use the same baster for the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rinse soap from your baby or pet's head by controlling the
direction and flow of the water with a baster.
</P>
<P>
   Between uses, wash the baster with warm sudsy water and a small
bottle brush to keep any bacteria from growing inside the bulb or
tube.

WHEN IS A `HACKER' NOT A `CRACKER'?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am a hacker. That is to say, I enjoy playing
with computers. I am not a cracker; I don't make a practice of
breaking computer security. Columns such as yours misuse the word
``hacker,'' giving the impression that it means ``security
breaker'' and nothing else. You are giving hackers a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hacked Off
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HACKED: Face reality, friend: When people think ``hacker''
these days, they think ``bad guy.'' Language is a living, vital
thing, and words change meanings.
</P>
<P>
   And calling these weasels ``crackers'' at your little meetings
and in your newsletters is not the answer. I spend as much time _
if not more _ as you do in front of a computer, but I'd be insulted
if anybody called me a hacker. You should try coming up with a new
label, or, better yet, not even advertising the sad fact that, like
me, you spend most of your waking hours with a mouse in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I occasionally view Jennifer Lopez and other
scantily clad ladies on the Internet. I have a great fear that one
day the police will break down my door and find all the ladies on
my hard drive. What do you think? I don't download, just view.
</P>
<P>
   _ Casual Observer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OBSERVER: Even if you only view the bare naked ladies, they
are on your hard drive nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   All the graphics on a Web page, including Jennifer, are stashed
on your drive so they can be used the next time you call up that
page instead of being downloaded all over again. It's called a
browser cache.
</P>
<P>
   If you're truly worried that Janet Reno has even a passing
interest in what's in there, you can dump the contents. In Internet
Explorer, go to the Tools menu, then Internet Options. Click the
General tab, then Delete Files. In Netscape, Go to the Edit menu,
then Preferences. Select Advanced, then Cache, then Clear Disk
Cache. So long, Jennifer!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: A mark of good writing is that the reader
understands, without effort, what the writer is trying to
communicate. Using three different words to mean the same thing (in
a recent column) leads the uninformed to confusion. ``E-mail
files,'' ``photos'' and ``programs'' were all used to mean ``photo
attachments.'' When I learned composition, we learned rules that
made the intent of the writer clear to the reader. The young
editors today do not know proper composition; they pass atrocious
writing in ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Bent Out of Shape
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BENT: Sorry it took so long to respond, but none of us here
could figure out what you were trying to say. Look, diss me all you
want if you can't understand things, but lay off my copy editors.
Even so, I think we all do a pretty good job for a bunch of
uneducated huckleberries.
</P>
<P>
   And, clearly, you didn't realize that when I used three separate
phrases, I meant three separate things. I love to trick readers
like that. You know, I've always found that repetitive use of words
and phrases gives a piece of writing all the charm and vitality of
an Army training manual, but considering your penchant for
pedantry, maybe that's what you'd prefer. May I recommend ``Field
Manual FM22-5'' in lieu of this column?

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are two trends in computing of which I
have long been skeptical. The first is the so-called thin client,
in which most of the computer power resides on a server instead of
the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a first cousin to the thin client known as the
information appliance, a simplified device for sending and/or
receiving information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both concepts run counter to the way personal computing has been
developing since its start in the late 1970s. They take power away
from the end user and put it back in a central location. The end
user relies on power within the network, rather than in the power
built into the machine at his or her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   This strikes me as counter to how people _ particularly at home
_ are using their computers. Most users want more muscle at their
immediate disposal, not less.
</P>
<P>
   So when IBM invited me to get a first look at a new laboratory
devoted to using both thin clients and information appliances in a
networked home, I was intrigued. Maybe by seeing this technology in
a real-world setting, I'd become a believer.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that IBM is chanting this mantra. The company
grew to prominence in the days of the mainframe, when all computing
power was stored in hulking machines that filled entire rooms.
Humans interacted with the computer via terminals that were little
more than keyboards and monitors. There was little or no muscle in
those terminals.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed with the advent of the personal computer, of
which IBM was one of the early proponents, along with Apple and
Tandy. The original IBM PC _ the precursor to the computer found on
most desktops _ was designed by a group whose mission was to
deliberately run counter to IBM's culture. According to Paul
Carroll's excellent book ``Big Blues: The Unmaking of IBM,'' the
company's executives never felt comfortable with what they'd
created. That partly explains why they lost the lead in the PC
market to clone-makers such as Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The facility at IBM's Austin campus is dubbed the Pervasive
Computing Lab, and the idea is that computing is built into just
about everything.
</P>
<P>
   For those who've made jokes about networked refrigerators, you
can stop laughing: This lab has one.
</P>
<P>
   The lab is set up like three rooms in a home _ the living room,
kitchen and garage. In the living room is a wide-screen TV, stereo
system and a server about the size of a cassette deck. This server
communicates with the other computing devices either wirelessly or
through electrical and phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in this homelike setting is connected to the server,
from the ceiling fan in the kitchen to the Venetian blinds in the
living room to the car sitting in the garage. As just one example
of what the lab does, instead of getting up and adjusting the
blinds, you can make the adjustment with a Web page viewed on the
TV or a touchscreen next to the phone in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Want to select some music for your long commute to the office? A
Web page on the TV allows you to select a CD from your collection,
have it converted to MP3 files and then wirelessly downloaded into
the computer in your car.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite device is the refrigerator. Built into the door is a
thin-client computer that lets you synchronize family schedules,
surf the Web, browse recipes and display digitized family photos.
If your family's refrigerator looks anything like mine, you can
understand how much paper and clutter you could clean off the door
with this feature alone.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a food-storage component to this as well. You can
put a tag on each piece of food you place in the refrigerator. The
computer reads the tag and knows what it is. You can be warned when
it is no longer safe to eat _ even before it becomes fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   All the goodies in the lab were cool, though some were more
useful than others. I don't need or want to have my window blinds
controlled by a computer. On the other hand, beaming my MP3
collection to my car stereo gets a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what I saw struck me as techies designing cool devices
for other techies. And most of the equipment would be prohibitively
expensive for the vast majority of homeowners today.
</P>
<P>
   Mark F. Bregman, general manager of IBM's Pervasive Computing
initiative, agrees that people may not want everything in the lab,
but getting feedback is what the facility is all about. IBM will be
running focus groups through the simulated room to see how everyday
folks react.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from all three rooms is a full-fledged PC.
Bregman believes that, while the PC has its place, most tasks are
best handled by specialized devices, rather than one that can take
on many different functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't use a Swiss Army Knife to cook with in the kitchen,
do you?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   True. But tools like a knife are extensions of our physical
capabilities, which by definition have limitations. A PC, on the
other hand, is a tool that extends the human mind _ and thus what
it can do is limited only by our imagination. Because of that, the
PC's vast utility extends from its flexibility. It becomes whatever
you need it to be, based on the software you load into it.
</P>
<P>
   Bregman argues that the pervasive computing model is better
because it puts utility up front and maintenance in the background
where it belongs. Bregman said ``trained professionals'' will
manage the software on the back end, even uploading new
capabilities to home devices automatically as they are available _
for a fee, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? To me, IBM's current vision smacks of an attempt
to return to the days when computing was controlled by a kind of
high priest _ the technical overlords in white coats behind the
locked system-room door. I see it as an attempt to re-establish
control, wresting it back from the end user.
</P>
<P>
   It's an attempt to undo the personal computer revolution, which
IBM started reluctantly.

PREPARATION IS KEY TO KEEPING LAND MINES OUT OF LAN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My friends and I have really gotten into multiplayer games,
and we play over the Internet all the time. But it's slow (several
of us use America Online), so we'd like to get together and have a
LAN party. I figure we'll have to set up a network. Is there
anything we should know before we try this? A. I've hosted a couple
of LAN (Local Area Network) parties at my house, and recently
attended a giant one with 100 other people, and it really is a lot
of fun. You're going to have a blast.
</P>
<P>
   But you're right to wonder if there's more to a LAN party than
just setting up a network, and, of course, providing drinks and
food.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, a LAN party is people bringing their
computers to a central location, linking them in a network and
playing online games. It usually involves first-person shooters
such as Command &AMP; Conquer, Quake III Arena or Unreal Tournament,
but now that most games have multiplayer components, the trend is
growing quickly. Flight simulators, tank games, racing games or
strategy titles are all good fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Your first move should be to visit www.lanparty.com, a site
devoted to the topic. Here you'll find an excellent guide to
hosting a party. Among the points the site makes:
</P>
<P>
   Think hard about electricity. This is one of the key elements
that can blow a LAN party _ literally. Remember that a computer and
monitor draw a lot of power. Don't expect to put six or seven
computers on the same circuit in a house. Three is probably the
maximum. Be prepared to run heavy-duty extension cords to other
rooms to spread the load among various circuits. And, of course,
make sure the cords are arranged so no one will trip over them.
</P>
<P>
   If your friends are bringing their computers, make sure they
understand what is required of them. You'll need network cards in
each computer and an Ethernet cable. You'll also need a way to link
the computers, and that means you'll need a hub. If you don't own
one, you'll need to have a friend bring one, or buy one. Make sure
the hub you have has enough ports for all the computers at your
party.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure everyone has a copy of the games that will be played.
Don't rely on installing one copy of the game on all computers.
Some games have copy restrictions that check for duplicated CD keys
or serial numbers, and then won't run if more than one copy is on a
LAN.
</P>
<P>
   Your friends should not forget the little things. When bringing
their computers, they should also bring mouse pads, power cords
(someone always forgets a power cord!) and headphones. In fact,
it's a good idea to leave speakers behind, and insist on headphones
only. At large LAN parties, where it can get very noisy, that's
almost a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not a computer whiz, make sure at least one of your
friends at the party is. There are always technical problems at LAN
parties _ and you'll need someone there who lives and breathes PCs.
If no one in your group of friends meets that criterion, find
someone who does and invite him or her. Look at it as a useful way
of expanding your social circle.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that not everyone is going to want to play games all
the time, so you might have some alternatives available.

TIME TO BRUSH UP ON THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bad enough that I don't have a computer science degree; now
I'm starting to wish I'd gone to law school. Some of the most
interesting computing developments of recent months have more to do
with torts than with tech. It's not just antitrust law either; many
of the legal disputes involve questions of free-speech rights and
the limits of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Cyber Patrol case, for instance. Microsystems
Software of Framingham, Mass. makes Cyber Patrol, a program that
blocks out Internet sites that some people might find offensive.
Well, there are others who find the very existence of Cyber Patrol
offensive _ ``censorware,'' they call it. Two such ``hacktivists''
unscrambled Cyber Patrol and used their knowledge to build CPHack,
a program that reveals the sites that Cyber Patrol blocks, and that
also makes it easy to deactivate the program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsystems went to court, saying that CPHack was a violation
of its copyright, because it was created with Cyber Patrol's own
code. A federal judge in Boston has ordered pretty much everybody
on the Internet with a copy of CPHack to remove it from their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Can the judge do that? The American Civil Liberties Union says
no, announcing Wednesday that it's appealing the ruling. I wish I
could take this delightfully simple view of the matter. But to a
mind uncontaminated by legal expertise, it seems like a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   If the CPHackers had merely revealed the list of sites Cyber
Patrol blocks, they'd probably be untouchable. You can't copyright
a list of factual information _ even I know that. But do the
hackers have a right to use someone else's code to create a program
that prevents the original program from working? Isn't that a sort
of theft or vandalism?
</P>
<P>
   That one's not clear. The Boston judge, in issuing his
injunction, seemed to think this is unacceptable. But there's this
1988 case, Vault v. Quaid, that suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Vault Corp.'s program prevented software piracy, by making it
impossible to copy data from a floppy disk. Quaid Software studied
Vault's program and used that knowledge to write software that
defeated the Vault system. And guess what? A federal court said
Quaid's software was A-OK, even though it effectively destroyed
Vault's business. I can see why the ACLU appealed the Cyber Patrol
injunction. Odd though it might seem to my untrained mind, the
CPHackers could yet win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more such litigation ahead too, as other
hacktivists use their programming skills to protest various
corporate practices. We'll probably hear a lot about a group called
RTMark, best known for an international Internet campaign to shut
down the popular toy retailing Web site eToys.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that eToys had found out about an arts Web site called
etoy.com, and demanded that the site change its name. But etoy.com
had been founded years before eToys came along, and said it had
every right to its Internet domain name. eToys got a federal judge
to issue an injunction against its tiny adversary. But outraged
RTMark members publicly vowed to launch hacker attacks against
eToys during the 1999 Christmas shopping season, to crash the site
and punish the company for its arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, but all the bad publicity forced eToys to back
down. Score one for the good guys, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   But if RTMark had roasted eToys' servers, wouldn't that be a
crime? After all, the FBI is still chasing the vandals who recently
shut down some of the world's biggest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think we can get away with it, we do it, yeah,'' says
RTMark spokesman Ray Thomas _ not his real name, by the way. ``The
legality of it is really a touchy issue.'' Because RTMark has never
been taken to court over an Internet sabotage campaign, Thomas says
it is willing to consider launching more acts of civil
disobedience, aimed at the overwhelming power of greedy
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``electrohippies,'' a group bitterly opposed
to genetically modified food crops. They're currently recruiting
volunteers to help them launch crippling attacks on corporate Web
sites beginning next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hacktivists still seem to believe the old myth that Internet
technology will always keep them a step ahead of the laws. Bill
Gates has lately learned otherwise, and so will these lads, in
time. I'd better get used to reading legal briefs. I expect to see
quite a few of them.

&HT;     A GREAT SURVIVOR OF THE GREAT QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``During the 1906 earthquake and fire I was only
2 years old, so I don't remember it, but my family told me about
it,'' Bessie Shum said.
</P>
<P>
   We were about a block from where the family's home stood before
the earthquake, in Shum's neat little Chinatown apartment crammed
with pictures of her family, which includes eight grandchildren and
eight great-grandchildren, the latest born just three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   What family stories they'll hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had bound feet, do you know what that means?'' Shum
said. ``Her feet were very small and she had trouble walking, but
my father said, `No time to pack anything.' We walked over to Van
Ness, and later went to Oakland on the ferry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bessie Shum will be the first Chinese-American
earthquake survivor to attend the annual gathering of survivors at
Lotta's Fountain on Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's an ordinary person, but what a life she's led
since her parents took her away from their devastated home near
Portsmouth Square.
</P>
<P>
   One of Shum's photographs from an unidentified San Francisco
newspaper shows young Bessie Wong (her maiden name) baking biscuits
at the YWCA to raise money for Herbert Hoover's relief fund for
European children displaced in World War I. The headline is
``Biscuits, China Style.''
</P>
<P>
   Shum, whose grandfather came to California with the Gold Rush to
work on rail lines, was reared in a family steeped in newspapering
and Chinese reform politics.
</P>
<P>
   She helped found the Chinatown women's service organization, the
Square and Circle, to raise relief money for the 1924 floods in
Canton. Shum and her friends started with a 10-cent raffle. Now
they raise money for many causes, including college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a chance to go to college,'' she said. ``I
worked all my life to support my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, she married Edward Shum, a graduate of New York
University, in a military ceremony. A picture on her wall shows the
bride and groom walking under the crossed swords of Army cadets.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a citizen and when they moved to China in 1931, she
lost her U.S. citizenship. During the Japanese-Chinese war, she had
to leave her husband and three children with relatives in China,
return to San Francisco and get naturalized as a citizen, while
submitting affidavit after affidavit to get her family back to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   All the while she worked two jobs as a waitress to send money
back to them. When her kids finally arrived, she worked as a
nightclub waitress so she could be with the kids during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sailors and soldiers came and danced at the
nightclub, and they always dropped dollars on the floor,'' the
96-year-old said playfully. ``You don't know who dropped the money,
so I kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper clip Shum keeps is from a 1963 issue of the
San Francisco Examiner. It's an article by Frank Herbert (who later
became famous for the science-fiction novel ``Dune'') about her
father, Wong Bock Yue.
</P>
<P>
   Wong returned from Oakland and San Jose with the family after
the earthquake. He worked at the Sing Fat Co. import house, then
became an aide to the Chinese revolutionary Dr. Sun Yat Sen when
Sun moved to San Francisco. Wong became publisher of the Young
China newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun asked my father to recruit men to raise money to go back
to China and topple the Manchu dynasty,'' she said. ``At that time
we had discrimination and the Chinese Exclusion Act. He could send
this paper to Chinese all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Shum if there still is discrimination against Chinese.
She leaned toward me, nodded seriously and said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   If many leading San Franciscans had had their way after the
earthquake, Wong Bock Yue and his family never would have come back
to Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese earthquake refugees like Bessie Shum's
family made their way to Oakland. Chinatown was looted by National
Guardsmen, and civic leaders like Abe Ruef and James Phelan talked
about ``the Chinese problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, Chinatown had been leveled and they wanted the
valuable land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, they wanted to put the Chinese in Hunters Point,''
said historian Him Mark Lai of the Chinese Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese returned to rebuild businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Even in death, the Chinese didn't get any respect. In 1980,
historians Gladys Hansen and Deanna Paoli Gumina compiled the names
of the earthquake dead for the San Francisco Archives. They
questioned the official 1907 casualty lists of 674 dead and
missing: ``With the complete destruction of Chinatown, it is
difficult to believe that only 12 Oriental names appear on the
compiled list of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese earthquake experience was even unhappier than the
experience of other nationalities, so it's understandable why
survivors haven't commemorated its anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was one of the big anniversaries of the earthquake, we
tried to find some (Chinese) survivors,'' said Manny Liu, director
of the Chinese Cultural Center, ``but we couldn't find any.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we have one, and what a survivor she is.
</P>
<P>
   We stood looking at the walls covered with pictures of her
children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is,'' Bessie Shum said. ``One family gives me
pictures, another gives me pictures. If I don't put them all up,
you know what happens.''
</P>

NET GIVES SINGLES A SCREENING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATRICIA WEN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falling in love has never been rational. Humphrey Bogart just
couldn't resist Lauren Bacall's sharp blue-green eyes. For
Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy was ``irresistible'' at first
sight.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, millions of single Americans, many already tied
to their computers for most of their working hours, are taking a
rational approach as they seek love via the magic of modems. And
besides, who's got the time now for person-to-person courting?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new phenomenon. But if the volume of people seeking
companionship via the Internet even approaches the numbers claimed
by online dating companies, it indicates the industry is evolving
from a fringe lonely hearts business to a legitimate Web service.
It could also upend society's unwritten rules about how people
meet, mingle, and couple. For one thing, it's a world where
spelling, punctuation, and grammar, not clothes, can make the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral as this all sounds, many singles say it's an efficient
way to screen others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more information about the person before
meeting,'' said Ethan Brown, 28, a lawyer from Weston. ``You can
e-mail them and correspond for a while. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown met Jodi Constantine, 29, a postdoctorate researcher at
Harvard, through Boston-based People2People.com, and they've been
dating for six months.
</P>
<P>
   People2People, and two other big sites, Match.com and
Matchmaker.com, boast of anywhere from 1 million to 4 million
members each, hooking thousands more each day with free trial
offers. Industry officials say most members are young professionals
in their 20s and 30s without the time to look for other singles in
bars or other places they might gather, and older never-marrieds,
divorced, or widowed men and women who don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-dating is more intellectual than physical, more rational
than emotional, yet some say more intimate. In most cases, members
type and edit their mini-biographies (including data such as age,
hometown, religion, education, and sometimes income level), as well
as write a short essay.
</P>
<P>
   Using fictitious code names, they also enter qualities they want
in their would-be lovers. Few are bold enough to offer a picture.
The computer synthesizes the data, then delivers ``matches,'' often
hundreds within a short distance from where the member lives.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sites claim a formidable success rate, others think
people like Brown and Constantine just got lucky. Some
psychologists and sociologists who study romance don't see e-dating
as a promising method. First, early on, there's no context of voice
or accent, face or expression. In anonymous exchanges, it's easy to
lie. And the mind doesn't always know what the heart wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flies in the face of how romance works,'' said Thomas
Lewis, a psychiatrist and co-author of a book, ``A General Theory
of Love,'' published this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know what they want,'' said Lewis, who is
also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the
University of California in San Francisco. ``They may put in the
criteria that matches what their thinking brain says, but their
emotional brain operates with a different set of operation
instructions that are not rational.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lewis talks about three sections of the brain: the
``reptilian brain'' that makes the heart beat and blood flow, the
``neo-cortex brain'' that does the intellectual work and scheming,
and the ``limbic brain'' that is full of irrational emotion and
guides our choices in love.
</P>
<P>
   He said the limbic brain is shaped at an early age, affected
largely by our childhood experiences about what types of looks,
smells, gestures, strides, and expressions we grew up with and are
now likely to respond to on a visceral level. Humans often don't
know what their limbic brain wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't we often surprised when we're attracted to someone who
doesn't match what's on our predetermined list?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but some singles contend they have some
non-negotiable requirements in a romantic partner, and computer
power can be harnessed to screen and sort out these demands.
Perhaps someone only wants a Christian, a nonsmoker, or someone who
wants more children. Many sites also offer matches for gay men and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   If the information in the Match.com database is accurate, most
members are open to meeting a wide variety of people. However,
opportunities shrink for older women and shorter men, which is the
brutal truth of the dating scene in general.
</P>
<P>
   Singles who use these on-line sites say this method differs from
print personal ads or singles clubs, the popularity of which has
also exploded in recent years, because there's generally a
prolonged period of e-mail exchanges before real names are given,
phone numbers exchanged, or meetings set up.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of executives at Match.com, the Boston Globe
entered a number of fictitious profiles to gauge what sort of
people the company's members were looking for. None of the matches
were followed up with correspondence to members.
</P>
<P>
   A fictitious woman, for example, seeking to date men within 25
miles of her home got anywhere from 350 to 500 ``matches.'' (That's
when both sides matched each other's criteria not all, but most of
the time.)
</P>
<P>
   That high hit rate held steady whether our lady was 25 or 45,
went from being agnostic to Christian to Jewish to Buddhist, turned
from Caucasian to African-American to Asian, or transformed from
heavy to slim.
</P>
<P>
   Her prospects dropped when she turned 50, however, she still
pulled 180 matches.
</P>
<P>
   A fictitious bachelor also got anywhere from 300 to 500 matches
under a similar variety of scenarios. What began to diminish a
man's chances was the issue of height. Still, a guy who was 5 feet
4 inches got about 150 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned members, however, say information in profiles _ even
pictures _ can be unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old man who works in medical sales said he once met a
woman through JDate.com, a site for Jewish singles, who didn't look
anything like her picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `By the way, I've gained 20 pounds since my
picture,' '' said the man, who gave his name only as Marc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge level of editorial shaping,'' said David
Givens, an anthropologist who runs the nonprofit Center for
Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash. ``That's the danger with words.
They're conscious and you can manipulate them. Face-to-face, you
might be able to choose your clothing or hairstyle. But otherwise,
you're there. It's you.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaping image through the written word can have its benefits,
said a 49-year-old single mother, who asked to remain anonymous.
She likes the chance to take the time to express in writing who she
is, though she acknowledges that this method favors the highly
literate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw me at bar, you wouldn't walk in and say, `Wow!' ''
said the woman, who is also a therapist. ``But I can write a letter
that will make you say, `Wow!' It allows me to show how I think,
how I write, and how I react to things.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, the biggest downside of Web matchmaking sites is that
two people become vulnerable to quick intimacy, within the romantic
``confessional booth'' of private e-mail exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, a sociology professor at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, who specializes in technology's effects on human
behavior, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give someone small amounts of written information, the
other person will construct the rest,'' she said. ``Then when the
two meet, there's this sense you already know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Most singles say cyber-matchmaking works best if participants
are aware of its pitfall and use it as an extra, not only, method
of meeting people. There's no shortcut to love, said James Gleick,
a journalist and author of ``Faster,'' which focuses on today's
technology-driven hurried life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sizing someone up is always time-consuming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in e-dating, different prejudices are at play. Said Lori
Orleck, a 38-year-old single woman: ``If someone has misspelled
words or bad grammar, I won't even look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   When rejection occurs, cyber-dating offers new ways of turning
people away. You don't have to give a stammering excuse or turn
your back.
</P>
<P>
   One side hits the ``delete'' button instead of ``reply,'' and
the other side, perhaps mercifully, reads on the computer screen,
``No messages.''

 &HT;    INTERNET PRIVACY PROVES DIVISIVE ISSUE ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement and civil liberties groups sparred
Thursday over how to balance the battle against cybercrime and the
need to protect individual privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution, the two sides agreed that federal laws must be
updated to reflect Information Age realities, but offered opposite
advice on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of the same information individuals formerly kept in
their homes, file cabinets, wallets and purses gravitates toward
new locations on the Internet's landscape, Congress must consider
whether the government adequately protects Fourth Amendment
values,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. the subcommittee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see laws that have not been updated in many years not being
used in ways that protect citizens under the Fourth Amendment,''
said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, ratified in 1791, provides for ``the right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects,
against unreasonable search and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, it is easier for the government to snoop through a
couple's private e-mails to one another than it is for the
government to listen into the very same conversations if they take
place on the phone,'' said Gregory Nojeim, a legislative counsel
for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that Americans are at risk of losing control of their
personal data, Nojeim added: ``As businesses and schools scramble
to stay apace of rapidly evolving technologies, Congress must jump
in and ensure that our privacy laws are not made obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Di Gregory, a deputy assistant attorney general,
called for more investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When law enforcement successfully investigates, apprehends and
prosecutes a criminal who has stolen a citizen's personal
information from a computer system, (we) are undeniably working to
protect privacy and deter further privacy violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of
America, agreed, noting that ``if the government is unable to
protect us, our institutions and our economy from criminal
activity, then many of the rights we hold so dear, including the
right to privacy, may be little more than a hollow promise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New economy'' companies are being caught in the middle of the
struggle, according to Nicole Wong, an attorney who represents such
clients as Dell Computer, Yahoo!, General Electric and the Los
Angeles Times on matters of Internet law for San Francisco-based
Perkins Coie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cyberspace we must recognize that the traditional notion of
'place' and 'possession' do not exist in a network of computers
that function on the basis of sharing and passing along data,''
Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most users would argue that the bank statements, personal
correspondence, personal calendars and address books are personal
and private and should be accorded the same degree of protection
from government intrusion as if those 'papers and effects' were
kept in the home,'' she concluded.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BILL MULLER   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE &QL; 
movie-list.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching those trailers while people are still finding
their seats and rattling their popcorn bags? Then Movie-List is for
you. The site features theatrical trailers for all the hot movies
coming out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers trailers and so-called teasers (shorter versions
of the trailer) in Quicktime. They are available in high-resolution
or low-resolution formats, depending on the speed of your
connection and how long you want to wait for a download.
</P>
<P>
   Recent additions to the site include trailers for ``The Hollow
Man,''which features Kevin Bacon as a not-so-nice invisible man,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary about the British punk
band the Sex Pistols, and ``Dinosaur,'' a Disney film about
prehistoric creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There also is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a new John Travolta flick
based on an L. Ron Hubbard book and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' the
remake of the '70s movie of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage
and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   So, grab some popcorn and soda, and take a gander. &QL; 
 &UR; MAGAZINE REVIEWS &QL; 
``BOY'S LIFE'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL; 
 &UR; ``ESQUIRE'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL; 
 &UR; ``OUTSIDE'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth
picking up for story on the ``Surf Chimp,'' a long-armed surfer
dude named Jeff Hakman who dominated his sport, founded a
multimillion-dollar surfwear company and then lost it all to a
heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno
stuff _ phones, pagers, Iridium satellites _ when you head out to
the wilderness, so you can forget about civilization. What was that
again? &QL; 
 &UR; ``REASON'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's
innocent, but because he's an expert at managing the news and
handling internal crises. Interesting piece offers ``a five-step
program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever.

<P>
   It used to be you paid a fixed price for frozen fish sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hated haggling. And supermarket clerks certainly
couldn't offer 20 cents off at the checkout counter.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, America _ long the landscape of fixed prices _
is turning negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Name your price online, and you could pay less for the fish than
on triple-coupon day. The same goes for paper towels, cars, and
mortgage rates _ and it's not just on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Dial your long-distance carrier and get a deal on calls to Japan
by playing a little hardball. If you walk into a chain electronics
store and appear undecided over a video camera, it may suddenly get
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Once limited to flea markets and car dealerships, bargaining for
everyday items such as toothpaste and televisions is slowly going
mainstream, specialists say. The popular Priceline.com is even
entertaining bids to fill up your gas tank this spring.
</P>
<P>
   US consumers, long believed to suffer from shyness, guilt, or
just plain awkwardness when engaged in face-to-face dickering,
don't seem to mind it at all when it's anonymous. Or when it's with
huge conglomerates that increasingly sell everything from blue
jeans to compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new way of bargaining, we don't usually have to look
someone in the eye and say, `I don't want to pay this price.' It's
the anonymity of the Web and the anonymity of these large, faceless
corporations we deal with that makes it easier,'' said Mary Lou
Roberts, a professor of pricing and e-commerce at University of
Massachusetts at Boston. ``It's an impersonal setting. It makes all
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The distaste for face-to-face haggling is never more apparent
than when buying a car, at the very least making some uncomfortable
while striking fear in others.
</P>
<P>
   To counter those experiences, car makers including Saturn have
begun offering fixed-priced cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the interaction with (car) salesmen. I don't feel
like I get a good deal. I wouldn't trust them,'' said Denise
Mowles, a mother who in the past has successfully bargained with
big retail outfits for a cheaper TV and video camera. Now, she bids
and shops online for everything from Beanie Babies to Disney
clothes for her children.
</P>
<P>
   The new, online bargaining, however, is a strange, slower-paced
back and forth compared to the bargain banter that defines Turkish
bazaars. Shoppers often submit isolated bids for products and must
wait to hear back. Sometimes they don't get a second chance. Other
sites actually play let's make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. Once, the American marketplace
pulsated with the same one-on-one negotiating that was the hallmark
of souks, or markets, in the Middle East, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The American general store changed that in the 1800s.
Manufacturers wanted to make sure they got full price for their
goods _ even if someone else was selling them. Selling became
standardized. The supermarket was born.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have always been price-conscious, they often
saved bargaining for high-ticket items such as houses and cars, and
clipped coupons and shopped on discount days for other items. Even
now, in a flush economy, consumers always want the best deal. In
supermarkets and chain drug stores, consumers can get what they
want _ exactly when they want it. No dickering over cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American citizen likes to get things quickly. We
want instant gratification,'' said Bruce Weinberg, assistant
professor of marketing and e-commerce at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   While make-a-deal, bidding, auction, and electronic negotiating
sites have helped fuel it, the bargaining craze started pre-Web,
marketing specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this competitive intensity now,'' said Kathleen
Seiders, marketing professor at Babson College. Many industry
monopolies have been dismantled, and competition for customers has
become fierce. And there are many places to get the same products.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, while the bargaining has yet to hit places like
Filene's or Parade of Shoes, it is happening in chain stores or
companies selling highly competitive items such as electronics or
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   So while the sale of the century may not be listed in the shop
window, employees are more free to offer a discount to customers
who need a little push to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, what do you have to lose when you bargain against a
listed price?
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse thing that can happen is you pay the fixed price,''
Seiders said.
</P>
<P>
   All that means, bargainers and specialists say, is that
consumers are realizing the power of their pocketbook. And for
some, doing it anonymously gives them even more confidence. They
can walk away. They can be the tough customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went to a mom-and-pop store, they would care if you
came back. You'd treat them a little differently because they
really need you,'' Mowles said.
</P>
<P>
   In big stores and online ``it's not personal,'' she said.

PROFESSOR SUES OVER ONLINE PERSONAL ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TANYA SCHEVITZ   
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ College students have long dished dirt about
professors, warning their classmates about whom they should avoid.
While the practice may have ruffled a few academic feathers, it has
been seen mostly as an innocuous part of campus life.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Internet. Now that such student
critiques have gone online, the practice has started a controversy
over free speech and libel that could have effects far beyond the
ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   At the City College of San Francisco, an English professor who
was the object of some particularly vicious written attacks by
students has filed a lawsuit that challenges the entire notion of
the Internet as a forum for unfettered speech.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Curzon Brown, an openly gay author, has been called
``homomanic,'' ``racist'' and ``mentally ill'' on the
 &UR; teacherreview.com  &LR; Web site, which posts anonymous reviews of
teachers at the college. Other professors have been the subject of
sexually explicit stories.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, scheduled to go to trial in San Francisco Superior
Court on Wednesday, is an attempt to shut down the Web site. ``It
is wrong. It is evil. I don't see how anyone can justify it,''
Curzon Brown said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has attracted the attention of the American Civil
Liberties Union and Internet experts, who have lined up behind Ryan
Lathouwers, the 27-year-old former computer science student who
started the site in 1997 as a way for students to find classes best
suited for them.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU staff attorney Ann Brick said the future of the Internet as
a free and open means of exchanging views may hinge on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment means that sometimes feelings get hurt,''
Brick said. ``The value in preserving those freedoms far outweighs
the harm of hurt feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, she noted, is ``just full of'' bulletin boards and
chat rooms where opinions are exchanged. ``You are not going to
have those on the Internet if the creator of those forums are at
risk of being held liable for what is posted.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that the Internet is not subject to the rules
of libel and defamation that govern newspapers. In the 1996
Communications Decency Act, Congress gave Internet service
providers immunity from liability to encourage them to police their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to induce people to be willing to (remove
objectionable material), we need to offer them immunity,'' said
Pamela Samuelson, professor of information management at Boalt Hall
School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lathouwers should fall under the law because he is
essentially providing an Internet service. But how the court
interprets his role in this case could set the precedent for small
Web sites, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important for public discourse that little guys
who run sites are not chilled out of the picture,'' Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lathouwers, who is now working at an Internet startup in
Sausalito, defended his Web site. ``I'm just a conduit for student
opinion,'' he said. ``People have a right to express their
opinions. The opinions are not always positive.''
</P>
<P>
   City College was also named in the suit because the site can be
reached from its Web page. Chancellor Phillip R. Day Jr. said the
college would not close down the Web site, even though it has the
power to do so, because of First Amendment concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Day said, he is working with Lathouwers on a system
that will maintain anonymity while verifying that only students who
have studied with a professor are submitting the reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The college is also developing its own site, which would provide
detailed information about professors to help students choose
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the college's 1,750 professors refuse to get
involved, Curzon Brown has support among some colleagues, including
the head of the English department and a physics professor who was
deluged with poor reviews and saw enrollment in his courses drop
after he criticized the site.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has roiled City College, a community college with 10
campuses across San Francisco. Students bicker about the merits of
the postings, and meetings about how to deal with the site
degenerate into hostile debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jesykah Forkash, 20, a student in Curzon Brown's English class,
said she did not agree that it should be used for personal attacks
but said it is ``totally valuable'' and has been accurate about
every teacher from whom she has taken a class.
</P>
<P>
   But Justine Heinze Giardello, 18, whose father is a professor at
the University of San Francisco, said students do not understand
how hard professors work. Students should not be able to bash
teachers in a forum that is out there for the world to see, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is horrible,'' she said. ``How would we feel if
there was a student review judging us on a personal basis?''
</P>
<P>
   Cady Eearnest, 18, said she does not agree with the ugly reviews
of Curzon Brown, who has been attacked as egotistical and abrasive.
``We have very interesting discussions. The papers are good, and he
is a fair grader,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Curzon Brown said the battle has worn him down. It
has created an atmosphere, he said, in which professors are
hesitant to uphold standards for fear that students who receive
poor grades will vilify them on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm depressed and I'm afraid,'' said Curzon Brown, who has
taught at City College for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lathouwers should be held responsible for what is posted
on the site, just as a newspaper publisher would be held liable for
printing libelous statements.
</P>

THANKS TO STAKE IN A DOT.COM, THE ROYAL PORTFOLIO IS THRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With regal insouciance, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
rode this week's dot.com roller-coaster, held on to her stake and
emerged as one of her land's newest Internet millionaires Friday
when an Internet company she backed went public.
</P>
<P>
   Her $160,000, 1.5 percent stake in Getmapping.com PLC soared
almost ten-fold in paper value to beyond $1.56 million _ just shy
of 1 million pounds _ when the company began trading on the
Alternative Investment Market with an initial offer price of $3.20,
closing at around $3.60.
</P>
<P>
   The queen chose to invest in Getmapping.com after the company _
which plans to produce the first full aerial map of her realm _ was
permitted to dedicate to her replicas of the Domesday Book, ordered
by William the Conqueror around 1086 as a survey of all the lands
in England.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, not quite the accepted thing to discuss Her
Majesty's wealth. ``The position as far as this is concerned is
that we never give details of the queen's portfolio because it
would lead to commercial endorsement,'' said Penny Russell-Smith, a
Buckingham Palace spokeswoman. But all indications were that
Friday's profits were little more than a dot.com on the landscape
of her personal wealth, which was estimated recently by The Sunday
Times of London at $440 million _ excluding priceless art works.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Getmapping.com said the queen's stake had been
worth some $1.39 million at the offer price, and had closed at a
12.5 premium. Tristram Cary, Getmapping.com's chief executive, said
the company had sought a ``sensible'' offering price after recent
swings in technology stocks. One closely watched British Internet
stock, Lastminute.com, was offered with much fanfare at around
$6.08 recently but plummeted and was trading Friday at $3.84.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Getmapping.com says it has so far mapped 85 percent of Britain
and plans to make a profit by selling aerial maps to real estate
companies and local government offices. It also wants to create
three-dimensional games that will permit internet users to simulate
a flight around Britain. It plans to use the proceeds from its
share offering to develop its Web site and start aerial mapping of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's interest in the company has inspired newspaper
reports that she is an avid user of the Web, but Buckingham Palace
has sought to play down the idea of the 73-year-old monarch
spending time on the computer. However, she does have her own Web
site _ www.royal.gov.uk _ launched in 1997 to provide news and
biographies of the royal family, Russell-Smith said.

 &HT;    FOR MICROSOFT, THE ROAD AHEAD LOOKS MORE DIFFICULT
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia,
happened to walk by a meeting room Wednesday where Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates was defending his company's behavior over lunch
with a clutch of Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard who was visiting, Byrd quipped, ``Send him to see
me with his checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd recalls the time Gates spent as a Senate page, only a few
years before he co-founded Microsoft, now the world's biggest
software firm. Down the road, Gates, still the world's richest man
despite last week's steep selloff in Microsoft stock, could be
obliged to write some big corporate checks, although not to Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The checks might cover a stiff criminal fine if U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decides to include monetary penalties
among the remedies in the punishment phase of the federal antitrust
trial against Microsoft. That phase is the last remaining piece of
litigation before the historic case is appealed, presumably all the
way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may be necessary to cover the triple damages that
Microsoft could be forced to pay as fallout from hundreds of civil
lawsuits that could expose the software giant to more than $7
billion in damages, according to legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Intel, Netscape Communications Corp., now part of America
Online Inc., and Sun Microsystems are among the firms Jackson said
were wronged by Microsoft. All could sue Microsoft for damages and
rely heavily on the government's case to prove their own case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these lawsuits, the government has already done 90
percent of the legwork,'' noted University of Baltimore School of
Law professor Bob Lande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Judge Jackson has issued a judgment on the findings
of fact, they potentially become legally significant in our case,''
said Dan Small, a partner with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll.
The Washington-based firm is striving to coordinate many of the 120
suits filed to date and lawsuits and consolidate them into larger
class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the judicial onslaught and the further dangers it
poses for Microsoft, Gates &AMP; Co. continue to take a confident,
almost defiant stand, maintaining the company will be vindicated in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when Gates visited Capitol Hill and the White
House _ at one point driving by the federal courthouse where
Jackson was meeting with both sides to map out the next steps in
the case _ he issued a letter to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was co-signed by Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully disagree with the court's ruling, and
ultimately believe the American justice system will affirm _ as it
has in the past _ that Microsoft's actions have been both lawful
and good for consumers,'' the letter read.
</P>
<P>
   That key point was reinforced on the following day by William
Neukom, Microsoft's dapper executive vice president and chief
counsel, who sat at the head of the defense table during the 76-day
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable in our position to bring the case to the
appellate court. ... We like our prospects,'' Neukom told the
litigation section of the American Bar Association's annual meeting
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   First, Neukom is scheduled to spend at least one more day next
month in Jackson's courtroom while the company's top hired
litigator, John Warden, presses Jackson to mitigate the punishment
Microsoft faces for having broken the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   But the government lawyers, seated at the prosecution table,
will hold the high cards at the May 24 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, in line with the scorching ``findings of fact''
Jackson issued last November, the judge is fully persuaded that
Microsoft has behaved as predatory monopoly. The evidence, Jackson
has held, amply demonstrates a pattern of abuse in which Microsoft
has done violence to the competitive process and placed ``an
oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the company's past conduct, the Justice Department and
the 19 states that joined it in the action view Microsoft as a
repeat offender that cannot be trusted. As the courtroom drama
moves on to consider remedies, that same lack of trust is sure to
lead them demand severe and far-reaching penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that any antitrust remedy in a monopoly case has to
be forward-looking, because otherwise you would forever be playing
catch-up,'' says Justice Dept. antitrust chief Joel Klein.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of antitrust cases in the past in which
the government has imposed forward-looking remedies. ``The relief
does not have to be confined to the exact offenses,'' said
Brookings Institution scholar Robert Litan, a former federal
antitrust official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that settlement talks have broken down, we are back to
square one. I would be surprised if the government didn't ask for
some form of structural relief,'' said Stephen Houck, who served as
lead lawyer for the states before returning to private practice
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In pronouncing his sentence, Jackson no doubt will address the
core issue raised in his ``conclusions of law'': The leveraging of
Microsoft's Windows operating system monopoly to foreclose
potential competition, stifle innovation and gouge consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is also under pressure to apply these remedies in a
way that will preserve Microsoft's ability to innovate in one of
the most dynamic sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Jackson will examine the final settlement package
presented by the government and rejected by Microsoft, which has
been handed over to the court under seal.
</P>
<P>
   They call upon Microsoft to stop pricing Windows in ways that
favor cooperative personal computer makers, to stop tying its
products to Windows in its sales contracts, to set aside all
exclusionary contracts, and to stop driving sales up by raising the
price of older versions of Windows whenever a new version comes
out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's settlement offer, Microsoft would also
have had to publish a version of Windows without its Internet
Explorer browser and to make available the programming details of
new versions of its system to outsiders at the same time as they
became available to its own applications developers.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the proposals in the proposed settlement is
that they are essentially backward-looking, and therefore unlikely
to stimulate new competition. Anything short of an outright breakup
would also almost certainly require permanent and intrusive
policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, the facts of this case were outdated before
the case even began,'' said Jonathan Zuck, president of the
Washington-based Association for Technology, whose list of 6,000
corporate members is headed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the litigation, it is also evident that
hand-held devices, smart cell phones and so-called information
appliances, including sophisticated game-playing machines, are
increasingly rendering the personal computer merely one of many
ways to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They all represent, to varying degrees, shifts in products and
services. Microsoft is an actor in all these fields, but does not
dominate them.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the situation poses a business challenge. For the
courts, however, struggling to solve an antitrust issue without
unduly harming the economy, the challenge could prove to be even
deeper.

HAND-HELD SYSTEMS TEMPT NEWS-HUNGRY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ This is a city ravenous for news and mobile
communications, with more than a half-dozen national newspapers and
nearly half the population owning cellular phones. So the prospect
of devices that can deliver news to the palm of one's hand is
making the English downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is so much pent-up demand for the new generation
of cellular phones offering Internet access based on the Wireless
Access Protocol, or WAP, that Vodafone AirTouch PLC, the world's
largest mobile-phone operator, has a waiting list for the phones
that may take months to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has long been the leader of the cellular-telephone
revolution. In some countries, over 60 percent of the population
have wireless phones, compared with only about 25 percent in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it comes to Internet access at home, Europe has been
the laggard. And while hand-held devices like the Palm Pilot have
taken off in the United States, Europeans have been slower to adopt
them.
</P>
<P>
   But mobile Internet access is a completely new game on both
sides of the Atlantic. U.S. cellular operators are offering an
array of mobile Internet options, though the offerings are based on
a hodgepodge of technologies. But in Europe, where all mobile
phones are based on a continent-wide standard called GSM, mobile
Internet access is limited so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of services have rolled out really quickly in the
U.S.,'' said Noah Yasskin, an analyst for the research firm of
Jupiter Communications in London. ``In Europe, everyone's waiting
for the phones and the standards. When it does roll out, it will be
really big because of the unified standards and the number of
people who use mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and other information providers are rushing to format
their content for mobile phones and to negotiate deals for
placement on the phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a lot of negotiations for WAP content,'' said Mike
Caldwell, a spokesman for Vodafone, who himself owns a WAP-enabled
mobile phone with links to the BBC and The Independent newspaper.
``We believe WAP is going to be big by next Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested a technical transition was responsible for the slow
rollout of interactive services on mobile telephones. Caldwell
compared the situation to Europe's changeover from analog cellular
service to the digital GSM format in December 1991. ``You couldn't
get a phone until a year later,'' he said. ``People said GSM stood
for God Send Mobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current delays can be traced to a bug in some of the
early Nokia WAP phones that Vodafone ordered. ``There was a glitch
in the first batch,'' he said. ``So we returned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Access Protocol will give users access to Internet
sites specially formatted for the small screens of mobile phones.
Headlines, sports scores and listings are being developed for the
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, predicted that WAP phones would
supplement, rather than replace, other types of Internet access.
``The mobile screen is so small that you are not talking about a
rich media experience,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An information delivery system that has already caught on in
Europe and is expected to grow is SMS, a text-based messaging
service. The service was initially developed so telephone users
could send each other quick text messages like those on pagers.
Recently, though, companies have begun developing commercial
applications for the service, like sending users news headlines and
movie listings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the SMS messaging capacity is already built into phones
that use the GSM standard, it is likely to remain a popular
function even after the introduction of WAP, Yasskin predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With so much information to deliver and so little screen space
to deliver it to, it is unclear whether advertising banners like
those on the Web will support the new hand-held ventures. So who is
going to pay for it all?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question,'' Yasskin said.

SHOULD MICROSOFT'S FATE BE IN PRIVATE HANDS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a federal judge ruling last week that Microsoft repeatedly
violated the law, the government has the easy part of the antitrust
case behind it. The real policy challenge comes now: what are the
right remedies?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's ruling came because of the breakdown of four months
of settlement talks _ mediated by Judge Richard A. Posner, a
federal jurist who is regarded as one of the leading thinkers on
antitrust _ in which the two sides could not agree on the
appropriate remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University, has a novel
recommendation for the government. ``Just declare victory and walk
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very effective means of dealing with the Microsoft
problem _ our system of private litigation,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and co-author of the
original flat-tax proposal in the early 1980s, Hall is a
conservative who believes antitrust laws are essential rules for
the health of free-market capitalism. He advised the Justice
Department's antitrust division on an earlier Microsoft case and is
also a respected economist who has been mentioned as a candidate
for the Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Hall believes Microsoft's main offense was its restrictive
contracts and behavior, which artificially raised the barrier to
entry by potential challengers to Microsoft. He has devised a
method for measuring the damage the company's behavior caused to
consumers, and he explained his approach in a paper presented at
the American Economic Association's annual conference in January.
</P>
<P>
   Using rough assumptions, the Hall paper concluded the economic
damage from Microsoft's practices amounted to overcharging about
$10 for each copy of its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hall said the overcharge calculation could well
be higher, depending on what assumptions are used, so the total
damage caused by Microsoft's practices in recent years could be
more than $7 billion. And that is before the triple damages called
for in private antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you charge Microsoft three times the cost of the harm, it
is a huge disincentive to engaging in the same kind of
anticompetitive conduct ever again,'' said Hall, who added he has
no interest in serving as an expert witness in any of the private
suits against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, a former justice department official who is
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said
that if the government followed Hall's modest proposal, it would be
an ``utter abdication of governmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The government does not bring antitrust suits to prepare the
ground for private litigants, he said, but to ensure remedial steps
are taken to stop illegal behavior by a monopolist and prevent it
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Litan said he had doubts about how well the private
litigants will do against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Microsoft is ready to fight a major war in the private
cases,'' he said. ``Its experts will argue that there is no proof
that consumers suffered from Microsoft's conduct. And there is not
a lot of evidence in the government's case of the current damage
that consumers suffered.''

MAGAZINE INTENDS TO GROW WITH THE INTERNET ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By COURTNEY KANE  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when swings in technology stocks are feeding a debate
about the Internet economy, The Industry Standard, a magazine
devoted to e-commerce, is starting a campaign to attract a broader
range of readers.
</P>
<P>
   When the magazine began in April 1998, it was aimed at the
people who were responsible for developing and putting into effect
their companies' Internet strategy. As e-commerce has exploded, so
too has that pool of potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people now who need the kind of information
we've been providing,'' said Kerry G. Zeida, vice president for
marketing and brand development for Standard Media in San
Francisco, which publishes The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million television and outdoor campaign _ the magazine's
first _ comes at a time when circulation growth is already strong.
The Industry Standard's circulation has risen to 150,000 from
60,000 when it began. The number of advertising pages, marketing
everything from alcohol to cars to technology, has grown even
faster: to 1,678.12 pages in the fourth quarter of last year from
251.17 pages in the fourth quarter of 1998, an increase of 568
percent, according to the tracking service Adscope Inc. in Eugene,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   While researching an angle to speak to the magazine's expanded
audience, Zeida said the magazine found that its readers appreciate
a competitive advantage they get from reading the publication.
Three 30-second commercials, which start Monday, take that notion
to a humorous extreme by showing Internet business leaders making
an effort to keep the information they get from The Industry
Standard confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, two men are seated at tables in a nondescript cafe,
with their backs to one another. In a spoof of spy movies, the two
exchange a series of quirky code phrases to assure each other that
they have the right contact: ``Does your wife sleep in the nude?''
``Actually she prefers flannel.'' ``Little Bo Peep has lost her
sheep.'' ``Leave them alone and they'll come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the two exchange their top-secret information. One man
quickly passes the magazine, which is concealed in a folder, to the
other and says, ``See you next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A second commercial features a man hustling to enter an empty
elevator. As he starts to open The Industry Standard magazine he
feels the presence of a security camera and backs up out of its
range. He then takes out a can of spray paint and blackens the
lens. Both spots close with an announcer saying: ``Read it. Learn
from it. Don't let it fall into the wrong hands,'' followed by the
company's tagline, ``The Industry Standard. Your weekly
intelligence report on the Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will begin running Monday in 10 markets,
including Atlanta, Dallas, Miami, New York and San Francisco,
during cable business programs including those of Bloomberg News,
CNBC, CNN and MSNBC. The work is the first from TBWA/Chiat/Day in
Playa del Rey, Calif., part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group, since that agency was awarded the account in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In the spots, ``we're saying this magazine is just chock full of
information all geared toward the Internet economy,'' said Jerry
Gentile, managing partner and creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
``I think what we've tried to do is to personify it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of don't let it fall into the wrong hands,'' he
added, is one of ``making this your edge to e-commerce, trying to
make everybody feel they have their own little personal source to
understand e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor portion of the campaign will feature billboards in
New York and San Francisco. One ad is a spectacular, a gigantic
electronic display located just off the Bay Bridge en route to San
Francisco. That billboard features an enlarged masthead of The
Industry Standard, accompanied by a live feed of
Internet-business-related news headlines for commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Other billboards show a copy of the magazine accompanied by
headlines including, ``We never met a bubble we couldn't burst''
and ``Sugar coating is for cereal.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for the magazine is the first component of what
will become a branding campaign to promote the entire company,
Standard Media. Subsequent ads for the other ventures and services
will be introduced later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Media, which is referred to simply as, ``The
Standard,'' is majority-owned by International Data Group. The
company also produces a Web site (www.TheStandard.com) and 18
online newsletters including Media Grok, in addition to hosting
national and international conferences and events.

<P>
   For Joshua White, the vibe at Pseudo.com, the dot-com enterprise
where he is employed these days, is amusingly reminiscent of a
different era: the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   White is a senior vice president in charge of production at
Pseudo, a company that creates original off-beat shows on
everything from the space program to hip-hop music to broadcast
over the Web. The struggle of the young staff to use the developing
medium in ways uniquely suited to the Internet strikes him as a
perfect parallel to his own life in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   That year, White was a 25-year-old lighting artist who went to
work for the rock promoter Bill Graham at the Fillmore East theater
in Manhattan's East Village. White's job and his passion were to
create light shows to match the kinetic new rock music emerging
from artists like the Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix. He was at the
center of cultural change, and it felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't chasing after anything traditional,'' he recalls. His
job, after all, was something no one had done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this feeling among those that were in it,'' he
added, ``that we were involved in something that older people would
not get. And then, like now, everyone over 30 is an outsider. They
come by and want to be part of it, but they just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the zeitgeist of the Internet of today that
keeps calling to mind the radical 1960s? Let's have no illusions:
The two decades are decidedly at odds in terms of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier era was defined by a rejection of prevailing social
norms, from segregation to sexual modesty to name a few. Today's
dot-com babies think about transforming commerce not values and
mores. And they are working happily within establishment parameters
to do it, fighting not in the streets but on the Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, dropping out meant dodging the draft and moving to
Canada to join a farming collective. Today, it means skipping out
of college before graduation to join a technology start-up and cash
in on millions of options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of empowerment is the same,'' Vern Keenan, who runs
a San Francisco Internet consulting firm, observes dryly, ``but the
politics is very different. Then the group party was socialism; now
it is libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for their obvious differences, the two eras are linked in
the psyches of many. Part of the connection is that many of the
Net's founding fathers came from the crucible of rebellion culture
in California _ Steve Wozniak of Apple Computer and Bill Joy of Sun
Microsystems to drop two prominent names. But the similarities run
deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, the Internet is a radically youth-centric
culture, convinced that dewy college graduates can better see the
future than those already tainted by their role in the old economy.
Surely, the hippie slogan, ``Don't trust anyone over 30,'' is as
apt for this emerging generation as it was for the 20-something
protesters who coined it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the university there is an inverse correlation between age
and experience,'' said Clay Shirky, a professor of new media at
Hunter College. ``The younger they are, the better they are at
speaking the new language. So undergraduates know more than
graduates, and freshmen know more than seniors _ all of which
really upsets the traditional order.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an aura of vitality and era-defining importance
around the activities of those who are plugged into the new economy
_ only some of which was lost in the recent stock market slide. It
is a common refrain for reporters to hear people talk about not
wanting to be bystanders to the digital revolution, as if working
for a dot-com is on par with going to Haight-Ashbury to drop acid
during the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Skeen is one of those mid-30-somethings drawn to the new
economy, in part, for the scene. Last month, Skeen left a
comfortable job at the publishing side of GQ, the men's magazine
published by Conde Nast to join Powerful Media Inc., whose
soon-to-be-introduced Web site Inside.com, aims to be a must-read
news service for media professionals. He is thrilled to have left
the polished Times Square offices of the big publishing company for
an enormous warehouse building on 11th Avenue, where numerous new
media enterprises make their home and the elevators are packed with
gadget-porting post-pubescents. ``It is an incredible
counterculture going on here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Skeen also sees the 1960s in his adventures. He equates, for
example, the lure of money in the 1990s to the lure of drugs in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Locke, co-author of ``The Cluetrain Manifesto,'' (Perseus
Books, 2000), a polemic that is rising quickly on the best-seller
lists, argues that the Internet revolution is the logical heir to
the 1960s on another front: communications.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s saw giant strides toward the democratization of
information, Locke argues, pointing to alternative publications
like Rolling Stone and journalists like the great Gonzo himself.
``Hunter Thompson was writing about what he was engaged in,'' Locke
said. ``He was not pretending to be objective or out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web, in Locke's view, brings the revolution against the
sonorous all-knowing corporate voice to its inevitable climax and
resolution in favor of the plebeians. ``The Internet enables people
to talk directly to each other and to corporations,'' he said. ``It
is something businesses ignore at their own peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy, man, heavy.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: MALL DEVELOPERS FIGHT BACK AT THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last year, amid the hype of dot-com retailing and the
run-up in e-commerce stocks, Web merchants had a lot of fun at the
expense of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   When they were not explicitly stating that mall shopping was a
complete waste of time and money, they implied it. Analysts piled
on as well, some predicting that e-tailers would bring about the
demise of the mall altogether. Mall developers could do little but
watch their stock prices sink, and hope people came to their
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the airwaves less crowded by consumer e-commerce
advertisements and with investors fleeing Web merchants en masse,
Internet retailers suddenly seem a lot more vulnerable _ and malls
are poised for a counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' biggest mall developers, like General Growth
Properties and Simon Property Group, have ratcheted up their own
e-commerce strategies in recent months. Putting a new spin on
so-called clicks and mortar strategies, they are vying to fill the
gaps left by both traditional and Internet retailers, in areas like
electronic ordering and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts may not slow the Internet shopping trend, but they
will at least ensure that the malls get a piece of the e-commerce
pie, and perhaps guarantee malls' continued relevance in the retail
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that among all mall owners, Simon Property Group
has been the most aggressive in pushing its e-commerce strategies.
The Indianapolis-based company is the nation's largest mall
developer, with more than 200 shopping malls, including the
behemoth Mall of America near Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Simon created two separate business units,
Clixnmortar and TenantConnect.net, to enable shoppers to integrate
e-commerce into their trips to the mall. Through TenantConnect,
Simon is installing broadband Internet connections inside its own
malls and those of other developers, so that store merchants can
have high-speed access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, retailers may take part in two Clixnmortar
initiatives now under development: FastFrog.com, which is designed
for teen-agers, and YourSherpa.com, which is intended for adult
users.
</P>
<P>
   In both programs, shoppers carry hand-held scanners through the
mall, zapping items they are interested in buying. When shoppers
are finished, the items appear on a wish list in a mall Internet
kiosk for FastFrog, or on a shopper's check-out page at a different
Internet kiosk for YourSherpa.
</P>
<P>
   From the FastFrog kiosks, teen-agers can forward their wish
lists to friends and relatives. At the YourSherpa kiosks, users can
type in their credit-card numbers and check out immediately, or
delay the final purchase until they go home and log onto a
YourSherpa Web site. Either way, YourSherpa shoppers are given the
option of picking up the items at the mall or having them wrapped
and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mall owners get no cut of the sale, as the proceeds
go entirely to the merchant whose store sells the product.
According to Shannon Haslund, vice president of operations for
Clixnmortar, the compensation details could change later. But for
now, mall owners are operating the kiosks primarily to generate
foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Haslund said FastFrog had been in tests at two Atlanta malls
since November, while a test run of YourSherpa.com began in
December in Atlanta's Lenox Square Mall, with one retailer, FAO
Schwarz. Based on the success of both programs, the company hopes
to roll them out nationally by the end of the year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Condon, manager of the FAO Schwarz in the Lenox Square
Mall, said YourSherpa had been ``tremendously valuable'' to the
store. Nearly all of the 700 shoppers who picked up a scanning
device from the YourSherpa kiosk have made purchases. The average
YourSherpa order, Condon said, was between $180 and $200, compared
with about $60 for an average store order.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, no merchandise had been returned from
YourSherpa purchases, compared with an average return rate of about
8 percent for store purchases. ``People don't have to finalize the
purchase right then,'' Condon said. ``It gives you a little more
time to decide. And you're not constrained by how much you can
carry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   General Growth Properties, the nation's second-largest mall
developer, is also moving quickly to capitalize on the Internet,
according to John Bucksbaum, the company's chief executive. ``We
were fairly certain that the Internet wouldn't result in our
demise, since we didn't think people would quit going out to do
their shopping,'' he said. ``So we asked, `How can we turn this
into an opportunity?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was Mallibu.com. The Web site will eventually link to
retailers in each of the company's 136 malls, allowing shoppers to
buy goods online directly from those retailers and have them
dropped off by a delivery service. Mallibu, which will begin
offering transactions online in June, also enables General Growth
to capitalize on one of the Internet's strengths: data tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon knows more about one customer after one trip than we do
about a person who comes in year after year,'' Bucksbaum said. By
tracking purchases online and obtaining e-mail addresses through
registrations, he said, ``we'll be able to e-mail a person about
new items coming into the store, or sales.''
</P>
<P>
   General Growth will charge retailers an amount not yet
determined for plugging into the malls' Mallibu.com Internet
systems, which are being installed, but it will not take a
commission from each sale. Still, the company could benefit from
any incremental Web sales, Bucksbaum said, since General Growth,
like other mall developers, takes between 4 percent and 8 percent
of a retailer's total sales beyond a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elaine Rubin, chairwoman of Shop.org, an Internet
retailing trade group, the efforts of Simon and General Growth
Properties ``are enlightening many other folks in the real estate
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes nonmall shopping centers. According to Charlotte
Ellis, senior vice president of Konover Property Trust, one of the
nation's largest developers of shopping centers that are not
enclosed malls, the company has begun to install high-speed
Internet lines in its 152 retail centers across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Konover plans to offer free Internet service
by year-end to users who agree to have their local shopping center
serve as their home page. Ellis said the border of the user's
screen would probably include advertisements and links to those
local retailers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might eventually order goods from the local retailers,
she said, and then pick them up or have them delivered. And while
Konover is passing along some of the costs of the program to its
retailers, the company is making a ``large'' undisclosed investment
upfront to start things off. ``In the meantime, it immediately sets
us apart from our competition,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also continues to stretch the notion of Internet
shopping into something that few thought it would be even six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping really hasn't changed much in 5,000 years,'' Ellis
said. ``We know there are going to be some big changes because of
the Internet, but ultimately it'll all be about saving time.''

<P>
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has been enmeshed in
controversy of late, with critics charging that it is awarding too
many patents that cover too much ground and questioning whether its
staff truly understands the technology it is evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's recently awarded patent for one-click online
shopping has received much attention because of its breadth. But
Amazon is by no means the leader in Internet patents.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is sitting on at least 14. In fact, in recent
months AOL has received one patent that covers customizing online
shopping for individual shoppers and another for a system that will
``search all resources on the Internet with one search command.''
Scores of other Internet-related patents quietly tumble out of the
patent office each week.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, much of the current controversy about patents,
according to historians of technology and communications, lacks a
sense of historical context. They say the patent battles looming on
the Internet horizon have historical precedent in those that arose
with other innovations in communication, including the telegraph,
telephone, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the development of the Internet as being
significantly different from the development of other
communications technologies since the 1840s,'' said Brian Winston,
the head of the School of Communication, Design and Media at the
University of Westminster in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of the Internet falls into a pattern. It's part
of that pattern that there will always be a terrible row over
patents.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent prospecting by Internet companies has been criticized in
a wide range of forums, from anonymous one-sentence postings on
slashdot.org, a Web site for computer programmers, to a scholarly
symposium conducted by the National Academy of Sciences in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of these new Internet patents, which by definition have
a software component, contend that software creation is far more
incremental than other kinds of invention.
</P>
<P>
   But Winston and many historians of technology argue that most
invention builds on existing innovation, rather than being the
result of a singular insight. Furthermore, many people are often
developing the same ideas at the same time. This phenomenon, they
say, is by no means exclusive to software _ or to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most extreme example of simultaneous development is when
you have Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray arriving at the
patent office on the same day with the idea of the telephone,''
said Winston, who is the author of ``Media Technology and Society:
A History From the Telegraph to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and Bell settled their differences, with Gray getting a
$100,000 settlement and lucrative contract work. But the early days
of the telephone were marked by many other patent disputes. At one
point the Bell System had 600 pending patent infringement cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general conception of invention is probably epitomized by
the image of a light bulb going off over your head,'' said Robert
Rosenberg, director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project, a
documentary editing project based at Rutgers University. ``But
inventions come out of other people's work, they come out of your
own work. They are almost always incremental.''
</P>
<P>
   And when social conditions and technology are both ripe,
Rosenberg said, patents become vigorously contested precisely
because they are so valuable and so many similar ideas bubble up at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be instructive to consider the example of Samuel
F.B. Morse and his first patent.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's contribution, to use anachronistic terms, was not so
much hardware as software. Others were inventing their own versions
of the telegraph, but Morse contributed the code _ putting dots and
dashes together so that information could be transmitted
efficiently, using electricity, over the new device.
</P>
<P>
   The historical precedent that most closely parallels the
development of the Internet is the evolution of radio, according to
the historian Amy Friedlander. She has written a series of
monographs on the development of large-scale infrastructures for a
nonprofit organization created by Robert Kahn, co-inventor of the
TCP/IP protocol that is at the heart of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio patent pool was finally formed in 1919,'' said
Friedlander, who is the editor of iMP, an online journal of
technology and public policy. ``One of the reasons it was formed
was there were so many patents and so much cross-licensing that
development of radio had become almost sclerotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although patents have often served as an important spur to
invention, she said, ``the capacity of patents to stifle innovation
is not new to our times.''
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum of history, just as everywhere, has its swings at
the patent office and in the courts that interpret patent law.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in addition to coming under fire for broad patents, the
patent office is roundly criticized for issuing patents that cover
dubious inventions like the physics-defying ``hyper-light-speed
antenna'' that serves as a portal to a ``new dimension.'' In
February, a patent was issued to a Colorado inventor for just such
a device.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-19th century, for example, Scientific American
published diatribes arguing exactly the opposite _ that the patent
office was far too stingy about handing out patents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that the patent office is issuing a number
of bad patents because it has become so technologically backward
that it cannot distinguish true innovation from fantastic theory or
hoary precedent.
</P>
<P>
   But for as long as it has existed, the patent office has been
confronted with new technology that may initially have sounded like
science fiction. ``The lag between the skills of the patent office
and innovation has been there a long time,'' said Philip Scranton,
a Rutgers professor who specializes in the history of industry and
technology. The watershed, according to Scranton, was not the
advent of software in the 20th century, but the electrical
inventions of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By inspecting mechanical drawings you can at least identify
what is similar between inventions, what is different and what
might be an infringement,'' he said. ``But with electrical
inventions arrived a whole new level of engineering and
mathematical considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental question that critics of Internet patents
pose is whether business models like the Amazon one-click process
should be patented at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here before,'' said Winston, who sees no problem
with business-model patents. ``There's a whole tendency to look at
new technologies as being outside of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say it may be a little too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people going to look back a hundred years from now and
think that one-click ordering was a revolutionary model?'' said
Paul Ceruzzi, a historian at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Air and Space Museum and the author of ``A History of Modern
Computing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know,'' he said. ``We have to wait for the dust to
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   (Patents may be viewed at www.uspto.gov on the Web or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington 20231.)

STOCK SHOCK IS A SIGNAL: TOUGH TIMES FOR E-TAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, a short-term battering of technology stocks and a
drumbeat of financial distress signals from e-commerce retailers
reminded the world that even dot-coms cannot assume a never-ending
flow of money.
</P>
<P>
   Not that David Friedensohn needed reminding. He still recalls a
lean week in late 1996 at SonicNet, the music Web site he was
running, when after meeting the payroll he had $50 left in the
bank. SonicNet escaped insolvency by being bought.
</P>
<P>
   Now Friedensohn runs an online video store called BigStar
Entertainment, which went public last August and by last Friday had
seen its share price sink to $3.75 _ 62 percent below the offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, like many e-tailers these days, that he cannot expect
to raise more money any time soon through a secondary offering. So
Friedensohn has taken what, for an Internet company at least, is
drastic action: He has slashed BigStar's marketing expenses 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of burning through his $25 million in cash in a year,
Friedensohn said, he now will survive 18 months _ long enough to
hope the company will be able to move into the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only smart thing I can do right now is take the cash I
have and assume I can't get any more,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
run into a brick wall like some of these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's market volatility made it painfully clear that many
Internet companies, especially the electronic retailers that
operate online stores, may be heading toward that wall. As a
sector, the so-called e-tailing companies' stock prices are now off
60 to 90 percent from their highs last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Such a drop is depressing for any business. But it is life
threatening for most e-tailers because nearly all of them went
public with the explicit plan of losing money for years while they
were building their brands and systems. And it seems doubtful that
many will be able to raise the second and third installments of
cash they had been counting on _ and that they will need for
carrying out those ambitious business plans.
</P>
<P>
   So now what?
</P>
<P>
   Like a Formula One race car driver who finds himself heading
into a sharp turn too fast, the choice is between hoping that luck
and skill can prevail over physics _ or slowing down to see whether
more reckless rivals spin out of control as they pull ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to make tough strategic choices to survive in this
environment,'' said Jonathan V. Diamond, chairman of CDNow, a music
e-tailer that has seen its own stock crater and now finds itself
back on the auction block after its merger with the Columbia House
record club was canceled last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like BigStar, are slamming on the brakes. Others
are making painful compromises to press ahead. Egghead.com, for
example, has been forced to seek private financing, at a discount
to the price of its publicly traded stock, which is now at $7.3125,
compared with more than $39 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, PlanetRX, an online drugstore, is one of the
companies that is moving ahead in full knowledge that its cash
cannot hold out until it breaks even. PlanetRX had planned a
secondary stock offering, William J. Razzouk, its chairman said,
but will not take that step as long as its stock remains 88 percent
below its October high of $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Razzouk's company will fine tune spending, in his
words, and defer plans to raise more money until its stock price
rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you manage your cash flow, and things that are not
absolutely, positively critical, you do without,'' he said. ``But
we will earn the opportunity to refill the gas tank one or two more
times, so long as investors see that we are making progress to
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many e-tailers in such dire straits? It is not
because people do not like shopping online. If anything, Internet
sales are ahead of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the online stores are finding it much more expensive than
they had expected to find and serve customers, while at the same
time the frantic pace of competition is depressing prices and
forcing costly giveaways like free shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that investors have shifted their fancy from
online retailing to so-called business-to-business commerce, which
involves the market for raw goods, industrial parts and corporate
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Wall Street finds that a business is not up to its
expectations, it just moves on to something else.'' said George
Orban, the chairman of Egghead, the online electronics retailer
that has tried to stay afloat in a tough business by merging with a
competitor, Onsale Inc. ``You're going to see a lot of businesses
flame out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Nova, a partner with Highland Capital, a venture firm, said
the companies he had invested in _ including e-tailers like eToys
and Staples.com _ are hardly going to flame out. But some, he said,
certainly have had to modify their approaches in the current
investment climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dance partners to Wall Street, and they changed the
tempo,'' Nova said. ``Nine months ago, investment bankers were
telling us we were showing profits too early and not investing
enough in the brand. Now we have to scale back our plans to show
profits earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   This vulnerability to the fickle folly of Wall Street,
particularly when much of the market's tone is being set by online
day traders, highlights just how risky it was for these companies
to go public with little more than a Web site and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the dark side of going public early,'' said Alec
L. Ellison, a merger specialist with Broadview, a New Jersey
investment bank. ``A lot of companies will have to be restructured
because they don't have a steady and patient source of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris MacAskill, chief executive of Fatbrain.com, an online
professional bookstore, blames investment bankers and venture
capitalists for forcing his company to go public much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we waited until we had a few more quarters under our belt,
we could have had a great public offering,'' he said. Fatbrain went
public in November 1998, with its share price closing near $25 the
first day. It is now at $10.8125. ``Your entrance to the grand
stage sets the standard for how you will be measured,'' MacAskill
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many other executives say they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are going public very early and are under
intense public scrutiny,'' CDNow's Diamond said. ``But I would do
it all over again,'' he said. ``We needed to go public to raise the
money to build a brand quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Diamond was an executive at the music retailer N2K when it
raised $103 million in an initial public offering in October 1997.
CDNow, with which it merged early last year, raised $65 million
when it went public in February 1998. Each also raised more in
secondary offerings before their merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives now say it was better to have gone
public perhaps too soon than wait until now, when the changing mood
of Wall Street may have made it too late for other e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going public was the best thing we could have done,'' said
Kenneth E. Kurtzman, the chief executive of Ashford.com, an online
jewelry store that went public with an $81 million offering last
September. ``We raised enough capital to see us until we get
profitable, and it established our name as the leader in the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even better,'' Kurtzman added, ``I felt like the door was
closing behind us. Our competitors are running out of cash, and
they can't go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists and investment bankers say it may be that
the only online retailers that are able to raise money in today's
market will be those affiliated with traditional retailers, like
Kmart, Wal-mart Stores and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be a new stand-alone business-to-consumer
dot-com created again,'' predicted Robert Lessin, co-chief
executive of Wit Capital, a New York investment bank active in
Internet offerings. ``Three years ago, you could create a brand for
$10 million. Now it costs $1 billion. With the lifetime value of a
customer, it just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   This judgment may be a bit too harsh, in the view of Michael
Moritz, a partner with Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that a lot of companies were formed and got
financed that didn't meet the great litmus test of being a good
business,'' he said. ``And people are only now waking up surprised
to find out what they had invested in. But a lot of nice, cherubic
little babies are being thrown out with the gray bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he argues, the babies, at least those in his
portfolio, will be rescued. ``I don't go to sleep at night worried
about cash,'' he said. ``Good companies can always raise money.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Esther Dyson was presiding over the most recent meeting of
Icann, the controversial international group that is trying to
create the Internet's first democracy. While she sat on a stage
facing an audience of several hundred, her frustration and
impatience grew increasingly apparent, as people filed to a
microphone in the aisle to voice their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Many opposed the interim board's proposal to elect permanent
members through an indirect process. But Dyson, the interim
chairwoman, defended the policy of using an electoral council
instead of letting the world's Internet users vote directly for
their board representatives. That was the best way, she told the
group, to prevent the nomination of ``people who are stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after seeing her remark on The New York Times Web
page, Dyson took exception. ``Out of context,'' she said. ``I might
have said it, but it was out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her intention, the remark put Dyson directly at odds
with some of the same civil liberties groups that have long been
among her staunchest supporters. And the incident last month in
Cairo, Egypt, made clear that despite her unofficial titles of
doyenne of cyberspace and queen of the digerati, a politician is
one thing that Dyson is not.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since Dyson was chosen to be
interim head of Icann _ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers _ with the mandate of leading the Clinton administration's
effort to move oversight of the network from federal contractors to
the international Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   But she has ruled Icann's fractious public meetings with a mix
of impatience, frustration and condescension. And the paucity of
diplomacy, some Internet executives say, has played a role in
Icann's rocky start. Among the missteps, two of the group's
earliest decisions _ to hold closed meetings and to levy a $1 tax
on Internet addresses _ were later rescinded under pressure from
the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what you see sometimes is that she doesn't quite
have the common touch,'' said Mike Godwin, a lawyer who worked with
Dyson in the early 1990s at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
public interest group devoted to the defense of free speech and
civil rights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is a dimension of being a political being
that involves going out and getting hands on and dealing with
individuals,'' said Godwin, who is now senior legal editor of
E-Commerce Law Weekly, a print publication. ``I don't think she is
terribly comfortable with that. I think she is democratic in
principle but not entirely democratic in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at her cluttered office in New York,
on a rare day when she was not traveling, Dyson defended her
leadership style. ``I don't have a tolerance for having my time
wasted; I'm straightforward,'' she said. ``It's not a question of
intelligence; it's a question of appropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most who know Esther Dyson say she does not suffer fools
gladly. But she was picked to head Icann not for her tact but
because of her international reputation for independence, integrity
and straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 foot 3 and 47 years of age, Dyson is a wiry, almost elfin
figure, with seeming disregard for the trappings of makeup and
fashion. She keeps her hair short and simply cut. She scurries
around her office and official meetings wearing socks without
shoes. And she often wears faded blue jeans, typically accompanied
by an oversized T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the renowned physicist Freeman Dyson, she is
described by another Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague, John
Gilmore, as having ``formidable intelligence.'' But Dyson's fast
mind can manifest itself in ways that may come across as dismissive
and condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a people person,'' said Jerry Michalski. For five
years, Michalski wrote Release 1.0, the influential technology
newsletter that Dyson's company, EDventure holdings, publishes
monthly. Michalski left about two years ago to become a freelance
consultant and speaker, a decision made in part, he explained, by
the emotional wall that he said she kept between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes humans,'' he said. ``She just doesn't do small talk.
If you hang out with her, it feels awkward. If you start talking
about feelings, she will turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her interpersonal skills, over the last 20 years Dyson
has cultivated long-standing relationships with a wide circle of
some of the most influential people in the computer and Internet
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard with a bachelor's degree in economics,
Dyson began her career in the computer world in the 1970s, covering
the budding industry as a reporter for Forbes magazine. From there
she moved to Wall Street as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 she formed her venture capital firm after buying a
computer industry newsletter that she renamed Release 1.0. With
that newsletter came a related annual conference, which she has
parlayed into an invitation-only event, called PC Forum, that the
industry's top executives and digerati are afraid to miss _ even at
a registration fee of $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is also on the board of numerous companies and nonprofit
groups around the world and has become a mainstay at Internet
conferences and policy panels. And she has positioned herself as a
well-paid, highly sought speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As former chairman, and now vice chairman, of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, she espoused some of the earliest predictions
about the complex challenges the Internet would pose for
intellectual property and privacy. And she has served on special
federal commissions on intellectual property, privacy and
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a civil libertarian, however, Dyson is more of an
observer, a thinker, than an activist, according to people who know
her well, who say she seems more comfortable with identifying tough
issues than taking on the hard fight to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly that limitation drew criticism to her 1997 book,
``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age,'' which some
critics derided as a naive collection of only sometimes interesting
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lambert, reviewing the book for Business Week, said
Dyson ``glosses over the obstacles that lie in the way'' of
achieving the ``electronic Utopia she foresees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Dyson talks, people in the digital world listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Esther starts talking about something, and you don't know
why, you better start paying attention,'' said Miljenko Horvak, a
former Citibank executive who is involved in several Eastern
European start-up companies with Dyson. For instance, Horvak said,
Dyson started talking about online privacy five years ago, well
before it became a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this thing that I call Esther's orbit,'' Horvak said.
``She, by the gravitational pull of her personality and her person
get all of these different kinds of people to be in orbit around
her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And that ``pull,'' Horvak says, does not involve charisma or
charm. But finding someone to say anything more critical for public
attribution is nearly impossible. ``Can we go off the record?'' is
the first thing many people said when asked to comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   As one acquaintance put it: ``People are afraid to say bad
things about Esther. Not because she is not a nice person, or out
of fear of retribution from her, but because they think it will
cast negatively on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Icann controversy is the issue of electing half
of the 18-member board. Originally the voting was to be complete by
the end of this September, but it is now not expected to be
finished until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as some blame Dyson for not being a better leader and
problem solver, many give her credit for dedicating the time
necessary to keep the very fragile Icann experiment from blowing up
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cochetti, who as a policy executive with IBM helped select
Dyson as Icann's interim chairwoman, said the decision was not
based on the assumption that she had a unique insight into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably about 1,000 people in the world who are as
insightful about the Internet as Esther,'' Cochetti said. ``People
may disagree with Esther, and they may disagree with either her
substance or her tactics, but it's rare _ if ever _ that anyone has
ever questioned her integrity,'' he said. ``She is a person who
from my experience operates from her principle. You can rely on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before taking on the Icann duties, Dyson was spending 70
percent to 80 percent of her life on the road, attending her
different board meetings and conferences and overseeing the
personal investments she has in some 30 technology companies around
the world _ many of them obscure ventures in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her Icann work comes atop this heavy load. And the strain of the
group's highly contentious process shows during Icann's public
forums, which are purposely held in a different country each time _
and at which Dyson has become increasingly curt to the people who
line up at the microphones to challenge proposed policies or
question the group's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Dyson has built a career as a seeming voice for
the little guy, the individual user of digital technology, that
some people in the electronic libertarian community say they feel a
bit abandoned by Dyson in the Icann process.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an episode last fall, when a coalition of nonprofit
groups traveled to Chile for an Icann board meeting. The group
asked the board to slow its policy-making until Icann had
representation from noncommercial interests and individuals. As
critics lined up to question how Icann, for example, had arrived at
its business-backed policy for cracking down on so-called
cybersquatters, Dyson's growing irritation became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' she told the audience, ``we are less
interested in complaints about the process'' and more interested in
``doing real work and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of last month's meeting in Cairo, Dyson and the
rest of the board at first resisted demands from powerful groups
like Common Cause and the Center for Democracy and Technology that
they reconsider the election plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite Dyson's ``people who are stupid'' remark,
the interim board listened and agreed to allow direct election of
the new members. But it remains unclear whether the hostilities
will dissipate and the board will again attempt to work closely
with the civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson admits that Icann has made mistakes. But she said she was
not sure how she might have made things work better. ``Could I have
been more forceful in raising some of things that I think were
mistakes?'' she said. ``I don't know. It might have worked and it
might have backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of her critics and her supporters agree that, whatever
the shortcomings, she has credibly performed a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have done it any better than Esther
has,'' Godwin said. ``It's to Esther's credit that Icann hasn't
been laughed out of existence.''

REAL ESTATE: FURNISHING AN APARTMENT WITH THE CLICK OF A MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the old days, about five minutes ago, it was
enough to know which restaurant had just opened in the meat-packing
district, or which store on Elizabeth Street sold the best dresses.
Knowing where to get things has always been part of the currency
here, the mark of the sophisticated New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, there's a whole new world to master, and that
doesn't mean Queens and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Its scouts are people like Brianna Lam, who lives in an elegant
Upper East Side apartment that is tastefully furnished with
antiques and early American oil paintings. She is friendly but not
effusive, perfectly dressed and as well-spoken as one would expect
from a woman who entered Columbia University at 16. When she
explains the row of liquor bottles in her kitchen by saying she
wanted to set up a ``bachelorette'' pad for herself, she seems as
Old World as her high-ceilinged apartment near Central Park in the
East 80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Lam, 28, is totally of her moment. The antique ottoman, the
secretary, the stereo system and the porcelain coasters didn't come
from little neighborhood shops. She found almost everything on the
Internet within two months of moving into her one-bedroom
apartment, and she spent only a fifth of what she had budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Lam was separating from her husband and
was tired of the contemporary style they had cultivated. She wanted
antiques, she said, but nothing so expensive she couldn't give a
party without worrying that a $10,000 table would be teetering in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   By roaming through stores on the Upper East Side, she estimated
that it would cost her $50,000 to get the look she wanted, and so
she set aside that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she started shopping, she was shocked to see that a
pair of chairs she liked cost $5,000. The big department stores
were no more appealing. ``A lot of time when you go to department
stores, you have to wait for six weeks,'' she said. ``When you're
starting from scratch, that seems like forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But being a technology consultant with her own company, Business
Solution Providers Inc., it was natural to her to check out Web
sites in her spare moments. She quickly found an Aubusson-style
needlepoint rug for $850; an upholstered antique footstool, which
doubles as a coffee table, for $190; a hand-painted tole tray table
with a stand for $130; and curved mahogany library steps for $100.
She even unearthed, for $175, a Lladro figurine of a Chinese woman,
which drew her, she said, ``because it looks a little like my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she had to have help. Desperately wanting the library
steps _ which she found on eBay, the Internet auction site _ so she
could reach her collection of rare books on the top shelves of her
living room, she asked someone she works with to bid for her,
because at the crucial moment, just before the auction closed, she
was going to be at a meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
   With two chairs she had brought from her old life, and a chaise
lounge bought at Bloomingdale's and delivered quickly because it
was in stock, she completed her apartment with about $40,000 left
over. She took that money and began buying early American
paintings. Again she used the Internet, but usually went in person
to the galleries to see the work, after seeing online what was
available.
</P>
<P>
   In furnishing her apartment, she said, she used eBay a lot,
sometimes making the first contact there and then going off line to
negotiate when the auction minimum wasn't met. To protect herself,
she bought primarily from sellers who had garnered a lot of
positive feedback from previous buyers, comments that are posted on
the site. She always avoided buying anything that looked fuzzy in a
photo, and always asked a lot of questions about the object's
condition and shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 70 transactions, she said, she had only three
negative experiences. Twice, furniture was damaged because of poor
packing, but the pieces were insured. In the third case, china
arrived with two broken plates, but because it was insured, the
seller replaced them through www.replacements.com, a company that
sells individual pieces of china and glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Buying online, she said, saves time and broadens choices. ``It's
analogous to having a global amalgamation of stores right in front
of you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For paintings her favorite sites were www.sothebys.com and
www.artnet.com/questtroyal.html, a New York art dealer that
specializes in 19th and early 20th century art. Among her purchases
is an 1875 work by Jervis McEntee (1828-1891), a Hudson River
School painter, which she bought through a dealer she found on the
Internet _ who happened to be the person who lived in her apartment
before she did.
</P>
<P>
   She likes McEntee's work, she said, because it is not like the
``very bright, very sunny'' paintings typical of his time.
</P>
<P>
   He is often criticized for his darker pictures, she said, but
``he was someone I could relate to.'' She buys old art books partly
because they sometimes have personal information about painters
that isn't found in new books.
</P>
<P>
   She said she found eBay very time consuming because of the vast
number of items on sale. Mostly, she found the sellers very
helpful. When she saw the ottoman on eBay, offered by an antiques
dealer in the Hamptons, she made a bid, but when nobody met the
minimum, she contacted the dealer directly, said she had placed the
highest bid and asked for his best price.
</P>
<P>
   They struck a deal, and then came the best part. ``I said I
needed it for a cocktail party coming up,'' she said, ``and they
said, `We'll drop it off in the city for $25.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In her bedroom, the rug came from Home Depot, a store she really
admires. ``I'm pretty bullish on their stock,'' she said. ``It's
one of the only non-Internet, nonwireless-communication companies
in my portfolio.'' She found her digital camera by going to
www.shopper.com to find out who had the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful duvet cover on the bed, however, came from a very
traditional source: her mother, who made it for her. ``When I was
little, she always wanted to make my clothes,'' said Lam, who was
born in Toronto and grew up in a small town in New Hampshire. ``I
wanted Levis.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that her apartment is finished, Lam is putting more time
into her other interests, including fiction writing and portrait
photography. She brings out a stunning photo of a woman she shot
during a race to Battery Park City, the woman's muscles glittering
like jewels in the light.
</P>
<P>
   She also likes handgun shooting, a hobby that startles anyone
who hears of it. ``People think it's violent,'' she said. But she
is not defensive. ``It's relaxing to me,'' she said. ``You're
focusing on the target.'' She shoots at a place in the West 20s,
where she likes meeting people she would never come across in her
work life, like police officers and FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work tons and tons of hours,'' she said. Then, ``I
thought, there's more to life than just working and making money.''

 &HT;    STUDY SAYS MANY GIRLS DISDAIN COMPUTER CAREERS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Girls are avoiding high-tech careers not because
they fear failing, but because they believe computer jobs are
boring and lonely, according to a study released Tuesday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they use e-mail and the Internet and word
processing, but when it comes to computer fluency _ finding
innovative ways to use information technology or to adapt new
technologies as they emerge _ girls and women just aren't in the
forefront,'' said Pamela Haag, director of research for the AAUW
Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to hearing a lot about math and science phobia''
among older girls, Haag said. But, she said, when the researchers
talked to girls in middle school and high school, ``it wasn't that
they were anxious about technology, they were estranged from it and
opting out from acquiring skills that are key to our economy and
will be key to our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her foundation, an affiliate of the American Association of
University Women, paid for the two-year study, which was directed
by a predominantly female commission of 15 prominent researchers,
teachers, journalists and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fifth of high tech jobs are held by women, the
commission said. Moreover, on-the-job use of technology lags among
teachers, about three-fourths of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
   The commission predicted that women will continue to trail men
in computer-related activities until there are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes in ``tedious and dull'' computer science courses that
weed out most students, rather than arouse interest in the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ More use of classroom technology to study non-technical
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Education for today's teachers that goes beyond ``drive-by''
workshops to emphasize how teachers can design instruction that
takes advantage of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of new ``high skill'' computer games that appeal to
boys and girls, as an alternative to today's ``high kill'' action
games for boys and ``pink'' passive games for girls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marketing campaigns that smash the stereotype of the high-tech
workplace as a sterile set of cubicles full of boring men who are
better at relating to machines than to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked, girls and women describe a prevailing concern that
computer science will stunt their diverse range of intellectual
pursuits and interests,'' the commission said. ``Girls tend to
imagine that computer professionals live in a solitary, antisocial
and sedentary world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing that stereotype, the commission said, ``Tinkering with
(computer) code need not be seen as less artistic than tinkering
with color, form and shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Its recommendation: ``Educators, parents, employers and guidance
counselors need to impart a more complex, realistic view of jobs
that rely heavily or centrally on computer technology. Many of
these jobs emphasize communication, collaboration and creativity.''

 &HT;    Easter sites brimming with information
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Easter is a holiday that _ just as is true for
Christmas _ has both a deep religious meaning and also has become a
day for games and family activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers information and guidance for both. So no matter
how your family celebrates the day, you should be able to find
something helpful. Unlike the Easter eggs hidden deep in the far
bushes, these sites are easy to find and use.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop on the Bunny Trail is a site called Eggs-otic
Easter. You'll find the site at
www.invision.net/easter/easterinside.html. If you'd like to share
your feelings about the day, there's a place where you can leave a
note for all the world to see. You'll find links that take you to
an Internet Easter egg hunt so, even if it rains on Easter, you can
still find eggs. Plus, there's a way to color Easter eggs online _
no mess, no fuss, all thanks to computer wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   No holiday worth its salt, or flour and sugar, is complete
without special meals, and that's certainly true of Easter. No
matter whether you celebrate the day with a fancy baked ham or a
backyard cookout while the kids hunt for eggs, there's help
available with holiday recipes.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to check out a site at
holidayrecipe.com/features/easter.asp called Holidayrecipe.com
Easter Recipes for some good cooking ideas. Besides the expected
ham recipes, you'll find some advice on creating your own Easter
baskets from scratch and then even more help on preparing goodies
to fill them. Even the humble boiled egg gets some attention here.
</P>
<P>
   The page also offers you a way to share your own recipes. You'll
be glad to know there's some advice on what to do with the leftover
ham.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at the Christian celebration of Easter, there is a
page at www.gospelcom.net/peggiesplace/easter.htm called Christian
Easter Celebration that is worth a visit. Another site at
www.rockies.net/(tilde)spirit/sermons/easterpage.html offers
information for ministers on the holiday, along with help in
planning sermons.
</P>
<P>
   If you realize, as you began to discuss the holiday with your
family, there are parts of the tradition and history that are still
mysteries to you, there's an excellent resource at
www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/1502/easte.html. It's called
Christine O'Keeffe's Easter page. You'll find links that take you
to sections explaining the egg's importance to the holiday, as well
as sections with traditional Easter games (including hiding the
eggs) and ancient history of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   This page also has an excellent collection of links to Easter
pages on other parts of the Web. So you'll want to spend some time
investigating these pages as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional Christian page, called Carolyn's Universe,
has some truly beautiful religious graphics as well as sections
that offer the traditional Christian story of Easter, plus
information on the Easter lily, Easter eggs and the Easter bunny.
One story that may not be familiar to all is the story of the
butterfly. That legend compares the metamorphosis of the
caterpillar into the butterfly to the stages of Christ's life.
You'll find Carolyn's Universe at
www.carolynsuniverse.com/easter.html.

 &HT;    Forget the gizmos, just give me some old-fashioned technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My brother called a few moments ago. He's a small-town
physician, and I'm a blue-collar newspaperman. We love each other
but _ since we are so different _ we end up scrambling to find a
conversation sometimes. He asked me, as he usually does, ``What's
new and exciting with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   I keep up pretty well. And I know the stock answers, I know what
the buzz is, but this was my brother, not some speech I was making.
</P>
<P>
   I realized that very few of the new things that excite the real
experts do much for me. For instance, there's wireless Web use.
Gosh, I'd rather play golf than walk down the golf course,
exchanging e-mails while trying to make up an excuse for why my
drive killed a golf course goose.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's MP3, downloading music files and playing them on
one of the tiny little music machines. My CD player is easier.
Besides, the music available online is either pirated copies of
commercial songs or tunes by groups that seem to have names like
``Too Stupid to Die.'' I'd rather listen to Peggy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   New computers ... well, there are always new computers, and they
are always faster and have more nifty features. But most of them
boil down to beige-colored boxes that tend to mess up at the most
inconvenient times.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the technology companies are almost desperate
to find some world-killer application or device these days. Instead
of worrying about what the world needs, they're more concerned with
what they can do, what they can invent, not what people need.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, get a lot of calls and talking to real
people _ the consumers who are made to feel almost inadequate
because they don't have Palm Pilots, cable modems or 1-gigahertz
PCs _ helps me tune out some of the hysteria that I read and hear.
Because of the e-mail, I get to talk to the real experts, the
people who would rather pay the mortgage than own a PC powerful
enough to run an astrophysics research program, who use Walkmans
instead of MP3 players, and who are just now getting fast telephone
modems and live in places where cable modems and DSL _ the
telephone company's high-speed data service _ is either unavailable
or not worth the money for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to tell my brother something and _ being desperate _ I
told him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm impressed by fairly mundane gadgets that are making a real
difference in people's lives. And so are many of my readers.
Instead of raving about MP3, they tell me that WebTV _ that simple
gadget that turns your TV set into an Internet machine _ has let
them join the world of cyberspace, let them send e-mail and browse
the Web without confusing them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The regular cell phone is also becoming as much a part of life
as the regular telephone and the TV. Rates have dropped to where
ordinary people can have one, and it's become a reliable lifeline
on lonely drives, an easy way to summon help. And with today's rate
plans, which often include free long-distance service, it's become
more than an auxiliary telephone. It's become the way a lot of us
call our family and friends, using that free long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-mail, that techno-dinosaur of the Internet that dates to the
days when the name World Wide Web sounded like a comic strip title,
has reinvented the art of personal correspondence. People are
writing again. And, maybe it's just my bias, but I think that it's
bringing back the art of the conversation. Sure, we've swapped
rocking chairs on the front porch for computers in the spare
bedroom, and that's not as warm and good, but it sure beats
watching prime-time TV alone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new and exciting in technology? It's the old stuff.
And it's the truth.

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, slower than many courts to enter
the age of online information, announced on Monday that it would
inaugurate its own Web site next Monday. The address is
www.supremecourtus.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decisions will be available on the site within hours
of their 10 a.m. release, through a link to a site run by the
Government Printing Office. Later on the day of release, the
court's own site will make the opinions directly available.
</P>
<P>
   Other information to be available on the Web site includes the
weekly orders granting and denying new appeals; the court's
schedule and argument calendar; the court's rules; bar admission
forms and instructions; visitors' guides; news releases, and
general information, like biographies of the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Arberg, the court's public information officer, said that
in the near future the court's docket would be available on the Web
site, enabling people to check the status of current cases and the
disposition of past cases. For the last four years, this
information has been available on a dial-up bulletin board system,
which will be shut down. Callers will still be able to obtain the
status of cases through the Clerk's Automated Response System at
(202) 479-3034.
</P>
<P>
   The court will also continue to maintain a system it calls
Project Hermes, under which 17 subscribers, including commercial
databases, universities, The Associated Press and The New York
Times, receive immediate computerized access to opinions, for
retransmission to their own users and subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Many state courts and most of the federal appeals courts either
have their own Web sites or post their decisions under special
arrangement with Web sites maintained by law schools within their
jurisdiction. The federal judiciary maintains its own Web site, at
www.uscourts.gov.

GOVERNORS BASH INTERNET PANEL IN LETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the nation's 50 governors will deliver
to Congress a scathing bipartisan attack on the Internet tax
commission on Wednesday, denouncing it as a forum for special
interests seeking tax breaks while threatening the system in which
states set their own tax policies to pay for police, fire-fighters
and schools.
</P>
<P>
   The letters come as the Republican leadership in Congress hosts
a series of events to toast the report by an advisory commission
that would effectively continue the exemption from sales taxes on
products sold by companies that operate only in cyberspace.
National retailers with bricks-and-mortar stores would have to
continue collecting sales taxes on all sales, including those over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, 36 governors, most of whom have reputations as
tax cutters, had signed a letter saying that Congress should not
interfere with the right of each state to determine its tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason to oppose the Internet tax
commission's report ``is that it would substantially interfere with
state sovereignty,'' the governors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Constitution was very clear in both ensuring state
sovereignty and creating a critical balance between federal and
state authority. For well over 200 years the federal government has
respected state sovereignty and has been extremely careful not to
interfere with the states' ability to independently raise revenues.
This proposal would dramatically undercut this precedent,'' the
governors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also says that the Internet tax commission ignored
its mandate, instead pursuing special interest tax breaks sought by
companies with seats on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of addressing the requirements laid out in the law to
recommend a new state and local sales tax system to provide for
fairness and balance,'' the governors wrote, ``the proposal chose
to use this opportunity to seek a host of new and expensive special
tax breaks. We urge you to reject the report.``
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by 19 Republicans, 15 Democrats and two
independents, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Angus King of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Four other governors sent separate letters supporting state
sovereignty in taxation as a constitutional principle, but not
attacking the Internet tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not sign the letter are Governors George W.
Bush of Texas, Jeb Bush of Florida, George Pataki of New York and
Governor James S. Gilmore 3rd of Virginia, all Republicans, and
Gray Davis of California, a Democrat. Gilmore chaired the Internet
tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   The support for a tax-free Internet has caused deep divisions
between Capitol Hill Republicans and Republicans who run
statehouses and city halls, where sales taxes are the largest
single source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill Republicans are also under attack from
retailers ranging from organizations of mom-and-pop merchants to
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. Only a handful of large
retailers favor the proposal to keep the Internet exempt from sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say any tax cut is a good tax
cut, see the Internet as critical to future prosperity and want to
be seen as its protector from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that solid support among congressional Republicans
for a tax-free Internet is weakening in Washington, on Tuesday Sen.
John McCain quietly canceled plans for the Senate Commerce
Committee to vote tomorrow on a bill to extend the Internet Tax
Freedom Act for three years to 2006. The withdrawal was revealed
when the issue did not appear on the committee agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buse, the committee staff director, said the planned vote
was delayed indefinitely ``at request of senators who wanted more
time to look at the issue and find out if they are in favor of a
moratorium or favor new taxes on their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Buse said McCain favors ``stepping back and taking a larger
view'' of Internet taxation and wants to avoid ``a rush to judgment
on how to impose taxes'' on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, Buse said, ``was too highly political and did
not provide any glide plan to answer these complex questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National
Governors Association, said he was delighted that McCain has
delayed action. ``This means we are getting through'' with the
message that ``who has the right to cut taxes in the states. Is it
the federal government or is it the states?''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah, a tax-cutting Republican who
organized other governors to sign the letter, said he, too, opposes
taxes aimed at the Internet, but that protecting the Internet as a
tax-exempt zone will distort the economy and shift power to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the Internet should be taxed. No bit taxes,
no bandwidth taxes, no access taxes. We should not do anything that
will inhibit this powerful engine of economic growth. But that is
not the issue here. The issue is whether the states will determine
their own tax policy and whether business will have a level playing
field. This is about whether local government will be allowed to
function independently of the national government.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said he persuaded so many governors to sign the letter
because they ``see this as the most significant federalism issue we
have faced in this century.''

&HT;     WAKE UP AND SMELL THE FREE-TRADE COFFEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As far back as February 1998, executives at the
mighty Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. said they were
``exploring the possibility`` of offering customers coffee beans
that meet international fair-trade standards for non-exploitive
labor.
</P>
<P>
   This week, exploration ended.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, Starbucks has promised, it will add ``fair-trade
certified'' coffee to the inventories of its 2,000-plus retail
stores and e-commerce Web site. Among other things, such
certification means individual farmers are guaranteed a minimum of
$1.26 per pound of beans.
</P>
<P>
   That guarantee will triple the incomes of thousands of
small-farm growers, mostly in Central America, who live below
subsistence levels with their tiny shares of the volatile
coffee-bean market.
</P>
<P>
   Although the move will affect only a small percentage of
Starbucks' multibillion-dollar retail business, the promise is
historic. Despite years of lobbying by international labor rights
groups, no other major U.S. coffee company has made such a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory for the farmers,'' said Paul Rice, the
executive director of TransFair USA, a nonprofit agency based in
Oakland, Calif., that will certify the coffee. ``We've been working
on Starbucks for about eight months, trying to get them on board.
The agreement they have made is truly visionary; it shows true
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   TransFair USA is a recent off-shoot of a 12-year-old European
fair trade organization and part of a 19-member international
consortium. All are independent monitoring and information agencies
that seek to protect and promote the livelihoods of some 500,000
small-farm coffee growers in Central America, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   TransFair does this primarily by helping small-farm families
establish large cooperatives to sell beans directly to huge coffee
companies. Shut out are the commercial middlemen whose exorbitant
fees reduce the farmers' per-pound price to about 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   So successful is TransFair USA's European parent, about $300
million in ``fair-trade certified'' coffee was sold on the
continent just last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks didn't just do something that would make the problem
go away,'' Rice said. ``They're making this coffee available in
every store, every day for a full year. And they have promised to
place the certification labels front-and-center and provide posters
and brochures that will educate their customers about fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have gone a different way. They could have dug in the
way Nike did when their labor practices were challenged. But they
decided instead to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Starbucks is hardly taking out thank-you ads, it's
likely that some of the credit for the company's decision goes to
the same labor rights groups that did indeed hound Nike into
humiliation and eventual submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been meeting with Starbucks for two years, and all we
kept getting was how they were this big ship that just couldn't be
`instantly' turned around,'' said Medea Benjamin, the founding
director of the San Francisco-based human rights group Global
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we addressed their board on Feb. 14 and met privately
with their executives, we still felt they weren't taking us
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Global Exchange folks told Starbucks they were organizing
a 30-city, April 13 protest in front of Starbucks stores from
Buffalo, N.Y., to Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, Starbucks senior vice president Dave Olsen sent Paul
Rice a letter outlining the company's agreement with TransFair USA.
</P>
<P>
   Global Exchange activists gladly called off the Starbucks action
and redirected their freed-up energy to increase pressure on other
coffee giants like Maxwell House (owned by the Philip Morris Cos.),
Folgers (owned by Procter and Gamble) and Peet's coffee in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, timing of the Starbucks-TransFair agreement could not
be better for workers rights activists with a long view:
</P>
<P>
   The annual Specialty Coffee Association of America trade show
opens Saturday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme of this year's show is `Quality, Sustainability and
Social Responsibility,'' Rice said. ``Starbucks' decision to carry
`fair-trade certified' coffee sends a powerful message to the
entire industry that this theme can be more than words on a
banner.''

GUN ADVOCATES MAY SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A newspaper columnist who wants lots of letters, e-mails and
phone calls can get them easily enough. Just write a column about
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter whether you're for gun control or against it.
Both sides will respond _ and respond vehemently. If you're really
clever _ and slightly ambivalent about the issue _ you can
infuriate gun lovers and gun haters in the very same column.
</P>
<P>
   My recent column suggesting that pro-gun forces hurt their own
cause by questioning President Clinton's motives for seeking new
gun laws _ and for refusing to compromise in the gun-law debate _
earned me the wrath of those who oppose restrictions on guns. But
the column also annoyed the anti-gun crowd because it included my
longstanding opinion that gun laws are of minimal value in reducing
crime and violence _ that the real problem isn't guns, but
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gun:
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be proud; your column ... is posted prominently
today at www.freerepublic.com. Unfortunately, it's the subject of
much derision, and worse. You see, the universal conclusion is that
you're an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think gun owners should compromise? We've BEEN
compromising for 32 years. Why doesn't the other side ever
compromise? I thought the 1968 ban on `small guns' (AKA `Saturday
night specials') was supposed to make us safe. Or was it banning
`assault rifles'? Or was it the ban on high-capacity magazines?
Whatever. How come we're not `safe' yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``NO MORE COMPROMISES!''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think you fall into the NRA `trap' too readily with
respect to the effectiveness of gun controls, since statistically,
only a minority of gun deaths and injuries are inflicted by
criminals who set out to rob or kill, whereas most are accidents,
crimes of passion, or unintended consequences of the ready
availability of guns. Registration and licensing requirements,
trigger locks, etc., would not `infringe' the ability of a merchant
or homeowner to obtain means of self protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky me, I don't have to decide which of these readers is right
and which is wrong. And I don't have to cast a vote in any
legislature, federal or state, on the many gun bills that are
constantly being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   I have my point of view, of course, and I have consistently
supported the right to keep and bear arms _ although I might be
tempted to re-evaluate my position if the pro-gun folks insist on
calling me an idiot every time I disagree with them.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me back to the previous column. The point I was
trying to make was that the combative intransigence of the National
Rifle Association and its devotees could result in more damage to
the rights of gun owners than the occasional compromise ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I understand the ``slippery slope'' argument, which says
that every new restriction on the rights of gun owners leads
inexorably toward the day when those rights are abolished. I agree
that a free society must be vigilant to the menace of
incrementalism where essential rights are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Once the voracious jaws of government start nibbling at precious
freedoms, there is the constant danger that liberty will be totally
and irrevocably consumed.
</P>
<P>
   However. The refusal of gun-rights proponents to even consider
the possibility that some gun-control measures might be worthwhile
could turn out to be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   As the NRA shouts down more and more attempts to reduce the
availability of guns in this country, many Americans are becoming
more and more frustrated. When U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New
York declared recently that ``the moms of America'' were growing
impatient with the gun lobby, she was issuing a warning that those
who value the Second Amendment should heed.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates such as Clinton and McCarthy have the
public's attention on this issue, and they are winning the
argument. If the NRA isn't careful, gradual erosion of gun rights
could turn out to be the least of its worries; the American people
might just decide to skip the incremental restrictions and go
straight for the all-out gun ban.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the gun lovers can hold off the gun haters forever by
refusing to give an inch. But if they bet the farm on it and lose _
well, who's the idiot then?

WALL STREET CASTS A DOUBTFUL EYE ON SOVEREIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the good news: Sovereign Bancorp.'s deal to take over
hundreds of bank branches divested during the merger of Fleet
Financial Corp. and BankBoston Corp. has already generated millions
of dollars in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: The loans were actually written for Sovereign
executives, to cover brokerage margin calls as the value of their
company stock continued to sink.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been skeptical of Sovereign's big New
England divestiture grab since Day One. The stock, down nearly 60
percent over the last year, barely registered a pulse as financial
shares began to rally back last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent document, Sovereign said that it loaned millions to
a handful of key executives in November, to cover bonus-related
taxes and margin calls on bankers who had borrowed to buy withering
company stock.
</P>
<P>
   Top on the list: chief executive Jay Sidhu, who took a $6.2
million loan. Two other officers borrowed a combined $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign's stock was already in a serious funk well before
rumors got around that it might be the big winner in the
Fleet-BankBoston divestiture last year.
</P>
<P>
   The shares moved higher for one day in September, right after
Sovereign officially won the right to buy 278 bank branches for
$1.4 billion. Since then, Sovereign shares have lost another 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The big March financial stock rally hasn't budged Sovereign
shares. While FleetBoston Financial Corp. has rallied 44 percent,
Sovereign stock has shed another fraction of a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't the huge divestiture victory for a relatively
small Pennsylvania institution translate into investor optimism? It
is precisely this scale issue, the enormity of the job, that makes
people nervous. Can they actually make the mechanics work, and will
the regional economy remain rosy long enough, probably for a couple
of years, for Sovereign to establish itself in good times?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereign is a long-term show-me situation,'' said analyst
James Ackor of Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign's stock woes have not been endured in a vacuum. Most
bank stocks have been badly depressed, and company executives note
that the market has been even worse for midsize institutions like
Sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good chunk of our decrease is sector-related,'' said Mark
McCollom, chief accounting officer at Sovereign. ``While we can't
control certain market influences, we believe we can control our
core growth rate in earnings _ and that's what we're trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet divestiture, originally planned as a single
transaction, has been reorganized as a staggered transfer, easing
Sovereign capital issues and making the actual change in operations
more managable.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign took over operations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and
parts of Western Massachusetts late last month. The balance of the
transfer, involving Eastern Massachusetts offices, will take place
in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, Sovereign reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a third of it, and that's a good sample,''
said John Hamill, chief executive of Sovereign New England.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the conversion is smooth and New England's
economy remains strong, some analysts believe Sovereign stock will
be poised for a rally. It is so cheap now, selling a bit over six
times earnings, that a healthy Sovereign has to be worth more, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming the conversion goes reasonably well, this stock
should be a double,'' said analyst Bruce Harting of Lehman
Brothers. ``There's not another name that represents this kind of
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   But that assumption will take time to play out. Sovereign's
quarterly earnings report, due next week, will reflect only a
sliver of the Fleet divestiture. A full picture could take several
quarters to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is negligible, but there's no compelling
near-term catalyst to move this stock up in the next six months,''
said Ackor, the Tucker Anthony analyst.

RUSSIAN DUMA APPROVES ARMS REDUCTION TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed)

START II is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Russian Duma Friday approved the long-delayed nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the United States, laying the ground for a
reduction of several thousand nuclear missiles on both sides and
opening the way to even more dramatic cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as START II, passed in the Duma, the lower
house of the Russian parliament, by a lopsided vote of 288-131,
with four abstentions. The Federation Council, the parliament's
upper house, is expected to approve it April 19, after which
President Vladimir Putin will sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin went before the Duma Friday to press the legislators to
approve the treaty, which was signed in 1993 but has been stalled
in Russia since the U.S. Congress ratified it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the treaty any further, Putin warned, ``can prompt a
nuclear arms race that Russia can ill-afford and whose consequence
would be even worse than the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin also warned that Russia would pull out of START II and
other arms treaties if the United States changed the anti-ballistic
missile treaty that it reached with the former Soviet Union in
1992. Congress wants to amend that treaty to allow the United
States to build a new anti-ballistic missile shield as protection
against accidental launchings and attacks by ``rogue'' states.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States does that, Putin assured the Duma
legislators, ``we will withdraw not only from the START II treaty
but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of
strategic and conventional weapons,'' according to the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   START II would reduce the number of missile warheads on each
side from 6,000 to 3,500 by the end of 2007. It would also ban
multiple warheads on land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position is that the current treaty must be ratified
before any deeper cuts can be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   START II was supported by the Russian military, which has been
drained of funds to maintain its nuclear arsenal because of
Russia's economic problems and war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing through the treaty's ratification, Putin demonstrated
his ability to prod the Duma into action and made a positive
gesture toward the West before he visits Britain on Sunday. The
vote Friday removes an irritant in Russian-U.S. relations, which
have also been strained by the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and
Yugoslavia and Russia's war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In accomplishing within a month of his election what his
predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, had failed to do in six years in
office, Putin benefited from the more centrist legislature that
emerged from Russia's parliamentary elections last December. The
Communists, who lost the majority they previously enjoyed in the
Duma, had obstructed passage of START II for nearly five years,
contending that it would only enhance the military superiority of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is visiting
Ukraine, hailed the Duma's ratification of the treaty as historic
and a boost for international security.

PICKING THROUGH BELICHICK'S PAST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ One thing Bill Belichick would like to make
clear as he prepares to run his first draft for the New England
Patriots _ and his first draft in five years _ Saturday is that the
phones in the war room are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legend that has grown up around his final draft with
the Cleveland Browns, he insisted this week on at least this: he
never threw the phone. Honest he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the story goes, Belichick was ready to take Penn State
tight end Kyle Brady with the 10th pick, a selection many in the
organization backed. But the New York Jets grabbed Brady out from
under the Browns' noses and what happened next has been the subject
of some debate ever since.
</P>
<P>
   According to both ESPN and published reports at the time, an
enraged Belichick grabbed a phone and hurled it into the wall.
According to Belichick and his drafting aide at the time, Mike
Lombardi, nothing like that happened. According to others in
Cleveland, it's gospel. Considering the way Brady's career turned
out, he wasn't worth denting the phone any way, but that's a
separate issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that was true,'' insisted Lombardi this week. ``I'll
take a lie detector test on that. Were we upset that he was taken
right ahead of us? Yeah, but Bill wasn't really that crazy about
Brady.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's story coincided with that of his former assistant.
``Some people in the organization wanted Brady,'' he said. ``How
badly, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What Belichick does know is what followed, which was his
decision to trade out of the 10th slot all the way down to No. 30,
where he selected an undersized Ohio State linebacker named Craig
Powell, who did little in football after suffering a severe knee
injury that summer and is no longer in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Whom he could have taken at No. 10, however, is of more
importance, because he could have taken someone who became one of
the best defensive linemen in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I learned from that draft, and I think Bill learned
as well, was that we were not prepared to make the right decision
on a certain player,'' recalled Lombardi, who now works in
personnel with the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Warren Sapp. We'd lost James Jones to Denver and
Michael Dean Perry, too, so we were looking for defensive linemen.
If we were prepared and known if Sapp was a good or bad guy, we
would have taken him and things would have been fine. But we didn't
know so we traded back and took Powell, who wasn't a very good
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, you have to learn from your mistakes. There's no
Draft Management 101 course. I know I learned from that case and I
believe Bill did, too. That will not happen again to either of us.
One thing about Bill, he analyzed every draft and studied our
mistakes. He doesn't make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mistake that day _ putting the telephone aside _ was that
his organization lacked enough information on one player and
gambled on another. During the five years Belichick was the Browns'
head coach and general manager (1991-95), he drafted some good
players but missed on what seems like more than the norm. What that
bodes for the Patriots' future is impossible to determine. All that
is sure is that Belichick once again has the final say, so the
credit _ not to mention the blame _ will fall on him one way or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in Cleveland, a team Belichick rebuilt from the
slovenly 3-13 group he inherited into an 11-5 playoff team four
years later. But his drafts were not as helpful as one might figure
considering where Cleveland picked, which is a concern of many
Patriot watchers as Belichick tries to reinforce a team that went
into a second-half free fall last season and now seems in need of
more help than it should have needed considering the favorable
drafting position it owned the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year of selecting, Belichick got a Pro Bowl player
in safety Eric Turner, the second pick overall, and another
productive one in the sixth round in wide receiver Michael Jackson,
who twice led the Browns in receptions. He hit again in 1994 on
Derrick Alexander, a receiver who remains the Chiefs' best pass
catcher, and got some solid years out of center Steve Everitt,
cornerback Antonio Langham (until he lost his confidence),
linebacker Gerald Dixon, defensive linemen James Jones and Pio
Sagapolutele, and a good season from Mike Frederick before being
fired after the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick also had some spectacular misses, such as Powell,
guard Ed King, defensive lineman Bill Johnson, and wide receiver
Pat Rowe, all second- and third-round choices no longer in
football. Several of those failures suffered serious injuries early
in their careers, which is more a case of bad luck than bad
analysis, but the most glaring deficiency in Belichick's Cleveland
drafts came near the end of them.
</P>
<P>
   From the fourth round on, he seldom seemed to pick a serviceable
player with the exception of Jackson in 1991; in fact, only nine of
his picks from those rounds remain in the league. That is a
deficiency Belichick seems to recognize as he enters the second
phase of his head coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to know what you're taking,'' Belichick said
this week. ``If I learned anything, I learned to cut down on the
risks you take. If a guy has all the variables of size and speed
but wasn't a good college player, you can make excuses for why that
was and convince yourself you can change it. But what I learned is
if you take a guy who didn't do much in college, regardless of the
reason, you're betting against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cleveland we did it more than we should have. What I
learned was that good athletes who are not good players in college
generally continue not to be good players in the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization alone should save him from making more
selections like Johnson, a fat defensive lineman with a bad
attitude who never did a thing in the NFL, or Rico Smith, a fast
wide receiver with bad hands, or Isaac Booth, a tall cornerback (6
feet 3 1/2 inches) who simply couldn't play in a uniform as well as
he looked wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think he and I both came to understand is why do we
think we're going to get a guy to play if the coach at Purdue or
somewhere couldn't?'' Lombardi said. ``We all want to say they
screwed him up and we can coach him. What we learned is that isn't
often the case.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What will be the case throughout his future drafts is that there
are certain principles Belichick believes in and will generally
adhere to.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that he builds his teams from the middle out,
believing that players in the middle of the field are closer to the
ball and hence have a greater impact on the game. That means he
looks for safeties, centers, middle linebackers, quarterbacks, and
running backs first, although that assumes such needs exist.
</P>
<P>
   If one looks at his Cleveland drafts, a clear pattern emerged,
as he took a safety, guard, and two interior defensive linemen with
his first four picks in 1991, a fullback type in Tommy Vardell No.
1 the next year, a center with his first pick in 1993, and a
linebacker and quarterback with his first two picks in 1995. That
doesn't mean he will go that way, but it is a sure sign of how he
believes a team is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different here than it was in Cleveland,'' Belichick
said. ``There's a much better base to build from, but some of the
same principles apply. I do believe if you've got good players in
the middle of the field they're involved in every play. The farther
out you are the less involved you become.''
</P>
<P>
   The next area of focus for Belichick is in high-production
players who fit a size-speed ratio. That does not mean he won't
ever reach for an undersized player or one slower than he might
like, but, as he learned in Cleveland, production and speed are two
sound indicators of a player's chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size and speed is the place to start,'' Belichick said. ``If
you want a big, fast team, you need big, fast players. You draft a
lot of slow guys you can only end up with one kind of team. There
are always exceptions but I do put a lot of emphasis on size and
speed.''

<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ The old brick wall slouches by a wooded glen
along busy Grove Street, a crumbling divider between present and
past, memory and ignorance, freedom and servitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that in 1765, 18 years before Massachusetts outlawed
the owning of human beings, an enslaved African-American named
Pompeii built the wall, making the bricks from local clay.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-foot wall formed half of an entry gate to a 400-acre
plantation owned by the Brooks family, whose well-known
contributions to Medford stand in stark contrast to those of
``Pomp'' and the dozens of slaves who once toiled there.
</P>
<P>
   As a monument to those who suffered the horrors of slavery, the
wall may seem a perplexing choice _ especially since Medford is
home to the well-preserved Royall House, site of the only remaining
slave quarters north of the Mason-Dixon line. The ``Old Slave
Wall,'' by comparison, appears ready to topple, and its cracked
face is marred by generations of graffiti, moss, and whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   But to a growing number of people, the Slave Wall is an ideal
candidate for a memorial to the un-heralded achievements of Pomp
and his fellow slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The wall, its admirers say, offers testament to the workaday
activities slaves were forced to do _ and is a stark reminder that
even in the cradle of abolition, slaves toiled for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The admirers, both black and white, are seeking public and
private money to shore up the wall, erect a plaque, and create a
small park behind it where visitors could view it comfortably. The
project would cost at least $25,000, said Jay Griffin, head of the
Medford Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I, like all of us, owe the wall some
recognition,'' said Pamela Goncalves, 47, an African-American
Medford resident who is leading the fledgling campaign. ``I owe
something to the people who suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Goncalves, who learned of the structure while researching for
her historic drama troupe called ``The Colored Ladies,'' has
touched on a topic that has been a sensitive issue in parts of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In Winthrop, battle lines have been drawn over the erecting of a
sign that calls attention to the slave trading and slave ownership
of Deane Winthrop, son of the state's first governor, whose home
gave the town its name.
</P>
<P>
   In Framingham, a controversy has flared as citizens prepare for
the town's 300th anniversary celebration, which will include a
reenactment of a Civil War battle. Some are saying that the
inclusion of a Confederate Flag in the festivities is offensive and
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   For a state that trumpets its role in the abolition of slavery,
Massachusetts has a ways to go before it comes to terms with its
role in American history's uglier chapters, some observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's ironic is that the people at the forefront of
preserving the history of slavery are all down South,'' said Byron
Rushing, a state representative from Boston and the former
executive director of the Museum of Afro American History in
Boston. ``In Massachusetts, you would not think that we would have
a problem talking about slavery, since we were the first state to
abolish it. You would think that would balance out the concern that
this is so negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Medford, which had slaves since the area was settled by British
colonists in the 1630s, has not escaped the now predictable strife
that follows discussions of slavery's place in local history. For
the past several years, some in the city have fiercely debated the
merits of a Depression-era mural in the post office that depicts a
black slave laboring in shackles. And about a decade ago, there was
also discussion about pulling down the slave quarters at the Royall
House.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, it seems, the city's historic
preservationists, political leaders, and community leaders appear
to agree: the Slave Wall should get its due.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Victorian houses, but there's only one
Slave Wall,'' said Thomas Lincoln, head of the Medford-Brooks State
Land Trust, the city-owned property where the wall stands. The
wall, he said, ``is a reminder that slavery is part of Medford's
history, that we hope we're doing better, and that we've hopefully
learned some lessons. It's not celebrating slavery. It's
celebrating the fortitude of slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Michael J. McGlynn said he has yet to hear from Goncalves
or others, but said that creating a permanent slave memorial at the
wall was ``a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should stand as a monument for what should never happen
again,'' McGlynn said. ``You have to bring these things up front,
you have to let people discuss it, then take direction from the
community at large to see what they want to preserve. . . . But you
can't bury history, no matter how bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make the wall a monument come at a time when
Medford's connections to slavery are under more scrutiny than ever,
said Griffin, the historical society head and a Medford High School
history teacher who lives with his family in the Royall House slave
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a team of Boston University archaelogists conducted
a dig at the Royall House to try to better understand the lives of
the 27 slaves who lived there. And currently, a team of Tufts
University scholars are busy preserving 19 letters owned by the
Medford Historical Society penned by 18th century slave ship
captains from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gittleman, president of the Royall House Association and
director of interpretation and education at the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston, said he finds
the new focus on slavery important and refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do much more to explore and interpret that
history,'' Gittleman said, adding that he hopes to convert the
slave quarters into an educational center about slavery in New
England. ``We don't want to wait until we have it perfect. We want
to start right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goncalves, a program director for a social service center in
East Boston, the Slave Wall stands out as the most important
restoration project in Medford. Its obscurity and bad condition,
she says, is an affront to all of the African-American slaves of
the area, and it should shoot to the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't find landmarks like that every day,'' Goncalves
said. ``It deserves recognition.''

<P>
   Welcome to presto pasta.
</P>
<P>
   We called our latest taste test the three-minute showdown.
</P>
<P>
   From the shopping bag to the table in five minutes, tops.
Prepared at home, too.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we're not talking gourmet dining. More like school
cafeteria eats. But our goal was not four-star (or three, or two)
cuisine. It was convenience and comparison. An old standby vs. a
brand-new product, two corporate giants going head to head.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner, Franco-American Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce with
Cheese. Pasta in a can. Open, put it in a bowl with a lid or cover
and microwave for 4 minutes (for a 26-ounce container). The
Campbell Soup Co. item has been a supermarket staple since before
the invention of the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner, Classico It's Pasta Anytime. Pre-cooked
spaghetti and sauce in a microwave container. Peel top film off,
pour pasta into tray, pour sauce around edges, lay film back across
top and zap for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's Pasta Anytime is new, first available in early March.
Albany, N.Y., five other Northeast metropolitan areas and Denver
are test-market sites. The non-refrigerated product is not
scheduled to go national until June. You'll find this Borden Co.
offering on the same shelves as boxes of dry pastas.
</P>
<P>
   We recruited six eager lunch eaters to sample the two side by
side, not knowing what they were about to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: It's Pasta Anytime. Which might just prove that you
get what you pay for, because It's Pasta Anytime is five times more
expensive than its Franco-American counterpart, 16 cents an ounce
vs. a mere 3 cents per ounce. The suggested retail price for a
15-ounce package of It's Pasta Anytime is $2.99 while a 26-ounce
can of Franco-American costs 84 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of our six samplers preferred Franco-American to It's
Pasta Anytime. She particularly liked the appearance of
Franco-American, giving it an 8 grade (out of 10) compared with a 2
for It's Pasta Anytime (which she said looks ``like spaghetti in
tomato soup.'')
</P>
<P>
   The final question in our taste test was: ``I'd buy this one,''
with a chance to check either dish. The woman who graded
Franco-American higher said she would buy It's Pasta Anytime for
her children, Franco-American for herself.
</P>
<P>
   However, the yellow-orange color of the sauce that comes out of
the Franco-American can was off-putting to a majority of our
tasters. Two of the six tasters likened it, appropriately enough,
to Chef Boyardee, another Campbell's product. Needless to say, this
comparison was not intended as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, It's Pasta Anytime received a number of
favorable comments for its appearance. ``Like it could be
homemade,'' wrote two of our panelists, while another said ``looks
like spaghetti in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   As for taste, those who preferred Pasta Anytime said ``Like
regular pasta, some interesting spices even. Not overly gooey with
sauce,'' and ``sweetish, with more of a sun-dried tomato flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to nutritional content and the actual
ingredients in these two products.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these presto pasta dishes would receive high praise
from a dietitian. Both are made with far more salt (37 percent of
the daily value of sodium in a serving of It's Pasta Anytime, 43
percent in Franco-American) and sugar (18 grams for It's Pasta
Anytime, 14 grams for Franco-American) than a tomato sauce I would
make at home in less than a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why two of our six tasters claimed they
would buy neither dish. Said one of these diners about Pasta
Anytime: ``Sour and tangy, but has some tomato flavor.'' Another of
our tasters, commenting on Franco-American, said, ``Like flour
that's not quite cooked and vaguely salty and tomatoey goo.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither presto pasta dish received rave reviews, it should
be noted that both lived up to their billing in terms of
preparation time. Both were out of the bag, into the microwave and
on the table in five minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America has at least mastered the presto part of this
experiment. Now it's time to concentrate on improving the pasta.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Modesty prevents two-time Boston Marathon champion
Moses Tanui from making predictions about Monday's race. When asked
whom he thinks will win, Tanui coyly smiles, looks up at the
ceiling in mock surprise, and carefully considers his answer.
Considering that Kenyan runners have dominated the last nine races,
Tanui would not appear arrogant if he forecasted a win by one of
his countrymen. But he cannot bring himself to make such a
statement. Instead, he leans forward as if telling a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying in Kenya,'' said Tanui. ``You cannot buy
clothes for a child before the child is born.''
</P>
<P>
   With the unpretentious style that makes the Kenyans both popular
and successful, Tanui served notice that he and his countrymen take
nothing for granted. The streak of nine consecutive Boston Marathon
wins by a Kenyan man is a source of pride, but not an assurance of
future wins. The last non-Kenyan to take home the title was Gelindo
Bordin in 1990. This year, South Africa and Ethiopia have brought
teams of runners in an effort to end the string of wins by their
African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But while Tanui won't predict a 10th consecutive win for a
runner from his homeland, the 10 male Kenyan competitors entered in
the 104th Boston Marathon are all top contenders and would like
nothing more than to add to Kenyan lore. Of all the big city
marathons contested each year, none draws the attention of the
Kenyan public or generates more reverence from Kenyan marathoners
than Boston. Aspiring long-distance runners from Eldoret,
Elmarakwet, Kisii, and the Nandi District dream of competing in the
Hub. And this year, with two Kenyan Olympic bids determined by
Boston Marathon finishes, the motivation for each Kenyan to finish
first has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Boston is a very unique marathon,'' said Tanui. ``It's
a very challenging marathon with hard ups and downs. It's good
competition for the Kenyan athletes, and we like competing in
marathons that are a challenge. We like tough challenges so that we
can prove that we are the best, and Boston is one of the toughest
marathons in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The successes of their countrymen also provide motivation for
the Kenyans. While the initial attraction may have been the
challenge of the course, the almost decade-long success of Kenyans
in Boston has made the local marathon practically a rite of
passage. After winning last year, Joseph Chebet was invited to
cross-country and track meets all over his country and paraded out
as the Boston Marathon champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Kenyans come to Boston because for the past years Kenyans
have been performing well,'' said Ondoro Osoro, who will make his
first appearance in Boston Monday and who ran the world's fastest
debut marathon (2:06:54 in Chicago in 1998). ``When you go to a
race you never know if you are going to win or not. It depends on
how your training has been. But from the past performances of the
fellow Kenyans, when someone (from Kenya) comes here, they (the
fans) are much more impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan winning streak stretches through the 1990s and
contains many of the best marathoners the world has watched.
Ibrahim Hussein won back-to-back after Bordin. Then Cosmas Ndeti
became the first runner to win three consecutive marathons (1993,
'94, '95) since Massachusetts resident Bill Rodgers accomplished
the feat (1978, '79, '80). Tanui earned his place in Boston lore by
winning the centennial edition in 1996 and triumphing again in
1998. Lameck Aguta took home the 1997 championship, and last year
belonged to Chebet. The yet-to-be-determined 2000 titlist likely
will become one of the gold medal favorites for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to Kenya was 1979 and what I thought
then was that if these people ever get organized, then it can
evolve from there,'' said agent and coach Kim McDonald, who
supervises more than 50 Kenyan athletes. ``For Kenyans, this is
their chance. Therefore, their willingness and eagerness to train
hard is probably second to none as a group and a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a few Americans who are willing to train very hard.
You've got a few British people who are willing to train very hard.
But as a group, there's nothing to compare with Kenyans. Winning
the Boston Marathon for them is their opportunity to go back and
purchase land and businesses and support their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the key points in why there is now the history
in the Boston Marathon is because the Boston Marathon to Kenyan
marathon runners is the second biggest marathon after the Olympics.
Therefore, it's continued to attract after Ibrahim Hussein, Cosmas
Ndeti, Moses Tanui. This is the race they want to win. Because of
the course and the weather, it might not be the fastest marathon in
the world, but again, this is a race that matters in Kenya.''
</P>
<P>
   The illustrious Kenyan history and the emphasis Kenyans put on
the race have kept other nations out of the top spot. But
representatives from Ethiopia and South Africa approach the race
more from an individual perspective. They do not view the Kenyans
as unbeatable, but believe the best prepared runner will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kenyans train very hard for this race, but this year I'm
trained better (than before),'' said Abner Chipu of South Africa,
who finished fourth last year in 2:12:46. ``This year, I trust
myself and I'm trained better. Maybe I can satisfy my mind. I'm not
worried. We have to challenge each other. It's just like a game.
You can win. You can lose. They can win. They can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   South African Elana Meyer will compete in the women's race,
where a Kenyan has yet to earn the title. Still, Meyer has
experienced the worldwide success of the Kenyan women and can
relate to Boston Marathon history that does not seem to favor her
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the end it's about individual performances,'' Meyer
said. ``You do it on your own legs. For other runners, it might be
intimidating to run against the Kenyan men because they have such a
strong tradition in running. Surely, it helps to train in groups. I
think it's a positive factor they (the South African men) trained
together and trained hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan women, who will be represented by Lornah Kiplagat and
Catherine Ndereba, may soon be replicating their countrymen's
long-term, long-distance achievements. At least, that's what they
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly by slowly, it (the wins) will come,'' said Kiplagat.
``We have to be patient, but it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ndereba: ``We are hoping they'll (the Kenyan women) soon
be dominating (in Boston).''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are too modest to outwardly declare themselves
among the top contenders in both the men's and women's races,
results of the 2000 Boston Marathon could easily add two more
Kenyan names to the list of champions. Until then, the Kenyans will
deflect attention away from past achievements and not proclaim
themselves unbeatable. After all, the Kenyans may know better than
anyone that training, not history, wins marathons. But with that
being the case, everyone knows the Kenyans are in great shape. Even
Tanui will briefly put aside his self-effacing manner and
acknowledge the Kenyans are well prepared to protect their streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Kenyan that is coming in can win the marathon,'' he said.
``Any time a Kenyan wins, that's our pride.''

TRADE TALK CONTINUES TO SWIRL AROUND RADKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Even before he trotted in from the visiting bullpen,
the Fenway Park crowd began talking up a Red Sox trade for
Minnesota righthander Brad Radke. The low-budget, cost-conscious
Twins are likely to make him available before season's end.
</P>
<P>
   The question is at what price? And do the Red Sox feel a
pressing need to add a pitcher to the rotation while taking another
hit to the farm system?
</P>
<P>
   Radke got a no-decision Thursday night, yielding three runs on
six hits in 6 2/3 innings for his best outing in three starts this
season. Outings like that are good enough to draw interest from
potential playoff teams, even though Radke will be a free agent
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   With a hard sinker and tantalizing changeup, Radke is a bargain
this year with a $3.2 million salary. But there is no guarantee a
trade will come now, or when the trading deadline approaches this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered,'' Radke said of the interest he has drawn.
``But you don't carry that out to the mound. You have to stay
focused to get guys out. I thought I did a pretty good job of that
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked about it in every city thus far. But it's no big
deal. I'm under contract until the end of this season. I have an
obligation to do my best for these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have never been shy about tracking pitching talent
and would love to have a Radke around if the price is right. But
there is more than money and statistics to evaluate, said general
manager Dan Duquette. In April, you look at your own talent first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some starters who should be able to do a decent
job,'' said Duquette. ``We'd like to look at them before we have to
give up half our farm system for another pitcher. We have to
explore those items, too. Let's say a Bret Saberhagen comes back
and these other guys we have out there are pitching good. That's a
pretty good rotation. Maybe Rod Beck will come back and help our
bullpen situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an ace. Hopefully, we can get a No. 2 situation out of
Ramon Martinez or Saberhagen. A lot of things can happen between
now and the closing months of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're talking pitchers or position players, the Red Sox
want to maintain a strong flow from the farm system. Pitching depth
is essential, so a solid pitcher like Radke can expect to at least
double his annual pay on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   A strong farm system is important not only to fill your own
lineup, but to have talent to deal for established veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody around here complained when Boston gave up two pitching
prospects, Carl Pavano and Tony Armas Jr., to Montreal for Pedro
Martinez. But until Carl Everett won over the Fenway Faithful with
his fast start, there was some grumbling about giving hot shot
shortstop prospect Adam Everett to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the home-grown pitchers? Brian Rose, a second-round
draft choice, will pitch tonight. But gone are can't-miss prospects
like Frankie Rodriguez (drafted in 1990, now with Seattle), Aaron
Sele (1991, also in Seattle), and Jeff Suppan 1993, Kansas City).
In the last two years, the Sox have traded more than a half-dozen
minor league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Replacements are coming. The ballyhooed pitching prospects this
spring were Koreans Sun-Woo Kim, Sang Lee, and Jin Ho Cho, and
Tomokazu Ohka of Japan. Cho is injured, the rest are in Pawtucket.
Not to be forgotten is righthander Juan Pena, who suffered a torn
ligament in his right elbow in spring training and is out for the
season. Whether and when the Asian contingent contributes remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   So where might Radke fit in with the Sox?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' said Duquette. ``You build up your
system and will use some of those players and trade some of them.
But there is a strategy to what we do. It was a trade that brought
Pedro here. We gave up value for value.''
</P>
<P>
   Trades are made to help the entire organization, added assistant
general manager Ed Kenney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's movement is not like a Jeff Bagwell-for-Larry Andersen
trade we made back in 1990,'' he said. ``You have to consider
everything. The game has changed because of the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference. People talk positively about the
Red Sox because they made the playoffs two consecutive years. Well,
the only reason they were able to do so was because of the wild
card. You have so many opportunities. There will be years in which
you've got a chance to win the whole thing. If that is the case,
you've got to trade a prospect to get that starting pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are still calling about Dernell Stenson and Donnie Sadler.
They've called about Wilton Veras, but he's on duty at third base
these days, replacing the injured John Valentin. There are others
in the lower minors who find scouts charting their every move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely unfair the way the system works now,'' said
Twins manager Tom Kelly. ``You get a good young player, develop
him, and then see his success spoil what he's trying to accomplish.
(Radke's) the only player people want to talk to. Everything is on
his shoulders but all we've ever asked him to do is go out and give
us a chance to win the ballgame. He did that tonight. That's all we
can ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a chance he will stay in Minnesota. He likes it
there. But he doesn't want to talk contract with anybody until the
season ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have to find out about Pete Schourek, whose pitching
line was strikingly similar to Radke's (6 2/3 innings, 6 hits, 3
runs, 2 earned), and Saberhagen, Duquette said. If both do well,
the Sox might never have to consider a trade for a Radke. By July
or September, somebody else may be a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have time to wait and see what happens,'' said Duquette.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You can also count on Belichick drafting several defensive and
offensive linemen in nearly every draft. In addition, he'll sign
several more linemen as free agent rookies, something he had
stunning success with in Cleveland with the likes of Orlando Brown
and Wally Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Although Belichick and Lombardi did not have great success
drafting in later rounds, they did have success when the scramble
was on for free agent rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always takes a couple of defensive linemen,'' said one NFL
personnel man familiar with Belichick's past drafts. ``You can't
find them so he's going to pick one or two every year and try to
develop them. He believes it takes two years to develop those young
linemen and he has a program to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to pick offensive linemen early (although he
took Everitt in the first round and King in the second) very often
because he believes if a guy is taken on the fourth round or sooner
he has to play and a lot of these guys aren't ready to play for
several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick began looking for developmental players as free agents
in Cleveland beginning in 1993 and admits he began to have his
organization concentrate a bit too much on that area and not enough
on the draft's fourth through seventh rounds. This time around he
will try to balance the two, knowing the rookie free agent route is
something his system of evaluation and player development already
has proven works well for him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned how to do that,'' Belichick said. ``We learned how
to identify developmental players and bring them along.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belichick almost always stands by his draft board's ratings
unless there is an overwhelming need to fill. If a bunch of players
are graded about the same, he might take the one that fills his
biggest priority. But if one player's grade is substantially better
than the others on the board, the decision is made not by Belichick
but by the evaluation system he has in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do whatever you can to improve your team so if you have a
severe need you draft the guy, especially if it appears there's no
one else who will be there later who can help,'' Belichick said.
``Otherwise, you take the higher rated guy if you can live with
what you've got at other positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't generally reach too far (down the board). You spend
a lot of money to scout these players so why would you pass 20 guys
you've rated ahead of somebody to take him? What are we evaluating
them for if we do that?''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the one thing Belichick will surely be is
prepared. He and his staff will not make the Warren Sapp mistake
again. They will be what he will ask his team to be next fall. They
will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is preparation,'' Belichick said. ``You have to
be sure you know all the players on the board and what they can do
for your team. I ask my scouts before we take someone `Is he a
potential starter? Is he a special teams player? What exactly can
the guy do for our team?' I don't care what he can do for somebody
else. What can he do for the New England Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take somebody and the scouts tell me he should be a
certain type player and it turns out otherwise, then they're
accountable. I ask them, `What were you looking at?' That's the
accountability side of it. If I elect not to use a guy in the role
they said he'd fill, that's a different issue. Then it's my fault
if he's not successful. So the main thing before we take a guy is
knowing what we're going to ask him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drafting is far from an exact science. A lot of these players
are far different two years after they've been in the league then
they are coming out of college. They're often not the same player
at all. You have to be able to project that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he learned in Cleveland though, you also have to be able to
restrain yourself from projecting something else too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the signs are there that a player has been
unproductive because that's who he is, but you see something you
like and it's gold dust,'' Belichick said. ``What I learned in
Cleveland is it usually turns out just to be dust. That's why, with
the exception of linemen who I believe develop more in their first
two years in the league than most other players, I prefer to take
players who were productive over a long period of time in college.
You can't base everything on production, but it counts for a lot.
Hopefully I have a better handle on that aspect of drafting this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   That and perhaps on the phone handles if something goes wrong.

BLAKE ADDS GREEN TO THE OLYMPIC MEDAL MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His language comes not from Olympus but from the
boardroom. ``Value-added.'' ``Portfolio management.'' ``Resource
allocation process.'' ``Brands and franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Blake is a businessman and he made his money and his
reputation as a turnaround artist, taking over troubled companies
like USF&AMP;G and making them profitable.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company is the non-profit US Olympic Committee,
which was ripe for a shakeup even before last year's Salt Lake City
payoff scandal. And during his first two months as the USOC's first
chief executive officer, the 58-year-old Blake has been driving
home his bottom-line agenda: Less bureaucracy, more accountability,
and more medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone recognized that something needed to be
done,'' Blake said in a wide-ranging interview Thursday on the eve
of the USOC meetings at the Westin Copley Place. ``I believe I was
brought in as a mandate for change. We're looking at a fundamental
transformation of the USOC in virtually every respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake has been streamlining and ``flattening'' the USOC's
unwieldy corporate structure, bringing in his own top staffers and
preparing to lay off as many as 70 of the committee's 500
employees. He's undertaken an unprecedented top-to-bottom review of
each of the 45 national sports governing bodies, from archery to
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And now Blake will ask the executive board to put the USOC's
money where the medals are, taking funding away from sports that
don't produce at the Games and giving it to those that do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the American people getting excited about us
finishing fifth at the Olympics,'' Blake said. ``They expect us to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   While Blake's bottom-line approach is routine in America's
boardrooms, it's revolutionary among Olympic purists, who believe
founder Baron Pierre de Coubertin's credo that the most important
thing about the Games is not winning, but taking part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who say that just being at the Games is
enough,'' said Blake. ``I'm saying, it's being there and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   National governing bodies for some sports, such as those of
track and field, swimming, and figure skating, are medal machines
that crank out gold, silver, and bronze quadrennium after
quadrennium. Others, like biathlon, team handball, and men's
weightlifting, haven't been near the award stand in years.
</P>
<P>
   If the USOC was a Fortune 500 company, it would sell off its
non-performing units or shut them down. The USOC can't do that, but
it will impose what Blake calls ``business discipline'' on NGBs
that spend millions of dollars to finish 49th. ``Eighty percent of
our funding was going out without any strings attached,'' said
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   With this summer's Games in Sydney only five months away and the
USOC's $160 million in grants already awarded, it's too late to
rework the deal. ``Any standing commitments we have, we will
honor,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Blake gets his way, future funding will depend on
performance and potential. Sports that always win medals will get
what they need. ``Like synchronized swimming,'' Blake said. ``We'll
want to protect those medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports that could produce multiple medals, like rowing and
canoe-kayak, probably will get strings-attached cash. Sports that
have never won medals, probably never will, and have little
following among American fans (like men's field hockey) probably
will see their funding chopped. ``We won't let a small-size NGB
fail,'' said Blake. ``But they'll have to do more for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That's merely Business 101 for any profit-and-loss outfit but
it's radical thinking for the NGBs, which have grown used to
cashing USOC checks with few questions asked. Blake has already
gotten several outraged earfuls about the money-for-medals approach
(``It's still a sell job,'' he conceded), so he's not expecting an
all-in-favor rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like trying to get a resolution through the United
Nations,'' Blake said. ``You have to appeal to the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's always been a challenge with the USOC, an ``organization
of organizations'' that includes everybody from USA Basketball to
the Catholic Youth Organization to the Dwarf Athletic Association
of America and which makes Balkan politics seem simple by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has always been about fiefdoms jostling with other
fiefdoms and jealously guarding their turf. Few of them agree on
anything and most don't consider winning Olympic medals as their
primary mission. ``You have some entrenched volunteer leaders that
love the limelight of being volunteer leaders,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   And some of them will be howling into open microphones when the
full board meets this weekend. ``There have been some noses out of
joint,'' Blake admitted. But the old USOC, which used to be little
more than a quadrennial travel agency, is dead. The structural
reforms voted through in February made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC president is now a board chairman. Blake has all the
day-to-day power and he hasn't been bashful about using it. When he
says ``fundamental transformation,'' he's not just rearranging
boxes on a flow chart.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Blake spent more than three hours running his 30-page
plan by the USOC's transition committee. ``What I found most
reassuring,'' he said, ``was that everybody recognized there's an
opportunity to do better than we have. If that was any indication,
I think we can come out of today's meeting with an agreement in
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that much would be a radical breakthrough for the USOC,
which has traditionally downplayed the medal chase as the central
part of the Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   If Blake gets that agreement, the NGBs will enter an unfamiliar
_ and unsettling _ world of business plans, fiscal accountability,
and a bottom line measured in precious metal. De Coubertin didn't
calculate that way, but Blake is a CEO managing a turnaround. ``I
never enter a fight,'' he says, ``unless I think I can win it.''

PROTESTERS CLAIM IMF DOES WORLD MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The front page no longer carries daily news of the
Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, and other arcane currencies.
Southeast Asia is out of recession and growing once again. Amid
American prosperity, it can be hard to remember that only two years
ago the world faced the very real prospect of a global financial
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this weekend, protesters will gather outside the offices
of the agency that led efforts to stop the crisis _ the
International Monetary Fund. Many believe the IMF does more harm
than good in the world, and they are willing to be arrested to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have a range of complaints. They say loans by the
IMF come with conditions that free up money for debt service by
cutting government investment in schools, health programs, and food
subsidies. They say some loans by the IMF and its sister agency,
the World Bank, encourage development that harms the environment.
They claim IMF programs lead to increased poverty, and debts held
by the poorest nations should be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters also take issue with the way the IMF handled the
Asian crisis, which was one of the most significant economic events
of recent times and one of the most important challenges in the
IMF's history. Even some prominent economists say the protesters
have a point; however, there is no consensus on why this startling
disruption in the economy began, or on whether the IMF's efforts to
stop it actually worked.
</P>
<P>
   How the debate sorts out could affect the world's response to
the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The fingerpointing starts with the cause of the Asian crisis,
which began in July 1997, when Thailand devalued its currency. That
helped spark currency and stock crashes in Indonesia and other
neighbors, including Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy.
Financial markets around the world became more jittery as the
crisis spread to Brazil. Then it hit Russia, whose nuclear arsenal
added a scary element to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it all begin? One school blames Asia itself and its
``crony capitalism,'' or the clubby relationships between
governments, banks and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thai real estate speculators were allowed to overbuild without
proper scrutiny of their books, this argument goes. The Korean
government wanted to become a world force in such industries as
shipbuilding and semiconductors, so it guided loans from foreign
banks into the giant Korean industrial conglomerates to build
factory capacity. When the market became glutted with chips, ships,
and capacity, the factories failed, which bankrupted companies and
stressed any local banks that had loaned them money.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF itself makes this argument in oblique language, blaming
the crisis on ``weaknesses in financial systems,'' ``governance,''
and ``government involvement in the private sector and lack of
transparency in corporate and fiscal accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Stiglitz, the Stanford economics professor who was
chief economist at the World Bank during the crisis, says ``crony
capitalism'' cannot have been the cause. ``These countries had
three decades of the most impressive growth of anywhere in the
world,'' he said in an interview, ``and they were getting less
secretive, more transparent, more independent in their banking
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz points the finger not at Asia, but at the IMF and the
United States. They pushed Asian nations to liberalize their
capital rules in the last two decades so foreigners could invest
more easily in Asian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This ``hot capital'' fueled the real estate boom in Thailand, he
argued, and the new rules allowed the money to flow out at the
first signs of trouble. Ironically, he said, Thailand and Korea did
not want to open the doors to fickle investors, and they did so
only under IMF and US pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you ask the question, `What changed in Asia in the
1990s?' the answer was capital- and financial-market
liberalization,'' Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally contentious is the IMF prescription for how to solve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF touchstones were currency reserves, government spending,
and interest rates. By maintaining a reserve of dollars, yen, or
deutsche marks, a country can buy its local currency and maintain
its value. But the troubled Asian currencies fell so steeply that
nations quickly ran out of reserves. As the local currencies sank,
companies that had borrowed money overseas found themselves having
to pay dollar-denominated loans with baht and rupiah that were
worth less and less.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF arranged cash infusions for these nations, in part to
help them defend the currencies. More than $36 billion went to
Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand alone, which grew to $118 billion as
other agencies and individual nations chipped in.
</P>
<P>
   But in return for the loans, the IMF asked borrowers to take
steps designed to induce investors to send their money back to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included raising interest rates and cutting
government spending, attempts to give investors a high return on
their money and assure them inflation would not eat away their
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also forced some nations to close their most troubled
banks, a step designed to force the banking system to acknowledge
bad loans on its books and to end ``crony capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But these measures exacted a heavy price, the critics say. ``I
was shocked by the closure of 16 banks in Indonesia when there was
no deposit insurance there,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, an economic
adviser to foreign governments and director of the Harvard
University Center for International Development. ``Lo and behold,
as anyone with some sense and experience would know, it led to a
banking crisis and helped trigger a full-fledged panic.''
</P>
<P>
   By ordering nations to hike interest rates, the IMF drove
troubled companies out of business and boosted unemployment,
critics say. And cutting government spending also put people out of
work and slowed the economy further. The IMF's prescription became
dangerous in places like Indonesia, the critics say, as the
recession caused riots and attacks on the ethnic Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot address the issue of restoring confidence just by
focusing on interest rates or deficits,'' Stiglitz said. ``You have
to have a broader perspective. The riots did more to damage
confidence (in Indonesia) than anything that could have been done
to the trade balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz and Sachs said the IMF should have allowed governments
to boost spending so people continued to work and spend money,
which would have minimized social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   They say the IMF was correct to push Western banks to roll over
their loans to Asian banks and companies, but the IMF should not
have forced nations to restructure their financial sectors. While
``crony capitalism'' may be undesirable, solving it is beyond the
IMF's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Asian economies are no longer in recession, though
they are not back to the robust health they enjoyed before the
crisis. Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank, says the rebound
validates most of the IMF approach. But critics like Sachs say the
rebound is due to foreign investors returning to Southeast Asia,
which happened only because foreign banks rolled over their loans
to Asian banks and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the debate, many economists say there is general but not
universal agreement the crisis taught several lessons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that countries should not be forced to cut budgets in the
middle of a financial crisis, as the social cost is too high, said
Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, who is not a particularly harsh critic of the IMF.
Even some IMF officials back this view, though it is uncertain how
it would guide them in a future crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is that fixed exchange rates are a mistake, Litan
said. Several Southeast Asian nations pegged their currency to the
US dollar in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Litan said. That
helped keep inflation in check and gave exporters certainty amid
the volatile international currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   But fixed rates force countries to spend reserves at times to
prop up the value of a local currency and maintain the peg to the
dollar, a burden some countries cannot bear.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed exchange rates also encourage investors to borrow in
dollars and lend in the local currency, as they believe there is
little risk of having to repay the loans in baht or rupiah that
have lost value, Litan said. When a nation abandons its fixed
exchange rate, these investors quickly pull their money from the
country and try to repay their dollar loans, which can spark a
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   More controversial is whether countries should limit their
exposure to foreign investors. Litan said many economists now
believe that, for some countries, it makes sense to bar short-term
investments and to require anyone investing in a business to keep
the money there for a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we recognize today that short-term capital flows can
be highly destabilizing,'' Stiglitz said. ``I'd say there's general
consensus on that.''

YEMENESE INCENSED   OVER IMAGE PORTRAYED BY `RULES' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key scene in America's current No. 1 box office
hit, ``Rules of Engagement,'' shows an angry mob outside the US
Embassy in Yemen. US Marines scamper on the roof. One falls dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the instant before a Marine colonel, played by Samuel L.
Jackson, orders his men to fire into the crowd, he looks at the mob
and sees Yemenite women and boys and girls firing rifles at them.
</P>
<P>
   As the scene unfolded in a Washington movie theater Thursday,
Yemen's ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab Al-Hajjri,
cringed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little girl shooting at Marines! Can you believe it?''
Al-Hajjri said. ``This movie reaches millions of people. It's a
total ruin for us. It ruins our image. Why Yemen? Even if we launch
a public campaign, how do you fight Hollywood?''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Picture's portrayal of Arabs isn't drawing the ire of
just Yemenis. Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, Thursday said that ``Rules of
Engagement'' was ``probably the most racist film ever made against
Arabs by Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only be compared to films like the ``Birth of a
Nation'' and ``The Eternal Jew'' in so far as the principled
purpose seems to be the demonization and vilification of an entire
people,'' Ibish said. ``There aren't any positive images of Arabs
in that movie. Instead, there is an explosion of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Paramount Pictures said: ```Rules of
Engagement' is a dramatization and a fictional account of the
consequences of extremism in all its forms. The film is not an
indictment of any government, culture or people. Rather, it
explores the human tragedy and consequences that can result when
people of any society are put in extreme situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount did not respond to a question from the Boston Globe on
why it decided to identify a country, and why it chose Yemen in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which was released April 7 and earned $15 million
last weekend, is about upholding Marine honor in the line of fire.
The story involves an evacuation of the US ambassador to Yemen in
Sana'a under sniper fire, the Marines' return of fire that kills 83
Yemenites and court-martial proceedings of the colonel for ordering
the shooting into the crowd. Tommy Lee Jones also stars in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's negative portrayals of Arabs has long been a point
of contention among Arab-Americans, many of whom believe it fuels
the malacious image of Arabs as terrorists. The Arab
Anti-Discrimination group has sharply criticized several other
recent movies, including ``The Siege'' and ``True Lies,'' while
finding only one film, ``The 13th Warrior,'' portraying a major
Arab character in good light.
</P>
<P>
   Ibish predicted ``Rules of Engagement'' will spark
demonstrations in coming weeks in several cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even stooped to portraying Arab children _ even paralyzed
little girls _ as hateful, vicious anti-American fanatics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Ambassador Al-Hajjri, the problem also includes his
country's image. For many Americans, the fictitious film will be
their first exposure to Yemen _ even though the film was shot at
the other end of the Arab world, in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of Yemen, population 16 million, desperately poor,
sitting on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula, is that
it may be a traveler's last window into the all-but-disappeared
Arab world of ``The Thousand and One Nights.'' Sana'a boasts some
of world's most beautiful architecture, with many of its houses
built in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen also is not on the US State Department's list of countries
sponsoring terrorism, and there have been no anti-American protests
there recently. But the country is well-known for its spate of
hostage-taking. Tribes often take travelers as hostages and release
them unharmed, although four hostages were killed in one incident
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens rarely,'' Al-Hajjri said. ``It's a bad thing, but
we hear of worse things all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hajjri, 40, who received a master's degree in law from
American University, has tried to build Yemen's reputation in his 2
1/2 years in Washington. He has invited hundreds of high school and
college students to his embassy. He has raised his country's
profile in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie, he fears, could be a huge setback in public
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend going to Yemen, and his mother just called
him, saying she was worried about him going now,'' the ambassador
said. ``I think what I'll do is invite the producer and all the
stars to Yemen so they can see for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador saw the movie for a second time Thursday so that
he could read the fine print at the end of the film.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie showed the street scene outside the fictional US
embassy, Al-Hajjri blurted out, ``This is not Yemen! This is
Morocco!''
</P>
<P>
   With each scene, he kept muttering, ``This is completely
unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, mercifully for him, the movie ended, and he stayed in
his seat as the rest of the moviegoers filed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's here to see the last line _ that it's all fiction,''
he said, looking around at the empty moviehouse.

<P>
   Q. My mouse problem may not be unique, but it sure is driving me
up the wall. I think the mice are coming in a gap where the siding
meets the foundation. Then they get between the suspended basement
ceiling and the floorboards above. They skitter-skatter on the
ceiling and that is what is bugging me. How can I get rid of them
and keep them out?
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Get a cat or two and have them live in the basement. They
certainly would be a deterrent, but if the mice stay in the ceiling
space, they may not make much of a difference. You will have a lot
of nervous mice. Or, take the ceiling down.
</P>
<P>
   OK, seriously, here is what to do. You can use traps or D-Con,
the poison that makes them seek water and forces them outdoors,
where they die. This generally happens, but there is no guarantee
that some won't die in the ceiling space. Lift some of the panels
and place the D-Con on the ceiling in strategic places. If you
don't like the idea of D-Con, you can use the snap traps (messy and
slow, but effective) or sticky traps (cruel, slow, and effective).
</P>
<P>
   Those are the ways to get rid of mice.
</P>
<P>
   To keep them away, seal the house. To check the suspected
entries between siding and foundation, take off some ceiling panels
near the foundation, turn off all the lights, and see if you see
daylight through that joint. If you do, you have big gaps to fill.
If you don't, you still may have gaps that are big enough to allow
mice in, and they too must be filled. Those gaps don't have to be
large; a mouse can go through a hole the size of a dime.
</P>
<P>
   It is easiest to fill the gaps from outside; simply insert oakum
or a rope-like caulking into the gap, filling it completely. For
bigger spaces, stuff steel wool into the hole. But instead of using
steel wool, use something called Stuffit, a copper wool or gauze,
that will not rust. It is called Stuffit, from Allen Special
Products (800-848-6805) or Creative Expressions (316-788-6290).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is 50 years old with aluminum siding, a brick front
on the first floor, and with insulation blown in 25 years ago,
which I think has settled. What can I do about those gaps where the
insulation has settled, especially in light of that brick front and
aluminum siding?
</P>
<P>
   GENEVIEVE McCULLOCH, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, check to see how much the insulation has settled. The
only way to do that is to cut holes in the inside walls near the
ceiling, and make a visual and probing check. You may be surprised
that the gaps are minimal, just a few inches, and you can cut the
wall finish, put in fiberglass, and recover the wall. You could do
this yourself, even if the gaps are bigger, maybe 12 inches. Or,
have cellulose blown in. Find an insulator in the Yellow Pages who
will do this relatively small but highly fussy job for a reasonable
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Your biggest project if you do it yourself or if you have it
done is filling the holes you made to get at the wall cavity.
Insulators are not very good hole fillers, and you may have to
improve on their work. But given time, you can make invisible
patches.
</P>
<P>
   If the walls are papered, you can do this: Wet the paper
slightly and try to pull down a foot or so of paper; let it hang in
place. After you do your project, and fill holes or put on a new
plasterboard, you can repaste the paper and no one, not even you,
will be able to tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I hired a roofer to reroof my house, but I am still waiting
for him to show up. And now it's winter. Is it safe to reroof in
winter?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN LEACH, Sandwich, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Roofing or reroofing can be done any time of the year,
as long as it is not deluging, snowing up a storm, or is 15 or 20
degrees, or colder. I remember when I had my roof stripped of
shingles nearly 30 years ago, the November day they started it
snowed. Not a lot, but enough to cover the roof.
</P>

   I panicked, and asked, ``What are you going to do?'' ``We're
going to sweep off the snow and get to work,'' the roofer replied.
They did just that and the shingles lasted 25 years, five years
beyond their warranty.
</P>
<P>
   So, rest easily in winter. One of the reasons roofers are
reluctant to work in very cold weather is that fiberglass shingles
(the most popular of roof shingles) are very brittle, and more
brittle in cold weather, and are difficult to store, handle, and
install. For this reason, I think organic shingles (those with a
felt core instead of fiberglass) are better to use. They are still
made and your roofer can get them.

   Q. Our electric dryer now exhausts into our old cellar. We plan
to put in one that will exhaust outdoors, but in the meantime can
we put a lint catcher at the end of the duct that is there now?

</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but clean it out every day, or every time you use the
dryer. A lint catcher like that can block the duct, and could cause
a fire.

KERRY EYED AS CONTENDER TO BE GORE RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no short list, or even a long one _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But multiple sources close to Vice President Al Gore say Senator
John F. Kerry will be a serious contender in the running-mate
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of appealing qualities, and a sense of being
seasoned personally and politically that would be attractive in a
potential running mate,'' said Michael J. Whouley, a senior adviser
to Gore who previously worked for Kerry in Massachusetts during the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry is definitely one of those half-dozen or dozen people
you have to put in the mix,'' said one Democratic official involved
with the Gore campaign. ``He brings a lot to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Whouley and other sources all explain Kerry's appeal by citing
his valorous military service, his 1996 triumph over former
Governor William F. Weld, and his early and active endorsement of
the vice president. He was also considered a loyal No. 2 when he
served as lieutenant governor under Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding not to run for president, Kerry brought his
political consultants _ John Marttila and Natalie Wigotsky _ to the
White House to advise Gore. He also campaigned for Gore in New
Hampshire, Iowa, and New York, speaking to newspaper editorial
boards and knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is the type of person who really appreciates loyalty and
appreciates someone who not only endorses, but rolls up their
sleeves and backs up that endorsement with hard work,'' said
another source close to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kerry declined to say Thursday whether he would accept
an offer to be Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of the game, it's both premature and
hypothetical,'' he said in an interview. ``I'm proud and flattered
to be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that one of his colleagues, Florida Senator Bob
Graham, had said he would be honored to serve if called upon, Kerry
continued to demur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal kind of thing between you and the
nominee,'' he said. ``I think the nominee ought to be the first to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kerry has been concentrating on Senate business these
days, he's being promoted for a spot on the ticket by Al From, the
president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that tries
to steer the party to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry is one of the people on every list that I've heard
about,'' said From, who frequently mentions Kerry to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   From praises the senator for taking a visible role on education,
an asset, he says, in a running mate. In speeches, Kerry has urged
more flexibility from teachers' unions and others in reforming
education. With Bush trying to claim the education front and move
to the center in the general election, From said, that makes Kerry
an even better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry has shown the ability to beat a good strong Republican
who's tried to run to the center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to a Kerry selection, however, is that
Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would appoint Kerry's
successor. Kerry is up for reelection in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats say they believe their party does not have a
shot at recapturing the Senate majority anyway, and that a
Republican senator from Massachusetts would quickly lose the seat
to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic official close to the Gore campaign said he
expected the vice president to look for someone who will reinforce
Gore's strengths in the same way Gore underscored candidate Bill
Clinton's in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who's proven himself to be a very adept
campaigner with the deconstruction of Bill Weld,'' the official
said, also pointing to Kerry's performance in their numerous
debates.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted, campaign officials insisted that they have not
begun to move forward with picking a running mate. So far, the
campaign has simply asked Warren Christopher, the former Secretary
of State who led the vice presidential selection process in 1992,
to reprise that role in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has one overriding principle that he'll use in moving
forward in this process,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press
secretary. ``That's finding the person who could take over and
handle the job of the presidency if called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane would not say whether Kerry would fit that profile, but
he did call the senator ``very distinguished, one of our leading
Democrats in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Lehane, ``He did a hell of a job campaigning for the
vice president in New Hampshire and other parts of the country.''

ALL THAT WAMPUM UP IN SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Uncle Junior on ``The Sopranos,'' a slang term new to
me gets its 15 seconds of fame, and just in time.
</P>
<P>
   The word is ``spondulicks,'' spelt various ways in its haphazard
derivation from the Greek. And it's reincarnation in a TV series
more famous for grit than Greek is timely because it means money,
wealth, moolah. And moolah is what makes the world go round, as
every day's news attests.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Greece, a seashell called spondylos came into
currency as the equivalent of cash, and when you went to pay off
your old Athenian loanshark, the Grecian equivalent of Tony
Soprano, you saved him breaking your legs by forking over a pile of
spondylikos, if I read my dictionaries right.
</P>
<P>
   What to the Greeks was a ``learned witticism'' came to America's
shores by the mid-1850s, with all the other immigrants. Here the
spelling morphed into ``spondulix'' and ``spondulics.'' But just as
the Sopranos are less interested in spelling than spending, on
murderous accumulation of pelf than on morphing of ancient
vocabularies, our society's fascination with pelf is limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Our Almighty Dollar is the world's currency, just as the
language we hijacked from the British Isles has become the lingo of
air travel, high tech, low-brow video, and middle-brow tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Badinage about boodle dominates our discussion. Whole TV
networks are dedicated to the daily desuetude of the Nasdaq and the
Dow. Temples of wealth such as the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund are besieged by protesters in Washington. Filthy
lucre is what makes the world go round, to listen to the daily
media output of us ``content providers.'' You can't eat it, drink
it, or breathe it, but we spend more time fussing over the old
dinero than we do over food, clean water, and clean air. Cutting
ourselves in for more cabbage is the principal activity of the age.
</P>
<P>
   Tote that barge; get that gravy. The search for shekels is
endless. Just ask the Irish sailorman who sings of how ``I spent
all me tin on the ladies drinkin' gin,'' so he's off to the western
ocean in the morning. God is great, but Mammon is running a close
second on the wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Siphoning simoleons is America's business. And for a couple of
years the stock market has been where you find the wherewithal. As
the Nasdaq swoons, our hearts go out to Bill Gates. The world's
richest man has lost 20, 30, who knows how many billions as
Microsoft stock took the biggest hit ever. Hey, buddy, can you
spare a dime? Yes? Great, slap it right down there on the
barrelhead. Leeping track of the lettuce employes armies of earnest
experts, who people out video screens, scrubbed and coiffed to the
standard expected of cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The market meltdown ensnares millions. A nice string of coconuts
turns into chicken feed, as the bottom feeders probe for the floor.
Is this the day it turns around? The hour? The minute? Where's Lou
Dobbs when we need him? Four bits is worth two bits in the click of
a cursor, as cheerleaders become cursers. What was a sawbuck's
worth of shares yesterday is only a finnif's today. Where'd the
rest of it go? You feel like shouting ``Hey!'' But it ain't hay.
</P>
<P>
   It's the long green, suddenly in shorter supply. What's going on
here? Is Alan Greenspan on vacation already? We're talking carfare
here, for the longest bull market ride on record. We didn't mind
the grubbing, even when it got grubby, but what happed to our
grubstake? We'd grown fat and happy reading a different script for
our scrip.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? What takes?
</P>
<P>
   The market giveth, and the market taketh. And we all, most of
us, just about all of us except the short traders, liked the giveth
better than the taketh. And speaking of the short traders, what
about the tall traders? Where'd they disappear to? We all more or
less held something back, what the old song celebrated: ``That's my
old ace-in-the-hole.''
</P>
<P>
   For the margin traders, who have to cough up when Nasdaq gets
bronchitis, there's no longer any trace of the ace. Or the king,
queen, jack and 10, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   A severe case of the shorts is catching up with a lot of those
day traders, and we're not talking underwear here. All those
high-tech chasers who failed to cash out at the top will be wearing
barrels, not boxers or briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Where'd all the wampum go?
</P>
<P>
   It went up in smoke above the bonfire of technology investments.
Who lit the match? Look no farther than the judge in the Microsoft
case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson may go down in legal texts as
the jurist who saved the world from the Microsoft monster. But his
findings hit the hydrogen-filled Nasdaq balloon like a lightning
bolt finding the Hindenburg. Fully 25 percent of the high-flyers'
market went poof.
</P>
<P>
   And to those investors, the good judge is seen as the
reincarnation of Marvin The Torch. Marvin was columnist Jimmy
Breslin's classic arsonist, a ``Sopranos'' kind of guy, whose
calling card was his claim to felonious property owners: ``I can
build you a vacant lot.''

PROTESTERS CLAIM IMF DOES WORLD MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The front page no longer carries daily news of the
Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, and other arcane currencies.
Southeast Asia is out of recession and growing once again. Amid
American prosperity, it can be hard to remember that only two years
ago the world faced the very real prospect of a global financial
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this weekend, protesters will gather outside the offices
of the agency that led efforts to stop the crisis _ the
International Monetary Fund. Many believe the IMF does more harm
than good in the world, and they are willing to be arrested to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have a range of complaints. They say loans by the
IMF come with conditions that free up money for debt service by
cutting government investment in schools, health programs, and food
subsidies. They say some loans by the IMF and its sister agency,
the World Bank, encourage development that harms the environment.
They claim IMF programs lead to increased poverty, and debts held
by the poorest nations should be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters also take issue with the way the IMF handled the
Asian crisis, which was one of the most significant economic events
of recent times and one of the most important challenges in the
IMF's history. Even some prominent economists say the protesters
have a point; however, there is no consensus on why this startling
disruption in the economy began, or on whether the IMF's efforts to
stop it actually worked.
</P>
<P>
   How the debate sorts out could affect the world's response to
the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The fingerpointing starts with the cause of the Asian crisis,
which began in July 1997, when Thailand devalued its currency. That
helped spark currency and stock crashes in Indonesia and other
neighbors, including Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy.
Financial markets around the world became more jittery as the
crisis spread to Brazil. Then it hit Russia, whose nuclear arsenal
added a scary element to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it all begin? One school blames Asia itself and its
``crony capitalism,'' or the clubby relationships between
governments, banks and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thai real estate speculators were allowed to overbuild without
proper scrutiny of their books, this argument goes. The Korean
government wanted to become a world force in such industries as
shipbuilding and semiconductors, so it guided loans from foreign
banks into the giant Korean industrial conglomerates to build
factory capacity. When the market became glutted with chips, ships,
and capacity, the factories failed, which bankrupted companies and
stressed any local banks that had loaned them money.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF itself makes this argument in oblique language, blaming
the crisis on ``weaknesses in financial systems,'' ``governance,''
and ``government involvement in the private sector and lack of
transparency in corporate and fiscal accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Stiglitz, the Stanford economics professor who was
chief economist at the World Bank during the crisis, says ``crony
capitalism'' cannot have been the cause. ``These countries had
three decades of the most impressive growth of anywhere in the
world,'' he said in an interview, ``and they were getting less
secretive, more transparent, more independent in their banking
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz points the finger not at Asia, but at the IMF and the
United States. They pushed Asian nations to liberalize their
capital rules in the last two decades so foreigners could invest
more easily in Asian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This ``hot capital'' fueled the real estate boom in Thailand, he
argued, and the new rules allowed the money to flow out at the
first signs of trouble. Ironically, he said, Thailand and Korea did
not want to open the doors to fickle investors, and they did so
only under IMF and US pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you ask the question, `What changed in Asia in the
1990s?' the answer was capital- and financial-market
liberalization,'' Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally contentious is the IMF prescription for how to solve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF touchstones were currency reserves, government spending,
and interest rates. By maintaining a reserve of dollars, yen, or
deutsche marks, a country can buy its local currency and maintain
its value. But the troubled Asian currencies fell so steeply that
nations quickly ran out of reserves. As the local currencies sank,
companies that had borrowed money overseas found themselves having
to pay dollar-denominated loans with baht and rupiah that were
worth less and less.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF arranged cash infusions for these nations, in part to
help them defend the currencies. More than $36 billion went to
Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand alone, which grew to $118 billion as
other agencies and individual nations chipped in.
</P>
<P>
   But in return for the loans, the IMF asked borrowers to take
steps designed to induce investors to send their money back to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included raising interest rates and cutting
government spending, attempts to give investors a high return on
their money and assure them inflation would not eat away their
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also forced some nations to close their most troubled
banks, a step designed to force the banking system to acknowledge
bad loans on its books and to end ``crony capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But these measures exacted a heavy price, the critics say. ``I
was shocked by the closure of 16 banks in Indonesia when there was
no deposit insurance there,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, an economic
adviser to foreign governments and director of the Harvard
University Center for International Development. ``Lo and behold,
as anyone with some sense and experience would know, it led to a
banking crisis and helped trigger a full-fledged panic.''
</P>
<P>
   By ordering nations to hike interest rates, the IMF drove
troubled companies out of business and boosted unemployment,
critics say. And cutting government spending also put people out of
work and slowed the economy further. The IMF's prescription became
dangerous in places like Indonesia, the critics say, as the
recession caused riots and attacks on the ethnic Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot address the issue of restoring confidence just by
focusing on interest rates or deficits,'' Stiglitz said. ``You have
to have a broader perspective. The riots did more to damage
confidence (in Indonesia) than anything that could have been done
to the trade balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz and Sachs said the IMF should have allowed governments
to boost spending so people continued to work and spend money,
which would have minimized social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   They say the IMF was correct to push Western banks to roll over
their loans to Asian banks and companies, but the IMF should not
have forced nations to restructure their financial sectors. While
``crony capitalism'' may be undesirable, solving it is beyond the
IMF's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Asian economies are no longer in recession, though
they are not back to the robust health they enjoyed before the
crisis. Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank, says the rebound
validates most of the IMF approach. But critics like Sachs say the
rebound is due to foreign investors returning to Southeast Asia,
which happened only because foreign banks rolled over their loans
to Asian banks and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the debate, many economists say there is general but not
universal agreement the crisis taught several lessons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that countries should not be forced to cut budgets in the
middle of a financial crisis, as the social cost is too high, said
Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, who is not a particularly harsh critic of the IMF.
Even some IMF officials back this view, though it is uncertain how
it would guide them in a future crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is that fixed exchange rates are a mistake, Litan
said. Several Southeast Asian nations pegged their currency to the
US dollar in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Litan said. That
helped keep inflation in check and gave exporters certainty amid
the volatile international currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   But fixed rates force countries to spend reserves at times to
prop up the value of a local currency and maintain the peg to the
dollar, a burden some countries cannot bear.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed exchange rates also encourage investors to borrow in
dollars and lend in the local currency, as they believe there is
little risk of having to repay the loans in baht or rupiah that
have lost value, Litan said. When a nation abandons its fixed
exchange rate, these investors quickly pull their money from the
country and try to repay their dollar loans, which can spark a
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   More controversial is whether countries should limit their
exposure to foreign investors. Litan said many economists now
believe that, for some countries, it makes sense to bar short-term
investments and to require anyone investing in a business to keep
the money there for a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we recognize today that short-term capital flows can
be highly destabilizing,'' Stiglitz said. ``I'd say there's general
consensus on that.''

&HT;     GOOD SAMARITAN PLANS TO WALK, DANCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL DeMARE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dean L. Johnson remembers the instant he was
struck by a tractor-trailer rig on the New York Thruway while
trying to aid a stranded motorist during a recent snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old soldier's Army instincts took over when both
legs were severed below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medic, medic,'' Johnson cried as other motorists rushed to
help him. He then instructed them on how to use a belt as a
tourniquet to stop the bleeding in his legs. The motorists kept him
warm until paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
   With high spirits and a vow to run, ride his bike and dance
again, Johnson talked about the incident for the first time
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, he said he didn't regret pulling over to
help because there was a small child in the stranded car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do the right thing,'' Johnson said during a news
conference at the Albany Medical Center Hospital. `'I saw these
people and they had a kid, and I at least had to give them a
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who holds the rank of specialist 4, returned from
Bosnia in early March. He was headed back to Fort Drum near
Watertown on Sunday when he was struck about 3:40 p.m. by a
tractor-trailer unable to stop on the slick highway. The truck
clipped the soldier as he attempted to dive into the median area
out of its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember running or diving,'' he said. `'All I
remember was I took two steps, and I was airborne.'' He said the
truck jackknifed and he got hit by the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and my legs were gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope for the future is just to be able to walk again, and
after that everything is gravy,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier is deemed an excellent candidate for prosthesis
because of his good health, his age and the fact the legs were
severed below the knees, said Jeffrey Schoenig, the registered
nurse attending Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ``overwhelming'' extent of the injuries and the
shock, Schoenig said he advised Johnson to take ``one step at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me `I don't want small steps, I want big steps,'''
Schoenig said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is expected to be transferred to Walter Reed Army
Hospital in Washington on Monday where he will remain until well
enough to return home to Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   His family has a ``big 4th of July bash, and I want to be able
to walk into that,'' he said. He expects to leave the Army and
enter college to possibly pursue a career as a teacher. He has
$40,000 toward his tuition, a bonus from the Army when he enlisted
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasn't always as upbeat about his future as he was on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got hit, I was ready to give up, but I love my
family too much,'' he said. His mother, Deena Phillips and paternal
grandmother, Joan Johnson, were at his side during the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe her son, Phillips said, ``This is what you
see, right here. We are very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a radio operator assigned to Company B of the 10th
Signal Battalion for the 10th Mountain Division, Light Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Batson and 1st Sgt. Don Sarringer, both from his
company, were among the soldiers from Fort Drum who visited him
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well liked by the other soldiers in the unit,'' said
Batson, his company commander. ``He's a very competent soldier and
is good at his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been flooded with cards and phone calls from
strangers wishing him well.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers who patrol the Thruway have also visited, and Johnson
was wearing a Troop T cap Thursday, a gift from the New York State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's 1996 Chevrolet pickup was totaled. His glasses
also were smashed, but troopers brought him a new pair after they
found an eyeglass prescription in his wallet.

</P>
<P>
   Johnson had visited his family in Rhode Island over the weekend
and was en route to base when he saw the stranded motorist on the
Thruway near the Taconic Parkway interchange in Columbia County.
</P>
<P>
   The car had spun out and was sideways across the lanes. Johnson
said he later learned it had broken its rear axle.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car told Johnson, who had stopped in the
passing lane, that troopers were on their way, but before the good
Samaritan could drive off, he saw out his rear-view mirror that a
tractor-trailer was rounding a curve and wasn't going to be able to
stop. Instinctively, he jumped out of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not heard from the truck driver, nor the family he
stopped to help. The trucker, Harold E. Feltt, 57, of Rock City
Falls, N.Y., was ticketed for driving at an imprudent speed, having
faulty windshield wipers and failure to keep a log book, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The child in the car, Johnson later learned, was 4 years old and
was with grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been too selfish not to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he knows he has a long road ahead of him, Johnson said he
was prepared to fight once he was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a good outlook on life,'' he said. He thought of his
family, and ``I didn't want to die by the road somewhere.''

YOU CAN'T STOP GLOBALIZAION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   I never met Charlene Barshefsky but I'm sure I know her.
</P>
<P>
   She was the smartest girl in high school. Knew all the answers.
Didn't try to hide it. Talked to everybody in the same slow,
measured,
I'm-only-going-to-say-this-once-so-you-better-get-it-the-first-time
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Never lost her cool. Didn't have to. She was always the smartest
one in the room, and she allowed time for the rest of us to catch
up. Now she's doing the same kind of thing, only on the world
stage.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration's lead dog on trade, the 49-year
old lawyer has rocketed around the planet, wheeling, dealing,
wheedling, needling, giving here, holding out there, clinging to
the slippery back of the globalization tiger.
</P>
<P>
   She may be Clinton's best appointment, though most Americans
couldn't pick her out of a lineup. Over the past five years, US
exports went up 50 percent, and while the world economy is too
massive a peak to be responsive to any one individual's will, she's
one of the most important folks on the planet when it comes to
buying, selling, shipping and consuming stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When 50,000 demonstrators descended upon Seattle to hoot at the
harried World Trade Organization, Barshefsky's became one of the
public faces of globalization. With steady nerve and a persistently
even temper, she has tried to smooth out the wrinkles in the social
fabric as unions and human rights groups and environmentalists
blast away at this plank or that plank of the Noah's Ark that is
world trade.
</P>
<P>
   So, Charlene, how do you do it? ``I nag,'' replied the Chicago
native simply to a Chicago newspaper. Her mother was a teacher and
her father a chemical engineer who became a rabbi. And all the
strains of the family DNA come into play in the trade negotiator's
job.
</P>
<P>
   With so many of the Clinton administration's traditioanl allies
in labor, liberal causes and the environment pounding the tom-toms
on the other side of the globalization issues, Barshefsky needs to
be able to teach, to appeal to scientific logic, and ultimately to
invoke the help of the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   As Vice President Al Gore has discovered, it is a very tricky
business to run for president when the unions, liberals and
tree-huggers whose votes you need are bellowing about trade
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bull----,'' screamed the chief of the United Auto
Workers at a rally Wednesday that drew as many as 10,000. Organized
by John Sweeney, chief of the AFL-CIO, the rally heard Harry Wu,
imprisoned for 19 years in China, denounce the idea of granting
permanent membership to China in the World Trade Organization.
That's what Barshefsky is pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please say no,'' appealed Wu. Barshefsky is pushing ``yes.''
At a separate Teamster rally, Pat Buchanan showed up in a Teamster
jacket, peddling his patented brand of talk-show braggadocio: ``I'd
tell (China) to stop threatening my country, persecuting the
Christians, and if you won't, you have sold your last pair of
chopsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's mainstream protest was lively but not disruptive. The
street action in downtown DC has drawn the interest of the cops,
the administration, and the concern of merchants and shopkeepers
worried about another series of riots like Seattle suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make their voices heard midst the tumult of street
demonstrations are the leaders of the institutions under fire, the
World Bank, and International Monetary Fund chief among them. The
World Bank and IMF have been rocked by increasingly harsh attacks
on their ususal business practices.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing momentum to force even greater forgivness of
Third World debt, though lending authorities plead that if they
wipe out all the red ink, there's no money being repaid and there
won't be any more to lend.
</P>
<P>
   The vast and towering achievements of the second half of the
20th century have been left largely unremarked upon. With all the
turmoil of what's been going wrong, on ugly human rights abuses and
persistent sub-Saharan poverty, what has been done right is left
uncelebrated.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this Thursday afternoon in the auditorium of
Brookline High School. As the driver and hefter of the one-woman
BHS tuba section of the school orchestra, I was there to see the
fruits of my labor in action.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkably uplifting ceremony titled ``Operation
Recognition,'' where 37 high school diplomas were awarded to old
men who'd left the Massachusetts high school before graduating to
join the military. Twenty of them went in the Navy, 11 in the Army,
four to the Air Corps, and two to the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their 70s, the survivors marched sprightly up the steps,
in some cases, limped on their own, came up supported by a son or
grandson, and two of them came with canes. For some of the names,
the diploma was accepted by a widow, a daughter, an old comrade.
</P>
<P>
   These men, pronounced keynote speaker Robert McKean of the
Massachusetts Department of Veterans' Services, ``are the men who
saved the world.'' About 500 people, many of them still in high
school, applauded warmly. ``Not only did they give up their
diplomas,'' said McKean, ``but the friendships, the football games
and the proms.'' Ticking off the storied battles of the Great War a
half-century back, he told the old vets, ``You didn't learn
history, you made history!''
</P>
<P>
   Amid prolonged applause, the orchestra played in turn the
signature tunes of each military service, and the vets marched out
with pride and grins and a few tears for lost comrades.
</P>
<P>
   And it struck me that one of the things that has made the world
a safer place is the incredible explosion of world trade, that has
stitched together the peoples of the planet with economic ties that
never previously existed.
</P>
<P>
   So I sympathize with the union workers fearful of being
undercut, with the human rights advocates who rightly call our
attention to the vicious abuses that still exist, and the
environmentalists who document the debauchery of our earthly
resources. But I also know that more young boys would be thrown
into wars if it were not for what trade does. And you cannot stop
globalization.

AVON TAKES TOO MUCH CREDIT FOR CHARITY WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad publicity for a breast cancer benefit? Astonishing, but
true.
</P>
<P>
   Avon Products, the $5.3 billion cosmetics giant, has been
recruiting walkers for its June 2-4 Leominster-to-Boston ``3-Day,''
a group walk that has attracted over 4,000 participants. First
launched in California in 1998, the walks are now held in seven US
cities, and, according to Avon, have raised ``over $20 million for
the breast cancer cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But Avon's promotion has come under fire from an unexpected
quarter: Breast Cancer Action, a small advocacy organization based
in San Francisco. In a stinging op-ed article published earlier
this year in the San Francsico Chronicle, BCA's executive director
Barbara Brenner attacked Avon's 3-Days head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner had three main criticisms: 1. Only affluent people could
afford to raise the $1,800 donation required for participation. 2.
Too much of the money raised _ 36 percent _ was spent on
administrative and marketing overhead. 3. Avon was giving the money
to the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, which
itself takes a cut of the proceeds, and then redistributes the
money to promote ``breast health'' awareness. ``None of the funds
may be used for actual (breast cancer) screening,'' Brenner wrote.
``The money can only be used for programs that encourage women to
get screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Avon, which is enjoying something of a resurgence under a young,
female chief executive, has gone bananas at Brenner's critique.
Director of public relations Susan Heaney says the participants
aren't necessarily rich, but ``come from every walk of life.'' As
for Brenner's criticism of how the money is spent, Avon announced
important changes in their funding choices about a month after her
article appeared. CEO Andrea Jung said $11 million will be donated
directly to five leading academic health centers working on breast
cancer research. Also, Avon will disburse its support through its
own foundation, which does not charge a fee. Company officials
emphasize that these decisions were not influenced by Brenner's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, understandably, Avon is silent on the question of
excessive overhead. Like similar mass expressions of charitable
feeling _ the Walk for Hunger comes to mind _ the 3-Day is
expensive to stage. The event is actually produced by
California-based Pallotta TeamWorks, which also puts on the New
York-to-Boston Tanqueray bike ride for AIDS, and backstopped by
outside and in-house public relations staffs. On its web site
(www.breastcancer3day.org/news.htm), Avon says 59 percent of all
money raised is going to the breast cancer cause.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Avon cites the approval of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus, a 60-40 fundraising-to-expenses ratio is pretty
awful. The local United Way told me they burn up 14 per cent of
donated monies on overhead; the Boys and Girls Club, 18 per cent
and so on. ``Avon is taking enormous credit for not doing very
much,'' Brenner says. ``If the walkers want to have an impact on
breast cancer, this isn't it.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Much hilarity attends the search for a ghost-writer for Lycos
boss Robert Davis' book, tentatively titled, ``Speed is Life,'' to
be published by Random House/Doubleday. New York-based literary
agent Daniel Greenberg _ 212-337-0934 if you're looking for work _
has approached every half-reputable business hack in Boston to do
the Davis book. Davis wants the book done ``at Internet speed,''
according to one writer, and have it available by the end of the
year. Greenberg initially offered $75,000, then bumped the asking
price to 100 large. He says he has a few candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine who has actually made money doing this advises:
get $300,000 up front, and ask for a share of ``imputed
royalties,'' a term he may have coined. The point is, no one has
ever heard of Bob Davis, and no one is going to buy his book. But
Lycos will probably pay for a print run of 30,000 or more to hand
out to employees and customers. So get those corporate purchases
treated as if they were retail sales, and collect a small royalty
on each unit. And don't take payment in stock options.

. . . Train buffs alert: Los Angeles-based Pine Tree Press has just
published ``Boston and Maine: City and Shore,'' a gorgeous picture

 &HT;    A reborn Avanti
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes typos in first two grafs.)
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLA RICA, GA. _ Few cars have captured aficionados' attention
like the Studebaker Avanti, and few cars have shown the Avanti's
catlike ability to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The marque has gone through at least four generations and five
ownership changes since the original car with the distinctive raked
grille flowed from the studio of Studebaker's design wizard,
Raymond Lowey, in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Studebaker may be long gone as an automaker, but the latest
edition of the Avanti is taking shape in a converted hosiery mill
in Villa Rica under the guidance of former Avanti consultant, sales
representative and collector John Seaton.
</P>
<P>
   The new Avanti Motor Corp. hasn't built the first production car
yet, but its prototypes have been seen at several major auto shows.
Another prototype is being prepared for government certification
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The newest edition ``has the Avanti essence,'' Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new design by Tom Kellogg, a member of Lowey's original
Avanti styling team, based on the original 1963 Lowey studio
designs but incorporating modern technology and amenities. It
retains the forward rake, wedge shape and asymmetrical hood.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanicals come from General Motors. The engine is the
5.7-liter, 305-horsepower V-8 used in the Chevrolet Corvette; a
four-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission will be
available. Other features will include air conditioning; cruise
control; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; leather interior; power
windows, mirrors and locks; AM/FM stereo with CD and a 500-watt
sound system and eight speakers. In other words, each new Avanti is
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new; there's nothing from the old car,'' Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-built rear-wheel-drive coupes and convertibles will
have fiberglass bodies. The coupes are priced at $69,000, the
convertibles at $83,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for colors: whatever you want.
</P>
<P>
   Seaton said the first cars will be painted to order, and that
there will be some spec vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants their own color,'' he said. ``It's a personal
fingerprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaton expects the car's appeal to cross generations, both to
original Avanti aficionados and to younger drivers. The target
market is people with substantial disposable income who are seeking
individuality in their automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   While there is plenty of competition in the luxury roadster
market, Seaton called Avanti an American icon. ``It's like seeing
an old friend,'' Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avanti name is well-known and popular. The car has been
around so long, people have fond memories of it. We're taking the
sting out of owning an exotic car.''
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to build about 300 cars a year when production
begins, expected in the last quarter this year. Although hiring
hasn't started yet, Seaton said he hopes to employ 50 to 100 people
in the assembly plant in the next 18 months or so.
</P>
<P>
   Seaton is bringing a background in auto and clothing retailing
to the business, along with a nearly lifelong love of Avantis. He
moved to Carrollton about 11 years ago, but he kept alive his hope
for one day manufacturing Avantis. The company is owned by three
investors: Seaton is president and chief executive officer; Michael
Kelly, a former Avanti company owner in the 1980s, is chairman; and
John Hull, a former corporate tax manager, is chief financial
officer. The new company acquired the Avanti name and assets; the
assets of AVX, builder of an Avanti experimental car; the building
in Villa Rica; and ``all we need to build the car,'' Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Avantis were built in 1991 in Youngstown, Ohio,
where Kelly moved the firm from the original Studebaker home in
South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The new Avanti Motor Corp. is starting from the ground up, but
it is keeping in touch with the past, too. Seaton's company
purchased the parts and molds for the last generation of Avantis
with the idea that the company might be a parts supplier for
current owners. From the 1960s through 1991, more than 8,000
Avantis were built.

RABBITS RUN, RECORDS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We don't know who will be leading Boston Marathon 2000
as it wends it way out of Hopkinton and Ashland, into Framingham
and Natick, past the women of Wellesley College, over the hills of
Newton, through Brookline and onto Boylston Street. It might be
defending champion Joseph Chebet. It could be two-time winner Moses
Tanui. Perhaps it will be an up-and-comer asked by a federation or
coach to set the pace for his training partners, or maybe it'll be
an overexuberant neophyte who will soon pay dearly for his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is this: He won't be an official rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing trend for top marathons to pay a set of pace
setters to help ensure ever-faster times, Boston isn't joining the
chase because, everyone seems to agree, it doesn't need to. While
many other races struggle for some combination of sponsorship,
media attention, top athletes, and respect, the 104-year-old Boston
Marathon can afford, literally and figuratively, to stand apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a historical marathon, and it is the best marathon
in the world,'' said Tanui, who won here in 1996 and 1998. ``I
don't think we should have rabbits because in the Olympics and
World Championships we don't have those.'' Asked if he was equating
Boston with those two pinnacles of the sport, he declared: ``Yes,
of course.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons Boston feels no need to bring in pace
setters, defined as runners who are paid to set an agreed-upon,
quick pace for a given distance and then, usually, drop out around
Mile 16 or earlier. For one thing, the net elevation drop of the
Boston course, combined with its point-to-point nature,
disqualifies it from consideration for world records regardless.
And world records are the prime reason rabbits exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until we got the record back here that I felt we had
reached our goals,'' said Carey Pinkowski, race director of the
Chicago Marathon, a ``dead flat'' course. ``When we compete for
sponsorship dollars, we have to be able to say we're faster and
better. We have to give the writers something to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason goes to genetics. ``The type of runners who run
well in Boston don't need rabbits anyway,'' said Frank Shorter, the
1972 Olympic gold medalist, citing four-time winner Bill Rodgers
and three-timer Cosmas Ndeti. ``You just get to Boston College and
roll down that hill and it's all over for everybody else. There's
just some sort of God-given ability to run downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the goal at Boston is victory, period. ``Time is kind
of unimportant,'' said Tom Ratcliffe, a Concord-based agent.
``Winning the race, that's important. In some ways, Boston can say
they're the last real marathon where there's no artificial element
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, say race officials. ``I don't think rabbits are either
necessary or appropriate at Boston,'' said Guy Morse, race
director. ``If you win Boston in 2:08 vs. 2:06, that's not nearly
as important as the fact that you won. That's the badge you wear.''
Rodgers agreed: ``Heck, we didn't even have accurate time and mile
markers. You raced your competition, purely. Today I won't say it's
contrived, but the emphasis on records is so much more powerful. We
just ran to win; it was so simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Although single rabbits have been around for years, only
recently have races been bringing them in by the hutchload, with
the best among them fetching up to $10,000. The phenomenon seems to
have been kicked into high gear a few years ago at the Rotterdam
Marathon, where the course and race structure was geared toward
breaking records. As the number of pace setters there grew, the
benefits of multiple rabbits became obvious. Not only could one
pick up the pace if another flagged, but together they could form,
in effect, a windshield. David Martin, professor of exercise
physiology at Georgia State University and an expert on the
marathon, said a runner screened from the wind will reap an energy
savings of 4 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can save some energy, you can run faster,'' he said.
``People have run about as fast as they can by themselves. They
need a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't dismiss the influence of drugs, warned Shorter, named this
week as chairman of the new US Anti-Doping Agency. ``To think that
EPO is not being used on a widespread basis is foolish,'' he said.
EPO, short for erythropoietin, is a banned substance that
stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, times have plummeted since rabbits have
become commonplace. Of the top-10 all-time fastest marathons, only
one was run before 1998, and that is Belayneh Densimo's 2:06:50 in
1988, which stood as the world record for a decade. When Ndeti
broke the Boston course record with his 2:07:15 win in 1994, it was
the fourth-fastest marathon ever; today it is No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers are dismayed. ``Times have gotten so watered
down,'' said Mark Wetmore, a Boston agent who represents, among
others, Ndeti. In Amsterdam last year, he said, ``four guys ran
2:06 and I'd never heard of any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least as troublesome to some is the fear that rabbits change
the texture of a race. Because a certain speed has been agreed on
beforehand and it's the rabbits' job to run precisely that, all a
competitor has to do out there is keep pace with the rabbits.
Bascially, some say, he doesn't have to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about a marathon, you're talking about 26
miles, you're not talking about the last seven,'' said Morse.
``There are so many dynamics going on that need to play themselves
out, not being influenced so that there's no opportunity for the
real race to begin until the rabbits drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, no one denies there were great finishes last year
in both New York and Chicago. In New York, the leaders were left on
their own just after Mile 18, with Chebet and Domingos Castro still
shoulder-to-shoulder with about a mile to go. Worth noting is that
German Silva, the two-time New York City Marathon champion from
Mexico who was the final rabbit, came under criticism for
interacting with fellow Fila athletes in the lead pack.
International rules, difficult to define or enforce, forbid giving
advice or assistance, but race director Allan Steinfeld said Silva
``was a cheerleader out there for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the last two of five rabbits _ having gotten the
eight-man lead pack in position to strike at the world record _ had
no sooner dropped out around 16 miles before Tanui stormed up to
the group from out of nowhere to take the lead and force Khannouchi
to give chase. When the dust had settled, Khannouchi had the world
record (2:05:42) and Tanui (2:06:16) the third-fastest marathon in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The way Tanui and Khannouchi were running, said Pinkowski, ``had
nothing to do with pacing. Pace setting can only get you so far,
and if you don't have the horses and the manpower to back it up
then it's wishful thinking. Ultimately, great competitions bring
the best performances.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Boston may not be known for speed, it's certainly
known for great performances. Remember 1990, when Juma Ikangaa was
about a week ahead of Gelindo Bordin in Newton, only to get reeled
in and finish a distant second? Or 1982, when Alberto Salazar and
Dick Beardsley raced to the wire, marking the first time two
runners broke 2:09 in the same race? No bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to Boston,'' said Martin, ``it's Mecca. I don't go
for records, I go to see raw talent do their best.''
</P>
<P>
   You can call Boston old-fashioned, you can call the Olympics
old-fashioned. They're great competitions. Some races do just fine
without rabbits, thank you.

HE HAS MASTERED HURDLES TO RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twelve years ago, Andrey Kuznetsov was primed to
represent the Soviet Union in the 10,000-meter race in the Seoul
Olympics. But he contracted hepatitis and had to shelve those
plans.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next Olympics came around, Kuznetsov had only
barely regained training form, and had to pass up the Games again.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't chosen to go to the '98 Games in Atlanta, so he came
to Boston that April to run _ but only after a snafu with his visa
resulted in Kuznetsov arriving just two days before the Marathon
and having to sleep one night in a chair in a hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The next two years he had a string of victories that came to a
halt last November when he pulled out of the Ocean State Marathon
in Rhosde Island with leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
   So it might seem like there has been a black cloud over the
Russian as he's tried to make his mark on the running circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Kuznetsov, 42, won the masters division in that Boston race in
1998; he successfully defended the title the next year, and is now
back to try to make it three in a row. In the meantime, he has
notched wins in the Houston, Grandma's, and Twin Cities marathons
and placed first in his division in Falmouth and other shorter
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the world's best master runner for the past two
years,'' said Don Paul, Kuznetsov's agent. ``His run in Boston was
the second strongest ever by a master, and I think he's the
strongest after John Campbell.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, an Olympian from New Zealand also represented by Paul,
set the world masters record at the 1990 Boston Marathon with a
time of 2:11:04.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Kuznetsov placed 15th overall at Boston, winning the
masters division in 2:15:27. He shaved a minute off that time the
next year, winning his division again and finishing seventh
overall.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds resigned that making the Olympics is a goal that has
passed him by. ``You need a time of 2:09, and that's too fast for
me,'' he said from Rockville, Md., where he is living while
training. ``So I'm not concentrating on the Olympics this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, he'll focus on Boston, where the first-place
prize is $10,000, and enter some shorter-distance races over the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   When Kuznetsov was growing up in Khabarovsk, in eastern Russia,
he focused on cross-country skiing. ``I like things that are
outside, and there's a big forest near where I live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He ran just in the summer, as training for skiing, until a coach
told him to lose the skis and concentrate on running.
</P>
<P>
   Kuznetsov did so and made the Olympic squad destined for Seoul
to compete in the 10,000-meter race, in which he had run 28:13. But
in April he got sick, and when the diagnosis was hepatitis,
Kuznetsov was told to say home and was kept in isolation for almost
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run for one year, and was slow to come back,'' he
said. ``They were testing my blood every month.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start training again for two years, which was too late
for him to prepare for the Olympics in Barcelona. Eventually he was
not just back to running but was running longer distances,
including a half-marathon. In 1994, he ran his first marathon, near
Kiev, and finished in 2:15.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1996, he had lowered his personal best to 2:12:31 _
second best in the country _ and was Russia's national champion at
20 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian federation opted to send two others to the
Olympics, both of whom finished way back in the standings in their
races.
</P>
<P>
   Living so far from Moscow didn't help his cause, Kuznetsov said,
but he refused to blame politics for the federation's decision not
to send him. He lived 4,000 miles away from Moscow, where
marathoner Oleg Struzhakov resided and where the team decisions
were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold bad feelings, but I always dreamed of running in
the Olympics,'' Kuznetsov said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuznetsov, who now has a working visa to be in the US, and whose
wife and two daughters live with him in Maryland, has won the
masters divisions in eight of the nine marathons he has entered in
the past two years, suffering his first loss at the Twin Cities
race last fall. He finished 5 seconds behind Kenyan Joshua
Kipkemboi, who wasn't wearing the correct masters bib.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Kuznetsov dropped out of the Ocean State Marathon
with leg spasms, and said he got back to hard training for the
Marathon only last month.
</P>
<P>
   So Kuznetsov knows he'll face a tough race on Monday. In
addition to Kipkemboi, the competition in the masters division will
include Budd Coates and Bob Schwelm, both of Pennsylvania, and
Steve Wilson of Flordia, who won last month's masters division in
the Motorola Marathon in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Boston,'' Kuznetsov. ``It's a good course, as long as
it's not hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just see how my muscles go. Inside I feel young, but my
muscles feel older.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side of the masters division, the favorite is
someone who won the race before. But neither she nor the race
organizers knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Tatyana Pozdnyakova, 45, ran Boston in 1995 and had the fastest
time in the masters race, but didn't win the division.
</P>
<P>
   That's because she was listed as 39 years old, not 40, a snafu
she blames on wrong information on her passport. Pozdnyakova was
17th overall with a time of 2:40.26; Irina Bondarchouk, 42,
recorded the best women's masters time (2:43:42) for 18th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake on my passport when I ran with the Army Club
in the Soviet Union, and I didn't change it when I went to the
US,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pozdnyakova has won the masters division in 10 of 11 marathons,
and is on an eight-marathon win streak. She ran a career-best
2:29:25 in the 1998 Chicago Marathon, the second best masters
marathon time ever as she won the division and finished fifth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Pozdnyakova, who has qualified to represent the Ukraine in the
Sydney Olympics, is training in Gainesville, Fla., where she lives
with her husband and son. She'll return to the Ukraine in June to
train with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Her top challengers will be Josette Columb-Janin of France and
Cindy Barber-Keeler of Florida, who have won the division for the
past three years.

SUPERFICIAL `28 DAYS' NEEDS REHAB, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
28 DAYS 
Directed by: Betty Thomas 
Screenplay by: Susannah Grant 
Starring: Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Diane
Ladd, Elizabeth Perkins, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tudyk, Michael
O'Malley, Azura Skye, Reni Santoni, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Margo
Martindale 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (mature thematic elements involving substance abuse,
language and some sensuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to take more than ``28 Days'' to jump-start Sandra
Bullock's stalled career. In her new vehicle, Bullock tries to move
off her sweetie-pie persona to play a wild thing, a downtown girl
who drinks herself into a rehab unit after wrecking her sister's
wedding by first falling into the cake, then commandeering the
honeymoon limo, jumping the curb, and broadsiding a neighbor's
porch. Faced with jail or rehab, she chooses the latter. But the
title of the new film is the first indicator of what's wrong with
it.
</P>
<P>
   It wants us to believe that Bullock's character, Gwen, can
overcome her alcohol abuse problem, roots and all, in 28 days. It's
detox as summer camp. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains in North
Carolina, the rehab center is a virtual country club, even if all
the chanting and touchy-feely stuff that go on there become a
little much. They mirror this film that isn't nearly gritty or
tough-minded enough. It shies away from presenting Bullock's
character as anything really frightening, or even unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, she's a bit unruly. When she vomits, it's always into
a toilet. She's vaguely described as a writer, but all we get of
her past are spinning, blurry flashbacks evoking her drunken
behavior, patterned on that of her mother. In short, it's a
sanitized _ and therefore unconvincing _ brand of drunkenness we
see here. Bullock is at her best in the beginning and end.
Initially, Gwen's response is glib denial and brittle contempt for
the others who are trying to get with the program. But after one
convenient perspective-altering incident _ she falls three stories
trying to retrieve some discarded pills _ she sees the light.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 28 days are up, she gathers her resolve to face
up to her party animal boyfriend, well-played by Dominic West as a
big-time enabler and a large part of her problem. In short, this
superficial and lightweight look at alcoholism hardly enables the
ever-likable Bullock to dance on the wilder shores of substance
abuse. Susannah Grant, fresh from delivering an invigorating script
in ``Erin Brockovich,'' here falls back on safe, bland
predictability that doesn't even allow the secondary characters
much scope. While Bullock seems reined in, staying button-cute,
even to the extent of flapping her hands helplessly when her
roommate overdoses on drugs, most of the others hardly seem there
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Buscemi is wasted as a savvy counselor and ex-addict. So
are the others, with the exceptions of West's bad influence and
Viggo Mortensen's fellow addict, a star pitcher in rehab. Despite
his babe-magnet behavior, he's savvy enough to talk some straight
talk to Gwen. Their avoidance of sappy, mutually dependent romance
is the script's sole departure from a facile glibness that seems a
more advanced case of denial than any exhibited by the characters.
For a much more convincing take on the same subject than this
screenful of wine and poses, check out ``Clean and Sober'' with
Michael Keaton and Kathy Baker.

NORTON'S `KEEPING THE FAITH' RINGS FALSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
KEEPING THE FAITH 
Directed by: Edward Norton 
Screenplay by: Stuart Blumberg 
Starring: Norton, Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, Anne Bancroft, Eli
Wallach, Ron Rifkin, Milos Forman, Holland Taylor 
Running time: 131 minutes 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' will be remembered as the film with which
actor Edward Norton made his directing debut. That's about all
it'll be remembered for. The romantic comedy starring Norton and
Ben Stiller as boyhood buddies who fall in love with a third grown
buddy _ Jenna Elfman _ is bland, prefab, and overextended. It's not
nearly as interesting as any of the films in which Norton has
acted, and sounds like something of a bad joke if you begin with
the fact that Norton plays a priest and Stiller plays a rabbi. The
rabbi can get married, although he's under pressure to marry a
Jewish girl. The priest can't marry. So who'll wind up with
Elfman's high-powered businesswoman with a cell phone grafted onto
her wrist?
</P>
<P>
   The question can't quite lift the film out of the conventional
rut into which it sinks with self-deceiving comfort pretty early
on, never to rise out of it. The romantic consternation escalates
when the rabbi and the priest, both modern, innovative types, meet
the third member of their childhood trio at the airport after not
having seen her for years. When they do, they both fall for her.
It's the rabbi who gets lucky in that she falls for him, too. To
avoid discomfort, they hide their involvement from their pal, the
priest, and, for that matter, from the rest of the world as well.
From this the romantic complications arise as Jake the rabbi and
Brian the priest agonize over their respective feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But the film isn't really interested in making the kind of
trouble it promises. It doesn't want to make trouble at all. It
wants to resolve everything conveniently. That's what's wrong with
it. It simply never plugs into the unruliness that drove the best
screwball comedies. There are some laughs to be derived from
Stiller's weaselly behavior, but they come at the cost of what
might have provided some emotional conviction. Elfman's Annie says
she loves him for his spirituality. But spirituality is the one
thing he doesn't project. Norton's Brian seems an awfully nice guy,
but a bit of a lightweight. Before long, you wonder what Annie
would see in either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although she isn't given much to work with, Elfman walks away
with ``Keeping the Faith.'' She's that vibrant a presence.
Actually, for all of its modernity, the film is a curious throwback
to those old Hollywood comedies where the assumption is that an
accomplished woman would cheerfully give up a high-powered career
to pursue love with Mr. Right. Annie's biz wiz has a lot more going
for her than Brian or Jake have going for them. Norton's direction
is proficient, but the film does tend to move as if it's
permanently stuck in second gear. His attempts to add texture by
including multicultural surrogates come out pretty cliched. So does
Jake's Jewish mother, played by Anne Bancroft. So, in fact, does
the whole film. It settles for slickness instead of sparkle.

A SLICKER `AMERICAN PSYCHO' ON SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN PSYCHO 
Directed by: Mary Harron 
Screenplay by: Guinevere Turner (based on Bret Easton Ellis'
novel) 
Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Reese
Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Josh
Lucas, Cara Seymour 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence, sexuality, language and drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American Psycho'' is one of the rare cases of a film improving
upon a book. But then it would be almost impossible not to improve
upon Bret Easton Ellis' trashy novel that seems too busy drooling
over its misogynistic frenzies to ever get around to pillorying
them. As there's no end of aggressiveness built into our
market-driven world, there's a certain bleak logic in inventing a
Wall Street serial killer, a soulless cipher who takes his identity
from the labels in his expensive clothes, having none himself.
Patrick Bateman, Ellis' Freddy Krueger figure out of GQ, first
hacks a business competitor to death, then extends his rage to a
string of women and homeless people. In the right hands, he could
have seemed an embodiment of the Reagan or Thatcher years, a Jack
the Ripper of capitalism, trying to hide his hollowness in
conspicuous consumption as he grows ever more unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   But ``American Psycho'' is no critique of Reaganomics. Ellis
went off the tracks. Instead of maintaining the distance essential
to satire, he seemed to blend into the excess, losing himself in
litanies of upmarket labels, punctuated by sadistic swoons. Mary
Harron's film avoids a couple of traps Ellis fell into simply
because she has images at her disposal. The long riff on skin care
rituals that numbingly begins the book on a dual note of narcissism
and insecurity is efficiently handled by a shot of Bateman's
oversized medicine cabinet, stuffed with bottles and jars of
creams, gels, lotions, and other emollients palmed off at top
dollar to the obsessive-compulsive. Bateman's apartment looks like
something out of Kubrick _ expensive, cold, white, hard-surfaced,
antiseptic _ a squash court gone co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Bateman loses control and starts swinging the ax and
wielding the chainsaw, the film starts sounding like Hitchcock's
``Psycho,'' with a shrieking soundtrack that pays repeated homage
to Bernard Herrmann's aural handiwork in the Bates Motel.
Meanwhile, Christian Bale's Bateman schleps to Wall Street each
day, where he fights a constant state of terror at being one-upped
by his equally shallow and nervous contemporaries. They travel in
packs to ridiculously expensive, pretentious clubs where they look
down their noses at Bellinis, snort cocaine, dine on
self-satirizing dishes like ostrich filets with cactus mayonnaise,
and zombie through sex with drugged-out socialites.
</P>
<P>
   Bale looks both buffed and vapid as a rudderless mannequin who
never knows whether to sedate himself into obliviousness or flog
himself into sensation with coke or killing. The settings and
production design do a lot of the work of the film. Harron
efficiently limns the world of these self-styled masters of the
universe in such moments as the one when four platinum credit cards
hit a serving tray in unison with _ their owners hope _ studied
insouciance as a three-figure tab arrives. Harron gets more mileage
than Ellis did out of the frequent moments when the young hotshots'
lack of distinct identities is underscored every time one is
constantly mistaken for another. The film is a smarter, sharper
take on their world than the book.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman's most anxious moment comes when he and the others
exchange business cards, and the card of his that he thought was so
cool is eclipsed by an even more coolly designed one. After every
such puncturing, an act of rage follows. When a snooty maitre d'
laughs at his last-minute reservation request, we know some new
victim's going to pay. The film got its rating changed from NC-17
to R when Harron trimmed a few seconds from a sex scene involving
Bateman and two prostitutes. But what does it say about where we
are now that the violence that follows _ a far greater obscenity
than the sex _ was unquestioned? During the so-called sex, Bateman
isn't looking at either of the women. Rather, he's looking at
himself in the mirror at the head of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he's making love to himself, supplying a
self-immolating metaphor for the book. It can't be said that Harron
is oblivious to its themes. She is in fact more inventive in her
handling of them than Ellis was. Yet she and the film remain boxed
in. They deliver the satire more efficiently, but they're still
stuck with the book's misogynism, and it doesn't play any less
revoltingly on screen than it did on the page. In both senses of
the word, ``American Psycho'' wastes its women. Harron softens the
harrowing ending, raising the possibility of a moral escape clause
the book does not. In this respect, at least, the novel has the
courage of its meretriciousness. The film is no more successful in
supplying resolution, much less catharsis. The book seems a case of
the prurient condemning the prurient. It's cynical junk
masquerading as social comment. The film is, finally, only a
slicker packaging of it.

NEWMAN, FIORENTINO CAPER STYLISHLY IN `MONEY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
WHERE THE MONEY IS 
Directed by: Marek Kanievska 
Screenplay by: E. Max Frye &AMP; Topper Lilien, Carroll Cartwright 
Starring: Paul Newman, Linda Fiorentino, Dermot Mulroney 
Running time: 89 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Where the Money Is,'' Paul Newman is cool, Linda Fiorentino
is hot, and that's all the film needs to put the joy back into
larceny. Connoisseurs of bank robbery will immediately recognize
the source of the film's title. When real-life midcentury bandit
Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he replied, with
impeccable logic, ``Because that's where the money is.'' In the
film, Newman's cagey old-timer, Henry Manning, shares this view.
When he's wheeled out of prison into a nursing home, doubled up
into a wheelchair by a supposed stroke, Fiorentino's nurse is
convinced he's faking his way out of stir.
</P>
<P>
   She's right. She knows Henry is a veteran bank robber. What she
doesn't know is that Henry is planning one last big score. But her
heart is in the right place, namely a larcenous one. Soon, she and
Newman's old-timer bond and her blue-collar husband, Dermot
Mulroney's Wayne, is in on the caper, too. Think of ``Where the
Money Is'' as a modest, blue-collar version of ``The Sting,'' with
Newman an aging Butch Cassidy, or Hud, a guy who wears a lot of
experience in his face, is in no hurry to make his move, but is
savvy and decisive when he does.
</P>
<P>
   The film never drags, but one of the enjoyable things about it
is its way of taking its time letting us get to know and savor the
characters. This takes the form of Carol trying to get the old guy
to stop playing possum and teach her what he knows so she can blast
free of the grubby small-town life that's weighing her down. Liking
her spirit, and realizing he can't do the job alone, he cuts her
and Wayne in for a piece of the action. The action, in this case,
involves hijacking an armored car, going around town picking up the
night's take from various establishments, then making off with it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't quite go as planned. Henry's cool and his
improvisatory abilities are tested several times, and it's a
pleasure to watch Newman unfurl them with the relaxed authority he
brings to the character acting that has occupied the latter part of
his life after he spent decades feeling ambivalent about being cast
as romantic leads. Fiorentino, that delectable panther of an
actress, has film's sultriest purr since the golden age of Lauren
Bacall. She convinces us that in Henry, Carol's restlessness has
found just what it needs to move to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun watching her awaken to new possibilities she had only
half acknowledged before Henry's arrival. Mulroney holds up his end
of the collaboration, too, as the husband who likes the idea of the
heist, but is jealous of his wife's fascination with the
experienced older man. The film is tense when it has to be, but
mostly it's jaunty, kept aloft by a playful mix of energies, except
when the thieves are backed into a couple of tight corners. ``Where
the Money Is'' is as much about character as about the caper. But
the test of any caper movie is whether you like the crooks enough
to root for them. This one aces the test effortlessly as Newman and
Fiorentino project more than enough charm to melt any mere armored
car.

POITIER'S BIOGRAPHY MEASURES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
The Measure of A Man: 
A Spiritual Autobiography 
By Sidney Poitier. HarperCollins. 236 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sidney Poitier learned when to fight and when to cool it,
something many of us never master. He developed the knack on a
rather fantastic journey that took him from his native Cat Island,
a tiny slip of land in the Bahamas, all the way to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   That's the gist of this book, whose 72-year-old author reflects
on his long odyssey. Cat Island, 46 miles long, three miles wide,
was where the actor, born prematurely while his struggling parents
were traveling to Miami to sell tomatoes, learned his first
important life lessons. By age 10, he'd had so many childhood
misadventures that, he recalls, he'd become almost enamored of
``flirting with risk,'' flirtations that continued throughout his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Jim Crow Miami at 15 as an immigrant kid with an
``inner eye'' that showed him, as had his ``Cat Island
curriculum,'' when trouble loomed. At barely 16, he recounts, he
approached two white policemen in an unmarked cruiser, seeking
directions home. The police struck a deal with him. They'd follow
him if he walked the 50 blocks to his home. If he didn't look back,
they suggested they'd shoot him. He complied.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing his first movie as a child, Poitier wanted to go to
Hollywood and become a cowboy. Eventually, he went and became the
first _ and only _ African-American to win the Academy Award for
best actor. He won it for his role in ``Lilies of the Field'' in
1963, a picture made on a shoestring by a studio that was
interested in developing a relationship with its director.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier's book is full of the detours he took before
establishing himself. His original bestselling 1980 autobiography,
``This Life,'' described his life in Hollywood. This book is a
personal history striving for something deeper, trying to give
contours to a full life in which Hollywood played only a part,
albeit a major one.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, after leaving the South for New York, the inexperienced
Poitier naively answered an ad for actors, placed by the American
Negro Theater. Since he didn't know how to perform, he recalls, he
was contemptuously advised to take a dishwashing job. He did. He
learned to read from newspapers with the help of an old Jewish
waiter. He went back to the Negro Theater and was hired as a
janitor before graduating to acting jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 23, Poitier had made a couple of films and
performed in a couple of major theatrical productions. He was
married, expecting his second child, and was a partner in a
struggling rib restaurant at 127th Street and 7th Avenue. He was
still washing dishes to keep the place going.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many stars, Poitier is able to discuss thoughtfully the
values in some of his film work, which, besides ``Lilies,''
includes ``A Patch of Blue,'' ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' and
``To Sir, With Love.'' He effectively previewed his role in
``Dinner'' before filming it when he was invited to a dinner party
at Spencer Tracey's Beverly Hills home at which Katharine Hepburn,
who'd invited him to her home for an introductory meeting, was a
guest.
</P>
<P>
   It was Poitier who suggested the powerful scene in ``In the Heat
of the Night.'' In that film, he's a Philadelphia detective working
in the South with the redneck lawman Rod Steiger. Poitier questions
a local businessman who slaps him in the face for impertinence.
Poitier slaps him back.
</P>
<P>
   He recounts how he survived a tense situation in the
extraordinary Lorraine Hansberry play ``A Raisin in the Sun.'' By
the end of the run, Claudia McNeil, who played the mother, wasn't
speaking to him. She believed the production was best when played
from the mother's point of view; Poitier thought it was best when
played from his character's, the son's.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier took a giant step forward in his career with the help of
an agent, Marty Baum. Poitier refused an acting role that would
have paid him a princely $750 a week; this came at a time when he
was so broke that he'd borrowed $75 from Household Finance Co. on
the furniture in his apartment to pay for his child's birth.
Poitier declined the job because his character was too passive.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Baum called him. He had to get something straight. He had
no jobs for Poitier but still didn't understand why the actor had
turned down the kind of money he'd been offered earlier. Poitier
explained. Then, Baum blurted out why he'd called. ``I don't know
what's going on with you, but anybody as crazy as you, I want to
handle him,'' he said.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I, like so many parents of teen-agers, am

that kids can get around them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Concerned Mom
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MOM: Outside of locking your kids in the basement for the
next few years, there's no foolproof way to shield them from all of
the dreck so readily available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I applaud your effort to restrict the stuff your kids can see,
but we know the most dangerous place any parent can stand is
smack-dab between a hormone-crazed teen-ager and a stack of dirty
pictures. Somebody's going to get trampled. At least that's what
Mama Bombay tells me, and she had plenty of opportunities to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   AOL allows the primary user to set content limits for others who
use the same account, but that's about all that can be done.
Besides, all a kid needs is somebody else's log-in and password,
and he's back in business again. I guess it wouldn't surprise you
to know that AOL passwords _ as well as passwords to thousands of
X-rated sites _ are traded almost as feverishly as Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice for you if AOL could police some of the grimier
chat rooms and e-mail come-ons, but then we'd have about 11 million
civil rights lawyers yammering about the First Amendment. And
there's simply no way anyone could ride herd on the entire
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Accept it: Your teens are attracted to salacious stuff, but
that's normal. It's your job to make sure they don't become
obsessed. That's not normal. Mama Bombay used a garden hose, but I
suggest a subtler approach, maybe a frank discussion about their
surfing habits. And, if you've done your job as a parent, you'll
just have to trust your kids.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am new to Windows. I had an Apple IIGS for
years and loved it. But my family said I needed a new computer, so
here I am. I will be working in various programs or playing a game,
and all of a sudden my computer says an ``illegal operation'' has
been performed and it will shut down. I have to kill the power to
restart. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ Broken Windows
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BROKEN: The only thing you did wrong was believing those
crashes were in any way your fault. Welcome to the world of
Microsoft: It's always Windows' fault.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal operation crash usually happens when two programs lay
claim to the same chunk of memory. Windows can't settle the dispute
_ which it shouldn't have allowed in the first place _ so it throws
up its hands and quits working. There's very little you can do to
avoid the problem.
</P>
<P>
   New computers come loaded with superfluous utility programs
running in the background. Each takes a bite out of total memory,
and it's possible they could be contributing to your crashes. If
you hit Control-Alt-Delete, you can see a list of everything going
on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to run a little leaner, go to the Start menu, then
to Run. Type in Msconfig and press Enter to start a utility that
allows you to selectively prevent those memory gobblers from
loading.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am new to Windows. I had an Apple IIGS for
years and loved it. But my family said I needed a new computer, so
here I am. I will be working in various programs or playing a game,
and all of a sudden my computer says an ``illegal operation'' has
been performed and it will shut down. I have to kill the power to
restart. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ Broken Windows
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BROKEN: The only thing you did wrong was believing those
crashes were in any way your fault. Welcome to the world of
Microsoft: It's always Windows' fault.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal operation crash usually happens when two programs lay
claim to the same chunk of memory. Windows can't settle the dispute
_ which it shouldn't have allowed in the first place _ so it throws
up its hands and quits working. There's very little you can do to
avoid the problem.
</P>
<P>
   New computers come loaded with superfluous utility programs
running in the background. Each takes a bite out of total memory,
and it's possible they could be contributing to your crashes. If
you hit Control-Alt-Delete, you can see a list of everything going
on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to run a little leaner, go to the Start menu, then
to Run. Type in Msconfig and press Enter to start a utility that
allows you to selectively prevent those memory gobblers from
loading.

AMBITIOUS OPERA COMPANY CONTINUES BLAZING TRAILS WITH `COLD SASSY
TREE'
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by OPERA-NOVELS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the past quarter of a century, Houston opera
audiences have seen singing vampires, science-fiction epics, the
meeting of Nixon and Mao, the assassination of a gay-rights
pioneer, the evolution of Jackie Kennedy into Jackie O, the coming
of age of Meg, Jo and Beth _ and lots of other things you don't
expect to see in an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such strange goings-on, or more likely because of them,
the icons of the musical world, from Leonard Bernstein to Michael
Tippett to Philip Glass, as well as numerous lesser-known composing
lights, have made the pilgrimage to Houston to present their latest
efforts to the Bayou City's operatic connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   A bastion of conservative musical tastes just 30 years ago,
Houston has since built an international reputation as a center for
innovative opera production and established itself beyond doubt as
the leading performing-arts organization in Texas. That success
story continues this week with the company's 25th world premiere,
Carlisle Floyd's ``Cold Sassy Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   This production epitomizes Houston Grand Opera's long-term
commitment to new opera. The company was once identified with a
trendy movement toward ``current events'' operas, such as ``Nixon
in China,'' ``Harvey Milk'' and ``Jackie O.'' Now there's a
stronger move toward adapting contemporary or classic fiction for
the operatic stage, as in the company's recent premiere of an opera
based on Louisa May Alcott's ``Little Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd has been associated with Houston Grand Opera for more than
20 years. The company premiered the composer's ``Bilby's Doll'' in
1976. The company staged his ``Willie Stark'' (based on Robert Penn
Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ``All the King's Men'') in
1981 and a revised version of his ``The Passion of Jonathan Wade''
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A highly literate composer who has written all of his own
librettos, Floyd first became acquainted with the novel ``Cold
Sassy Tree'' when his sister gave him a copy. Written in 1984 by
Olive Ann Burns, who died in 1990, it narrates the maturing of a
teen-age boy in a small Georgia town at the turn of the 20th
century, following him as he falls in love with a girl of lower
social class, while at the same time observing his widowed
grandfather's marriage of convenience unexpectedly develop into a
true and noble romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it and enjoyed it thoroughly, without thinking of it as
an opera,'' Floyd says. ``Then I reread it, thinking that it might
become an opera.''
</P>
<P>
   When Houston Grand Opera's general director, David Gockley,
approached Floyd about the possibility of commissioning another
opera, Floyd presented the idea of ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' but with
some doubts because of the challenges the book presented.
</P>
<P>
   Gockley was not the least reluctant. ``Our audience has gotten
larger, younger, more diverse,'' he says of Houston Grand Opera's
willingness to stage unusual and nontraditional productions. ``It's
not a homogeneous group.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, diversity has become a strength in the company's march
to prominence: It never alienates everyone in its audience at the
same time. Some of the ``Traviata'' crowd may balk at ``Nixon in
China,'' and some of the fans of ``The Making of the Representative
for Planet 8'' may complain about another ``Carmen,'' but at least
a large part of the audience is enthusiastically with the program
at any given time _ and all seem proud of the company's burgeoning
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   So Floyd got a commission for his challenging project.
</P>
<P>
   And the challenges were significant. The plot was largely
episodic, based on isolated events and vivid characters. And
several key events _ the arrival of the first automobile in the
town, a train accident _ were impossible to stage.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd took to the task, slimming down the cast and
concentrating on the romances.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an opera that's the flip side of ``Susannah,'' the
opera that skyrocketed Floyd to fame in 1956 when he was still in
his 20s. That opera, which the Fort Worth Opera will stage in the
fall, is pessimistic, presenting the story (inspired by a book in
the Old Testament Apocrypha) of a young woman in a rural Southern
setting who is seduced by a preacher and condemned by a
sanctimonious community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' however, paints the brighter side of an
isolated Southern town; even with its clearly painted faults, the
community ultimately provides love and support to the protagonists
and a setting for growth and transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its commitment to quality, Houston Grand Opera
hired Australian film director Bruce Beresford _ who directed
``Breaker Morant,'' Crimes of the Heart'' and ``Tender Mercies'' _
to direct ``Cold Sassy Tree.'' An avid opera fan, Beresford has
directed stage versions of Puccini's ``Girl of the Golden West,''
Strauss' ``Elektra'' and Robert Ward's ``The Crucible.''
</P>
<P>
   Beresford is most impressed by the depth of emotion in ``Cold
Sassy Tree.'' The setting is distinctly regional, and the company
had to bring in a diction coach to get the Southeastern accent _
especially the word ``Love,'' which is the name of one of the main
characters _ just right.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Beresford, the emotions transcend region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic passions are the same all over the world,''
Beresford says.''People behave the same in Nigeria, where I lived
for three years, as they do in New York or London or Hollywood.''
</P>

SIX-PART MINISERIES PORTRAY GRITTY STREETCORNER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CORNER 
Starring: Khandi Alexander, T. K. Carter, Sean Nelson, Tyra
Ferrell, Glenn Plummer 
Directed by: Charles S. Dutton 
On: HBO, Sundays at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few minutes watching ``The Corner,'' a bleak and bracing
and beautiful new HBO miniseries, you are crystal clear on a few
issues. 1) This drama won't be must-see TV for those who like to
watch human suffering healed by an angel's touch. 2) The inner-city
realism, unrelenting and darkly poetic, is unequaled on TV. 3) The
acting is so seamless and unflattering to the actors it will
probably scare Emmy voters back to their tapes of ``3d Rock From
the Sun.'' 4) HBO is definitely not running this uncompromising
six-part miniseries about drug addiction and poverty in order to
pump ratings.
</P>
<P>
   And by the final minutes of ``The Corner,'' which airs Sundays
at 10 p.m. for the next six weeks, you are clear on one last point:
This is an unforgettable piece of work. If you stay with it,
through the hours of junkie desperation and defeated hopes and
fleeting victories, you probably won't say, ``I just loved it.''
But you will feel something even more powerful: compassion,
insight, and the intensity of having watched an ensemble of actors
completely inhabit their roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corner'' is set in a hollowed-out West Baltimore
neighborhood, picked clean of anything that might return a few
dollars at the junkyard. Fran Boyd and Gary McCullough, once a
couple but now just drug buddies, move along the streets always
with a mission _ to score, to get money to score, or to get home
and shoot the latest score. They sleep in separate places _ she
lives with her siblings, he lives with his parents _ but they
continually cross paths, just as they also intersect with their
16-year-old son, a dealer named DeAndre. The movie is held together
by a lovely, natural choreography that keeps throwing the members
of this broken family together. They care about one another, for
sure, but Fran and Gary are fixated on their drug needs, and
DeAndre, with his distinctive dreadlocks, is caught up in making
big money and hanging with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Fran and Gary will kick drugs,
particularly as Fran builds up the courage to get into detox, and
the question of whether DeAndre will land in jail or worse, hang
over ``The Corner.'' And the answers to these question do arrive.
But it isn't plotted in the way we generally think of plot. It's
more like a collection of everyday moments in the life of a
neighborhood _ Fran stealing drugs from DeAndre while he has sex
with his girlfriend; Gary struggling to keep from spending his
mother's errand money on drugs; the gold-rush fever that sweeps
through the neighborhood when furniture is left on the sidewalk
after an eviction; a touchingly innocent teen sock hop at a
recreation center; and the unshakable image of junkies taking
needles in their knuckles, their necks, their behinds. Shuffled in
with these vignettes are random flashbacks to Fran and Gary's
promising middle-class life, and how they lost it.
</P>
<P>
   We also get to know a large cast of indelibly acted secondary
characters, from Tyra Ferrell's idealistic recreation-center
director to Clarke Peters as a neighborhood elder with a liver
problem. Gradually, all these characters, with their lost paradises
and momentary triumphs, add up to a remarkably full, revelatory
social portrait. I should also add that there are indeed moments of
humor, particularly an ongoing riff about bumming cigarettes. No
one would ever call ``The Corner'' a comedy, but it does contain
needed occasions of respite from the grimness.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is strongly directed by Charles S. Dutton, known for
his years as TV's ``Roc,'' for supporting roles in movies such as
``Cookie's Fortune,'' and for an early personal history that
includes prison time for manslaughter. It's only Dutton's second
time behind the camera (the first was HBO's ``First Time Felon''),
but he has enough directorial patience to let his characters'
humanity emerge slowly and surely, without any stylistic gimmickry.
His faux documentary approach is neutral and straightforward, and
he avoids the instrusive, self-conscious stylizations of verite
dramas like ``NYPD Blue.'' (Actually, the movie has its roots in
nonfiction, in a book of the same title by Edward Burns and David
Simon). Dutton also avoids _ mostly successfully _ the sort of
manipulative earnestness meant to nudge us into sadness or
political anger about America's inability to cope with drug
addiction. He simply lets the mundane world of ``The Corner'' speak
for itself.
</P>
<P>
   As Fran, Khandi Alexander is stunningly real. Best known as
Benton's sister on ``ER'' and as one of the ensemble players on
``NewsRadio,'' she seems to become Fran, a woman who is wily and
amoral when it comes to getting drugs and drug money, but who
passionately wants to keep her son clean. She's a fearless force of
nature, and most of the humor in ``The Corner'' is thanks to her
raging cynicism. Even when she looks like a ghost, as drug-infested
and characterless as the buildings on the corner, she's a fountain
of edgy zingers. As Gary, comedian T. K. Carter perfectly captures
the gentleness and passivity that can be addiction's easiest
conquest. He's beaten down and he knows it, and in his shame he
prefers to shoot dope without being watched. And as DeAndre, Sean
Nelson, from the movie ``Fresh,'' delivers a subtle mix of cocky,
resigned attitude and the desire for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Corner'' may sound like just more preachy TV cliches
about drug abuse and African-American self-destruction, it is so
much more than that. It is about the life and death forces at war
in that inner-city staple, ``The Corner,'' and it is a jarring
introduction to the people behind the statistics and the cliches. I
hope it finds an audience, despite its rawness. No one ever said
great drama had to be pretty.

 &HT;    First, vitamins were our saviors; then the real truth came out
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes muscular to macular in 16th graf.)
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My local supermarket has row upon row of vitamins,
minerals, extracts, compounds and mixtures that hint at curing or
preventing all known health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The section for these concoctions is located across the aisle
from medicines typically used for headaches, colds, sore throats
and such.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the aisle is for people who have an ailment they
want to get rid of. The other side is for people who are trying to
not get something they'll want to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   I've always figured that I'd wait until I got something unwanted
before I'd worry about it. Besides, I never trusted the claims that
swallowing so many milligrams of tree bark, weed pollen or
pulverized rock would be any better for me than the traditional
food sold in the store.
</P>
<P>
   For years I've listened to relatives, friends and even doctors
talk about antioxidants, free radicals and dietary supplements.
Back in the 1960s, free radicals were the hippies who hadn't been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I caved in and began taking some of the stuff
sold across the aisle from the aspirin, cough medicine and throat
lozenges.
</P>
<P>
   I now take a multivitamin tablet that contains most of the
elements in the periodic table. It's a huge pill.
</P>
<P>
   I also take a big vitamin C pill each morning. A motorcycle
racer out in California told me how important it is to take vitamin
C. I bought a big bottle.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-wife with several college degrees told me that I need to
take natural vitamin E and the mineral selenium.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what vitamin E is supposed to do or what the
difference is between natural vitamin E and unnatural vitamin E.
Nevertheless, I bought a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   I also bought a bottle of selenium. It sounds like a chemical
used to make nuclear weapons. It was on a shelf across from the
upset stomach medicine.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many pills, tablets and capsules on my bathroom
counter now that I take half of them in the morning and the other
half at night. This recent development comes after a lifetime of
resisting suggestions and warnings that I should take dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say whether the pills make any difference
except that they sometimes upset my stomach and cause me to buy the
upset-stomach medicine across from the selenium.
</P>
<P>
   About the time I lined my counter with supplements, a National
Academy of Sciences panel announced that there is no convincing
scientific evidence that taking large amounts of vitamins C and E
or the nutrients selenium and beta carotene can reduce the chances
of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease or
other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   This panel of scientific experts concluded that despite the
popular belief of ex-wives, doctors and others that high doses of
so-called antioxidants help prevent a variety of illnesses, there
is insufficient evidence to recommend that Americans get more of
these nutrients than is necessary to prevent basic nutritional
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said large doses of vitamins C and E and selenium can
be harmful rather than reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular
disease, cataracts, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, cancer and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no evidence that vitamin E or other supplements
can reduce the effects of aging, according to the Institute of
Medicine panel, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences. Too
much vitamin E, however, can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that people should get their nutrients from
food, not pills. A balanced diet and adequate exercise should be
all most Americans need to maintain their health and prevent
disease.
</P>
<P>
   That's too easy.

MITCHELL HOLDS COURT AND SPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AN ALL-STAR TRIBUTE TO JONI MITCHELL 
On: TNT 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors don't seem to be particularly dazzled by one another. But
the moment they lay their eyes on a genuine rock icon, their
perfectly sculpted jaws tumble to the floor and all kinds of mush
comes gushing out. And when that icon is Joni Mitchell, goddess,
musician, painter, and poet, well the gush factor is significant.
And so it happens that, in the course of TNT's ``All-Star Tribute
to Joni Mitchell,'' host Ashley Judd can't seem to stop nattering
on about her earliest Joni memories, while the likes of Goldie
Hawn, Susan Sarandon, and Laurence Fishburne sit staring wide-eyed
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard not to identify with their awe. Few artists
deserve tribute as much as Mitchell, for her perfect lyrics, for
her expressive voice, for her musical adventurousness, for her
career stamina, and, of course, for her famously uncompromising
nature. Over the course of her 30-year-plus recording life, she has
created one of the most personal and fully realized musical
statements in pop, from the simple confessional pleasures of
``Blue'' and ``For the Roses'' to the more complex visions of
``Court and Spark,'' ``Hejira,'' ``The Hissing of Summer Lawns,''
and later albums like ``Night Ride Home'' and ``Turbulent Indigo.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``All-Star Tribute to Joni Mitchell,'' which
airs Sunday at 9, has everything to do with Mitchell's strength as
an artist. Filmed in New York last week, the concert is a series of
musical guests performing Mitchell songs. Not only do all of the
performances fall short of Mitchell's own versions _ that is to be
expected, but none of the guests seems able to make the song his or
her own for even a few minutes, despite the fact that most of the
selections are from Mitchell's earlier, more conventional albums.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Lauper gives an oddly flat, slinky version of ``Carey,''
Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter work painfully hard to
harmonize on ``Chelsea Morning,'' and k.d. lang never takes off
with her sultry go at ``Help Me.'' Elton John comes up with an
earthbound, uninspired ``Free Man in Paris,'' the song Mitchell
wrote about David Geffen, and Richard Thompson steps a little too
heavily on ``Woodstock'' and ``Black Crow,'' although he does
manage some effectively predatory riffs on the latter. ``I've
played before the queen of England,'' Elton announces, as if to
explain why the performers have been missing the mark, ``and it's
not so intimidating as having such a great musician there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who watches the show from a side balcony, does her
best not to be intimidating, greeting each performance with a
genuine smile. She closes her eyes to enjoy James Taylor's
unsuccessful attempt to Taylorize ``River,'' and she rocks her head
to Bryan Adams and Wynonna Judd singing the raucous ``Raised on
Robbery.'' She is a warm front of good vibes, and the many camera
shots of her are the best part of the show. At the end, she takes
the stage to offer thanks for the ``surrealistic'' event and to
provide the concert's most heartfelt performance, a contented,
resigned version of ``Both Sides Now'' with a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the best kind of celebration: when the subject of
homage walks away with the night without even trying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' is such a loving evocation of the
Manhattan literary scene of the 1940s, at least insofar as it
stretched from Greenwich Village to the offices of The New Yorker
on 43d Street and back again, that I found myself cutting its
stiff-legged direction a lot of slack and enjoying its characters
and atmosphere. Joe Gould was a Greenwich Village bum and lifelong
sponger, but one with intelligence, style, and panache, who claimed
to be writing the longest book ever. It was an oral history of the
world, in which he said he was recording snatches of overheard New
York vernacular in notebook after marbled school notebook,
interspersed with autobiography and philosophical observations.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time until New Yorker writer Joseph
Mitchell ran into him, which in the film he does in a coffee shop.
Mitchell loved New York's eccentrics and specialized in writing
about them for the magazine's Talk of the Town section and in
occasional Profiles. In a time when the world wanted to believe the
bohemian tradition was still alive in the Village, Mitchell's 1942
piece made a lot of people happy, including Gould, who became a
minor celebrity and something of a tourist attraction, with his own
table at the Minetta Tavern. He filled notebook after notebook,
which he stashed with friends, and wasn't shy about soliciting
donations to the Joe Gould Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the work of the film is done with the casting of Ian
Holm in the title role. Holm is wonderful, unobtrusively calling
upon his Shakespearean background to paint Gould as a vest-pocket
Falstaff, filled with bluff and bluster, shrewdly exploiting his
snappish Yankee manner and salty speech, spicing them with the
occasional wild-man routine he claimed to have absorbed from
Indians he once lived near in Montana. Yet Holm's Gould is not
entirely a humbug. He lets people know he graduated from Harvard in
1911. To bestow upon him an anachronistic phrase, he talked the
talk, even when his frequent drunkenness prevented him from walking
the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci's Mitchell provides a couple of kinds of
counterpoint. Quiet, reserved, proper, murmuring mouthful after
mouthful of Southern courtliness, it's easy to imagine the
transplanted North Carolinean in his suit, collar, tie, and hat
leaving his wife and two daughters each morning and riding the
subway uptown to The New Yorker, fitting perfectly into its
somewhat prissy atmosphere, typing away methodically in his
cloistered office each day for years. He loved New York and its
characters, became a legend himself by writing about them, but
wasn't quite prepared for the way Joe Gould invaded his life.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Holm does a wonderful job of showing us why people
believed in Joe Gould even as they noticed his calculating,
appraising glances, so does Tucci as it begins to occur to Mitchell
that he's being suckered by Gould. We learn what he found out, and
wrote in 1964, after Gould's death in 1957. Tucci the director may
have damped Mitchell a little too much. And while he fills the
screen with yeasty characters, they don't often behave in a yeasty
way. There's something almost stilted in some interactions. We feel
he's got the right people up there, but hasn't encouraged them to
cut loose enough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's some shortfall in the spontaneity department,
the individual portrayals are marvelous, fully worthy of occupying
the almost tenderly evoked settings. Susan Sarandon is a standout
as the artist Alice Neel, who painted a scandalous portrait of
Gould. Patrick Tovatt is terrific as Harold Ross, the gruff genius
who edited The New Yorker. Hope Davis adds dimension as Mitchell's
photographer wife, who contributes additional views of New York,
and Patricia Clarkson provides grace and heart as a generous
gallery owner and benefactor. ``Joe Gould's Secret'' isn't all it
could have been, but there's a lot to like in it. It's of a piece
with ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' and ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' which means that if you're up for a bit of time travel to a
vanished New York, it's indispensable viewing.

NOVEL APPROACHES TO OPERA (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plays, legends and famous historical events have always been
common fodder for opera composers.
</P>
<P>
   Novels, too, are getting their operatic due, the latest being
Carlisle Floyd's ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' based on the novel by Olive
Ann Burns.
</P>
<P>
   But while operatic adaptations of novels are in vogue, it isn't
a new phenomenon. In the traditional repertory, the first famous
opera based on a full-length novel was Donizetti's ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' in 1835 _ although it's easy to forget that this
thoroughly Italian piece is based on a thoroughly British novel by
Walter Scott. Bizet's ``Carmen'' is based on a novella by Prosper
Merimee, and, in the early part of this century, Gershwin's ``Porgy
and Bess'' was inspired by DuBose Heyward's ``Porgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has become an even more popular source in recent
decades. Bernard Hermann, best known as the composer of numerous
film scores for Alfred Hitchcock, produced a setting of Emily
Bronte's ``Wuthering Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev took on the hefty challenge of Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace'' to produce a mammoth work whose dimensions discourage
performance. British composer Benjamin Britten loved to turn short
novels into operas, and did so with Herman Melville's ``Billy
Budd,'' Henry James' ``The Turn of the Screw'' and Thomas Mann's
``Death in Venice.'' Puccini's good friend Franco Alfano set
Tolstoy's ``Resurrection'' early in this century, with the book
still hot off the presses; American composer Tod Machover set the
same novel for the Houston Grand Opera in 1999. And, in keeping
with Houston Grand Opera's tradition of new works, Mark Adamo
adapted Louisa May Alcott's ``Little Women'' in 1998 on commission
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, in particular, loves to use novels as source material.
Along with ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' he has set Robert Penn Warren's
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``All the President's Men'' (retitled
``Willie Stark'', John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' and Esther
Forbes' ``A Mirror for Witches'' (retitled ``Bilby's Doll'') _ no
doubt making him, along with Oprah Winfrey, a Christmas card
favorite of struggling authors around the country.

NOEL GALLAGHER STANDS BY OASIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up the mountain, then down it. That's been the path of British
rock in the last decade _ and Oasis has seen both sides of that
mountain. The Beatles-sounding band, starring brothers Noel and
Liam Gallagher, sold 29 million albums in the mid-'90s, but has
struggled with its latest release, ``Standing on the Shoulders of
Giants,'' which slumped to no. 185 in Billboard this week after
just five weeks in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things come in cycles, don't they?'' says Noel
Gallagher, the band's guitarist and chief songwriter. ``When we
first started, people said that British guitar music was dead
because everything was American grunge with Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and
the Smashing Pumpkins. But then we came along, and all the American
rock died down for a while. But now it's back with Korn and that
type of music. Five years from now, you might be having a
conversation and jazz might be back in vogue. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after about six months of this (new) album being out,
we'll find out where we truly stand,'' adds Gallagher. ``We've just
come out of this whirlwind phenomenon that was Oasis between 1994
and 1997. The world was fascinated by British music and we were at
the forefront of that. It has sort of tailed off over the last
couple of years while we've been away, but everyone in the (Oasis)
camp is still really positive about getting out and doing the gigs
and then going on to make another record.''
</P>
<P>
   Although record sales have dropped, Oasis is still selling
oodles of concert tickets. A recent tour of Japan sold out. The
group will head back this summer to England, where it plays
football stadiums and has already sold out two nights at Wembley
Stadium, which holds 76,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new album is not a very singles-oriented album, so we
weren't expecting it to be that successful in terms of record
sales, but we're still a successful rock 'n' roll band,'' says
Gallagher. ``To be successful is not just all about selling
records.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, named for a saying on the two-pound British coin,
is, frankly, not Oasis's best, and not up to the 10 million-selling
``(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' CD, which put the band on the
international map. Some new songs work, such as the single ``Go Let
It Out'' and the psychedelic ``Who Feels Love?'' (with a ``Dear
Prudence''-style riff), but some others are surprisingly inert, and
one, ``Little James'' (written by Liam about his son), has the
goofy lyric, ``Live for your toys, even though they make noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Noel retains a wonderfully carefree attitude toward
Oasis's current sales malaise. ``I'm not in this for the career.
I'm in it because I don't want to sit at home,'' he says. ``If this
ended tomorrow, I'd just go and do something else. But I'd do
something else with a guitar on my back. Even if it was decorating
at home, I'd still have a guitar while doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he's not unaware of the pressure heaped upon Oasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the biggest band in England, but I always feel that we
get an unfair amount of pressure that we have to do something
ground-breaking. Whoever said that music had to always move
forward? Who came up with that notion? To me, it's like I'm good at
playing a Les Paul (guitar) through a Marshall stack. That's what I
do. I can't be a member of Kraftwerk, you know? I like the way that
I sound and I love the way that we sound. I don't see that I should
have to change it because of some fanciful notion that music should
always have to be moving in a certain direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Oasis has two new members this tour _ rhythm guitarist Gem
Archer and bassist Andy Bell. ``We're just a better overall band
now. It's as simple as that, and hopefully that will translate into
the recording studio the next time,'' says Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   As to his famously tempestuous relationship with Liam, Noel
says, ``It's the same as it always is. When he's sober, he's great.
When he's drunk, he's a (jerk). At the moment, he's more sober than
drunk. Six days out of seven he's great; and on the seventh day,
it's just batten down the hatches and walk in the total opposite
direction from where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As to life outside Oasis, Noel and his wife recently moved to
the country from London and had their first child, a daughter. ``I
started having babies and started a farm! It's all gone wrong!'' he
says kiddingly.
</P>
<P>
   A country gentleman? Is he turning into George Harrison or
something? ``Well, I haven't gotten his beard yet, but that's
definitely on the list,'' Gallagher says, chuckling again.
</P>
<P>

   Juliana resurfaces: Juliana Hatfield is ready to blow back into
view with not one, but two CDs on Rounder's Zoe label, due May 16.
One is the exquisite, singer-songwriterly ``Beautiful Creature,''
the other the harder-rocking ``Juliana's Pony.'' Each will be sold
separately, but a limited number will be packaged together with
bonus tracks. Hatfield, a Duxbury native who had moved to Los
Angeles but is now back in Cambridge, previewed the songs in a
stellar, sold-out show at Johnny D's on Wednesday. Once an alt-rock
queen, she now exhibits a much broader range, from the gently
sculpted melody of ``Slow Motion'' to the Led Zeppelin-style
riffing of ``My Protege.'' She stretched out nobly, aided by a
hot-shot band of guitarist John Skibic (from Gigolo Aunts), drummer
Stacy Jones (originally with Letters to Cleo, later with Veruca
Salt), and bassist Drew Parsons. Look for more local shows after
the CDs come out.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT LABEL I'D LIKE TO PUT ON THIS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what America's youngsters don't need _ another set of
labels.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Search Institute's profile of developmental
assets amounts to _ labeling youth as lacking certain elements that
grown-ups think are important for maturing into well-adjusted
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, designed to allow communities to ``assess the health
and well-being of middle and high school age children,'' asks 156
questions about everything from homework and grades to drug use and
sexual activity. The results are supposed to provide ``important
insights'' about the challenges that young people face and the
``internal strengths and external supports they have to overcome''
them.
</P>
<P>
   The spin on the Minneapolis-based institute's survey is that it
reportedly focuses on what assets young people have _ ``the
essential building blocks for adolescent development'' _ rather
than on what's lacking, but any time you ascribe specific numerical
values to a child who has the ``assets'' that make him likely to
succeed vs. one who is lacking said ``assets'' and is likely to
have a hard time, that's labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the three Tarrant County, Texas, school districts
who took the survey scored 18.8 out of a possible 40. The national
average is 18, so kids in the Everman, White Settlement and Fort
Worth school districts are above the national average _ barely.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a condemnation that our children are like children
everywhere else in America, but the local score has some folks in
the youth services arena passing peach pits because it's so low. (A
cynic might say: ``Of course they're reacting with alarm. Future
grants ride on whatever plan is devised to combat this terrible,
terrible problem.'')
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, there aren't that many gee-whiz findings in this report
that adults who take more than two minutes to think about it
couldn't figure out for themselves. It's just been packaged in a
way to make the information appear innovative.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the survey is totally without merit. It
is another bit of information that adults can consider when taking
a broad-brush look at today's youth. A very, very broad brush.
</P>
<P>
   But one has to question the survey's validity when children's
answers are filtered through adult eyes and adult mind-sets.
</P>
<P>
   One set of questions that are supposed to determine a child's
``positive identity'' asks whether the students feel they have
``control over things that happen to me.'' As a colleague of mine
said, junior high or high school age kids who believe they have
control over what happens are suffering from severe perception
problems.
</P>
<P>
   My stepdaughter, who is a charming, well-adjusted, intelligent
21-year-old completing her junior year at Texas Tech, would have
scored low on this category if she perceived her public school
years the way the adults in her life did. Teachers controlled her
school hours; coaches controlled her after-school hours; parents
controlled the majority of the remainder of her waking hours.
Alexis in control? You gotta be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   And exactly how does a sixth-grader or even an 11th-grader
define ``control''? Does that mean they decide what they wear? What
they eat for dinner? What they watch on TV? How late they get to
stay up _ or out? Most parents who are involved in their children's
lives would view a young person's total control over these things
as bad.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion that ``high self-esteem'' is necessary for a
positive identity _ please. I've known more than one kid with
``high self-esteem'' who could stand to be deflated a few notches.
Adults who value self-esteem over actual achievement are placing
the emphasis on the wrong area. A youngster who achieves in school
will automatically have increased self-esteem, and it will be based
on something other than squishy ``all hat and no cattle'' rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Caution needs to be exercised so that this survey doesn't take
on the status of divine wisdom, a 21st-century Rosetta stone for
figuring out young people.

   GERMANTOWN, N.Y. _ Lunch is ready for some 30 Carmelite Sisters
For the Aged and Infirm, gathered in the cavernous white dining
hall attached to their Motherhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Mary Suzanne, their superior general, is leading them in
grace, a prayer as familiar to devout Christians as the cool wood
of a pew. At once, the nuns bow their heads in prayer. Bless us, O
Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from Thy
bounty through Christ, Our Lord ...
</P>
<P>
   Their uniformity, of gesture and of brown habit, reinforces the
simple reverence, all the more striking when the nuns conclude,
Amen, and turn about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Suzanne explains that a visitor is here and that they
should be themselves. This room, built to hold 100 novices, as it
once did in the 1960s, suddenly echoes with the laughter and voices
of the Carmelites.
</P>
<P>
   In one moment, they have shown two sides _ the contemplative and
the active _ that have been their watchwords since Saint Albert
wrote their guiding rule around 1206.
</P>
<P>
   It is the community's prayerful and joyful character that
resonates from one end of the motherhouse, where the nuns are
hashing over the news _ ``Well, poor Darryl Strawberry'' _ to the
other, which holds a shrine to their founder, Mother M. Angeline
Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Mother M. Angeline ``felt that joy is always an important part
of religious life. She wanted there to be laughter in the convent.
She wanted there to be happiness in the convent,'' said Sister
Joseph Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic religious communities are defined by their
``charism,'' or faith-inspired philosophy, which for the Carmelites
is the compassionate care of the elderly _ in their words, ``to
clasp the hand of an older person and give meaning to the autumn of
life.'' Charism also describes a community's personality, and for
that, meet Carmelites like Sister Madeline Angeline, who as
vocation director is on the frontline of the Carmelites'
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   When Sister Theresa, one of two young novices here, first called
the Carmelites in this upstate New York community two years ago,
she got Sister Madeline. Sister Theresa's first question was
whether the Carmelites continued to wear the habit, a sign to her
of ``the consecrated life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Madeline's response: ``Yes, we wear it 25 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Madeline, by traveling to schools and college career
days, or navigating the Internet, also is responsible for putting a
human face to religious life. So, it is she who naturally relates
the story of a recent basketball game, between visiting nuns and
the Carmelites here. Complete with cheerleaders, the game, she says
as a finale, ``was to behold.''
</P>
<P>
   For a woman who carries the imposing title of superior general,
Mother Suzanne has a welcoming, natural presence as she and Sister
Joseph Catherine, the vicar general, the second-highest
officeholder, walk through the motherhouse.
</P>
<P>
   From here, Mother Suzanne oversees an order of 259 nuns, whose
community owns, co-sponsors or runs 31 nursing homes or related
facilities, in nine states and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The motherhouse, a monumental 19th-century Italianate villa
bought by the Carmelites in 1946, was one of the Hudson River
mansions built by the manorial Livingston family.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding it are acres of rolling green and maple trees, their
bark shaggy with age, and behind the white stucco motherhouse, the
Hudson unspools in a thread of pearl blue.
</P>
<P>
   A breezeway connects the 1858 estate to a neo-classical chapel,
in turn connected to 1950s buildings where the 30 nuns do most of
their living and working.
</P>
<P>
   These buildings represent an era of flourishing growth. Founder
Mother M. Angeline during the 1950s and 1960s replaced a renovated
garage that housed novices with the three-story modern building,
built a retreat house and chaplain's quarters, and added the chapel
in place of the one that now holds her relics.
</P>
<P>
   Her presence is everywhere at the motherhouse, and the tone she
set when she founded this Carmelite order, in a vacant New York
City rectory in 1929, remains in her motherhouse and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Born Brigid Teresa McCrory, this Irish immigrant originally
joined the French order of Little Sisters of the Poor. By the
1920s, Mother M. Angeline in her Bronx nursing home began
introducing small reforms, such as changing diet plans and allowing
residents to make homey touches to their quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes, made in a country with a higher standard of
living, caused a gulf between Mother M. Angeline and the order,
rooted in France's more institutional care of the poor, according
to her biographies. She and six nuns left the Little Sisters in
1929, two years later affiliating with the Carmel order, named for
the ridge in Palestine where the Virgin Mary is believed to have
visited the faithful hermits.
</P>
<P>
   In Carmelite nursing homes, Mother M. Angeline united married
couples, threw parties and dances, gave the elderly free run of
their rooms to decorate with their own furniture _ innovations from
a practical, witty woman who once characterized herself to The New
York Times as ``an adult Irish lady past 21.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to pass through the motherhouse, a gleaming
place with a floral scent, without seeing the serene-looking Mother
M. Angeline in various portraits. The Carmelites, too, have
transformed the first chapel into a heritage room. It is a stunning
collection of one person's life, with glass cases that display the
mundane, such as hairbrushes, passport, eyeglasses, and the sacred,
including the white mantle and habit she wore all her life and the
crown of white roses placed on her head when she died, on Jan. 21,
1984, her 91st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   One of her close associates, Sister Mary Gabriel, pointing to
the various ephemera, quotes one of the order's six original nuns.
``You save this because Mother is going to be a saint someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Her upstairs living quarters, too, have been converted to a
chapel; it is a contemplative place, and here, Mother Suzanne
prays, silently, momentarily, before an altar that holds a
sculpture of the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she says simply, ``is holy ground.''

</P>
<P>
   In the historic motherhouse, Sister Joseph Catherine and Mother
Suzanne discuss the days when the novitiate here brimmed with new
vocations. Mother Suzanne in 1968 entered the Carmelite order with
23 other postulants, or new applicants, in their first months of
religious life. In the early 1970s, the Carmelites numbered nearly
500 women. There are now 259, and the population is aging.
Typically, the Carmelites now accept one or two postulants each
year. Sisters Celine and Theresa, who were raised Roman Catholic in
Vietnam, are the latest, first-year novices.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 nuns live at the motherhouse, based there to administer
the community, to direct the novitiate, and to run the motherhouse
as a retreat and center of prayer for the whole congregation. Most
of the other nuns, however, live in convents at the nursing
facilities they run.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of the 1950s, when women would enter the
convent directly after high school. Now, women are deciding about
religious life later, after they've experienced college and career,
much like their counterparts who delay marriage and family as they
pursue numerous options. And, indeed, among the Carmelites are
health administrators, registered nurses, physical therapists and
social workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for people to know we are alive and well and
happy in what we're doing, and to give them pause to think that
such a life is something they should consider,'' Mother Suzanne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, their recruitment also is rooted in prayer. ``I'm
hope-filled. Our mission in the church is a very needed one. It
certainly is the work of God. Because it's such a needed ministry,
I think the Lord will continue to provide for our needs, maybe not
in the same way as in the past.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When Ashlee Danford, 16, makes her way through
the halls of Averill Park High School, she's eye-to-eye with about
half of her fellow students, standing ``tall'' at 5-feet-5-inches.
But when she returns home to play with her Shih Tzu, Rascal, she
shrinks down to 4-feet-11-inches.
</P>
<P>
   Danford has joined the ranks of young women who are wearing
platform shoes. From the malls to the office to the dance floors on
Friday and Saturday nights, many women are making the `70s-era
stompers the shoe of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Skelly, 26, of Schenectady even wears platform sneakers
_ she has three pairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate wearing flat shoes,'' Skelly said. ``They're not only
yucky and plain, but uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Skelly owns 75 pairs of shoes, most of them platforms, and only
one pair of flats.
</P>
<P>
   The flats are a requirement for Skelly's culinary studies at
Schenectady County Community College. For safety reasons, she is
not allowed in the school's kitchen in her platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get out of school, I kick them off,'' Skelly
said. ``There's no way I'm wearing them in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the platform shoe falls into two categories _ the
wedgie, where the entire bottom is one chunky piece, and the true
platform, where the sole and heel are separate.
</P>
<P>
   Skelly has mastered the balancing act of platforms and only
feels comfortable in the chunky sole. When she's cooking away from
school, she wears her platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be running around in my chef's apron and hat cooking
dinner for a big group of family and friends and everyone always
makes fun of me,'' Skelly said. ``They think it's funny that I
manage not to slip or trip when I'm trying to do so many things at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Skelly goes from 5-3 to what she calls a more desirable height
in her platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize I'm short until I have to take my shoes
off at someone's house,'' she said. ``At least one person always
comments on how I shrank.''
</P>
<P>
   Danford echos Skelly. ``I'm not even at the 5-foot mark, but no
one really notices because my shoes make me 5-4 to 5-5 every day,''
she said. ``That's good, though, because even though I'm used to my
height, I want to be taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Platform shoes, which were popular in the East for centuries,
were introduced to Europe in the 16th century. Known as chopines,
the shoes had soles up to 2 feet high. Customarily, two servants
would support a woman wearing these shoes, reinforcing the image of
a woman as frail and dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seeing men in platforms is uncommon, but it was popular
in Europe in the 17th century. King Louis XIV was unhappy with his
height and began a movement to platform shoes among men. Some had
soles as high as 5 inches and were decorated with battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Romans wore platform shoes to keep their feet out of
the mud and water. The style was revived in the 1930s, the `70s and
again in the `90s in the United States, but strictly for fashion.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Platforms have been a cause for arrest in Tokyo, where many
traffic accidents are blamed on women's inability to properly sense
the pedals and to react quickly while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Skelly used to find driving difficult and would drive in one
bare foot, but no longer feels the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Platform shoes can be just as tough for pedestrians, reducing
some women to lying sprawled on the sidewalk. Still, fashion reigns
supreme and women keep wearing the high-risk shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And they are slightly safer and more comfortable than
skinny-heeled stilettos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Platforms can cause back, hip and knee pain. It is usually
short-term,'' said Dr. Michael Dudick, a chiropractor, ``but the
foot damage that comes along with stilettos is not so much a factor
with platform shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudick said the height of the sole should be a factor in
choosing to wear platforms. He has seen girls as young as 15 in
shoes stacked to what he called a comical level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a young girl is walking around looking like Herman
Munster, she runs the risk of twisting, or even spraining her
ankle, and that's probably the biggest problem associated with the
shoes,'' he said. ``For a singular event, they're fine, but I
strongly discourage women from wearing them on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bad Fads Museum (http://www.badfads.com),
platforms are often referred to as ``the Elevated Orthopedic
Nightmare.'' In the 1960s, the shoes were only one or two inches
high but grew in height and variety until hospital emergency rooms
were routinely treating people for twisted or broken ankles.
</P>
<P>
   The media have always helped to both dictate and rule fashion.
Sally Struthers wore platforms on the popular 1970s sitcom ``All in
the Family.'' Struthers wore the shoes to shorten the height gap
between her and co-star Rob Reiner, but had to practice walking in
them before wearing them on the air, according to Barbara Williams,
curator at The Shoe Museum of the Temple University School of
Podiatric Medicine in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent addition to the museum is a pair of 6-inch blue
satin platform sandals worn by Struthers, as Gloria, on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm addicted to platforms,'' Skelly said. ``If I have money to
spend, the shoe store is the first place I go.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Gold Kist Inc. poultry processing plants in
Alabama that supply chicken to school lunch programs nationwide
were overwhelmed earlier this year by diseased poultry, federal
investigators have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many birds condemned that they were filling up
the 'USDA condemned' barrel and spilling onto the floor,'' the
report, obtained by Cox Newspapers, says of conditions at Gold
Kist's Boaz plant.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the chickens arriving on Feb. 9 were
infected with a respiratory disease called airsacculitis that
leaves pus inside the carcass, one federal worker told an
investigator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of
Inspector General (OIG). The report did not say how many chickens
arrived at the plant tat day, but typically it processes tens of
thousands of birds a day.
</P>
<P>
   At a plant in Guntersville that is using an experimental food
inspection system, the report found that Gold Kist failed to
identify substantial numbers of diseased carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the experimental program, company workers instead of
federal inspectors are supposed to find and remove substandard
poultry. But the report cited government records showing that on
Feb. 7, 28 percent of birds selected in government spot checks
after being approved by the company were diseased, typically with
airsacculitis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite conditions inside the plants, the inspector general's
office said it was dropping the matter because ``there is no
allegation of any deliberate violation of law or direct threat to
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bekkers, Gold Kist president and chief operating officer,
said in a statement posted on its Web site: ``As we have assured
our customers all along, Gold Kist Farms brand chicken products are
safe, wholesome and good to eat. We appreciate that this was
recognized in the OIG report.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Atlanta-based company refused to be
interviewed, offering instead to reply to written questions. Cox
Newspapers declined that offer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson at the inspector general's office in Washington
declined to discuss the March 3 report.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office launched its investigation in
early February after Cox Newspapers detailed allegations by several
federal food safety inspectors at the Guntersville and Boaz plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, school districts in a number of states stopped
using Gold Kist chicken nuggets, and a test by the Ohio Department
of Agriculture found Listeria, a deadly pathogen, in one lot of the
product. Gold Kist issued a recall of its chicken nuggets on Feb.
23, but no illnesses were linked to the product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to determining whether the inspectors' allegations
were true, the report says that Agriculture Department officials
asked the OIG to determine if ``internal agency documents (were
given) to the press.'' The report says it found ``no basis for
further investigation'' of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said that because of widespread disease in Gold
Kist chicken flocks, both processing plants were being inundated
with diseased poultry.
</P>
<P>
   While such birds are normally condemned, the inspectors said
that under the experimental food inspection system at the
Guntersville facility, some diseased poultry was being used to make
chicken nuggets for school lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken nuggets are not considered a threat to human health
because the poultry diseases cannot be transmitted to human beings.
However, inspectors said they considered carcasses with scabs,
sores and pus to be ``unwholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the inspectors' allegations were published,
Bekkers issued a press release defending the quality of his product
and charging that ``the public is being misled by a few
union-activist USDA poultry inspectors.'' He said that there was
``no factual support for their claims.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week after Bekkers' statement was issued, a Gold Kist
official acknowledged to an OIG investigator that ``airsacculitis
... had been moving through the flocks and infecting chickens.''
The name of the executive was deleted in the copy of the report
obtained by Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Billy, head of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, released a statement Feb. 11 saying the
government had ``excellent controls'' at the plant and that food
from the plant can be ``eaten with confidence.'' He also said, ``We
have no reason to believe products leaving these Gold Kist Plants
is anything other than safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the OIG's report quoted federal inspectors who were
complaining that ``they are not allowed to remove birds at any
point.'' The report lists the results of inspections made at
Guntersville on Feb. 5, 7 and 8. A sampling of chickens made by
federal inspectors _ after Gold Kist workers had supposedly culled
out diseased carcasses _ found that between 11 and 28 percent of
the birds were diseased. Federal rules permit a maximum of 3
percent of a sample to contain diseased birds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Agriculture Department's press office did not
respond to repeated requests for an interview with Billy.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The OIG's report raises questions about what exactly the
government means when it says food products are wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law forbids the sale of poultry for human consumption if
it is ``adulterated or misbranded'' at the time of sale. If it is
``unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human
food,'' it is considered ``adulterated.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report said that the ``inquiry did not disclose any
adulteration of product.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials have declined repeated requests
over several weeks to provide an explanation of the meaning of the
term ``wholesome'' in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, said
wholesome ``is meant to describe conditions that would not only
make the food unhealthy or unsafe, but also would be unappealing.
It is not food a consumer would knowingly want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The OIG report said that an inspector at the Boaz plant told
investigators about the chicken leaving the plant, ``as far as (he
or she) knows it is not unsafe, but (he or she) would not it it
personally. (He or she) thinks the public should know that sores
and scabs are going into it.''

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks took a beating as investors reacted
to the inflation data. At 2:30 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 429 points, the S&AMP;P 500 down 57 points, and the
Nasdaq composite index down 230 points, extending its losses for a
fifth consecutive session. European stock markets were also lower:
London was down 2.64 percent and Frankfurt down 2.88 percent. In
Japan, the Nikkei closed down 0.45 percent; Hong Kong's Hang Seng
ended down 1.28 percent. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Consumer prices accelerated more than
expected in March, reviving fears of higher inflation and putting
pressure on the Federal Reserve to step up its series of interest
rate increases. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.7 percent last
month, the biggest increase in 11 months. More important, the core
index _ which excludes food and energy, which accounted for half of
the gain in the CPI _ rose 0.4 percent, as costs increased for
clothing, housing, medical care and airfares. The gain, which
follows a 0.2 percent increase in February, was the largest since
January 1995. By Louis Uchitelle.

   ONLINE-ANTIQUARIANS (Undated) _ Ordinarily the antiquarian trade
is the dusty, genteel corner of the book market that attracts
fiercely independent booksellers who savor the musty fragrance of
brown-spotted rag paper and the Eureka moment of spotting a rare
first edition dumped in a garage sale heap. But now the dust motes
are flying in the rare and used book market with the flashy
emergence of Alibris, a virtual used bookseller with Wall Street
ambitions and Silicon Valley money. The hostilities that Alibris
has provoked among some traditional booksellers mirrors the same
tensions that other industries are facing over issues of
consolidation and the loss of personal connections. Virtual
bookselling has been a boon to used book dealers because it opens
the market to customers around the world and offered freedom to
sell these books from isolated outposts. By Doreen Carvajal.

Inner city schools and health clinics are crumbling. And while the
nation burns, the rich are buying and selling politicians like
cheap baseball cards. ``Big business is on a collision course with
American democracy, and American democracy has been losing.'' Those
are the words of Ralph Nader, who is mounting another radical
campaign for the presidency. But this time things are a little
different. He's raising money this time and enlisting the help of
left-leaning celebrities like Jackson Browne and Warren Beatty.
He's also managed to pluck some of the supports of Bill Bradley who
can't quite stomach the thought of supporting Al Gore, and he's set
his sights on winning at least 5 percent of the vote for the Green
Party. So far he seems to be succeeding, elbowing out Pat Buchanan
for third place in some recent polls. And if that happens, Nader

CUBAN CHILD DRAMA IS BACK IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The relatives of Elian Gonzalez appeared Friday to have
temporarily thwarted government efforts to reunite the boy quickly
with his father by forcing the custody fight into the arena where
they had always wanted it: the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Friday that they would not try
to take Elian from his Miami relatives until a federal court in
Atlanta reviewed a temporary stay order issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J.L. Edmondson of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta had said Elian could not leave the United States for
now, effectively barring the 6-year-old's father from immediately
taking his son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The order came Thursday, shortly after Lazaro Gonzalez, the
boy's great-uncle, defied government instructions to take Elian to
a waiting airplane by 2 p.m. on Thursday for a reunion with his
father in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is now in non-compliance to federal instructions to
them,'' Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said in a telephone interview Friday. ``So
we will be moving forward with an enforcement action plan to
enforce our order at the most appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cardona said the government would not act until a
three-judge panel reviewed the temporary stay, which could happen
as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of mounting tension, emotions cooled Friday in the
Little Havana neighborhood where protesters choked the streets
daily this week. Friday morning, a cluster of people waited in a
steady rain outside the Gonzalez family home as the focus of the
custody fight turned to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Edmondson also gave the government until Friday
morning to respond to a court injunction request filed on Monday by
lawyers for the Miami relatives. U.S. officials filed a brief at
10:45 a.m., asking the court to order the relatives to hand over
Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that the relatives had violated government orders
to surrender the boy by Thursday, and that the court should not aid
the relatives until they handed over Elian, Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   If the boy is turned over immediately to his father, Cardona
said, the government would bar the father from taking Elian out of
the country until a court appeals process is resolved. The father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who flew from Cuba to claim his son, has said
he would remain in the United States if the custody fight became a
prolonged legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of Cuban-Americans, Elian's great-uncle is
reluctant to see the boy returned to his homeland. For weeks, he
has been defying government efforts to claim the boy, hoping to
stall until the Atlanta appellate court can review his case. He has
asked the court to compel the INS to grant the boy an asylum
hearing, and oral arguments are scheduled to begin on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said Friday that they did not know when a
three-judge panel would review the temporary stay or when it would
rule on the injunction request. The injunction asked the court to
prevent Elian from leaving the country until an appeals process
initiated by the Miami relatives starts in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami relatives have also gone to a federal
court in Washington to try to prevent the boy from being taken out
of the country, arguing that such an action might violate the boy's
human rights. Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Washington said Friday that he will review the request on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had told the family to take Elian by 2 p.m. on
Thursday to Opa-Locka Airport, near Miami. But the deadline came
and went, and Elian's relatives remained in their home with the
boy. When the government took no action, a crowd of about 4,000
supporters, mostly Cuban-Americans who are opposed to the
government of President Fidel Castro, pumped their fists in the air
and shouted ``Justice! Justice! Justice!''
</P>
<P>
   Some tore apart stuffed dummies of Castro. Others called the
Atlanta court's intervention a ``miracle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that U.S. marshals
would not immediately try to take the boy if the deadline passed,
and that a government response would be ``reasoned and measured.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, Reno failed in a nearly three-hour meeting
with the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to elicit promises to
hand over the boy. The Justice Department immediately issued its
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, flew to Miami
Wednesday to try to persuade the family to accompany them to
Washington. But after Reno met Elian and negotiated with his
great-uncle at the Miami Beach villa of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, a
Roman Catholic nun, the attorney general left the home
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was given temporary residency status and placed in the
care of his great-uncle after fishermen discovered him floating in
an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy was one of
three survivors of a capsized refugee boat. His mother, who was
divorced from the boy's father, and 10 other Cubans had drowned.

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Every once in a while you read or hear an incredible story from
World War Two and wonder if it is true. Did it really take place?
Recently I was introduced to an incredible story by the person to
whom it happened.
 &HT;    I heard this story during my visit to Miami Beach, while
visiting my parents. Miami is famous for its winter resorts. Many
elderly Jews leave the New York area during the cold winter to live
in Miami Beach. My parents spend their winters there as do many
friends. There are some Holocaust survivors that meet in synagogues
and gather on a boardwalk that stretches a few miles along the
Atlantic Ocean.
 &HT;    One night my dad had asked me to join him on the boardwalk for a
stroll. We walked along the ocean, stopping to meet friends and
family. At the end of the boardwalk I met a distinguished person,
Rabbi Joseph Landau. He was sitting by himself engrossed in
thought. We sat next to him and began a friendly conversation. We
spoke in Yiddish and English.
 &HT;    I asked him in Yiddish, ``From which country are you?'' He
answered ``Auschwitz.'' I thought I heard wrong. Auschwitz is the
place where Nazis had built the concentration camp. It was the
largest death camp in Europe, responsible for killing millions of
people.
 &HT;    How could he come from such a horrible place, I wondered. I
thought the devil himself lived in Auschwitz. The killing grounds
were his playground and no good had ever been there. Certainly no
Jews ever lived there, or so I thought.
 &HT;    I was shocked when Landau enlightened me with the following
facts:
 &HT;    Auschwitz was called Osptitzin in Yiddish. It was a wonderful
little town that had a nice Jewish community consisting of 8,000
souls. There were Jewish schools called cheder, synagogues, kosher
shops, and mikvehs -- ritual baths. It had great rabbis, teachers
and a striving economy. When the Germans entered Auschwitz in 1939
they burned down the synagogue.
 &HT;    Landau was a teen-ager when Germany invaded Poland. Together
with many Jews he was taken to labor camps and then to
concentration camps. Beginning in 1940, Landau was taken to labor
camps at Sakrau, Germany, then to Blechhammer and Wiesau.
 &HT;    After years of hard labor he was shipped to the concentration
camp in Bunzalu and Terezenstat. Some camps were places where
people were murdered, others were places where you were worked and
starved to death. Miraculously, he and a few friends stayed
together and lived through those horrible years.
 &HT;    During those awful times he prayed daily and even had a pair of
religious items, tefillin. I don't know where he found the strength
to pray every day.
 &HT;    ``Many of us were worked to death. Others died of starvation or
from beatings. We worked on building the now famous German autobahn
that runs through Germany. We also built an ammunition factory for
the German war effort. You can imagine how terrible we felt doing
that!'' Landau said.
 &HT;    ``In 1942 to 1944 I was held in a work camp called Wiesau. We
were kept alive as long as we could work. There I lived in daily
fear of being killed. We were about 26 to 50 persons to a barrack.
Our sleeping quarters were miserable. The mattresses were a small
sack of straw. In the winter we had a small stove that heated the
room. Most of the time we were starving and ill-treated.
 &HT;    ``When the holiday of Passover came about I decided that I must
have matzoh, the unleavened bread of faith. I wanted very badly to
celebrate the Passover seder with matzoh. I told my closest friends
that we would try to get some flour and I would risk my life to
bake matzoh for Passover.''
 &HT;    Landau described the camp's conditions:
 &HT;    ``We worked from early morning to late night and then we were
locked up for the night. If we were lucky we would not be disturbed
or beaten. So life went on day by day. We became so disoriented
that after a while we didn't even know what day it was. But then in
1942, I still remembered to count the days until Passover.
 &HT;    ``At work, we would be given a cigarette a day and a small piece
of bread. At night, we would be given a cup full of liquid called
soup. This was our rations. It was a meager existence.
 &HT;    ``We decided to keep our cigarettes and barter them for flour
from a Czechoslovakian worker. At first we thought it wouldn't work
out but as the saying goes, 'When there's a will there's a way.'
 &HT;    ``Our fellow workers let it be known that they could get a
cigarette for flour and, miraculously, an ounce of flour appeared.
Soon we had a bit more, enough to supply a matzoh or two for our
seder, or Passover meal.
 &HT;    ``Now we had a fresh problem. How would we smuggle the flour
into our barracks? If anyone were caught smuggling they would be
shot. The following plan was instituted. We would bring the flour
into the camp at night by hiding it in our clothing. At the bottom
of our pants we made a small hem. In there we would put a few
sprinkles of flour. We tucked our pants into our worn-out shoes.
Then we returned to the barracks. We would be searched and allowed
in.
 &HT;    ``Miraculously, the flour was not discovered. Then very
carefully we would empty and shake the flour out of the ends of our
pants. Slowly but surely we had flour for Passover. Imagine, here
we were in the terrible labor camp thinking of only one thing -- to
have matzoh for the holiday.
 &HT;    ``It had taken us a long time to save a pound of flour. We
waited patiently for the holiday. I also knew if we were caught it
would be the end of us but I was as determined as ever.
 &HT;    ``The night before Passover we heated up the potbelly stove
until the top was burning red hot. Very quickly we mixed the flour
and water and kneaded the dough. In just a few minutes we had baked
two or three matzohs. I thought to myself, if I can only stay alive
to keep on doing my religious duties.
 &HT;    ``I sorely missed my family and remembered my Yeshiva friends
and teachers. Our great family seders were now a thing of the past.
Living in the past kept me alive in the present. That Passover
night we ate matzoh, never knowing if we would survive the war, but
we did.
 &HT;    ``In 1945, I was moved to the concentration camp in Terezenstat.
I was part of a death march where most of the participants died.
The Germans moved us, hoping we would all die. They wanted to
destroy all the evidence of their crimes. But God did not let that
happen.
 &HT;    ``I became very sick and almost died. On May 8, 1945 I was
liberated by the Russians. After regaining my health I was
determined to keep on going. I met a girl who survived the
Auschwitz death camps. We had similar goal and were determined to
start a family. I thank God that I have two daughters and many
grandchildren.
 &HT;    ``When I came to America I became a teacher for children and
organized a school for children of refugees. As the school grew so
did my responsibilities. I became the principal of the school. From
a small group of survivors we grew into thousands. We built
schools, synagogues and saw the rebirth of our people. As I have
retired I spend my winters in Miami Beach.''
 &HT;    Rabbi Landau gave a sigh and his remarkable story came to an
end.
 &HT;    I thought, imagine, here was a real person who suffered years of
labor and concentration camps. A real walking witness of the past
generation. He is the living proof that no matter what happens to a
person he can rise to the occasion and outlive his adversaries.
 &HT;    Rabbi Landau's message is that ``As long as man feels that God
is with him he can make it through any Holocaust.''
 &HT;    True, his parents, brother and most of his family and friends
perished, but he would not stop hoping. He rose from the ashes and
looked ahead, rebuilding his family legacy.
 &HT;    This year when Passover comes, gather your family and tell them
how, in every generation, Jews are persecuted and saved. How in
World War Two we were sought out and killed. Yet, even in those
times there are those who became stronger in their faith. They did
everything possible to bake their matzoh and eat the bread of
faith.
 &HT;    Think and take courage. If Rabbi Landau could make matzoh in a
labor death camp, then surely we can find time to do so in our
God-given free land of America.
 &HT;    On Wednesday night, April 19, Jews worldwide will celebrate the
Passover holiday. When we eat our matzoh, break off a piece, share
it with our neighbors, telling them that the message of liberation
is for all people.
 &HT;    A happy Passover to you all.

room. Most of the time we were starving and ill-treated.
 &HT;    ``When the holiday of Passover came about I decided that I must
have matzoh, the unleavened bread of faith. I wanted very badly to
celebrate the Passover seder with matzoh. I told my closest friends
that we would try to get some flour and I would risk my life to
bake matzoh for Passover.''
 &HT;    Landau described the camp's conditions:
 &HT;    ``We worked from early morning to late night and then we were
locked up for the night. If we were lucky we would not be disturbed
or beaten. So life went on day by day. We became so disoriented
that after a while we didn't even know what day it was. But then in
1942, I still remembered to count the days until Passover.
 &HT;    ``At work, we would be given a cigarette a day and a small piece
of bread. At night, we would be given a cup full of liquid called
soup. This was our rations. It was a meager existence.
 &HT;    ``We decided to keep our cigarettes and barter them for flour
from a Czechoslovakian worker. At first we thought it wouldn't work
out but as the saying goes, 'When there's a will there's a way.'
 &HT;    ``Our fellow workers let it be known that they could get a
cigarette for flour and, miraculously, an ounce of flour appeared.
Soon we had a bit more, enough to supply a matzoh or two for our
seder, or Passover meal.
 &HT;    ``Now we had a fresh problem. How would we smuggle the flour
into our barracks? If anyone were caught smuggling they would be
shot. The following plan was instituted. We would bring the flour
into the camp at night by hiding it in our clothing. At the bottom
of our pants we made a small hem. In there we would put a few
sprinkles of flour. We tucked our pants into our worn-out shoes.
Then we returned to the barracks. We would be searched and allowed
in.
 &HT;    ``Miraculously, the flour was not discovered. Then very
carefully we would empty and shake the flour out of the ends of our
pants. Slowly but surely we had flour for Passover. Imagine, here
we were in the terrible labor camp thinking of only one thing -- to
have matzoh for the holiday.
 &HT;    ``It had taken us a long time to save a pound of flour. We
waited patiently for the holiday. I also knew if we were caught it
would be the end of us but I was as determined as ever.
 &HT;    ``The night before Passover we heated up the potbelly stove
until the top was burning red hot. Very quickly we mixed the flour
and water and kneaded the dough. In just a few minutes we had baked
two or three matzohs. I thought to myself, if I can only stay alive
to keep on doing my religious duties.
 &HT;    ``I sorely missed my family and remembered my Yeshiva friends
and teachers. Our great family seders were now a thing of the past.
Living in the past kept me alive in the present. That Passover
night we ate matzoh, never knowing if we would survive the war, but
we did.
 &HT;    ``In 1945, I was moved to the concentration camp in Terezenstat.
I was part of a death march where most of the participants died.
The Germans moved us, hoping we would all die. They wanted to
destroy all the evidence of their crimes. But God did not let that
happen.
 &HT;    ``I became very sick and almost died. On May 8, 1945 I was
liberated by the Russians. After regaining my health I was
determined to keep on going. I met a girl who survived the
Auschwitz death camps. We had similar goal and were determined to
start a family. I thank God that I have two daughters and many
grandchildren.
 &HT;    ``When I came to America I became a teacher for children and
organized a school for children of refugees. As the school grew so
did my responsibilities. I became the principal of the school. From
a small group of survivors we grew into thousands. We built
schools, synagogues and saw the rebirth of our people. As I have
retired I spend my winters in Miami Beach.''
 &HT;    Rabbi Landau gave a sigh and his remarkable story came to an
end.
 &HT;    I thought, imagine, here was a real person who suffered years of
labor and concentration camps. A real walking witness of the past
generation. He is the living proof that no matter what happens to a
person he can rise to the occasion and outlive his adversaries.
 &HT;    Rabbi Landau's message is that ``As long as man feels that God
is with him he can make it through any Holocaust.''
 &HT;    True, his parents, brother and most of his family and friends
perished, but he would not stop hoping. He rose from the ashes and
looked ahead, rebuilding his family legacy.
 &HT;    This year when Passover comes, gather your family and tell them
how, in every generation, Jews are persecuted and saved. How in
World War Two we were sought out and killed. Yet, even in those
times there are those who became stronger in their faith. They did
everything possible to bake their matzoh and eat the bread of
faith.
 &HT;    Think and take courage. If Rabbi Landau could make matzoh in a
labor death camp, then surely we can find time to do so in our
God-given free land of America.
 &HT;    On Wednesday night, April 19, Jews worldwide will celebrate the
Passover holiday. When we eat our matzoh, break off a piece, share
it with our neighbors, telling them that the message of liberation
is for all people.
 &HT;    A happy Passover to you all.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: They don't make chili like this
anymore
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Neighbor, can I borrow a cup of suet?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if you can spare it, I need a little more than a cup.
</P>
<P>
   Say, three pounds?
</P>
<P>
   It's for a recipe that's come my way for homemade chili.
</P>
<P>
   Doggone if I haven't let my supply of suet run low. And you
never have too much suet.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you of the tofu persuasion, I'm talking about pure
rendered fat, the stuff that used to make everything from turnip
greens to fried green tomatoes taste all the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   I say used to.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who have given up the joys of living in an effort to live
forever have forsaken staples such as suet in our more enlightened
times.
</P>
<P>
   This particular recipe comes from a different time.
</P>
<P>
   It's from the old Eat-A-Bite Cafe which, long, long ago, was
located downtown on First Street in a miniature, cottage-like
building, so small there was no room for tables, only stools at the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, most all the stools were occupied.
</P>
<P>
   You could get a good hamburger there, but the Eat-A-Bite Cafe's
homemade chili was what it was famous for.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, it was a secret recipe presumed to have been lost
years ago when the little cafe finally closed its doors for the
last time, an eventual casualty of the highway bypass having routed
traffic and business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I would imagine that the cook has long since departed this
world. For that matter, so have most of the people who ate there,
particularly those who ate there regularly, casualities in need of
a bypass themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But now it turns out that the chili recipe has survived after
all.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow I know passed along the details, scribbled onto a 3x5
card by, I'm told, a waitress who had wanted the recipe for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   How he came by it, he didn't say and I didn't ask.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, in the interest of preserving history _ though
perhaps not lives _ I have acquired a copy, which I hereby pass
along to posterity:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eat-A-Bite Cafe's Homemade Chili
</P>
<P>
   12 pounds chili meat
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds of suet (rendered out fat)
</P>
<P>
   Add meat to fat, cook for 30 minutes. Stir often on low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add to meat:
</P>
<P>
   2 tbs. salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tbs. garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tbs. cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 qt. water
</P>
<P>
   Cook 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bowl, mix 1/2 pound chili blend mix, 1 small box
paprika, 2 pounds flour.
</P>
<P>
   Add water to make a paste thin enough to pour, add to meat
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Add between 1 pint and 1 qt. water to desired consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Skim excess fat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming there is such a thing as excess fat.
</P>
<P>
   Eat at your own risk. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The recipe doesn't suggest how many it'll feed. But any
culinary concoction that requires two pounds of flour most likely
will take care of a fair-sized crowd.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. I checked with a local meat market. Suet is still
available, at 89 cents a pound. You have to wonder how they can
sell it so cheap.

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Perhaps I should start by saying that I have never had a dog I
would have wished to replicate. There was Nappy, the poodle-shaped
blur of my toddler years. Sweet little Woof, never the brightest
bulb in the canine kingdom. Lawrence, the Labrador, who barked at
suitcases on wheels. My sister's Irish setter, who gathered up the
ripest of our unwashed laundry and slept in it.
 &HT;    I won't bore you with the rest of my dog-owning history, except
to add that I liked all my dogs, toilet-drinkers though they were,
mourned their passing _ and trooped cheerfully off to the animal
shelter when the time came for a new one. I am not, in other words,
the target customer for Genetic Savings and Clone, a company that
offers to store the DNA of your aging dog or cat so that one just
like it may someday be cloned for you, at a cost, initially, of
about $200,000 each.
 &HT;    The company is itself an offshoot of the Missyplicity Project,
founded in 1998 when an anonymous couple gave $2.3 million to Texas
A&AMP;M University so that biologists there might devote their
considerable time and expertise to the remaking of the couple's pet
dog, Missy. Researchers hope to meet that goal by the end of this
year.
 &HT;    In the purity of its self-indulgence and the frivolousness of
its purpose, the Missyplicity project is unique. Why invest
millions in pet cloning when the world is full of sick children and
stray dogs? But in another sense, it is an entirely representative
case _ a riveting reminder of the way in which the idea of cloning
has been normalized, even cute-ified, in remarkably short order.
 &HT;    Remember how it was just three years ago? In February 1997, when
scientists in Edinburgh unveiled Dolly, a cloned sheep, the whole
idea of cloning mammals _ and the path it seemed to open to the
cloning of humans _ struck countless observers as a hideous portent
of science out of control. Writing of cloning's potential for
commodifying human life and further depersonalizing reproduction,
the moral philosopher Leon Kass warned, ``Shallow are the souls
that have forgotten how to shudder.''
 &HT;    Who shudders now? Last month, when PPL Therapeutics, a biotech
company, revealed that it had produced five cloned pigs, the story
didn't even make the front page of many newspapers. When the
Discovery Channel sponsored the thawing of a woolly mammoth _ which
scientists hoped to clone _ Larry Agenbroad, a paleontologist
involved with the project, crowed: ``When people say, 'Why clone a
woolly mammoth?' I say, 'Why not?'''
 &HT;    His swagger was so convincing that the skeptical biologist who
protested that ``life isn't something you start and stop like a
record. It has to go on in continuum'' sounded like a querulous
Luddite _ even to millions who had applauded the didactic ending of
``Jurassic Park.''
 &HT;    ``There are theological objections to this work, but the
objectors have to back off,'' Michael Archer, a scientist working
on the cloning of the extinct Tasmanian tiger, has said. ``This is
the way science, and life, is going.'' Not all cloning projects are
alike, and cloned pigs, it must be said, may someday save the lives
of people in need of transplants.
 &HT;    And yet, every news account that wallows in porcine cuteness
(``the baby pigs playfully wrestled and nibbled on one another's
ears at the news conference'') or matter-of-factly reports their
beneficial effect on PPL's stock price, makes the whole
Frankensteinian business seem that much more banal. Every
breakthrough in animal cloning makes human cloning not just more
technically plausible, but more emotionally plausible.
 &HT;    In February, the European Patent Office admitted that it had _
by mistake _ issued a patent that could include human cloning. It's
true that many technological innovations that once seemed
disturbingly unnatural _ in vitro fertilization, for one _ have
been folded more or less smoothly into the fabric of modern life.
 &HT;    But human cloning is different. It would be a quantum leap
toward the manufacture of children as consumer goods. And it would
introduce a new kind of intergenerational tyranny: who can doubt
that a child endowed with _ specifically chosen to have _ a
previously used genotype would grow up fettered by parents'
Procrustean expectations of how those genes should perform?
 &HT;    ``It is pertinent to ask,'' wrote Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell,
the scientists who brought us Dolly, ``whether curiosity, vanity,
the wish for personal power or an undoubtedly misguided desire for
immortality really are good enough reasons for bringing a child
into the world.''
 &HT;    In its own small or maybe not so small way, the Missyplicity
Project is the cloning frontier's worst moral offender. That's
because it represents the first example of cloning for sentimental
reasons, the first attempt to recreate a specific animal, and so
feeds the illusion that those we love can be replaced by genetic
copies. It doesn't matter that Missyplicity's backers admit a clone
can duplicate only a creature's genetic material, not its identity.
The fantasy they are playing to is of resurrection.
 &HT;    The Texas A&AMP;M scientists say they have already been inundated
with requests from people whose pet ``is dying or got hit by a car
or ... is just getting old.'' And for three years, Ian Wilmut has
been taking calls from grieving parents and others begging him to
clone their loved ones back to life.
 &HT;    Cloyingly, incrementally, Missyplicity and its ilk make the
manufacture of replacement-model humans seem that much more
imaginable. And that, I think, is still worth a shudder.

 (ART ADV: Color photo of Sidney Poitier is available in JPEG format
by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By BRENT STAPLES  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Sidney Poitier has sworn off alcohol, red meat, milk, sugar _
and refers to his occasional scoop of ice cream as ``falling off
the wagon.'' His dietary discipline is legendary in Beverly Hills,
where his frequent dinner companions include the romance novelist
Jackie Collins and the billionaire businessman Marvin Davis.
 &HT;    At breakfast recently at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los
Angeles, Poitier consumed an omelet made of egg whites, to avoid
cholesterol, and a side dish of broccoli, in keeping with his habit
of eating vegetables at every meal. But the highlight was the
serving of granola topped with blueberries. Instead of milk,
Poitier poured water into the bowl.
 &HT;    Poitier has been a health food and exercise enthusiast for at
least 40 years, and it has served him well: at 73, he is 6-foot-3,
200 pounds, trim, fit and still smiling the incandescent smile that
started his career five decades ago. His eating habits, however,
constitute more than a diet. They flow from an iron-willed
self-control that covers his every waking moment, allowing him to
present himself as the cool and elegant gentleman, even through
periods of enormous personal strain.
 &HT;    People who know him from his first days as a stage actor in New
York, like Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, know a different person,
however. As Dee says: ``Sidney is the smoldering flame that you
don't think will catch fire and burn down the house. He has a
capacity for explosion that is incredible. It takes possession of
him.''
 &HT;    Davis adds that having to sit on that temper in Hollywood ``is a
prison I certainly would not wish to occupy.'' The subject of that
temper does not come easily to Poitier in conversation, but he
describes his relationship with his ``demons'' as ``perfect''
because he knows when to give vent to them and when to force them
down.
 &HT;    ``I know that my biggest job is to keep them as controlled as I
can because they are _ what's the word? _ seismic.''
 &HT;    Control is the dominant motif in Poitier's new memoir, his
second, ``The Measure of a Man,'' which is revealing in what it
leaves out. Poitier views the book as a ``summing up'' of his
career and his life as father to six daughters, but the crux is
Poitier's preoccupation with the choices he made to sustain his
long run as a leading man, and the shift in racial politics that
helped to bring that run to an end.
 &HT;    Everything about Poitier is indirect _ an image reflected in an
image, seen through an inflection. But read between the lines,
``The Measure of a Man'' is a self-defense brief, deployed against
critics who attacked him during the 1960s as an ``Uncle Tom'' and a
``house nigger.''
 &HT;    Before Sidney Poitier left New York for Hollywood,
African-American characters in the movies consisted mainly of
butlers, maids and Stepin Fetchits who shuffled across the screen
in dimwitted bewilderment. Poitier broke this mold in 1950, playing
a black doctor who treated white patients in ``No Way Out'' _ a
film that was so threatening at the time that the authorities
banned it in parts of the United States and in Poitier's native
Bahamas, then still a colony of Britain.
 &HT;    By the late 1960s, Poitier had been awarded an Oscar for best
actor for his performance in ``Lilies of the Field'' (he is still
that award's only black recipient) and made more than two dozen
films in the same vein, allowing Americans to envision black people
not just as butlers and maids, but also as doctors, psychiatrists,
engineers, war correspondents, teachers and police detectives.
 &HT;    The attack on Poitier began in earnest in 1967, when he starred
in three hit movies during the same year. While ``To Sir With
Love,'' ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner?'' made him the biggest box-office star in the country,
Poitier came under ferocious fire.
 &HT;    White critics savaged his work as superficial. African-American
critics like the playwright Clifford Mason, writing in The New York
Times, branded him ``a showcase nigger'' who coddled white racists
instead of punching them in the face. All at once, black radicalism
begat the questionable blessing of the black exploitation films
with pimps, prostitutes and tough guys yelling ``Get Whitey.''
Poitier was suddenly reviled as a Stepin Fetchit in a gray flannel
suit.
 &HT;    Everything changes if you live long enough, and now Poitier has
gone from outcast to hero once more. Over the last several years,
the critical establishment has beaten a path to his door bearing
laurels and awards. The period of rejection in the 1960s, according
to those who knew him, was a living hell.
 &HT;    But when Poitier speaks of it today, he does so with the typical
reserve: ``I didn't feel victimized by any of it. There was never a
time when I didn't take those attacks without giving them their due
natural measure, and saying, 'Is there value in this?''' But those
``demons'' still rage beneath this polished veneer.
 &HT;    In the most illuminating section of his memoir, Poitier
discusses Virgil Tibbs, the black police detective he portrayed in
``In the Heat of the Night.'' The emotional center of the movie is
a scene in which Tibbs interviews one of the town's most important
white citizens and the man slaps him across the face, as he would
any black person from the surrounding cotton fields. Without
missing a beat, Tibbs slaps him back, quickly _ and returns to his
cool, cerebral self.
 &HT;    Poitier explains that he, and not the director, added the
retaliation to the script. Poitier writes that a black man solving
the murder of a white person in deep Mississippi represented
progress that ``didn't come from unbridled rage any more than it
came from polite submission. Progress then and now comes from the
collision of powerful forces within the hearts of those who strive
for it. Anger and charity, love and hate, pride and shame, broken
down and reassembled in an igneous process that yields a fierce
resolve.''
 &HT;    Indirectly, Poitier invites us to re-examine his work and,
through it, our history. Now who was ``blacker'' in the 1960s: the
cerebral detective Virgil Tibbs, outwitting white folks in
Mississippi, or those long-gone blaxploitation heroes screaming
``Kill Whitey'' at the camera?

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a videotape of Saul Bellow's 75th birthday party, held
in 1990. The festivities took place at the Art Institute of
Chicago. Mayor Richard M. Daley and his wife, Maggie, were the
hosts. Bellow's close friend Allan Bloom was the toastmaster.
Chicago was entering a renaissance under a new mayor; this official
party was a symbol of progress, so a local television station
covered it.
</P>
<P>
   The results are unremarkable. You see a provincial celebration
of a hometown boy _ ``Chicago's greatest writer'' _ made good. But
once you have read Saul Bellow's new novel, ``Ravelstein,'' the
tape becomes more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' is a memoirlike account of Bellow's friendship
with Bloom, the political philosopher who achieved fame with his
1987 jeremiad, ``The Closing of the American Mind,'' a No. 1 best
seller for 10 weeks. It shaped the culture wars, the battle over
what to teach in universities, for years afterward. President
Ronald Reagan invited Bloom to the White House; Margaret Thatcher
discussed philosophy with him at Chequers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow and Bloom, who died in 1992, had become close during
their years teaching together at the University of Chicago's
Committee for Social Thought, an interdisciplinary graduate program
known for its conservative ideological focus.
</P>
<P>
   Within that community and beyond, ``Ravelstein'' has created a
furor, because in it the 84-year-old Bellow discloses that Bloom
(the Ravelstein of the title) was homosexual and writes that his
death at age 62, ascribed in his obituaries to internal bleeding
and liver failure, was actually from AIDS. Some of Bloom's other
friends dispute the cause of death and wonder at Bellow's
intentions in ``outing'' his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Bellow write ``Ravelstein''? Is it an act of friendship
or betrayal? Did he mean to enhance Bloom's reputation or discredit
it? Or is this just what authors do _ tell their friends' secrets?
Part way through writing ``Ravelstein,'' Bellow sent Werner
Dannhauser, a political scientist who had been a close friend and
ideological soul mate of Bloom's, a draft of his novel. Dannhauser
told him he had included too many details about Bloom's private
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did my objections register?'' Dannhauser remembered with an
unhappy laugh. ``Yes, but he decided to do it anyway.'' As for
Bellow, he heard the conversation differently. To his ear,
Dannhauser's objections were unremarkable. Bellow, ignoring
Dannhauser, went back to work on what he called his ``testimony to
my feeling for Bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   The birthday party figures in the novel. It is transformed into
an event in honor of Ravelstein, shortly after which he collapses
with his first severe symptoms of HIV infection. It is the moment
before he goes from cultural ``rock star'' to prisoner under
sentence of death. When I asked Bellow last month about the party,
he insisted he had nothing special on his mind that night 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating fiction is a very strange thing,'' he said. ``Very
few people understand it. They may think they do. They try to line
it up with certain knowable facts, but it doesn't always work that
way.'' What Bellow mostly remembered about his party was worrying
that a speaker would say something to embarrass him. Nothing like
that happened.
</P>
<P>
   But now, facing criticisms of his thinly disguised portrait of
Bloom, he wondered if he himself had done something in bad taste.
In publishing ``Ravelstein,'' Bellow confessed, he was afraid he
had ``crossed the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan bloom was only famous at the end of his life. When he came
to the University of Chicago in 1979, he had been a little-known
professor of philosophy for 25 years _ at Yale, then Cornell, then
the University of Toronto. He had a preoccupation with the question
of what kind of individual can best protect a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom had encouraged generations of students to ask themselves
this question, to clear their minds of cant and faddishness and to
try to understand freedom at the deepest level. He saw it as a
struggle for their souls. The approach, with its emphasis on
classical texts, was widely taken as conservative, though Bloom
always insisted it was radically democratic. It specifically
excluded the politics of identity.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom bonded closely with his male students and infrequently
with female ones. But he didn't fit into contemporary categories of
``closeted'' or ``out,'' because in some sense he didn't live in
the present at all. ``Allan saw himself as an ancient Greek,'' said
a friend. (Bellow writes the same of Ravelstein.)
</P>
<P>
   When Bellow met Bloom in 1979, the novelist was the central
figure of American letters. He had recently won the Nobel Prize in
Literature. He was on his fourth marriage, to the beautiful
Romanian-born mathematician Alexandra Tulcea. He had been cheated
on and cheated. He had had Reichian analysis. He was a brilliant
raconteur with a cruel wit. His credo was that America was a tough
country for those who lived by their imaginations _ and that for a
poet to survive, he had to know how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Famous, clever and quotable, Bellow did not lack company. But he
missed conversation at his own level. Most of Bellow's intellectual
peers _ men like the art critic Harold Rosenberg and the poet
Delmore Schwartz _ had died. These were people who, as his
43-year-old son Adam Bellow remembered, ``could tell him something
was no good and not to publish it.'' Moreover, Bellow was aware
that even in his triumph, time was running out for writers like
him.
</P>
<P>
   The midcentury domination of culture and literature by American
Jewish immigrants' descendants like Bloom, Bellow, Roth and Mailer
was on its way out. Much like his characters, he lived in a kind of
land of the dead. He was lonely. When I spoke with Bellow, he
recalled his first extended encounter with Bloom: a discussion of
``Madame Bovary'' in his office. They bonded quickly. ``We
understood each other immediately,'' Bellow said.
</P>
<P>
   They both loved to talk, but they were both used to being
listened to, so they compromised. Bellow laughed at Bloom's jokes
and Bloom at Bellow's. They decided to teach a course on the
political and philosophical aspects of classic texts. The class was
limited to the Western canon _ Rousseau, Montesquieu, Flaubert _
and left literary theory out. This focus felt unremarkable within
the conservative confines of the University of Chicago in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow eventually moved into the apartment building next to
Bloom's. From his window, he could see if his friend's lights were
on. They spent so much time together that Bellow's wife, Alexandra,
with whom he was fighting, accused them of being lovers.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is highlighted in ``Ravelstein.'' Chickie, the
narrator who stands in for Bellow, tells his wife that when it
comes to homosexuality, he wouldn't even know ``how the act was
done.'' When I asked Bellow about this, he had a similar answer.
``Alexandra's was sort of a low blow,'' he said. ``I didn't take it
seriously. I had never been queer and I never expected to become
queer.''
</P>
<P>
   After his marriage to Alexandra ended in 1985, Bellow and Bloom
for a time had dinner together several times a week. Once, to a
friend, Bloom jokingly referred to this period as ``the time Saul
and I were married.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner Dannhauser said that Bloom at first was wary of being
written about. He knew that Bellow had a way of satirizing his
friends in his fiction. But Bloom was by his nature effusive and
gossipy. (In the novel, Ravelstein jokes, ``It's not gossip, it's
social history.'') Over time, Bloom gave up his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Allan liked someone, he wasn't very calculating,''
Dannhauser remembered. In the early '80s, Bellow began to encourage
Bloom to put his thoughts into book form. He could make some money
and pay for his extravagant tastes, his love for fine clothes and
good food. Bloom began work on a book with the title ``American
Nihilism,'' which became ``The Closing of the American Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow wrote the book's foreword and got his agent, Wasserman,
to take on Bloom. The advance from Simon &AMP; Schuster was $10,000. In
his 1982 novel, ``The Dean's December,'' Bellow had already created
an academic who writes a controversial essay about the moral decay
of the country. Now life would imitate his art.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom got a lot out of the friendship, too. He got acceptance.
He also became a millionaire, and took great pleasure in spending
his riches. Although his writing style had previously been fussy
and academic, contact with Bellow improved it. By the time ``The
Closing of the American Mind'' was published, he had begun to write
the way he spoke, in the Midwestern Jewish patois that is so
expertly captured in ``Ravelstein.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bloom grew sick. First came a flare-up of shingles.
Then, some time after Bellow's birthday party, Bloom came down with
Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurological ailment causing temporary
paralysis. When he died, in October 1992, the official cause on his
death certificate was bleeding from peptic ulcers compounded by
liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow was devastated. He had married wife No. 5, Janis
Freedman, a former graduate student of Bloom's who had become
Bellow's assistant. He was debating moving to Boston University and
had wanted Bloom to come too. After Bloom's death, for several
years Bellow temporized about writing about his friend. He had
health problems of his own. Besides, he couldn't find the angle.
Encomia were not, as he would say, his racket. He worked on other
things; in 1993 he and Janis moved to Boston. Two years later, the
couple went to St. Martin on a vacation. Bellow almost died from a
toxin he ingested in some red snapper. ``I was nine-tenths gone,''
he told me. When he regained his strength, he got to work on
``Ravelstein.'' By 1998, he completed a draft of the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' is the chronicle of a late-life friendship told
from the point of view of the surviving friend. It begins just
after Ravelstein has published an unnamed best-selling book of
ideas and takes the reader through the last few years of his life.
We marvel with the narrator, Chickie, at the unique phenomenon that
is Abe Ravelstein, an academic whose ``intellect had made a
millionaire of him.'' In the midst of his boon, Ravelstein,
reaching for the truth about himself, gets Chickie to promise to
write about him, ``without softeners or sweeteners.'' Then we learn
of his disease and follow him through the series of medical crises
that end with his death.
</P>
<P>
   This story is pretty true to Bloom's life. Bloom's younger
companion and heir, Michael Wu, figures in the novel, too, renamed
Nikki. A chef in real life, in ``Ravelstein'' he is a largely
sensual presence, a ``graceful, boyish man'' with ``round arms''
and ``long shifting layers of black hair reaching his glossy
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial passages in the book _ those about
Bloom's private life _ are surprisingly vague. Ravelstein, we
learn, ``relished louche encounters, the fishy and the equivocal,''
but that is all we learn. There are no liaisons described.
Ravelstein's urges are only articulated in a brief passage in which
he confesses that he still thinks ``a lot about those pretty boys
in Paris.'' Considering that the link between the libido and the
intellect is Bellow's signature focus, one doesn't expect to be
left at the bedroom door. The reticence _ perhaps even discomfort _
is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Ravelstein'' offers a richly imagined portrait of
Bloom as intellectual, as teacher, as friend. Is this not in itself
a great favor? There is little in ``The Closing of the American
Mind'' to remind us that behind all that learning was a first-class
personality. It took Bellow to unearth the human being, to bring
out Bloom's inner glory. No matter what critics may say, isn't this
the ultimate gift to a friend?
</P>
<P>
   After the story that he had ``outed'' Bloom broke in February,
Bellow appeared to shut himself off. His son, Adam, became his de
facto intermediary, and he was able to present the brief for the
defense. ``You should not forget that there are compensations for
people who get caught by my father's genius,'' he said. ``You get a
true portrait of yourself and the knowledge you've been taken
seriously by a great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the portrait by a great artist a true portrait? To be
sure, the novelist's truth is certainly not the same as the
journalist's truth. Nathan Tarcov, a University of Chicago
professor who is the son of Bellow's old friend Oscar Tarcov,
doesn't believe Bloom died of AIDS. Nathan was Bloom's medical
executor and present during his final days. ``The word AIDS was
never mentioned when Allan died,'' he said. ``I think I would have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who signed Bloom's death certificate, Nicholas
Davidson, considers the cause of death ``pretty much irrelevant.''
Bloom was a man who ``was in heart failure, kidney failure,'' he
said. ``The body was winding down.'' Michael Wu, he remembered, was
constantly at Bloom's bedside, but Wu did not want to revisit
Bloom's death with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fiction, not a biography,'' is all he would say of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to be the end of it. ``Ravelstein'' was a rorschach
test. How you saw it depended on who you were. Then, in mid-March,
I got a call from Saul Bellow's assistant at Boston University.
Bellow would sit for an interview about ``Ravelstein'' and its
sources.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of our meeting, Bellow did not want our subject to be
fiction. This business of Bloom had gotten out of hand, and he
wanted to talk about it. He explained the high ambition of the
book, its goal. He said, ``There are few people who are trained in
their souls, so to speak, to do something extraordinary, and I
think Bloom was such a person.'' Such models present themselves
only rarely in a writer's life, and he couldn't resist the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bloom was in some sense a great man,'' he said, ``and I wanted
to get him down on paper.'' Where he had erred, he told me, was in
misjudging people's sensitivities about homosexuality and AIDS.
``You know, I've discovered that this is a very itchy subject, and
the people carry over attitudes more appropriate to the Middle
Ages.'' But he didn't stop there. He said he now felt sorry about
having exposed Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the feeling it brought with it and the sense of
neglected responsibility and even recklessness on my part, because
I didn't mean any harm to Allan,'' he said. ``He was so open about
himself that you never thought of it as being harmful. Perhaps I
should have held on to the book for a while and not published it so
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosing Bloom's cause of death was not, as his son Adam
suggested, a plot to foil Bloom's enemies. Bloom had been oblique
about his illness, as he was oblique about many things. He had
never spoken to Bellow about his having HIV or AIDS. ``I don't know
that he died of AIDS, really,'' Bellow said. ``It was just my
impression that he may have.'' Bellow had given him the disease,
finally, because it was the right one for Ravelstein, who was in so
many ways Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, there was a finished copy of the book sent by
the publisher waiting for me. I knew, since the appearance of the
advanced galleys in January, that Bellow had been working steadily
with a copy editor to perfect ``Ravelstein.'' But as I read through
it, I found that he had been up to something else too. He had
tinkered with the mentions of homosexuality and AIDS. Ravelstein
and Nikki's sexual connection was now just implied. The phrase ``He
was HIV-positive, he was dying from it'' had been changed to ``He
was HIV-positive, he was dying of complications from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The words ``from HIV'' had been excised from the sentence ``And
not only his death from HIV but a good many other deaths as well.''
The phrase ``Abe was taking the common drug prescribed for AIDS''
had become ``Abe was taking the common drug prescribed for his
condition.'' Bellow had made the changes in an attempt to back
himself out of a corner. He had bowdlerized his own book.
</P>
<P>
   But his artistic impulses had stymied him. What disease has the
metaphoric power of AIDS? He could censor here and there, but he
couldn't abandon the conceit altogether. This country, so powerful
it could kill poets, had not killed Bellow, but it had gotten him
to rewrite. It had said reality was stronger than fiction. If he
wanted to mess with it, he had to play by the rules. I hoped one
day some future biographer would undo the changes, if only as a
matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' may yet prove Bellow's gift to Bloom. At the very
least, it will raise interesting questions about the relationship
between authors and their writing. Allan Bloom became famous not
just because of what he wrote but also because of who people
assumed him to be: antidrug, antisex, wildly patriotic. How many
members of the right will want their money back now?
</P>
<P>
   What of Saul Bellow's own work? What does ``Ravelstein'' leave
us with that we didn't have before? It pints out the extent to
which men lie at the heart of Bellow's fiction. ``Ravelstein'' is a
meditation on mortality, and it is in Ravelstein's body that the
mortality Bellow feels is manifested. I asked Bellow why he had
given Bloom AIDS in ``Ravelstein'' without knowing that he had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the disease was that here was a man who had
everything in life but also had the knife to the throat,'' Bellow
said. He made a cutting gesture across his neck. ``It's the tragic
inevitability of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that he had just drawn the imaginary knife across
his own throat. He laughed. ``It may not have been accurate for
him,'' he said. ``It may just be accurate for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bellow cannot say with any more certainty than
anyone else that ``Ravelstein'' is Bloom. He can only say,
``Ravelstein, c'est moi.''

<P>
   Every year at this time, I conjure up an image of tens of
millions of us rushing dutifully, but also proudly, to send off our
1040s to feed and protect our prized democracy. The image persists
even though it has grown quaint, wrong in almost every respect.
</P>
<P>
   Our taxes finance a government that writes too many laws,
especially tax laws, in undemocratic fashion. And as more and more
Americans learn how their taxes are unfairly raised and spent, they
no longer pay them cheerfully or rigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Complexity, gimmickry and dishonesty abound. My only hope is
that the Internet will soon destroy the whole mad tax structure and
force a total redesign.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the pain of payment is causing me to exaggerate.
What should be a solemn ritual of citizenship has been turned into
a sordid game of multidimensional hide-and-seek. And atop the
maddening income tax inequities lies a regressive payroll tax _
nominally ``in trust'' for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   By taxing only wages up to $76,200, it favors the rich yet is
studiously overlooked in the periodic clamor for tax reduction and
reform. So some of the poorest, hardest-working Americans simply
commit the crime of doing business in undeclared cash or barter.
</P>
<P>
   And the wealthiest Americans engage platoons of experts to
devise serpentine tax evasions. They shelter earnings in foreign
hideaways, convoluted trusts, posthumous charities and many legal
fictions, like the depreciation of actually appreciating real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves the great majority of middle-income families
with the greatest grounds for grievance. Their incomes are
impossible to hide, and their routes of escape are few. Most settle
for a ``standard deduction'' because they cannot qualify for
existing loopholes or hire lobbyists to write some for them. (Yes,
tax lobbyists no longer just mill in government lobbies; they sit
down with state and federal legislators to help cut the cloth to
suit their masters.)
</P>
<P>
   You would think our media would regularly expose these
conditions, particularly in income tax season. But for most
journalists old news is no news. Besides, their business offices
prefer to sell ``news you can use'' _ strategies for negotiating,
not challenging, the tax labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   And our new media are no more bashful than the old in settling
for a stake in the system. The Internet features many more sites
offering tax advice and assistance and, yes, even ``audit
insurance,'' than discussions about making our taxes comprehensible
and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed behind the media in defense of the present system are
the legions of accountants, lawyers, brokers and investors who
collect tolls for guiding the public through the tax maze. They
have made allies of those who think they profit more than they lose
through tax deductions, most notably homeowners, lenders and
builders who share government subsidies for mortgage interest and
real estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly ensnared in the system are the philanthropies and
nonprofit institutions that use tax deductions to lure
contributors. It does not seem to bother these do-good schools,
hospitals, churches and ballet companies that a rich person's $1
gift is rewarded with a government rebate of at least 40 cents
whereas a poor person's $1 yields not one cent of discount.
</P>
<P>
   Why is not every charitable gift rewarded with an identical
subsidy? Because disguising subsidies as tax deductions means they
never show up on Congress' list of expenditures. Inevitably,
politicians and their supporters have now also found ways to use
obscure provisions of the income tax code to hide huge campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dandy way to compensate for their probable loss of more
visible ``soft'' money from favor-seekers. Frustration with the
entrenched income tax system has led some reformers to urge a shift
to a European-style ``value added'' tax _ which would add a small
levy to the cost of goods and services every time they change hands
or otherwise increase in value.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately paid by consumers, this is essentially a hidden sales
tax. Such a national sales tax was unlikely to attract much favor
so long as states and localities relied on their own separate sales
taxes as a major source of revenue. But lo and behold: the
merchants and customers on the Internet are rapidly undermining
local sales taxes by destroying the geographical basis of America's
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have always been able to dodge local sales taxes by
shopping in catalogs and ordering by mail or phone from merchants
in other states. Only companies that operate physically in the
customer's state are obliged to collect that state's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet promises to make remote and ``virtual'' sales
commonplace: a book I buy from www.bn.com still incurs a local tax
because Barnes &AMP; Noble maintains stores in New York. But a book
from remote www.amazon.com reaches me tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that this 8 percent to 10 percent advantage for Web
merchants (on top of their savings on real estate and sales clerks)
will so enrage traditional businesses that they will soon succeed
in repealing most sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One clear harbinger is the way New York's politicians have been
offering ``tax free'' weeks on clothing just to keep me from buying
untaxed suits in New Jersey. They'll wake up soon enough to the
even greater Web bargains offered from Idaho, Shanghai and
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a commission created to advise Congress on Internet
taxes has already fallen victim to the tensions between fixed and
virtual enterprises and adjourned in confusion. As local sales
taxes are discarded, a national value-added tax will come to appear
more and more attractive. But it would still leave states and
localities without sufficient revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   With luck and vision, Americans would then demand a wonderfully
simple and uniform earnings tax that treats all forms of income
alike, without gimmicks, deductions, credits or postponements, and
permits every state and locality to claim a small percentage of
that levy for its own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   With computer records to vouchsafe all calculations, your 1040
report could fit on a postcard and be settled with a credit card.
The Treasury would then send a designated fraction to your state
capital and city hall. And it could pay out truly equal sums to
match every dollar that anyone gives to authorized charities.
</P>
<P>
   No good causes would be lost and much sanity would be regained.
Wake up! The deadline's Monday night.

 By JEAN STROUSE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One of the ways in which the very rich are different from you
and me is that they become public property. Just about everyone has
an opinion about Bill Gates' business tactics, products, motives,
character, house _ and about what he should be doing with his
immense fortune. Before he began giving money away, people
complained that he was a miser. Now that he is giving money away,
they complain that he's doing it too late, that he isn't giving
enough, that he hasn't a clue about what he's getting into, that
the projects he is financing are too conservative, too liberal, too
big, too small, too safe, too risky, too conventional, too splashy.
Or they say he's only doing it to avoid taxes, or to expand
Microsoft's markets, or, especially, to improve his image in light
of the government's high-profile antitrust suit.
 &HT;    ``Bill Gates can't win,'' says Vartan Gregorian, president of
Carnegie Corp. and a longtime adviser to Gates on the subject of
philanthropy. ``It's like 19th-century anti-Semitism. If the Jews
didn't mix into German society, people said they had a parochial,
shtetl mentality. If they did mix, people said they were trying to
pass. More important than why he's doing this is what he's doing.
The proof will be in the pudding.''
 &HT;    In January, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation edged past
Britain's Wellcome Trust to become the largest in the world, with
assets of $21.8 billion. Even the greatest philanthropists of the
past did not give away as much in real dollars over their entire
lifetimes as Gates has at the age of 44.
 &HT;    According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Andrew Carnegie made
gifts amounting to $350 million before he died in 1919 _ a sum that
would be worth about $3 billion in today's dollars; and the $540
million that John D. Rockefeller dispensed before his death in 1937
would amount to more than $6 billion today _ less than a third of
the Gates total so far. As a percentage of the gross national
product, Gates' gifts do not yet match those of his predecessors,
but he is just getting started.
 &HT;    That Gates began adding to the foundation in huge ($5 billion)
increments over the past 14 months, as the government prosecution
took its damaging course, led to a widespread conviction that his
philanthropy was just part of a public relations campaign. Then, on
April 3, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that
Microsoft violated the law with ``predacious'' anticompetitive
behavior, and the stock market knocked $80 billion off the
company's value. Gates himself reportedly lost $12 billion to $14
billion that day, but the foundation's endowment remains intact:
its donations come in the form of Microsoft stock and are
immediately converted to cash.
 &HT;    What effect, if any, the lawsuit will have on future
contributions to the foundation is unclear. Microsoft intends to
appeal, and the battle could go on for years. Gates has always said
that, like Carnegie, he will give away most of his fortune before
he dies. He plans to make sure his children are well taken care of
but doesn't want to leave them the burden of tremendous wealth.
Carnegie, however, turned his full attention to philanthropy only
after he retired from the steel business at age 65. Gates probably
has several decades of earning and giving ahead. He has not set a
schedule for dispersing his fortune. In February, Patty Stonesifer,
the president of the foundation, said that Gates thought it had
reached about the right size for the time being.
 &HT;    Primarily occupied at the moment with his company and his
family, Gates has delegated the running of the foundation to his
friend Stonesifer, a former Microsoft executive, and to his father,
William H. Gates Jr., although he and his wife, Melinda, are
actively involved. Well aware that effective philanthropy requires
as much time and creativity as building a business does, Gates
considers himself ``very early on the learning curve of this
stuff,'' he says. ``There are just an infinite number of things to
be figured out.'' Still, backed by his enormous resources and
extraordinary renown (it would be hard to overestimate the power of
being Bill Gates), the foundation is already having a major impact
_ not only on specific projects in the fields of education and
global health but also on other wealthy individuals, on the
American conversation about philanthropy and on public policy.
 &HT;    One morning in February, Stonesifer and I drove from Seattle to
the Microsoft campus in Redmond to talk with Gates about his
philanthropy. He was, of course, looking at a computer screen in
his office when we arrived. Emerging from behind his desk, he had
on a pale green button-down shirt with the initials W.H.G. in light
blue over the left breast, tan slacks, tan socks and brown
basket-weave loafers. On the shelves and walls surrounding his
workstation were pictures of Melinda and their two young children,
a photograph of Einstein, several framed covers of The Economist
and an aboriginal mask from Australia.
 &HT;    We sat around a small table in the anteroom _ Gates' work and
reception areas combined are about the size of a midlevel
publishing executive's office in New York. Not exactly what you'd
expect for a man whose company had a market value roughly equal to
the gross domestic product of Spain. There was no sign, for the
next hour, that the release of Windows 2000 had set off firestorms
the previous week, or that lawyers for both sides in the antitrust
case were scheduled to make their final arguments the following
day.
 &HT;    Gates compartmentalizes well. At one point in the conversation
he brought up his friend Warren Buffett, who does not intend to
give his billions away until he has finished earning them.
 &HT;    ``Warren thinks it's very tricky to be in a meeting one minute
where you're talking about giving away lots of money, and then in
the next minute you're thinking about making money,'' Gates said.
``He thinks that's a little schizophrenic, and I hear him. But I've
always had partitions where I'm reading about biotech, or working
on my job, or learning to play bridge. So, at least so far'' _ he
shrugged and laughed _ ``it hasn't created any schizophrenia for
me.''
 &HT;    Gates and Stonesifer have worked together ever since she started
at Microsoft in 1988, and they seem entirely at ease in each
other's company. She is tall and slim at 43, with brown eyes, pale
skin, freckles and a close-cropped brush of red hair. For years she
was the only female executive at Microsoft, and when she retired in
early 1997 with Microsoft quantities of money, she didn't need
another job.
 &HT;    ``Patty could sit on a beach for the rest of her life if she
wanted to,'' says one of her friends. She takes no salary for
running the Gates Foundation and serves on the boards of CBS,
Amazon.com and Kinko's. Although they are widely recognized around
Seattle, Stonesifer and the Gateses do not stay behind closed doors
_ they go to movies and restaurants and basketball games _ and
people come up to Stonesifer in coffee bars and airports with grant
proposals and free advice.
 &HT;    In the course of working on this article, I've come in for small
doses of what she deals with all the time. The heads of five New
York institutions suggested that I put in a good word for their
financing requests in Seattle. A producer at ``60 Minutes'' who
doubles as an amateur coach asked me, ``How would Gates like to
supply uniforms for a bunch of 13-year-old basketball players?''
Gordon J. Davis, the chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center: ``Find out
if he's interested in jazz.'' A young female editorial assistant:
``Ask him if he knows any nice 26-year-old guys.'' I repeated these
requests to Gates, who laughed, then said, ``Well, you know,
capitalism has these strange things, where some people have all
these resources.''
 &HT;    Having so much in the way of resources can make it hard to tell
what people actually want. When he first met Vartan Gregorian,
Gates recalls thinking: '''Ah, why is this guy spending time
getting to know me?' First, he was at Brown. So I wondered, does he
want a bunch of money for Brown? And then he'd come and see me and
we'd talk about what were good causes, or what was going on with
foundations.'' It turned out that Gregorian just wanted to
encourage Gates to think about giving money away, not to ask for
any.
 &HT;    In those early conversations with Gregorian, Gates was thinking
about finding an underfinanced area of scientific research to
support. Now the aspects of his philanthropical work that he seems
most excited about have to do with redressing tremendous inequities
in global health. According to the World Health Organization, less
than 10 percent of the world's medical research financing is
directed at the health problems that afflict 90 percent of the
human population.
 &HT;    Pharmaceutical companies don't make drugs for people who can't
afford them. And millions of children in poor countries die every
year from diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines.
The Gates Foundation recently pledged $750 million to a fund that
will help buy and distribute those medications in developing
countries through a new group called Global Alliance for Vaccines
and Immunization.
 &HT;    ``We're in this unbelievable era where you could argue, What's
the most amazing thing taking place?'' Gates says, leaning forward
in his chair. ``Is it software technology stuff and the Internet
and new forms of communication? Or is it the revolution in
biology?''
 &HT;    At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in January,
Gates was disappointed to find not everyone as galvanized as he is
by the combination of biotechnological innovation, widespread
social disparities and hugely difficult problems that might be
solved by the intervention of enormous resources and armies of
intelligent people. He sat on a panel that officially inaugurated
the global vaccine alliance with Gro Harlem Brundtland of the WHO,
Carol Bellamy of UNICEF, James Wolfensohn of the World Bank,
Joaquim Chissano, the president of Mozambique, and Raymond
Gilmartin of Merck.
 &HT;    It was, Gates said in his office a month later, a colossal bore:
``I was sitting there on that panel thinking, We're talking about
saving three million lives a year here. It's about people. I hate
to be critical, but that was one of the least inspirational, least
informative panels I've seen.''
 &HT;    Though he was by turns voluble, thoughtful, funny,
self-deprecating and serious on a range of subjects, Gates
sidestepped my questions about personal motives for his
philanthropical choices. The banker J.P. Morgan supposedly once
said that a man always has two reasons for the things he does: a
good reason, and the real reason (although in his own case he never
acknowledged the slightest difference between the two).
 &HT;    The ``reasons'' historically ascribed to philanthropy have
ranged from guilt to concern for one's legacy to religious
principle to noblesse oblige to plain generosity. It has been
widely assumed that the ``robber barons'' of the Gilded Age tried
to buy their way through the eye of the needle with large gifts to
libraries, medical research, educational and cultural institutions
and the arts. However, as the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in
the 1940s: ``To imagine that such men did not sleep the sleep of
the just would be romantic sentimentalism. In the Gilded Age even
the angels sang for them.''
 &HT;    Maybe, but in fact these men did not believe _ regardless of
what others thought _ that they had earned their fortunes in
sinister ways. Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan saw themselves as
building great industrial or financial empires and making America
rich, and they did not feel that they had to atone for commercial
sins or ``clean up'' their images for posterity by giving money
away.
 &HT;    This is a very different era, but I would imagine that Gates
sees himself as having created extraordinary new technological
capacities and widespread public access to information, and as
having helped stimulate the phenomenal recent growth of the
American economy. That he wouldn't tell a reporter about his
``real'' reasons isn't surprising. Maybe, like Morgan, he doesn't
think they are any different from the ``good'' ones. And as
Gregorian says, it doesn't matter. What he's doing is more
important than why.

 By JEAN STROUSE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In early January, I went to Africa with Patty Stonesifer and Dr.
Gordon Perkin, the director of global health for the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, to see some of the projects they are
underwriting in Ghana, Gambia and South Africa. Stonesifer had
specifically decided not to call on the heads of governments. She
wanted to be able to spend her time talking with people ``on the
ground'' about their work _ on childhood immunization, family
planning, cervical cancer, malaria, the reduction of maternal and
infant mortality and AIDS. Even before we reached Africa, however,
it was apparent that you can't travel around the world representing
Bill Gates with any degree of anonymity.
 &HT;    At 6:30 a.m., as a jet-lagged Stonesifer waited in line at
London's Gatwick Airport en route to Ghana,York investment
banker standing behind her figured out who she was and told her how
she ought to be spending Gates' money. When we arrived at the
airport in Accra that night, someone was holding up a misspelled
sign that said, ``Welcome Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation,'' and
a local hustler tried to charge $5,000 for getting some photography
equipment through customs.
 &HT;    The foundation does not generally finance direct delivery of
health services. Instead, it channels grants through existing
organizations, seeking to identify good projects that are already
under way and to find new models and strategies that work. This
sounds more conservative than it is. All over the world, health
care issues are inseparable from politics and economics, and anyone
who has worked in developing countries will tell you that the most
difficult problem for potentially lifesaving interventions is
delivery _ getting medications and services to the people who need
them. The majority of the Gates Foundation's health financing will
be directed at improving people's access to existing and newly
developing medical technologies.
 &HT;    To facilitate that access, the foundation promotes the use of
simple tools like vaccines, contraceptives, nutritional
supplements, single-use syringes and diagnostic procedures. At an
immunization clinic on our first day in Ghana, Perkin recognized a
small circle on the label of a polio vaccine vial _ a warning sign
devised by a nonprofit organization he helped found in Seattle
called Program for Appropriate Technology in Health. He was
delighted when the nurse in charge was able to tell him that the
darkening circle meant the vaccine was approaching its expiration
date and had to be used right away. Even health workers who cannot
read can dispense this medicine.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation also seeks to support people who are
finding innovative ways to approach public health problems and
promote major social change. Lynette Denny, for example, whom we
saw toward the end of the trip, is a gynecological oncologist
working with women in impoverished squatter villages and townships
near Cape Town. Most of these women have never seen a gynecologist
before, much less had a Pap test. Cervical cancer is the leading
cause of cancer death among women in developing countries, but it
can effectively be prevented by early detection. Because Pap smears
are complicated to administer and expensive to analyze, Denny's
work led her and several colleagues to devise a simple new
screening test for cervical cancer.
 &HT;    In early January, the Journal of the American Medical
Association published a study based on her group's work, showing
that the new test detects the precursors of cervical cancer at
least as well as the Pap test does. Many questions remain and the
research is still under way, but this work could lead to extensive
changes in social policy and the saving of millions of lives. Denny
works with the Alliance for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer,
which received a $50 million grant over five years from the Gates
Foundation in 1999.
 &HT;    Gates has referred to people who don't operate at full mental
capacity as having ``unused bandwidth.'' Stonesifer doesn't appear
to have any. Throughout the week we spent in Africa she worked from
7 a.m. until midnight every day, talking with people in hospital
beds, nursing stations and makeshift doctors' offices, at briefing
breakfasts, village councils, private houses and dinner meetings.
When we got back to a van or a plane, the rest of us would be ready
to sleep or goof off. Stonesifer and Perkin spent the downtime
talking about what they had learned, where they would like to go
with it and how they would report back to Bill and Melinda. The
book she read on the trip was ``The Politics of International
Health: the Children's Vaccine Initiative and the Struggle to
Develop Vaccines for the Third World,'' by William A. Muraskin.
 &HT;    For a couple of days in Ghana, most of the people we met had
never heard of Bill Gates. As we were about to leave for Gambia,
however, Stonesifer got word that Ghana's controversial president,
Jerry Rawlings, was coming to the airport to see us off. Rawlings
has been a surprisingly outspoken advocate of AIDS education,
family planning, economic development and women's rights. A big man
with a broad face framed by a salt-and-pepper beard, he arrived by
helicopter. Striding across the tarmac in black jeans, cowboy
boots, a black-and-white Nike warmup jacket and shades, he looked
more like a music-industry mogul than a head of state.
 &HT;    In the airport lounge he mock-scolded Stonesifer: ``Someone like
you shouldn't arrive in Ghana without announcing your presence. I'm
glad to hear about your noble intentions here. I had to come see
you and thank Bill Gates.'' They talked for a few minutes, then he
got around to what Stonesifer calls ``the ask.'' (It is inevitable,
and she's not cynical about it; she wants to know what people
need.)
 &HT;    ``What we need in Ghana,'' said Rawlings, ``is to make AIDS
testing affordable.'' Then he stepped back onto the tarmac,
signaled the chopper pilot by twirling his finger over his head and
took off. By the time we reached Gambia, its president knew that
Rawlings had met with Stonesifer and wanted an audience as well. It
took some delicate negotiating to avoid a diplomatic insult. The
lesson Stonesifer drew: political leaders play an important role in
what the foundation is trying to do, and its officers can't go in
under the radar.
 &HT;    The new headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
offer as sharp a contrast to the stone-and-glass-clad, high-rise,
wood-paneled premises of the big East Coast foundations as the new
techno-billionaires' dress code does to CEO pinstripes. A two-story
tan and gray concrete building, it backs up against a marina on
Seattle's Lake Union and is identified only by its street address.
(It used to be a check-processing plant, which usually prompts
someone to quip that it still is.) Inside, there are ficus trees,
an orchid on the receptionist's desk, earth-tone walls, wood and
slate-tile floors, several modest executive offices, an open
geometry of staff cubicles and 1,700,000 feet of computer cable.
 &HT;    When I first visited Seattle in early December, Nelson Mandela
and his wife, Graca Machel, were in town to raise money for their
work in Africa _ Mandela and Gates have known each other since 1997
_ and Stonesifer spent part of a morning showing the couple around
the building. At one point on the tour Stonesifer stopped, tapped
her fingernail on a polished countertop that looked like stone and
said: ``Sunflower seeds. We're testing new materials. It's very
Seattle.''
 &HT;    Also very Seattle is the foundation's lean, informal structure.
Last year, when Gates decided to combine two smaller charitable
funds into one and increase the endowment, he specifically chose
not to enlarge the foursome in charge of ultimate decisions _
himself, his wife, his father (CEO) and Stonesifer (president) _
and not to appoint a board. He had set up his first foundation in
1994, the year he married Melinda. At a bridal lunch the day before
the wedding, his mother, Mary, a prominent civic leader in Seattle,
read a letter to the couple saying, in effect, ``From those who are
given great resources, great things are expected.'' By all accounts
Melinda has played a significant role in directing more of her
husband's attention to the world outside Microsoft.
 &HT;    A few months after the wedding, Mary Gates died. Bill's father,
who had also been a leader of Seattle's ``old'' philanthropy _
chiefly the United Way _ was moving toward retirement from the law
firm Preston, Gates &AMP; Ellis and volunteered to help his son deal
with the floods of requests for money that were coming in.
(Although the father is William H. Gates Jr. and the son W.H.G.
III, people in Seattle refer to the elder Gates as Bill Sr. and to
the Microsoft founder as simply Bill.) Now 73 years old, with
genial blue eyes, sparse white hair and big glasses, Bill Sr. is 6
feet 6 inches tall and looks like a combination of his son and Paul
Volcker.
 &HT;    Bill established the William H. Gates foundation in 1994 with
$106 million and added about $2 billion over the next four years.
It focused on global health issues and projects in the Pacific
Northwest. Until last fall, Bill Sr. ran it out of cardboard boxes
in the basement of his house. Gates enlisted Stonesifer to launch
the second foundation, aimed at reducing the ``digital divide,''
early in 1997. She had just left Microsoft, where she had been head
of the Interactive Media division; Time magazine in 1996 named her
one of the 25 most influential people in America.
 &HT;    Ready for a change and wanting more time for her two teen-age
children, she rented an office over a pizza parlor in Redmond and
started a management consulting firm. Her first client was
DreamWorks SKG. She lasted three months. ``Someday I'll write a
book called, 'My 12 Weeks in Hollywood,''' she says with a laugh.
By March she was running the new $200 million Gates library
program, which provides computers, Internet access and training and
technical support in low-income communities all over the United
States and Canada.
 &HT;    She had no hesitation about returning to the workaholic Gates
fold. Raised in a Catholic family in Indiana (she was the sixth of
nine children), she has always had a strong sense of social
responsibility _ she keeps a plastic figure of Jiminy Cricket in
her office as a comic reference to her hyperactive conscience. ``I
loved working with Bill and Melinda at Microsoft, so to be able to
use everything we'd learned in technology and turn it to social
good, to help shape their philanthropical efforts and give the
money back _ this job was tailor-made for me.''
 &HT;    The foundation has proved no less demanding than Microsoft, but
she does have somewhat more flexibility about time. As the two
Gates foundations combined and moved into new headquarters last
year, they expanded their accounting and public affairs staffs and
appointed executive directors for the library program, education
and global health.
 &HT;    The Canadian-born Perkin, director of global health, has more
than 35 years of experience in international health and family
planning. The foundation's senior adviser for global health is
William Foege, a widely revered epidemiologist and former head of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who was part of the
international team that eradicated smallpox.
 &HT;    In all, the staff now consists of about 130 people, 110 of whom
belong to what Gates calls the Internet Peace Corps _ a team of
young computer trainers who spend about half their time on the road
wiring public libraries. Which leaves 20 people for everything
else, although the officers consult with 60 to 75 experts in
various fields.
 &HT;    The Ford Foundation has a staff of 567 worldwide. Stonesifer and
Bill Sr. serve as co-chairpersons of the foundation, but she
essentially runs it _ he doesn't want to be bothered with decisions
about hiring, process and organizational structure. On questions of
grant-making, however, she says they are ``two in a box _ we try
not to be at the same meetings since it's unnecessary; that way we
get more done.'' Still, she confesses with a grin, it can be a
little weird that ``the other person in the box is Dad.''
 &HT;    Though she is the only nonfamily member of the group, Stonesifer
is so close _ and so fiercely loyal _ to Bill and Melinda that she
seems a virtual Gates. How do the foursome handle disagreements?
They argue things out, she says: ``All of the Gateses, and myself,
are strong-minded, strong-willed individuals. That's one reason we
get along so well.''
 &HT;    Some philanthropy watchers are highly dubious about this
all-in-the-family approach. The historian Mark Dowie, who is
writing a book on American foundations, recently urged Gates to
trade his wife and his father to the Ford Foundation for people
with more experience and to set up an executive board with race and
gender balance. Gordon Conway, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation, however, has been impressed with the leadership of the
new Gates enterprise, finding it ``extraordinarily well focused in
the health field.''
 &HT;    And Charles Hamilton, executive director of the Clark
Foundation, applauds the agility with which a closely held
foundation can make decisions: ``I hope Gates will continue to
maintain personal control _ that he really gets and stays
involved.'' Gates apparently intends to. He and Melinda set the
overall direction and priorities for their giving, and Stonesifer
and Bill Sr. report to them constantly _ one on one, in four-way
meetings, on the phone and by e-mail, which they call simply
``mail.''
 &HT;    They are rarely all in one place at the same time. Stonesifer
travels to New York once a month for CBS board meetings and has
been to Davos and India since the Africa trip. The foundation
receives more than 3,000 proposals a month, and its public affairs
manager, Trevor Neilson, gets about 500 additional personal
requests about everything from eviction notices to medical bills to
prosthetic limbs. The senior officers, with some staff help, weed
out thousands of proposals that do not accord with the Gates aims,
then submit lists of projects they would like to finance to Melinda
and Bill, who read and talk about the proposals and personally
approve every grant over $1 million.
 &HT;    Bill writes questions and comments all over the lists _
sometimes saying simply yes (to a request for $40 million) or no,
or ``tell me more about respiratory diseases,'' or ``why this
country?'' or ``if this does well what's the next step?'' His
negative response isn't always final: ``When I say no,'' he says
with a grin, ``somebody usually comes back with, 'Did you really
mean to say no on this one?'''
 &HT;    Melinda, who does not give interviews to the press, is more
closely involved than her husband in the day-to-day operations of
the organization. Do the couple have different kinds of input?
``Melinda has a strong interest in children and early childhood,''
says Stonesifer. ``Bill is very interested in medical interventions
and new tools, in figuring out what is possible with new scientific
technology. And they are both passionate about how those areas can
work together.''
 &HT;    Once Gates made up his mind to create a single large foundation,
he began adding to it at the rate of $5 billion a quarter. And
since foundations are required by law annually to give away 5
percent of their assets, the directors of this $21.8 billion fund
now have to dispense more than $1 billion a year _ not an easy
thing to do well. They insist on careful monitoring to assure that
the money is not wasted or mismanaged. They take a long-term,
strategic view of what their grants can do, and they place strong
emphasis on evaluation procedures _ even though measures of success
in the nonprofit world are notoriously hard to come by.
 &HT;    Stonesifer says, ``I sometimes miss the marketplace, which
really kicks you around when you make a mistake.'' At first, the
selection process was largely reactive. But as the foundation's
resources have grown, notes Bill Sr., the process has become more
proactive, and the scope of the giving is narrowing to areas in
which the money stands to have the greatest impact _ projects that
aim at the causes rather than the symptoms of social problems. The
officers talk a great deal about leverage, impact, strategy, scale
and the ``catalytic dollar'' and are determined not to let their
financing drive other sources of money away. On the contrary, they
try to use their grants and Gates' celebrity to bring more partners
and dollars to the table.
 &HT;    So far, the Gates domestic programs have drawn more critical
fire than the work in international health. Last September the
foundation announced that it was pledging $1 billion over 20 years
to scholarships for minority students _ for full-time college
programs and graduate study in engineering, math, science,
education or library science, to be administered by the United
Negro College Fund. In October, the conservative Weekly Standard
ran an article called ``Bill Gates, Minority Leader: A Billion
Dollars Is a Terrible Thing to Waste.'' The argument: that the
program should not be race-based and is an attempt to circumvent
recent anti-affirmative-action rulings in states like Washington
and California.
 &HT;    The library-wiring initiative has had critics from the start. It
delivers Gateway machines and free Microsoft programs, which led to
a widespread perception that Gates was using his philanthropy to
expand the market for Microsoft, much the way tobacco companies
hook adolescents on cigarettes. Stonesifer says, ``The only
software we donate is Microsoft, but these machines are wide open,
and many of the libraries load them up with all kinds of other
software.''
 &HT;    The negative reactions did not cause Gates to reconsider the
program, reports Stonesifer, but he and Melinda didn't anticipate
the cynicism. ``Like the rest of us, they want people to think what
they're doing is good,'' Stonesifer says. ``It shouldn't have come
as a surprise that one of Bill's first major philanthropical
projects would be in the field of technology. All first gifts tend
to be something you know about, and he had 20 years of
technological expertise.''

 By JEAN STROUSE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Bill Gates looks back with some amusement at his belated
realization that access to technological information might not be
the answer to the world's most serious problems. Microsoft was
donating computers to poor communities in Africa in the mid-'90s,
and during a visit to Johannesburg, South Africa, Gates went to
Soweto where he was proudly shown the town's single computer.
 &HT;    As he took in his surroundings, he recalls, he said to himself:
'''Hey, wait a minute _ there's only one electrical outlet in this
whole place.' And yup, they had plugged in that computer, and when
I was there, man, that thing was running and everybody was very
thankful. But I looked around and thought, Hmm, computers may not
be the highest priority in this particular place. I wondered, Who
the heck is going to be really using this thing?''
 &HT;    He says it was toward the end of 1998 that he realized _ partly
through working with Foege and Perkin and partly through his own
reading _ how little international attention was being paid to some
of the world's most urgent medical problems and how much of a
difference his large-scale resources could make.
 &HT;    The World Health Organization estimates that malaria kills about
two million people a year, nearly half of them children in
sub-Saharan Africa, and infects about 200 million more. There has
been a 180 percent increase in the number of cases in South Africa
over the past year and a dangerous rise in drug resistance to the
disease. Roughly 2.3 billion people _ more than a third of the
world's population _ are at risk of infection, but since most of
them live in the world's poorest countries and cannot buy expensive
drugs, there has been no financial incentive for pharmaceutical
companies to develop a malaria vaccine.
 &HT;    Piers Whitehead of Mercer Consulting has compared large
pharmaceuticals to supermodels: they don't get out of bed and go to
work for less than $350 million in annual sales for a single
product. According to The Economist, the amount of money spent on
malaria vaccine research worldwide in 1996 was about $60 million.
In June 1999 the Gates Foundation set up a $50 million Malaria
Vaccine Initiative.
 &HT;    ``With one grant,'' says Gates, ``we became the biggest private
funder of malaria research. It just sort of blows the mind.''
 &HT;    The malaria vaccine research fund creates what economists call a
``push'' mechanism, providing the means for scientists to conduct
studies that would not otherwise be economically feasible. And the
foundation is tackling malaria in other ways as well. By putting up
$750 million for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization,
it also gives pharmaceutical companies a ``pull'' incentive _
essentially saying, ``If you develop a vaccine, we'll buy and
distribute it.'' It is the medical equivalent of the fairy tale
king who challenges his knights to solve some impossible problem,
promising that the man who succeeds will marry his daughter. Still,
scientists think it will take at least 10 years to find a vaccine
against this extremely complex virus.
 &HT;    The foundation is also applying the ``pull'' mechanism to the
less glamorous but no less urgent problem of getting childhood
vaccines that the industrialized world takes for granted _ against
measles, whooping cough, tetanus, polio and diphtheria _ to
developing countries. It often takes 10 to 15 years for basic
vaccines to get to people in poor countries, even though
immunization could save millions of lives a year, and administering
a $1 shot is much more cost-effective than paying for years of
medical care.
 &HT;    The $750 million fund will buy and distribute those basic drugs,
along with new ones against yellow fever, hepatitis B and
Haemophilus influenza type B. That was the subject of the panel
Gates found so disappointing at Davos. Michael Rothschild, dean of
the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, thinks it ``extremely smart
of the Gates Foundation to move on all these fronts at the same
time. It's hard to think of a more exciting image for science than
finding a vaccine for malaria. But figuring out how to distribute a
measles vaccine is about as sexy as clearing up the New Jersey
Meadowlands.''
 &HT;    Twenty-one billion, eight hundred million dollars. It is hard to
conceive of that much money. To put the figure in some perspective:
as of March 30, 2000, the market capitalization of Apple Computer
was $22.5 billion; Gannett's was a little more than $20 billion,
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.'s $21.9 billion and Safeway's $20.5billion. The
Ford Foundation, America's second largest, has an endowment of $14
billion, but its growth, like that of most philanthropical
institutions, has come from asset appreciation over time.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation grew by nearly $20 billion in one year.
 &HT;    Next to these Olympian sums, the recent charitable gifts of mere
mortal billionaires _ like the $150 million given to Stanford
University by Jim Clark, the co-founder of Netscape, in 1999, or
the $134 million that Warren Buffett and his wife, Susan, divided
among four organizations _ begin to look like pocket change. The
United States has not seen philanthropy on this scale since the era
of Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan and Ford. The sources of America's
great fortunes have moved west over the course of the century, but
as recently as 15 years ago there were no major foundations in the
Pacific Northwest. Now venture capitalists and foreign dignitaries
go to Seattle for the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks.
 &HT;    And over the past decade, the wealth created by the information
technology and telecommunications businesses has been doing for
Seattle what the big railroad and industrial fortunes did for New
York in the Gilded Age. The city gleams with new or renovated
cultural institutions and sports arenas _ the Seattle Symphony's
Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Art Museum, the SuperSonics' Key Arena,
the Mariners' Safeco Field and an as yet unbuilt waterfront
sculpture park. Some of the new multimillionaires are putting
personal time and money into social services and public schools.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation has recently given grants ranging from
$5,000 for a local AIDS group to $30 million for King County's
United Way. One of the most ambitious of the Gates-financed
projects is the New York-based International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative. Founded by an intense, 43-year-old physician named Seth
Berkley, IAVI identifies promising AIDS vaccine candidates, then
brokers deals with drug manufacturers and developing countries to
fast-track the candidates into clinical trials.
 &HT;    More than 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide,
about 70 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is
expected to kill more people in the coming decade than died in all
the wars of the 20th century. Only a vaccine could stop this
devastation. And as with malaria, pharmaceutical companies are not
about to spend enormous amounts of money developing a vaccine that
is needed primarily by people who can't afford it. But if IAVI
supplies the research money, the pharmaceutical company has no
major costs to recoup. In exchange for its financing, IAVI expects
the company to provide the vaccine at low cost in developing
countries or forfeit the rights to the technology.
 &HT;    In the United States the company can charge whatever the market
will bear. AIDS researchers believe it could take at least a decade
to develop a vaccine against this constantly mutating virus, and
some think it won't be possible at all. Nonetheless, Berkley is
determined to get human trials under way.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation gave the AIDS vaccine initiative $1.5
million in 1998 in support of a ``scientific blueprint.''
Inaugurated at the international AIDS conference in Geneva in June
1998, the blueprint attracted worldwide attention and brought in
additional financing _ $325,000 from the British government and
another $160,000 from the Elton John Foundation.
 &HT;    That fall, IAVI announced two novel vaccine approaches for Kenya
and South Africa and started preparations for clinical trials.
Early in 1999 the Gates Foundation granted the AIDS vaccine
initiative $25 million to be paid over five years. Like other Gates
projects, this one has critics.
 &HT;    Some want more emphasis on forcing pharmaceutical companies to
donate huge quantities of therapeutic drugs like AZT to Africa _ an
issue that is fraught with economic and political complications.
Others spoke off the record because their institutions hope to get
Gates grants. One prominent AIDS researcher predicts that the
vaccine route will prove fruitless _ that no one knows what will
spark broad immunity and, given the infrastructure problems in
Africa, it would be impossible to deliver a vaccine even if science
found one. He argues that Gates' support of IAVI is about politics
and his image. The foundation, the physician suggests, would do a
lot more good handing out condoms on truck routes from Kenya than
paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to IAVI bureaucrats.
 &HT;    Dr. David Ho, the director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research
Center, an affiliate of Rockefeller University, disagrees with this
point of view. ``Vaccines are the biggest thing in AIDS research
today,'' he says, and the vaccine initiative is ``a very worthy
project'' for Gates Foundation support. Ho, who came up with the
concept of the triple-combination drug therapy that has
significantly checked the progress of AIDS in the United States and
Europe, thinks the freedom Gates has to provide substantial
financing more quickly than the NIH is essential. Wouldn't it be
interesting, he reflects, ``if Bill Gates were remembered in the
future more for his philanthropy than for his work with
computers?''
 &HT;    David Baltimore, president of the California Institute of
Technology and chairman of the AIDS Research Vaccine Committee,
says that AIDS research right now is in greater need of new ideas
than of more money, but ``we can't possibly do too much'' about a
disease that has ``skyrocketed over everything else in
importance.'' He thinks the vaccine initiative is positioning
itself at a crucial juncture between drug companies and developing
countries, that the candidates it is moving toward trials are good
ones, and that science will learn from the research regardless of
the outcome.

 By JEAN STROUSE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One vaccine trial sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, a New York-based organization sponsored by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, is scheduled to begin in Hlabisa, a
village in the South African province of KwaZulu/Natal, before the
end of 2000. The landscape of undulating hills and neatly planted
farms around Hlabisa, 180 miles north of Durban, could be mistaken
for Tuscany or Vermont.
 &HT;    This beautiful place is the epicenter of South Africa's AIDS
epidemic: 38 percent of the population is HIV positive, with the
highest incidence among women and men in their 20s. Many of the men
leave for months at a time to work in mines near Johannesburg,
where they patronize prostitutes or take ``town wives'' and
contract HIV. When they return home they infect their rural wives,
who often pass the virus along to babies while nursing.
 &HT;    A high rate of sexually transmitted diseases (about 25 percent)
enhances the ease of HIV transmission. The community's religious
leaders spend most of their time officiating at funerals.
 &HT;    ``This is not an epidemic,'' says Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, the
principal investigator for the IAVI trial project in South Africa.
``It's a catastrophe.''
 &HT;    The day Patty Stonesifer, the Gates Foundation president, and I
were there the community held a meeting in an open field to discuss
preparations for a vaccine trial. Because of its high levels of HIV
and STDs, Hlabisa has a relatively well-developed medical system
and a strong community advisory board that includes tribal and
religious leaders, teachers and health care and social service
workers.
 &HT;    The vaccine candidate, underwritten last year with an initial
$4.5 million grant from IAVI, is being developed jointly by the
South African Medical Research Council, the University of Cape
Town, the National Institute of Virology in South Africa and a
biotechnology company in Durham, N.C., called AlphaVax. It is based
on the strain of HIV that dominates in this region. The first phase
of the trial will simply test the vaccine for safety, using healthy
volunteers in the United States and South Africa.
 &HT;    After the community meeting I took a walk with Janet Frohlich, a
tall woman with short dark hair and a strong South African accent
who works in Hlabisa as a field coordinator for the Medical
Research Council. The vaccine trial has to run in tandem with
education and prevention, she said; measures that are perceived as
``punitive,'' like insistence on men using condoms, have failed,
and health workers are now trying to teach women how to protect
themselves. They are also trying to teach both men and women how to
talk about sex and STDs.
 &HT;    A soccer game that had been going on during the meeting was
still under way. As we stood watching the players, I realized that
a third of them will probably be dead in 15 years. Frohlich said,
``If you ask the boys what they know about AIDS, they say: 'We've
learned not to sleep with the thin girls. Only sleep with the fat
ones.'''
 &HT;    At the White House in March, President Clinton inaugurated his
Millennium Vaccine Initiative, which includes a $1 billion tax
credit for drug companies to speed up the development of new
vaccines and $50 million for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization purchase fund _ and he acknowledged the Gateses'
leadership in these areas.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation is a relative newcomer to the field of
global health, but in collaboration with others it has helped to
create a sense of urgency about a wide range of international
health problems, to mobilize vast financial resources and to bring
these issues to the forefront of economic and political debate.
 &HT;    On the subject of his own politics, Bill Gates has refused to
characterize himself as conservative or liberal and declines to
declare a party affiliation. He contributes to both parties. Last
fall he told Sam Howe Verhovek of The New York Times that he thinks
the Republicans often do a good job of figuring out how to
encourage wealth creation while Democrats tend to think more about
how to spread wealth around _ ``and those are both things I think
are very important.''
 &HT;    ``When people attack the wealth-creation mechanisms,'' he went
on with a smile, ``it seems to push me in one direction, and when
they don't take spreading the wealth seriously, well, that pushes
me in the other direction.''
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation has a decidedly liberal agenda _
intervening to offset social inequities in health and education _
and the online magazine Salon ``outed'' Gates as a ``closet
liberal'' in 1998 for supporting family planning, gun safety and
organizations that opposed tax cuts in Washington State. The
downsizing of federal spending on health and social programs over
the last two decades, along with a widespread decline of public
confidence in Washington, has steadily shifted responsibility for
social welfare issues to state and local initiatives and to private
philanthropy.
 &HT;    And though some conservatives dislike the Gates Foundation's
choices and others think the money would do more good left in the
marketplace, many favor this kind of privatization. Edward Crane,
president of the Cato Institute in Washington _ a libertarian
policy center _ says: ``I applaud Gates for all the wealth he's
created. It's his money, and he can do with it whatever he likes.''
 &HT;    Times of extraordinary prosperity in America periodically draw
national attention to the nature and reach of private philanthropy,
raising moral and legal questions about accountability, taxation,
spending requirements and limitations on charitable giving. Susan
Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation, points out that
Americans are at once fascinated by and profoundly uneasy about
wealth and the power it confers, and she urges her colleagues to
welcome increased public scrutiny.
 &HT;    Michael E. Porter and Mark R. Kramer have argued in a recent
Harvard Business Review that foundations need to improve their
performance and justify their tax-exempt status by creating value
much the way businesses do. Peter Bienstock, a Princeton, N.J.,
investor, predicts that the tremendous current flow of money into
private foundations is going to create pressure for greater
government regulation _ that we are moving toward a period of
``charitable trust-busting.'' And Joel L. Fleishman, a law
professor at Duke University and president of Atlantic
Philanthropic Service Co. in New York, has called for a new federal
agency to regulate the nonprofit sector.
 &HT;    Probably the warning I heard most often in conversations about
the Gates Foundation had to do with the law of unintended
consequences.
 &HT;    ``Grant-making on that scale is a very difficult art,'' says
Edward A. Ames at the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, who fears
that the people in charge of the ``huge new pools of money being
turned to philanthropy'' may not know enough about ``the impact
they can have on the fields that are the objects of their
generosity.''
 &HT;    Richard Gilder, an investment manager, cautions, ``Giving is as
tough a business as getting.'' Gilder has done a substantial amount
of both. ``You can do so much damage,'' he says. ``The rule in
philanthropy, as in medicine, should be, 'First, do no harm.'''
 &HT;    The best story about unintended consequences comes from Gordon
Conway at the Rockefeller Foundation, who worked as an entomologist
in Borneo in the 1960s. In an attempt to control malaria, the World
Health Organization sprayed houses with DDT. The campaign did kill
mosquitoes and reduced the incidence of malaria, but it had side
effects.
 &HT;    House lizards ate the dead bugs, then cats ate the lizards and
died from the accumulated insecticide. Without cats, the local rat
population exploded _ rats that could carry plague and typhus.
Neighboring states donated cats to the affected upland regions. For
the remote interior, the WHO and Singapore's Royal Air Force
devised a maneuver worthy of Disney called Operation Cat Drop: they
packed cats into perforated containers and sent them plummeting
into upland villages by parachute.
 &HT;    The day we drove to Hlabisa in mid-January, the Gates Foundation
group took off two hours between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. for a
mini-safari at the Phinda game reserve in Zululand on the eastern
coast of South Africa. The high point was a mother cheetah with
four cubs, who let us watch her from about 20 yards away for nearly
10 minutes.
 &HT;    As we drove back toward the lodge, our guide, Gavin, said that
since there is no hunting in the park, the predators tend to take
over and kill too many other animals. As a result, the wardens
periodically capture some of the big cats and send them off to
other parks.
 &HT;    ``Is that a good idea?'' Patty Stonesifer wanted to know. ``To
intervene in nature that way?'' Gavin said, ``Oh, they do it at all
the big parks, even Kruger,'' which didn't really answer the
question.
 &HT;    ``It's such an enormous responsibility,'' Stonesifer reflected.
``How do you know how far to go?''

&HT;     HBO TO AIR PROGRAM ON BASKETBALL STAR BILL RUSSELL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The genesis of HBO's documentary ``Bill Russell:
My Life, My Way'' occurred one day when Russell was visiting with
his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   They posed the question: ``Were you better than Michael
Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   And in typical there's-never-an-easy-answer Russell fashion, he
pointed out two things: A) They got the question backwards; and B)
Grandpa was the one the young Michael Jordan wanted to be when he
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exchange that compelled the man who has a longstanding
reputation of being private and reclusive to agree to sit in front
of a television camera and discuss his legendary life and career.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the one-hour HBO documentary, which debuts Monday
at 10 p.m. and airs four more times by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and longtime friend and business associate Alan Hillburg
took the idea of the show to HBO and with HBO's track record of
compelling sports programming, it seemed like a good fit. There
are, it can be argued, few more personalities in the history of
sport more compelling than Russell.
</P>
<P>
   As per usual with HBO sports shows, it is an interesting,
insightful hour which will satisfy older viewers' cravings for
nostalgia and will give younger viewers an increasingly rare view
of an athlete who had aspirations beyond individual achievement and
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with Russell's Monroe, La., roots and his move
to Oakland, Calif., as a young child. It moves on to document his
illustrious but not always glorious career as a college star at the
University of San Francisco (two national championships) and his
even more illustrious professional career with the Boston Celtics
in which he won 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's years at USF come across as a bittersweet time for the
team's star player. Russell said he felt that part of the show was
accurately portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that,'' Russell said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the show is light on the basketball, or as Russell
put it ``It doesn't show why I was as good as I was. The focus was
not as much on Russell the player, as on Russell the leader, the
social activist and the sometimes prickly personality.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Russell's ever-present perspective _ he is
interviewed throughout the program _ other interview subjects
include former Celtics coach Red Auerbach, former teammates Bob
Cousy, John Thompson, John Havlicek, K.C. Jones and Sam Jones; and
Russell's daughter Karen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his input, Russell isn't sure how well the show reflects
who he is and who he was as a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very serious,'' Russell said Thursday morning. ``I'm not
that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he view himself as a recluse, a label he couldn't
manage to escape even in a show that he helped to initiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as being true,'' Russell said. ``I don't know
anyone who has a completely open life. I like to keep things as
small as possible. If they are smaller, they are less complicated.
I just do what I like to do.''

HOLBROOKE TO LEAD SECURITY COUNCIL DELEGATION TO CONGO AHEAD OF
PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative to
the United Nations, has agreed to lead a Security Council
delegation early in May to Congo, where the council plans to send a
peacekeeping operation this year.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the Security Council trip and the deployment
of a monitoring and peacekeeping mission are still in some doubt,
however, as fighting was reported in Congo Friday, a day after a
cease-fire was to go into effect. The war, in which about half a
dozen African countries are involved, pits the Congo government of
President Laurent Kabila against rebels backed by his former
allies, Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   As the council was meeting Friday, there were also reports of a
series of explosions at the international airport at Kinshasa, the
capital of Congo. U.N. officials said they were told a Boeing 707,
possibly a military plane, had crashed into a fuel truck, setting
off the explosions. News reports from Kinshasa said that stores of
ammunition had exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was told that there had been numerous
injuries, but there was no information on casualties. Officials
here were told that half the airport complex had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a Security Council mission to Congo _ one of
the riskiest in a series of trips that council members are making
to view the organization's work in the field _ was made Friday
during a council debate on Rwanda six years after the genocide
there that left hundreds of thousands dead.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the debate was a tough report last December that
held both the United Nations and leading member countries, in
particular the United States, responsible for a failure to prevent
or stop the 1994 genocidal campaign by Hutu militias against ethnic
Tutsi and their Hutu supporters. The report, prepared by a team led
by Ingvar Carlsson, a former Swedish prime minister, was
commissioned by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had been the head
of U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holbrooke said Friday of his Congo mission that ``I believe it
is a mission that we hope will avoid another meeting like this one
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Security Council members drew lessons Friday from the
Rwanda report about the lack of good information and analysis on
warnings of planned genocide, along with a tendency to hide behind
the limited instructions U.N. peacekeepers had in Rwanda and the
promises by parties involved in ethnic conflict to observe a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   ``From its inception, the United Nations assistance mission for
Rwanda,'' said Patricia Durrant, Jamaica's ambassador, ``was
hindered by a poorly conceived mandate, the lack of the necessary
resources to carry out that mandate and the political will on the
part of the Security Council to take critical decisions at a time
when the forces on the ground could ill afford undue delay.'' Too
often, she added, peacekeeping operations are made too small for
the sake of ``political expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's ambassador, Joseph W. Mutaboba, had the last word in
Friday's debate. ``Thanks for the statements,'' he said, ``but what
next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My country, Rwanda, wishes to hear from you all about the
policies and measures this body has taken or has intention of
putting in place to make sure that what happened in Rwanda _ and we
witnessed through the screens of our television sets _ does never
again occur elsewhere on this globe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo operation of 5,537 people, most of whom would be
ceasefire monitors and support workers rather than troops, is not
intended to be deployed until a cease-fire holds. But even that
distant hope could be jeopardized if the U.S. Congress blocks U.S.
financial contributions to the force and others that are already
deployed. Such a move is now under way in a committee that
appropriates money for several departments including the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is working hard to reduce congressional antipathy
toward the United Nations by trying to win a reduction of U.S. dues
to the organization, is also having to fight in both houses of
Congress against opponents of U.S. backing for international
peacekeeping.

&HT;     PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR SEQUOIA MONUMENT RANKLES BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's plan to create a 355,000-acre Sequoia
National Monument has people on both sides of the issue up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the president's proclamation, expected
Saturday, may not go far enough to preserve the largest stands of
unprotected giant sequoias left in the world because Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman is advising the administration to allow
commercial logging to continue for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a national monument that's supposed to be
sacrosanct and sacred. But the Forest Service says, `Business as
usual. We're going to log,''' said Martin Litton, a Sierra Club
leader who has spent his life hiking in, flying over and
photographing the majestic red trees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence, furious timber workers, off-road
vehicle buffs and property rights activists say the president's
designation will make nearly one-third of the existing Sequoia
National Forest off limits to commercial logging. They say the
presidential action would block roads and create headaches for
people who live in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a political move by President Clinton that has
nothing to do with saving sequoia redwoods. It's a payback to the
environmental groups that campaigned for him,'' said John Keyes, a
rancher and grower in Springville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a land grab. We feel that access to the High Sierra will
be denied because of this monument,'' added Keyes, who founded the
Sierra Nevada Access, Multiple-Use and Stewardship Coalition three
years ago to oppose the Forest Service's plan to protect roadless
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected announce the creation of the Sequoia
National Monument on Saturday. The declaration would offer
permanent protection to the ancient giants. The land would come
from the existing 1.14 million-acre Sequoia National Forest
southeast of Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   The forest contains about 25,000 acres, or two-thirds of the
38,350 acres of the world's remaining giant sequoias. The rest are
in the adjoining Sequoia National Park and on state, federal,
private and Native American lands in California.
</P>
<P>
   Giant sequoias, Sequoiadendron giganteum, like their cousins,
the coastal redwoods, Sequoia sempervirens, are found only in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest giant sequoia on record reaches a height of 269 feet
and a circumference of 112 feet. The base is 35 feet in diameter.
The trees can live more than 3,000 years.

CONGRESS AGREES ON TRADE RULES FOR AFRICA, CENTRAL AMERICA,
CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of tough negotiations, Senate and
House leaders have agreed on new trade terms for countries in
Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, setting the stage for
congressional approval in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators reached a breakthrough late Thursday, agreeing to
provide a measure of protection for U.S. textile manufacturers,
though not as much as the industry and its allies in the Senate had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Senate negotiators yielded a bit to their House counterparts on
that issue, accepting an arrangement on imports of African clothing
that would gradually open more markets to African weavers over the
next eight years. Senators had earlier pressed for a requirement
that clothing made in Africa be fashioned from U.S. fabric and
thread.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the talks said Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,
personally intervened late Thursday to revive the discussions.
Those close to the talks said that many details remain to be worked
out, but that with the backing of Lott and Hastert they can be
resolved in time for final passage. That is expected to take place
when lawmakers return from their spring recess late this month.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative accord was heartening for President Clinton, who
has made legislation extending new trade benefits to Africa,
Central America and Caribbean countries a top priority. The White
House hopes an accord on countries in those regions will be a
prelude to an agreement on a far more contentious issue,
normalizing trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from textile-industry states have been fighting the
current legislation, as have some unions and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The House originally backed a bill dealing only with several
dozen sub-Saharan African nations. Senators favored a bill that
covered those countries plus two dozen in the Caribbean and Central
America. People familiar with the deal reached Thursday said House
negotiators agreed to cover those additional nations.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to U.S. textile interests, T-shirts made in
Caribbean and Central American countries would be subject to some
barriers not applied to other clothing.

&HT;     `JOE GOULD'S SECRET' ASKS THE UNANSWERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' asks questions that may not have an
answer, and it asks them more than once.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between a starving artist and a deadbeat?
At what point does ``eccentric'' become ``grotesque''? How much do
artists owe to the guilt of the rich? Are we all basically
forgettable? Does a writer steal the soul of people he puts down on
paper, or do they end up stealing his soul?
</P>
<P>
   This movie is about the sometime friendship between Joe
Mitchell, a writer for the New Yorker, and a graying
poet-bohemian-bungler-drunk named Joe Gould, a tirading bowser who
lives in the prewar oddness of Manhattan, wearing two shirts at a
time, finding shelter in midnight sitting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, whose New Yorker pieces were compiled in the
best-selling ``Up in the Old Hotel'' in 1992, follows Gould around,
getting glimpses of a lifestyle that includes ritual begging,
seagull-like honks and tics, bare-chested war dances for giggling
drinkers at midtown parties and a 1,000-page project called ``The
Oral History of Our Time.''
</P>
<P>
   When the New Yorker prints an article on Gould in December 1942
titled ``Professor Seagull,'' both men's lives are changed. Gould,
who strutted around with Mitchell during interviews, talking about
``my biographer,'' clings to Mitchell long after the article comes
out. He tries to grow into the Gould of ``Professor Seagull,''
becoming both larger and smaller in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The good looks, sounds, sights and acting in ``Joe Gould's
Secret'' owe a lot to director Stanley Tucci, who plays Mitchell.
Tucci insisted that Gould be played by Ian Holm, the English actor
he starred with in ``Big Night,'' a highly praised 1996 film of
Italian immigrants opening a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Holm and Tucci are as brilliant in ``Secret'' as they were in
``Big Night,'' offering that same sense of falling face-down into a
vat of life, sending globs of it across the faces of everyone
within splashing distance. Holm, especially, is memorable,
agonizingly true to a character who is half artist, half phony.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is outstanding, from Hope Davis to Vivian Marquie to
Susan Sarandon. But the movie belongs to Tucci and Gould with no
room, really, for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to get a sense of Gould. He orders a bowl
of soup at his regular corner cafe and slams half a bottle of
ketchup into it before the owner grabs it out of his hands. At the
Minetta Tavern, a bartender leans over to tell Mitchell that Gould
is ``good for business. You know, the tourists come in, you tell
'em you've got a real Bohemian over there, and they go, 'Oooooooo.
'''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gould sits in the cafe complaining about a lack of
respect, reciting his knowledge of books and Indians and the
beauties of everyday life ``and all they can do is rag me about
ketchup!'' Gould makes sure Mitchell knows, up front, that he
graduated from Harvard in 1911, magna cum laude, and that he
numbers Ezra Pound and e.e. cummings among his pals.
</P>
<P>
   As with most self-styled eccentrics, a little of Gould goes a
long way. Mitchell is eventually faced with the fear all writers
live with _ that someone they write about will dog them, day and
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's beautifully ordinary existence, a waltz of quiet days
with his wife and two daughters, is constantly disrupted by Gould,
who comes by to cadge drinks or dollars or donations to ``The Oral
History of Our Time,'' the secret at the heart of ``Joe Gould.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell balks at the disruptions, his wife reminds him
people's lives don't exist in 10-page vignettes _ ``their story
doesn't end just because you're finished writing.'' It frightens
people, she points out, to be thought of and forgotten, that
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Once Gould appears in the New Yorker he becomes a favorite of
the well-to-do, picking up an anonymous patron in the process.
Gould, who has spent his entire life living on the edge, is
suddenly comfortable. It's his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he bares sore-encrusted legs to a longtime friend
and painter (Sarandon). The woman washes his feet _ Mary Magdalene
scouring the feet of Jesus _ but Gould is all too human. He wants
her to see the sores, to feel her pity. At the end of his rope,
he's still half artist, half phony.
</P>
<P>
   While Gould is wasting away, his friends wring their hands,
wondering how much will be lost if the anonymous voices in ``The
Oral History of Our Time'' are never heard. But there are anonymous
voices all around, every day, every minute. Damon Runyon and Studs
Terkel wrote about that.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gould, himself, was anonymous. His gift, his whispered
secret, his two-shirts, bohemian rapture, stands out because he
fought for so long against the anonymity he knew was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   For all his artistry, Mitchell was pretty anonymous, as well.
There was a drought between Mitchell's work of the '40s and ``Joe
Gould's Secret,'' which appeared in the New Yorker in 1962.
Mitchell continued to work for the magazine as writer and editor,
but he did not have another article printed in the 32 years left in
his writing life.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves open that last question: Whose soul is it that was
being stolen?

FALL TV FORECAST: WHO WILL STAY, WHO WILL GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As network programmers assess which shows must be kept, which
will be discarded, and how the holes will be filled, it's clear
that ABC is sitting on its newly minted throne all fat and content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' has become the glory and curse
of this TV season, but ABC is, understandably, only concerned with
the former. With such a ratings provider _ and killer _ at its
disposal, ABC surely isn't breaking much of a sweat in the search
for fall pilots to fill slots vacated by dead-and-goners like
``Wasteland'' and painfully wounded shows such as the uneven, but
still-smarter-than-most ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competition certainly is. ``Millionaire'' figures
prominently in the plans of not just ABC but every other network
competitor _ except, perhaps, UPN, which, with its desperate desire
for young men (that didn't come out right, did it?) is playing its
own game.
</P>
<P>
   As the networks prepare the 2000-2001 fall lineups, which will
be announced by mid-May, they're being careful to avoid
``Millionaire,'' both with new shows and with many shows they're
planning to bring back.
</P>
<P>
   It only adds to the tension of this annual chess game of what's
in, what's out, and what should go where. With less than a month
before fall lineups are announced, the usual suspects _ ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``ER'' and
``X-Files,'' if David Duchovny re-ups _ are safe while the comedies
have been far less impressive, with the exception of NBC's ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' and, to a lesser extent, a few other top sitcoms like
``Friends'' and ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, having rewarded its cast with Porsches, NBC has now
given ``Will &AMP; Grace'' a two-year commitment and the unofficial
stamp of Comedy of the Future. ``Friends'' remains a bona fide hit,
in ratings and episode-by-episode quality, but let's face it: How
long can those actors remain together? How long can NBC afford
them? How long can NBC keep ``Will &AMP; Grace'' off Thursday night?
</P>
<P>
   The network, as well as its competitors, are suffering from the
current drought of decent half-hour comedies, which helps explain
the number of comedies that could very well get the ax. Aside from
Fox's hilarious ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which has managed to
attract 16 million viewers a week AND the blessing of critics, new
sitcoms this season have, for the most part, fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the comedies are along the lines of ABC's midseason
hopeful ``Talk to Me,'' with film actress Kyra Sedgwick portraying
a talk radio host; NBC's ``Battery Park,'' a ``Barney Miller''-type
police station comedy; and ``Daddio,'' also on NBC, with Michael
Chiklis as a househusband. All of these series arrived with a
rather loud thud, partly because they're trying far too hard to be
wacky rather than funny.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``King of Queens'' and ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' the twosome carrying Monday nights on CBS, even
established shows in the genre are in trouble. While I have yet to
see a second of Charlie Sheen on ``Spin City,'' there's little
doubt that the series will suffer terribly without Michael J. Fox
next season, and even the scripts of the once feisty ``Dharma and
Greg'' have been noticeably lifeless lately.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, a batch of shows whose cancellations
would only be met with satisfaction, if not outright glee. NBC
Entertainment President Garth Ancier decided to give the struggling
sitcoms ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Suddenly Susan'' opportunities
to revive this season since, according to him, its wiser to tinker
with programs that have ``built some equity with viewers'' than to
launch new ones into the unknown. Seeing that neither series
improved, say bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad,'' the other Thursday-night occupant, has
placed among the top 20 shows on television, but the significance
of its ratings is questionable because NBC scheduled it in the
weakened but still-powerful Thursday-night lineup anchored by
``Friends'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Jesse,'' the Christina Applegate series that follows
``Friends,'' could get canned. Different cast members haven't made
a difference; the series has lost an additional 4 million viewers
from last season. Other likely cancellations: ABC's ``Norm'' and
``Then Came You,'' and The WB's supremely awful reincarnated
``Zoe,'' which now has the distinction of failing as both a high
school and a college comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As for dramas facing extinction, Fox plans to give Jennifer Love
Hewitt's ``Time of Your Life'' a last-ditch test by airing new
episodes over the summer. The network will probably also finally
yank ``Get Real,'' as well as its game show ``Greed'' and the
reality series ``World's Wackiest Police Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, ``Falcone'' looks all but dead, as does the restructured
``Chicago Hope,'' ``Early Edition,'' ``Martial Law'' and the
amazingly durable ``Diagnosis Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   While I'd understand CBS' cancellation of ``Now and Again'' _
its mediocre ratings no longer yield even the cult following
necessary to keep it afloat on a major network _ its disappearance
would still be a disappointment. Few series offer such playful
poignancy, and Eric Close, as a human brain encased in a ripped bod
created by the government, and Dennis Haysbert, as his guardian,
have developed the kind of fun, zippy chemistry we haven't
experienced since Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd in the early
days of ``Moonlighting.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the deaths of ``Freaks and Geeks,'' the splendid high
school-is-a-nightmare dramedy on NBC, and Wonderland,'' a drama set
in a psychiatric ward of a hospital, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   While last season the networks set a precedent of growing hits
slowly by standing by them through the early, tough times, that
doesn't appear to be the case this year. ABC's ``Wonderland''
lasted two episodes. But when you have a ``Millionaire,'' what's
another discarded drama?

A PIERCING LOOK AT A FAD SO UGLY THAT IT HURTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allergies, unsightly scars, rejection, infection _ I knew there
were good reasons why the very thought of pierced body parts give
me the heebie-jeebies. Until now, I just couldn't seem to get past
the primary one: terrifying pain.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 20 years and a month of Sundays since my
sisters and I showed up at Selman's Jewelry store in Summit, Miss.,
to have my ears pierced, but I remember the horror as if it were
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six of us, I was probably the last to work up enough
nerve. As I remember it, they'd already gotten their ears pierced
the old-fashioned way: Deaden the ear with ice, thread a needle,
and sew. In some instances, more than once.
</P>
<P>
   They were with me for moral support. But I was scared.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed so much we caused a scene. To this day, Dianne
swears I turned white. Yes, white. I had to get the other ear done,
but I promised myself that that would be it for me. If the good
Lord hadn't already put it there, not another hole would ever be
put in my body with my approval.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you can understand if I shudder to even lay eyes on
someone with a hole drilled in a place other than the earlobes,
tremble if there's more than one piercing and nearly faint when I
spy a pierced tongue, nose or eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, my terror when I read the other day in the
Science section of The New York Times that people are even piercing
their genitals.
</P>
<P>
   The very thought makes me hurt. All over.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world would anyone want an ornament there?
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to seem like a prude, because the truth is I'm more
a chicken than anything else. But what could these people be
thinking? I mean, how does one decide to put an earring in their
tongue or navel or nipples? What kind of conversation, if any,
could go on in their heads?
</P>
<P>
   It's so tempting to be sarcastic, but this is no laughing
matter. Along with being a very popular fad, especially among
teen-agers, body piercing can be quite hazardous to your health,
not to mention your social standing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, The Times reported that one young woman was fired
from a law firm because the rest of the staff was so repulsed by
her facial piercings.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to make me weep, because I'm against
discrimination of any kind. At the same time, this is an example of
just the thing to do if you don't really want your job.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I was in a restaurant and the person taking my order
had a ring in her tongue. She has a right to work, but I have a
right to my appetite. One look and suddenly I didn't feel hungry
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned health risks. The list is long.
</P>
<P>
   Allergic reaction to jewelry is the most common culprit. Far
more serious are infections caused when sterile techniques aren't
used.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible for piercing to introduce bacteria and viruses
into the bloodstream, including hepatitis B. The list is so long, I
stopped reading for fear I'd start experiencing the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I know my limitations. But apparently, some people don't.

 &HT;    RUSSIA RATIFIES START II, WARNS AGAINST 'STAR WARS'
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With last-minute urging from President-elect Vladimir
Putin, Russia's lower house of parliament ended years of deadlock
Friday and ratified the START II treaty to scrap thousands of
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin and lawmakers warned that Russia will abandon all arms
control pacts if the United States goes forward with plans to
implement a space-based ``Star Wars'' anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-and-half hour closed-door debate, attended by Putin
and a phalanx of military brass carrying the ``suitcase'' with the
country's nuclear launch codes, the State Duma voted 288 to 131 to
approve the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting off the ratification of START II on which the future
of our strategic nuclear forces depends would be undesirable and
harmful,'' Putin said. ``We don't need an arms race. We faced one
before, and if we allow it again it will be worse than last time.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Communists and hard-liners in the Duma had blocked
the pact. It now goes to the Federation Council, the upper chamber
of parliament, which is expected to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a victory for Putin, who has tried to shrug off
criticism for Russia's brutal war in Chechnya and to bolster his
image as a West-looking politician with plenty of political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, however, the news is a mixed
bag. While it gives President Clinton his first foreign policy
victory in the area of arms control, it complicates a decision he
faces this summer over whether to forge ahead with the
controversial multibillion-dollar Star Wars national defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma expressed its opposition to such a system by passing a
separate resolution stating that Russia would pull out of all
nuclear and conventional arms control agreements if the United
States does not adhere to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM Treaty forbids the ``Star Wars''-type missile defense
system that Washington wants to build. U.S. officials believe such
technology is the best defense against nuclear attacks from rogue
nations, a scenario seen as more likely in the post-Cold War era
than an all-out nuclear war with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was hoping to soften Russia's opposition to the
new anti-missile system when officials meet in Washington at the
end of the month. But Putin, echoing the Duma lawmakers, said
Russia would nullify all arms treaties if the United States goes
forward with the Star Wars system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress in this case, we will have the chance and we
will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole
system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and
conventional weapons,'' Putin told the Duma shortly before the vote
</P>
<P>
   START II, negotiated between former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and former President George Bush in 1993, would cut nuclear
stockpiles from 6,000 warheads on each side to no more than 3,500
by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate ratified the agreement in 1996, but Yeltsin
couldn't get the treaty approved by the previous
Communist-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
   After new Duma elections in December, the balance of political
power swung in favor of moderates. Putin was able to lead his party
and a host of other political blocs to approve the treaty, which is
backed by Russia's military and national security leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials had said that approving START II would
strengthen Russia's position in the ABM debate.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov said Friday he would propose
several alternatives to changing the ABM treaty in talks at the end
of the month in the United States, according to the Interfax news
agency. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. and Russian diplomats said in Geneva they would
hold talks there next week to assess the prospects for launching
talks on START III.
</P>
<P>
   START III was agreed to in outline form three years ago. But the
hard work is to agree how deep the further cuts should be.
Washington is looking to cut arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each,
while Russian officials say they are ready to go lower to 1,500
each.
</P>
<P>
   Putin highlighted to the Duma the economic benefits to ratifying
START II, telling lawmakers that the money saved on the maintenance
of the nuclear arsenal would be spent in upgrading the country's
conventional weapons and army.

you might think it is. This includes, but is not limited to, good,
arousing, powerful, witty, academic, reserved, humble, nicely
photographed, riveting, fun and, yes (or no) titillating.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Hughes Brothers' ``Pimp,'' ``Sex'' was part of a
tag-team of self-styled raunchumentaries at Sundance '99 that
everyone wanted to see but no one left talking about. How, you
might ask, could a movie about a popular dirty-movie star that's
been shot in a porn-friendly video format fail?
</P>
<P>
   Well, porn stars are like models and most sock puppets: Nobody
really cares what they have to say. Anyway, the only time the
Singapore-born, London-raised, American-educated sex artist bothers
to speak coherently is when she's making what she would call a
``real'' movie. The director gets all up in Chong's business,
interviewing her equally stoned and pretentious friends, spending
time with her Catholic Singaporean mother, who, incidentally, is
unaware of her daughter's porn life.
</P>
<P>
   The first time relatively mainstream America got a taste of the
terribly uncompelling Chong was with her seemingly doped-up
appearance on ``Jerry Springer'' in 1995, though, recognizing how
on top of things Jerry's audience is, she was probably a household
name.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent her girlhood in a convent as a child named Grace,
one supposes Chong wanted to get out and break all the sex laws.
Chong's docu-autobio shares its name with the singer's coffee-table
book full of tawdry erotica, and she spends most of Lewis' movie
looking like Madonna in her ``Borderline'' days, magically
transported to the set of the ``Justify My Love'' video.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis gives us interviews that look like high-8 outtakes from
``Boogie Nights'' with Ron Jeremy and porn execs who call Chong ``a
super winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup of Lewis' profile appears to be his being present to
witness the taping of Chong's tour de force in which she has sex
with 251 men over the course of 10 hours. But as it turns out,
``The World's Biggest Gang-Bang'' is also the lamest.

SHRAKE ADDS TEXAS HISTORY TO HIS LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a colorful career that has spanned half a
century, Edwin Shrake, more familiarly known to friends and readers
as ``Bud,'' has written nearly everything that can be put into
print.
</P>
<P>
   First came newspaper stories for the Fort Worth Press, Dallas
Times Herald and Dallas Morning News. Then came worldwide ramblings
for Sports Illustrated; a spate of critically acclaimed, if never
bestselling, novels (the classic ``Blessed McGill'' among them);
screenplays (''Tom Horn'' and ``Kid Blue''); sports how-to's
(including ``Harvey Penick's Little Red Book,'' the bestselling
sports book of all time); and, currently, a stage play co-authored
with Britain's Michael Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   But experience and success haven't banked the writing fire in
Shrake, a 68-year-old Fort Worth native now living in his beloved
adoptive hometown of Austin. He's out hustling ``The Borderland''
(Hyperion, $24.95), a novel about the Republic of Texas in 1839.
It's a work combining historical perspective, vivid imagination and
not a little mysticism _ a book that, even by Shrake's exacting
standards, pushed him to the limits of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always tried to make everything I wrote as good as it
could possibly be,'' Shrake says between bites of chicken tacos at
a north Fort Worth restaurant. ``I've never taken being a writer
for granted. I've never gotten tired of writing. But this book is
different for me. It was a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrake originally conceived the novel in the late 1970s and
worked through a draft centered on the epic Texan-Comanche battle
of Plum Creek, when the Indians unsuccessfully tried to stave off
white occupation of their favorite tribal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some New York editor took a look _ a brief look _ and told
me nobody wanted to read a historical novel about Texas,'' Shrake
growls, still irritated by the comment two decades later. ``Of
course, just a year or two later Larry McMurtry comes along with
`Lonesome Dove,' and (James) Michener has a bestseller with
`Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, Shrake relegated what he was then calling Plum
Creek to the bottom of a soon-forgotten box and carried on with his
life, which, at the time, was as notorious for nonstop partying as
for writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking at that time,'' Shrake says, eyes twinkling at
the understatement. (In his recent autobiography ``Gypsy Songman,''
hedonistic singer/songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker devotes dozens of
pages to descriptions of megaparties he and Shrake hosted during
the 1970s and speculates why either should have survived them.) ``I
think now that the book (`Borderland') wasn't supposed to come
then. I wasn't prepared to do the research I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Years passed. Shrake took on other book projects; the Penick
book and its sequels made him enough money to take financial
concerns out of his life. In the mid-'80s, he was found to have
diabetes and quit drinking. Shrake became the full-time companion
of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. But ``Plum Creek'' was never
quite expunged from his memory. In particular, Bill Wittliff, an
old pal involved in producing the epic ``Lonesome Dove'' TV
miniseries, urged Shrake to get back to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying `No,' and then one night about four years ago I
was sitting out on my balcony,'' Shrake says. ``I live in West Lake
Hills in Austin, and from my balcony you can look out across the
Colorado (River). So I was sitting there thinking about how Austin
has changed over the years _ hippie Austin, dot-com Austin _ and
then it occurred to me that, back in 1839, Comanches might have
been in the same place with the same view, wondering like me why
strangers were coming to change a place they dearly loved the way
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first new scene when Shrake started rewriting,
combining his old ``Plum Creek'' plot with reams of new material.
Now his tale encompassed early political conflict in the fledgling
Republic of Texas and how the capital was moved from relatively
civilized Houston to Austin, an outpost in the heart of Comanche
territory. Shrake populated his saga with colorful characters real
and imagined and threw in all sorts of mystical allegories that
further elevated the renamed ``The Borderland'' from interesting
western drama to mesmerizing existential heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess to being mystically inclined,'' says Shrake, who, by
virtue of a ministerial license he acquired by mail, has officiated
at weddings. ``I'm a little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Released this month, ``The Borderland'' has so far sold solidly,
if not spectacularly. Shrake believes it is coincidence, not bad
luck, that he and fellow Austinite Stephen Harrigan have published
massive novels of Texas history within weeks of each other. (They
even have the same literary agent.) Harrigan's ``The Gates of the
Alamo'' has just climbed onto the New York Times bestseller list.
Shrake hopes that's a good sign for ``The Borderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope `The Gates of the Alamo' sells a jillion copies,''
Shrake says. ``There could be a coattail effect, and my book could
sell half a jillion. Honestly, I believe there's always room for
two successful books.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Borderland'' sells enough copies, Shrake is eager to
attempt a sequel. Meanwhile, he and London-based Rudman are
finishing the seventh draft of their play via e-mail, and Shrake is
also finding time to stay in touch with colorful former colleagues
from Fort Worth's Paschal High and the long-defunct Fort Worth
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Jenkins was my best friend from high school on, and I
still see Blackie Sherrod, Jerre Todd, Gary Cartwright, all the old
Press people,'' Shrake says. ``It's not too strong a word to say we
love each other. The old days were golden times, though we never
made enough money to sit back and realize they were golden then.
But I still have lots of things I want to do; I have no interest in
just stopping where I am and remembering instead of doing.''

FIRST, SALSA. THEN, LATIN MUSIC. NOW, RUM IS HOT.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ At Samba Room, the nuevo-Cuban restaurant in Dallas
where the white-jacketed waiters and the Tito Puente soundtrack
make you feel like you stepped into a club Ricky Ricardo might have
opened, rum seems to be in everything at the bar: The mojitos
(fresh lime juice, rum, sugar cane extract, mint). The caipirinhas,
sweet cocktails made with a Brazilian liqueur that tastes just like
rum. The special Crazyy martinis, made with Bacardi Limon flavored
rum, Cointreau and cranberry juice.
</P>
<P>
   And at Cuba Libre, a cavernous 2-story, Caribbean-flavored bar
and restaurant that opened in Dallas two months ago, rum is the
specialty of the house. They stock fruit-flavored rums and
specially aged sipping rums; bartenders mix it into pina coladas
and martinis. And on weekend nights, the bar sells at least 100
servings of its most popular drink, the house-special frozen Cuba
Libre, a slushy concoction of rum, Coke and lime _ ``like a Slurpee
with a real kick,'' says bar manager Rodney Caprio.
</P>
<P>
   Single-malt scotch and cigars? That's so '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitans? Um, they were over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila? OK, that's still a big deal, but some think its moment
has peaked.
</P>
<P>
   No, the drink of the moment, the trendy liquor of choice, is
rum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love rum. Rum is fun, rum is tropical, rum is hot,'' says
Park Kerr, of the El Paso Chile Co., who is not given to
understatement, and who has reasons of his own to say this: His new
``Rum &AMP; Tiki Cookbook'' (William Morrow; $12.95) just hit stores,
full of interesting recipes like lemon rum martinis, garlicky crab
fettuccine in rum cream sauce, and ginger-rum balls.
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures back Kerr up; rum now sells about 50,000 gallons
more a year in the United States than it did five years ago. Sales
of vodka, the most popular hard liquor in the United States, are
still more than twice those of rum, but rum is in fourth place for
hard-liquor sales, according to figures supplied by the Distilled
Spirits Council of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr credits rum's resurgence to its adaptability (its
relatively light flavor makes it a good mixer, both in drinks and
in main dishes and sauces) and to food trends (the increased
popularity of Latin and Caribbean fusion cuisines). And he likes
the nostalgia factor, too _ the same movement behind such new-again
trends as swing dancing and retro fashions like capri pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents drank rum in the '50s and '60s. My mother imported
banana daiquiris to El Paso,'' says Kerr, a native Texan. ``So it
has that whole '50s and '60s thing going, too.''
</P>
<P>
   More cynical observers, however, might credit marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the early '90s, rum sales declined, until about 1995
_ coincidentally, about the time that rums flavored with fruit
juices, like Bacardi Limon, were introduced. Flavored rums now
account for 25 percent of the rum market, says John Gomez, a
marketing executive at Bacardi.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez attributes rum's new popularity partly to the shift in
consumer tastes over the past 20 years away from dark liquors
(whiskey, bourbon) and toward clear liquors (rum, vodka, gin).
</P>
<P>
   ``People are moving away from drinking (liquor) that is an
acquired taste,'' he says. ``They don't want something that burns.
They're looking for easy-to-drink cocktails'' such as flavored
rums, which don't even need mixers.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true of under-30 drinkers, he says. About 18
months ago, Bacardi started aggressively courting these
twentysomething consumers with its Bacardi by Night campaign,
featuring hot young rum drinkers and such taglines as ``Cubicle by
day; Bacardi by night.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the trend, Gomez says, is the growth in more
expensive, aged rums, costing $30 a bottle or more, compared to the
traditional rum that costs up to $15 a bottle. Gomez compares the
pricier rums to a cognac, in that their smooth taste appeals to an
older, more affluent, more sophisticated crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's market-driven or marketing-driven, local businesses
are embracing the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Angeluna, for instance, serves a specialty drink
called Blame it on Rio, which is particularly popular in the
summer. It's essentially a rum martini, made with cachaca (the
Brazilian liqueur that's similar to rum), Cointreau, and fresh lime
juice, served straight up in an oversized martini glass.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Westin Galleria earlier this year introduced a special
Nuevo Latino menu that features mojitos, daiquiris and Caribe
Cosmopolitans, made with cranberry juice, rum and Grand Marnier.
And local Latin-themed restaurants as El Paraiso, a Cuban
restaurant and bar in Euless, also stock plenty of rum at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Local liquor stores are being a little more cautious, but even
they carry more flavored rums and more expensive rums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly they expect rums to take off like tequilas have, and
there are a lot more expensive rums on the market, but they're not
selling all that well yet,'' says Harry Labovitz, an executive vice
president at King's, the Fort Worth liquor store chain. ``It takes
time for these to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, two years ago, Labovitz stocked just one or two rums that
sold for more than $30 a bottle; now he has nine labels at or above
that price, including Pyrat Cask 23, which costs $260 for a
750-milliliter bottle. And yes, he sells them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have them in the store just for window dressing,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuba Libre, anyone?

NEW YORK SWEARS OFF AN INSECTICIDE IN WAR AGAINST MOSQUITOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City has decided not to spray malathion, the
pesticide it used against mosquitoes last year, in its campaign to
prevent another outbreak of West Nile virus, and to use helicopter
spraying only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the city will begin an effort to kill mosquitoes
before they hatch, and if neighborhoods do become infested, health
officials will opt for three other insecticides sprayed primarily
by trucks. The city will use helicopters to spray those
insecticides only if the other methods fail. Both the use of
malathion and helicopter spraying greatly unnerved residents and
environmental groups last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid using insecticides, the city plans an
aggressive effort to kill mosquito larvae, and it will drop
millions of tiny larvae-eating fish into the city's waste treatment
plants. The so-called mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, which will be
confined to the plants, multiply rapidly and are considered a
vacuum for larvae, consuming hundreds an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, said the city
had decided not to use malathion because it was under a safety
review by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. ``Our
confidence needs to be deferred until questions raised by the
review are resolved,'' he said. Malathion has in fact been under
review by the agency for well over 18 months, under a 1996 law
enacted to review all pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory,'' said Laura Haight, an environmental
associate for the New York Public Interest Group, a public advocacy
organization. ``This is the first time the city has made any
statement whatsoever like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Haight's organization and other environmental groups have
contended that the effects of malathion have not been fully
studied. Thousands of city residents also clamored for the end of
malathion spraying last year, worrying about possible effects on
children, pets and roof gardens, and annoyed that chemical droplets
often fell without warning during summer evenings outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani scoffed at the idea that
malathion was harmful and vowed to keep spraying as long as it was
necessary. Most scientists believe that malathion, if used
properly, is harmless to humans.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, neither Giuliani nor Cohen
mentioned the city's decision to abandon malathion. The plan to use
other insecticides was on the fifth page of a five-page news
release on the city's extensive plan to ward off another West Nile
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, city workers will squirt poison along the
city's cracks and crevices. Government officials will press
residents to clean out their birdbaths. And the larvae-eating fish
will presumably use their appetites to help keep calamity at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito eradication plan is part of a multimillion-dollar
program to ward off the West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne virus
that can cause swelling of the brain and that killed 7 people and
sickened 62 in the metropolitan region last year. After that
outbreak, the city and other municipalities embarked on a costly
insecticide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the fish program, the city plans to treat storm drains
and other areas of standing water with larvicides that inhibit
mosquito breeding and the maturation of mosquito larvae. The
application is to begin next week and continue through April.
</P>
<P>
   The city will also begin a major advertising campaign urging New
Yorkers to get rid of standing pools of water, change the water in
their birdbaths, drain unused pools and apply bug spray when
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city will do its part to control mosquito breeding,''
Cohen said Thursday during a City Council hearing. ``However, we
can only truly succeed in significantly reducing mosquitoes if
everyone pitches in to mosquito-proof New York City by eliminating
areas of standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was jeered by several environmental advocates at the
hearing when he announced that the city would, if needed, use other
chemicals for spraying: Scourge, Anvil and Agrevo Permanone. Many
environmentalists oppose the use of any insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement came almost a month after the state
health commissioner, Dr. Antonia Novello, outlined a plan to battle
mosquitoes statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Westchester was one of several suburban counties
that chose a different pesticide, sumithrin, sold under the trade
name Anvil, for its aerial attack on mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it has made no decision on which chemical to spray
should an aerial assault become necessary, said Mary Landrigan, a
spokeswoman for the County Health Department. She said the primary
focus remained on finding and eliminating breeding mosquitoes and
larvae so that no spraying would be necessary later. Connecticut
cities will be left to make their plans as they choose, an official
there said. New Jersey and Long Island officials could not be
reached Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The use of mosquitofish is common all over the world, and they
are most often found in the southeast United States and in the
Caribbean, said Christopher Andrews, executive director of the
South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston. In 1905, about 150 of the
fish were introduced into Hawaii from Texas to test their
effectiveness in preying on mosquito larvae, according to a Web
site run by the Department of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fish are not indigenous to New York, some have
thrived for years in a wastewater treatment plant near Wards
Island. No one seems to know how they got there, said a spokesman
at the City Department of Environmental Protection. If mosquitoes
are found to be breeding in other treatment plants in the city, the
fish will be called to dinner at those plants.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, the fish are not harmless _ they have
been known to prey on natural fauna and overtake other fish
populations when introduced in foreign areas. But since they will
be limited to the waste treatment plants, this should not be an
issue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor proudly clutched a jar of the minnowlike fish at his
news conference Thursday. ``See them, here they are,'' he said.
``They eat larvae. See? They eat that,'' he added, pointing to a
wee bit of larvae. ``They're going to be in our treatment plants,
and they're going to eat them. Maybe a month from now, they'll be
quite a bit fatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, whom the mayor derided last year as
alarmists, applauded the city's efforts to ward off mosquitoes'
hatching. ``We do have concerns about the health effects of all
pesticides,'' Haight said. ``But over all, this plan contains many
of the elements we have been calling for that prevent their
unnecessary use.''

NISSAN SENTRA: WILL MORE, MORE, MORE BE ENOUGH? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The preliminary statistics for highway deaths in
1999 are out, and they show substantial safety progress, if you
look at them the way the Department of Transportation does. Looking
differently at the same numbers, though, some safety analysts see
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   And buried in the numbers are some contradictory trends.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, released earlier this month by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the number of
people killed in vehicle accidents last year was 41,345, down from
41,471 in 1998, a 0.3 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of 126 people out of more than 40,000 may not sound like
a success, but the Transportation Department called that an
improvement when measured by vehicle miles traveled: The 1999 rate
was 1.5 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled; the rate in
1998 was 1.6 deaths per 100 million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the drop in the
death rate was historic. ``This continued reduction in traffic
fatalities is encouraging news,'' he said in a statement. ``Safety
is President Clinton's and Vice President Gore's highest
transportation priority, and these statistics show that our
commitment to safety is paying huge dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the number of deaths per 100 million miles is down
sharply; 20 years ago it was 3.4, or more than twice the current
rate, and 30 years ago it was 4.7, or three times what it is now.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual number of fatalities is shrinking far more
slowly. For each year of the 1990s, it has varied from 39,250 to
44,599. The rate is dropping because vehicle miles traveled jumps
by about 2 percent each year, now approaching 2.7 trillion miles,
up from 2.6 trillion last year, and 1.8 trillion in 1970. ``The
number of deaths could be stable or rising and you divide by this
huge number, and it looks like things are always getting better,''
said Dr. Robert Scopatz, a statistician and road safety expert at
Data Nexus Inc., a public safety consulting firm in Kissimmee, Fla.
``It's always going to look like an improvement, because vehicle
miles traveled rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Scopatz said the statistical method used by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, called the Fatality Analysis
Reporting System, produced the best data available. But he added
that vehicle miles traveled _ an estimate based on states counting
cars at various spots _ was not the ideal number on which to make
safety calculations. A better method for measuring safety, he said,
would use the number of people miles _ meaning the total number of
miles that people travel, whether alone or with others _ although
currently there is no way to measure that. (Scopatz said he was
also curious about the number of deaths per million cell phone
calls.)
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary numbers, some reached on the basis of direct
counting and others through sampling, show that the total number of
crashes reported to the police, 6.3 million, is also down, by about
0.7 percent. But the number of injuries, for reasons that are not
clear, rose to 3.2 million, an increase of about 8,000, or 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   New cars that include more safety features and the wider use of
seat belts may be reducing fatalities, and thus increasing the
number of people who are counted as injured, but that shift likely
represents hundreds, not thousands, of people. Stephanie Faul, a
spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, said better
emergency medical care has also spared lives, if not injuries.
</P>
<P>
   One category that experienced disappointing results was
motorcycle fatalities, which reached 2,537 last year, up 11 percent
from 1998. The 1998 number was about 8 percent higher than 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Again, no one is sure why. Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said, ``In a good economy,
more people may be purchasing motorcycles as a toy.'' And, she
said, helmet laws were being relaxed. Further analysis may show
whether the death rate is highest in states that have eased their
helmet laws.
</P>
<P>
   And continuing to fuel the debate over higher speed limits, the
transportation department's preliminary 1999 data showed that the
number of deaths on roads with posted speed limits of 55 and above
rose by 2 percent, and the number on roads with speed limits below
55 fell by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that makes it sound like faster highway traffic is
causing more deaths. But there are complicating factors. According
to Dr. Steven Bloch, a researcher at the Automobile Club of
Southern California, an AAA affiliate, higher freeway speed limits
are inducing drivers to change their routes from back roads to the
interstates, increasing traffic there, and, as a result, the number
of accidents. And the federal data did not account for the miles of
roadway where the speed limit was shifted from under 55 to 55 or
over.
</P>
<P>
   If a past pattern holds, the number of deaths in 2000 might be
significantly lower: Deaths dropped sharply in 1974, 1980 and 1992
_ years when the price of gasoline spiked. But some people think
the consumer reaction to the current increase in gas prices will
not be so strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Nambisan, a professor of civil engineering at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said the scarcity of fuel could
make people drive less or slower. Still, she added, ``I don't think
a significant portion of the population is driving significantly
less.''
</P>
<P>
   2 Views on Side-Impact Air Bags
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of the crisis over air bags killing or injuring
children in the front passenger seat, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration said last October that side-impact air bags
on the rear seats could also be a hazard to children. And since
parents were being urged to put children in the back seat to keep
them away from the front air bags, the carmakers who offer
side-impact air bags in the rear seats should ship those cars with
the bags disabled, the agency said, leaving it to the buyer and the
dealer to decide if they should be activated.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for BMW, Karl-Heinz Ziwica, said his company had
shipped cars that way even before the October letter from the
safety agency. But at Mercedes-Benz USA, James Resnick, a
spokesman, said, ``It's our belief that the rear side air bags
provide a very significant safety benefit, both for adults and
children.'' Children should be in appropriate seats or booster
seats, he said, and if they are properly positioned, there is no
threat to them.'' Based on that position, Mercedes ships its cars
with the side air bags activated.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``a very small handful'' of buyers have asked to have the
bags deactivated, Resnick said.

   WASHINGTON _ The federal government launched a campaign Friday
to publicize the risks of anabolic steroids amid indications that
the use of muscle-enhancing drugs among young athletes and
body-builders is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a half million young people are using anabolic
steroids,'' Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, told a news conference. ``And the numbers are going to
get worse unless we do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five percent more 10th-graders reported trying steroids
at least once in their lifetime in 1999 than in 1998, according to
an institute study released in December. The study also found that
eighth-graders were equally as likely as 10th-graders to have tried
steroids, and that nearly one percent of students in the eighth,
10th and 12th grades had used steroids within a month of the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which is part of the National Institutes of
Health, launched an educational Web site about the potential risks
of using steroids, www.steroidabuse.org, and will distribute nearly
one million information sheets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The information includes 500,000 postcards that will be
available at selected gyms, movie theaters and shopping malls,
among other places, in major cities such as Los Angeles and
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids are manufactured substances that act like
testosterone, the male sex hormone, in building muscle mass. Some
teen-agers use steroids, which are available over the counter, to
enhance their physical appearance, their athletic performance or
both.
</P>
<P>
   But Leshner and several doctors who joined him at the news
conference said steroid use by young men can also cause acne,
stunted growth and the development of breasts. For teen-age girls,
who several doctors said are using steroids more than in years
past, short-term side effects include facial hair, increased body
hair and acne.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said long-term use can result in various types of
cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports
is bad for our health, bad for the sports, bad for the youth and
bad for our country,'' said Dr. Gary Wadler, an associate professor
at the New York University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linn Goldberg of the Oregon Health Sciences University
unveiled the results of a coach- and peer-training program for high
school boys that reduced the use of steroids and other drugs
significantly in its first test case. Football players from 31
Oregon high schools participated in the program that was funded by
the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of anabolic steroids was reduced by 50 percent as were
the use of athletic-enhancing supplements,'' Goldberg reported,
adding that the program also has helped decrease alcohol and drug
use.

COMPANY BANKS ON GIRLS GOING BOY CRAZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Nancy Pasternack writes for the Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Fla.,
a New York Times Regional Newspaper.) 
 By NANCY PASTERNACK    
 Sarasota Herald-Tribune    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Brittany Beatty, 10, stares intently at the
face on a trading card. She has found one she says she really
likes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hernando County fifth-grader reads the name, ``Brian,''
beneath the photo of a blue-eyed boy in a baseball cap. Brian,
according to the card, is a Sagittarius. He likes hockey and girls
who have a sense of humor. He's 13.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Crazy, the product that holds Brittany spellbound, is the
latest offering from Decipher, a Norfolk, Va., company that also
produces ``Star Wars'' and ``Austin Powers'' trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects of Boy Crazy cards, the slogan boasts, are ``real boys
for real girls.'' A pack of nine cards retails for $3.
</P>
<P>
   One month after making their debut on the display counter of
Quality Collectibles in Sarasota Square Mall, their draw is still
limited.
</P>
<P>
   But store manager David Baker says it's just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are just finding out about them,'' he says. Soon, he
predicts, the cards ``will be like Pokemon. Once they (kids) learn
about it, it'll really take off.'' This would not surprise
Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' photos, she says, are cute, ``and the set up is
neat.'' Boy Crazy cards feature photos of boys _ age 12-22 _ taken
during a search of 15 malls last year. Virginia teen-age
cheerleaders helped sift 363 from thousands photographed, according
to Decipher officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cards hit markets in Europe and Australia, too, in recent
weeks. And though it may be too early to tell how sales have gone,
the Boy Crazy Web site (www.boycrazy.com) _ which offers game
rules, opportunities to vote for favorite cards and inquire about
individual photo subjects _ gets 1.6 million hits per day on
average, according to Decipher spokeswoman Leslie Hellerman. The
site's registered membership, she says, numbers 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of mall rats?
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear glasses,'' says Hellerman. ``They have braces on
their teeth. They're more realistic than the pretty boys on the WB
(Warner Brothers) Network.'' But some parents say they would prefer
a little less reality for children approaching or enduring puberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a meat market for kids,'' says Donna Marks of
Chicago, who shopped at Sarasota Square Mall on a recent Saturday
with her 11-year-old son. ``They remind me of personal ads.'' Some
of the girls the cards are meant to appeal to also are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Lawrenz, 11, a Sarasota Middle School student, throws her
mother a look of disappointment as she flips through a stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if they were the Backstreet Boys,'' she says, shrugging.
``These are complete strangers.'' Hellerman says the company
protects the anonymity of its young subjects by listing the boys'
first names and states of origin only.
</P>
<P>
   And information from Web site visitors, she says, is entered
under the strictest codes of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a dating service. There's not a lot this would
offer someone whose ideas are anything but wholesome.'' Not
everyone takes comfort from such assurances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inappropriate,'' says Dan Bafia of Bradenton, whose
daughters are 15 and 12 _ both within the ideal age range targeted
by Boy Crazy. ``I'm not too keen on them getting into stuff like
that online,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota High School teacher Donna Burkhart says Boy Crazy cards
are the last thing teens and pre-teens need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hormones are raging enough,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But the cards pique her niece's interest. The 7th-grader looks
at each boy's face carefully. While she doesn't offer her own
opinion, she says her peers are likely to go in for the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother, Jean Klaus, shows even more interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty cute, huh? This one needs a shave,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had some cute older guys like Paul Newman I'd be
trading these at the health club,'' she says. A second national
mall tour is underway to search for next year's batch of ``real
boys,'' according to Hellerman. No Florida malls have made it on
the itinerary yet.
</P>
<P>
   Hellerman says it's still a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good to Said Lissone, a 10th-grader at Riverview
High. ``I'd like to be on one of those,'' he says, looking at the
Boy Crazy display at Quality Collectibles. Then another thought
occurs to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' he says. ``Do they have cards with girls on them?''

MY IRA NEEDS VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By BOB MORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people have hip financial managers. I have an accountant
named Ronald McDonald, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   He hates money, or to be more precise, people who are making too
much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day the media hits you with another new rich guy who
made a billion dollars,'' he's saying as he adds up my tax
deductions. ``I mean, who are these people on TV, telling you some
stupid Internet stock is so important? Karl Marx was right when he
said capitalism will eat itself alive. It'll destroy the planet,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Because I don't make much money or own much stock, I usually
find his harangues refreshing, if not validating. But now he's just
making me anxious. This tax season something has changed, even for
people far more affluent than I; we can't help comparing ourselves
with all the skinny young eco-conscious philanthropically correct
e-people who don't even have to wear ties to make their killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time you had to work your way up,'' says a friend who
took the slow road from business school to banking to marketing to
Internet-venturing, shedding his expensive suits in the process.
``These new people skip the meal and go straight to the dessert,
and it's annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. But, honestly, I'm kind of ashamed to be so
despairing, because in addition to having a great career and a
rent-controlled apartment, my income is 10 times what it once was.
In this new compare-and-despair culture, I don't need a Marxist
accountant. I need therapy to work out my envy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing from a lot of stressed-out successful people who
don't think they're doing well because others are making
millions,'' says Suzanne Marcus, a psychologist in La Jolla,
Calif., who tells me that success isn't measured by finances and
cites a recent article in American Psychologist that asks, ``If
we're so rich, why aren't we happy?''
</P>
<P>
   She adds that real happiness is reflected in one's ability to
lose track of time while engaged in meaningful ``flow activities,''
like music and sports. ``What a rich life,'' she coos when I tell
her that I'm about to sail to Cuba on assignment (not for this
column).
</P>
<P>
   So if life's so good, why am I so upset by what Vanity Fair and
Vogue are calling the e-Establishment and Dot Com Society, even
after Microsoft lost, Nasdaq dipped, and Dana Giacchetto, the young
financial guru to the stars, was charged with stock fraud? ``If you
really want what others have,'' Marcus says, ``use your jealousy,
and stretch yourself to be more like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day I'm in the office of my Chase bank manager. My
modest retirement savings, she's telling me sternly, are earning
nothing. When she asks about my meager investments, I don't know if
the Pfizer stock I bought when Viagra was first marketed has split
or not, nor do I know what my Dreyfus fund is worth since I hate
pie charts. CD? IRA? P/E ratio? What's it mean? ``I'm such a
loser,'' I say. ``You're not a loser, you have some money,'' she
says. ``You just need to get your portfolio in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I'm in with the bank's senior financial investor, who has
a leopard-print belt that matches her handbag. ``So you're single,
42, disappointed in Viagra,'' she says, ``and you have money
issues. What else?'' I tell her that I'm tired of rooting against
new-technology celebrities and that although I still object to cell
phones, maybe there's a way to invest in all the satellites
facilitating all the yakking. She listens, calls up charts, runs
figures and rejects my investment interest in fashion and extreme
sports. One mutual fund she likes makes me cringe when I see a
cruise line on its list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you think all these retired people with money are
going?'' she scolds. ``Snowboarding?''
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy my need for something trendy, she finds a fund that
invests in communications infrastructure. ``It'll give you
something to talk about at your cocktail parties,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So what if I'm investing in social cachet more than anything
else? This is the makeover I've needed. It's 7 p.m. when we finish,
and all my CD's and IRA's are now in stocks, where they belong. I
feel wiped out, yet invigorated, as if we've just engaged in sex or
some other kind of flow activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a cigarette?'' I ask Ms. Investor. She laughs.
</P>
<P>
   When I return to Ronald McDonald the next day, he tells me I owe
a lot in taxes. But for the first time in my life, I feel happy to
pay up, because in my own small way, I'm now a player who's engaged
in the conversation that has taken over the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what's meant by a correction?

WHEN CELEBRITY HEARTS BLEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 16)  
 By MICHELE WILLENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public image of Leonardo DiCaprio, circa 1998: a party boy
with a reserved table in every VIP room, hopping from Moomba to
Chaos to Veruka in a Lincoln Navigator with his posse of male
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Leonardo DiCaprio, circa April 2000: the chairman
of Earth Day, leading a four-hour rally in Washington next Saturday
to raise awareness of global warming, a subject about which he says
in a Web chat, ``I personally feel this is the most highly ignored,
yet important issue facing the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, few Hollywood stars have worked to transform
their off-screen image as strikingly as DiCaprio, the ``Titanic''
heartthrob who seems intent on exchanging the hard-partying persona
for that of an activist alarmed about the fate of the earth.
DiCaprio is also writing an essay on the environment to appear in
Time magazine this week, and his interview with President Clinton,
the subject of a media dust-up the last two weeks, will finally be
seen on ABC's ``Planet Earth 2000'' special on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenness of DiCaprio's emergence as an environmental
champion _ he had not publicly flexed his social consciousness
before _ suggests some intriguing questions about the relationship
between celebrities and the causes they espouse. To what degree are
a star's motives altruistic, and to what degree self-promotional?
When is an actor using a high profile to draw the spotlight to a
worthy cause, and when is he or she hoping for a more flattering
form of personal media coverage? Is there any downside for
nonprofit groups who enlist celebrities?
</P>
<P>
   Professional environmentalists are happy to have DiCaprio in
their corner. ``He's a new name to the movement, but a well-known
one, so we say go for it,'' said Jay Watson, a West Coast director
of fund raising for the Wilderness Society. But he has some concern
about the actor's credibility on global warming, which is caused in
part by driving gas-guzzlers like Lincoln Navigators and heating
big homes. ``When you get into things like overconsumption of
resources, a movie star like him has to be careful, because it's no
secret many live very lavish lifestyles,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about celebrities and causes seem more relevant
than ever as so many stars line up behind do-good issues that
nearly every Hollywood party is a stop on the charity circuit. ``I
have seen a major increase in the number of invitations I get for
celebrities and benefits,'' said George Christy, the columnist for
The Hollywood Reporter, who has covered the party scene for
decades. ``There are still birthday parties and premieres, but they
are now overwhelmed by events that are about something.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue of George magazine uses its cover to
``applaud'' the no-nukes activism of Michael Douglas and, inside,
lists 109 stars and their causes, from David Schwimmer and the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, to Christina Aguilera and the
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, to Charlton Heston and the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrity is expected to have an issue now as much as he or
she is expected to have an agent,'' said Robin Bronk, coordinator
of the Creative Coalition, which acts as a sort of issues
clearinghouse for the entertainment industry. (You don't like
global warming? How about doing this censorship benefit?)
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, whose advisory board includes Alec Baldwin, Ron
Silver and Robin Williams, makes no bones about mixing Hollywood
careers with social activism. ``The reality is that issues are
searching for celebrity voices,'' Bronk said, ``and that is
relatively new. It's just the nature of our celebrity culture.''
</P>
<P>
   News coverage is increasingly fixated on celebrities, so causes
recruit famous spokesmen, who in turn reap the benefit of coverage
that is more flattering than usual. The campaign to build a World
War II memorial in Washington with private money was stalled for
years until its co-chairman, former Sen. Bob Dole, recruited Tom
Hanks as spokesman. Now, a $100 million drive has been kicked into
high gear thanks to the actor's announcements and appearances.
``Every time he goes on Leno or Letterman, he mentions our 800
number, and the phones ring off the hook,'' said Doug McKinnon,
Dole's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, one of the public's most beloved stars, said he was not
motivated by the prospect of more personally flattering coverage.
``As we enter the new millennium, a lot of us are realizing there's
more than just cranking out the product,'' he said. He had no
hesitation at all about supporting the World War II memorial, he
added, ``once I saw the plans and knew that it was a tasteful
design, not some huge combat boot in the middle of the Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy experts, by and large, see little downside to the
tightening embrace of celebrities and causes, and even if the
motives are mixed on both sides, they say, little harm is done.
``You always have to ask, is it pure altruism or an attempt for
some new kind of warm glow?'' said Alan Abramson, director of
nonprofit studies for the Aspen Institute, a policy research group.
``The second possibility may be more the case with these people,
but I guess I say, so what? For those in the public eye, there are
always doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard magazine,
questions whether the trend represents momentum in the march of
humanity. ``You have to ask if the most successful causes had
celebrities as their spokespersons,'' he said. ``Did antismoking?
Did drunk drivers? But this has become an increasingly unserious
country, so unserious politics may make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of serious politics driven by a celebrity endorser
was Proposition 10 in California, a 1998 ballot initiative that
raised the tax on cigarettes 50 cents a pack and uses the $680
million a year collected to pay for health, nutrition and child
care for preschoolers. Proposition 10 was also known as the Reiner
Initiative, for the actor-director Rob Reiner, who essentially quit
his day job for two years to research and raise money for the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drove it all the way through, the way a lot of political
people couldn't have,'' said John Emerson, a longtime Democratic
operative in California.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner compared the effort to a political campaign, as opposed
to a one-night stand at a charity fund-raiser at the Beverly
Hilton. ``It's one thing to put a spotlight on an issue, it's
another to get into the inner workings of creating public policy,''
he said. By comparison, movie making now feels like recess to him,
he said. He continues his advocacy through his I Am Your Child
Foundation, for which he has persuaded Meg Ryan and Bruce Willis to
do ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see my name on their phone list, they groan where
once they were thrilled,'' he said. ``They know it's probably not
about a movie. But they still call me back because maybe it's about
a movie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such serious-issues advocacy in Hollywood has given rise to a
new kind of personal assistant, one who helps stars sort through
the competing claims of charities and channel their time and money.
Call them P Girls, as in ``political,'' as distinguished from the D
Girls, who develop film projects for stars. The P Girl sisterhood _
nearly everyone in this line of work seems to be a woman _ includes
Lara Bergthold, who navigates social causes for Norman Lear; Marge
Tabankin, who works for Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg;
Joyce Deep, with Robert Redford; and Donna Bojarsky, with Richard
Dreyfuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots outside of movies I'd like to do, so it makes
sense to have someone who knows that world,'' said Dreyfuss, who
founded the volunteer organization L.A. Works in 1991 and recently
sponsored a conference at Columbia University on journalism and the
Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the P Girls have political experience in Washington and,
in the words of Bojarsky, ``We constantly pass things back and
forth, and there's a lot of `I'll do yours if you'll do mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   P Girls should not be confused with press agents, though at
times they may be hard to distinguish. DiCaprio entered the world
of social activism through Ken Sunshine, who calls himself a ``PR
consultant,'' though he has deep political roots. He is a former
chief of staff for Mayor David Dinkins and is informally advising
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign. Sunshine got to know
DiCaprio on a trip to Cuba about a year and a half ago. Six months
ago, he became DiCaprio's sole press agent when the actor dismissed
his longtime Los Angeles publicity agent, Cindy Guagente.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunshine's help, DiCaprio, 25, who had no previous record
of lending his name to social issues, began seeking to position
himself as an environmental spokesman about a year ago. He met with
several environmental groups, including the National Resources
Defense Council, before deciding to represent Earth Day. Sunshine
said the movie star's interest in things environmental was neither
sudden nor designed to dignify his image. DiCaprio himself declined
to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo reads more scientific magazines and books than anyone I
know and knows more about global warming than most reporters
covering it,'' Sunshine said. ``I've worked with phonies trying to
use issues to enhance their images, but Leo isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, although DiCaprio's public embrace of
environmentalism did follow some bad press during the making of his
last movie, ``The Beach.'' Ecologists in Thailand protested in
February 1999 that the filmmakers had desecrated a national park.
In an open letter decrying DiCaprio's Earth Day role, posted on an
environmental Web site, envirolink.org, Michael Babcock, an
American visitor to the beach where the movie was made, wrote that
film crews had damaged the root systems that hold sand in place,
and monsoons have subsequently flattened and ``denuded'' the dunes.
(The 20th Century Fox studio, which made the film, maintains the
beach was left in better shape than it was found.)
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes, the national coordinator for the first Earth Day
in 1970, who is also a leader of this year's effort, recalled his
first meeting with DiCaprio last year. ``I flew down to Los Angeles
to meet him at his office and found him both knowledgeable and
passionate,'' he said. ``Since we were looking to reach a new
generation, he seemed a natural fit, and he agreed right at that
meeting to be our chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said he did not worry about image problems the star, who
had his parents with him, might have had. ``I guess if I had any
concerns,'' Hayes said, ``it was that he is the best actor of his
generation, and you always wonder, is this the real thing or
another performance?''
</P>
<P>
   While DiCaprio was signing on with Earth Day and doing an
interview for its Web site (``Buy the same T-shirt worn by Leonardo
DiCaprio''), he and Sunshine approached television networks about
an environmental special. NBC turned them down. But DiCaprio's
friend Chris Cuomo, a correspondent for ``20/20'' on ABC persuaded
his producers to do a one-hour show, with what must have sounded
like a coup: the Hollywood star would chat with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When word of DiCaprio's March 31 interview at the White House
leaked out, ABC News was instantly ridiculed for sending an actor
to do a news reporter's job, with some of the harshest criticism
coming from ABC's Washington bureau. After internal debate, ABC has
decided to use at least some of the 20-minute interview on the 8
p.m. broadcast this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC has a history of bringing the fight, which is why I came
here,'' said Cuomo, the son of the former New York governor Mario
Cuomo. ``Who knew we'd be attacked from the inside?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel tons of guilt about bringing Leonardo in on this,'' he
added. ``He went with me because we are friends, not pal-around,
close friends, but friends, and he felt he'd be protected in a
sense. I think that for him to put up with this _ and he knew he
was going to get a whipping even before we started _ shows how
committed he is to the issue. He did it anyway, even though this
doesn't help him one bit. He's not doing this in a celebrity
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, DiCaprio may decide it's easier to go back to
club-hopping.

   ALLERGY-WEBSITE (New York) _ The proof of the hotness of
respiratory ailments can be found _ and purchased _ at
Gazoontite.com. A Web site and a catalog, not to mention a new
retail store on Broadway near 75th Street, Gazoontite.com sells
everything from $699 Miele vacuum cleaners and hypo-allergenic
comforters covered in 230-thread-count cotton to a rubber Bart
Simpson that fits over an inhaler. Everything for the allergy,
asthma and status-symbol victim. By Rick Marin. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   JEANS-FASHION (New York) _ Jeans are back, and they have left
Woodstock decidedly behind. They are the season's biggest fashion
trend, running the gamut from sequined to studded, dark to light,
hot pants to cropped to full length. The trendiest part of the
trend, dirty denim, reflects the rest of our instant theme park
culture: it has been dirtied for you in advance _ prestained,
preburnt or prepainted. By Alex Witchel. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-KERRIGAN (New York) _ When the Welsh hyphenate
writer-director-actor Justin Kerrigan blew into New York on Sunday
night, the people at Miramax, which is releasing ``Human Traffic,''
his film on the rave scene, must have gone for the Advil. It's not
that Kerrigan, 26, is one of those bad boys who trash hotel rooms.
It's that he's candid about his decadent drug-fueled lifestyle,
which is celebrated in his film. Which means it's pretty
entertaining to meet him flying without a conversational governor
in a bar in Greenwich Village, just off the plane from London, as
he sets out to party through the night. By Linda Lee. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   DIAMOND-JEWELRY (New York) _ While it's true that the diamond
has never gone out of style, this season the ultimate rock _ which
happens to be April's birthstone _ has transcended its own
perennial appeal. Diamond jewelry is so much in vogue that even the
engagement ring has become a fashion item. Once upon a time diamond
rings represented husbands. (Just ask Elizabeth Taylor, who
received both the 33.19-carat Krupp diamond and a 69.42-carat
Cartier rock as gifts from Richard Burton.) But now ``they are
considered not just tokens of affection but accessories,'' said
Anne Slowey, Elle magazine's fashion news director. By Hadley
Davis. &QL;

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Flowering quince is a spectacular
sight in the early spring, with its bare branches covered in waxy,
inch-wide blossoms in shades of rose, red, pink or orangey-red.
There are single, semi-double and fully double flowers, all a
credit to the rose family, to which flowering quince belongs. The
fact that gardeners are willing to devote space to flowering quince
_ and often to several varieties of flowering quince _ is a tip-off
to how spectacular those spring flowers are. By Cass Peterson. &QL;

CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON HMO
APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., this story may update later) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a breakthrough, House and Senate negotiators
said on Friday that they had reached a tentative agreement on an
appeals process for patients denied care by health maintenance
organizations _ a major issue in legislation to define patients'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, patients could obtain ``an independent
medical review'' of any decision in which an HMO denied care or
coverage on the ground that a particular service was not medically
necessary or was experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could also obtain an independent review whenever an HMO
concludes that a particular item or service is ``not a covered
benefit.'' The review might be done by lawyers if it involved only
the interpretation of an insurance contract. But it would have to
be done by doctors if the dispute involved a medical question _
whether, for example, a surgical procedure is purely cosmetic or is
needed to correct a medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks of negotiations, Republicans and Democrats from
the House and the Senate issued a detailed summary of what they
called a ``bipartisan bicameral agreement'' on the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cautioned that it was an agreement in principle, a
conceptual agreement, to be translated into legislative language
over the spring recess, but they confirmed that the conferees had
made substantial progress on one of the most important provisions
of the legislation to define patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three states have laws or regulations that require
managed-care plans to have some type of ``external review''
procedure so patients can challenge a denial of care of coverage.
In general, HMOs, state officials and consumer groups say the
appeal procedures have worked well, ruling for patients in about
half the cases and for insurers in the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say the appeal procedures can raise the standard of
medical care, by requiring doctors to consider the views of outside
experts on whether a particular treatment is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal process, by resolving disputes promptly, can reduce
the need for litigation, consumers and insurers say. The number of
appeals averages one for every 16,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the
conference committee, called the appeals process ``a very
significant provision'' of the patient's bill of rights. He said it
would let patients in ``every employer-sponsored plan in the
country'' _ 125 million people _ have the right to an external
review.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Nickles and liberal Democrats like Sen.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts found they could agree on the
proposition that medical decisions should be made by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky., a member of the conference
committee, described the agreement as ``a major bipartisan
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this agreement, said Fletcher, a family doctor, ``if your
HMO denies the care you need, you will be able to appeal that
decision to ensure that physicians make medical decisions, not
insurance bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets forth a wide range of factors that would have
to be considered by medical reviewers. Specifically, it says, their
decisions shall be based on patient's medical condition and medical
records; ``valid, relevant scientific evidence and clinical
evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature''; and the
consensus of experts on what treatments are appropriate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agreement includes these provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _Patients could appeal if the denial of a benefit poses a
significant risk to a patient's life or health, or if the value of
the benefit exceeds ``a significant threshold,'' to be specified by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   _A patient filing an appeal could be required to pay a $50 fee.
The money would be refunded if the patient prevailed. Low-income
people could have the charge waived.
</P>
<P>
   _The secretary of health and human services would set standards
to make sure reviewers had no conflicts of interest and no
financial incentive to rule in a particular way.

   NEW YORK _ Tree season 2000 is upon us, the harbinger of pollen
counts to come. But I say to you, my fellow allergy and asthma
sufferers, do not be ashamed or embarrassed by your wheezing, runny
noses and rheumy eyes. Own your symptoms! These most geeky of
afflictions are on the verge of becoming chic.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the anti-allergy drug commercials on television.
Blissed-out models with flowers coming out their ears, in some kind
of psychedelic reverie Timothy Leary would have dreamed up if he
had worked on Madison Avenue. Who needs Zoloft and Atavan when
you've got Allegra and Claritin?
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, Teresa Hale of the Hale Clinic in London _ an
alternative medicine center founded by Prince Charles and once
frequented by Diana, Princess of Wales _ will be in New York.
Hale's practitioners will be conducting a three-day, $500 workshop
propounding a wholistic treatment for asthma, through a series of
breathing exercises. A disease has not really arrived until there's
a wholistic cure.
</P>
<P>
   But definitive proof of the hotness of respiratory ailments can
be found _ and purchased _ at Gazoontite.com. A Web site and a
catalog, not to mention a new retail store on Broadway near 75th
Street, Gazoontite.com sells everything from $699 Miele vacuum
cleaners and hypo-allergenic comforters covered in 230-thread-count
cotton to a rubber Bart Simpson that fits over an inhaler.
Everything for the allergy, asthma and status-symbol victim.
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong asthmatic who is allergic to pollen, cats and the
women who love them, I can attest that these have never been
glamorous ailments. And there has always been the suspicion among
less tolerant nonsufferers that all that annoying sneezing and
wheezing is really just psychosomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the embarrassment factor. When I was a young nipper, the
last thing I wanted was for someone to know I got shots or needed
an inhaler, much less catch me sneaking a puff. You don't want to
arm other small boys with that kind of information. This continued
into my 30s. Not long ago, a friend and I were on our way out of
his apartment when my bright yellow Proventil dispenser fell out of
my jacket pocket. We both stared down at where it lay on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, `Afterschool Special' moment,'' he said. It was as if he
had found out I couldn't read.
</P>
<P>
   It amazes me that today's youngsters would want to advertise
their handicap with a rubber Bart Simpson. An article in Spin a few
years ago said rappers were customizing their inhalers, encasing
them in model low-rider cars and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite.com is sort of the same idea, upscaled. The company
started in 1998 in San Francisco. It has stores there and in Costa
Mesa, Calif. The catalog eschews the medicinal, hospital-supply
look of its predecessors in favor of a sleek Pottery Barn effect.
In the sparely modern bedroom on Page 4, the blond-wood Eames chair
and white $160 Honeywell HEPA air purifier are both triumphs of
allergy-friendly design (``avoid upholstered furniture,'' the copy
counsels). Lying on the bed is a washable yellow plush duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our signature duck,'' explained Soon Yu, the company's founder
and chief executive, as he gave me a tour of the 750-square-foot
store. ``He's kind of a noble duck with allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu, 34, has an MBA from Stanford and was a product manager at
Clorox before starting Gazoontite.com. And he has allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to be embarrassed about,'' he said. ``There's no
stigma. We're taking a positive approach with a way you can manage
your lifestyle to act healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked about the sleek, minimal design. The floor and walls are
bamboo plywood, the products presented in simple, uncluttered
display cases. The $99 black Vornado 750 fan somehow looks sexier
here than it does at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $89.99.
</P>
<P>
   Yu told me his creative director came from Swatch. The McCall
Design Group, whose credits include Banana Republic and Pottery
Barn, gave Gazoontite.com its mall-ready in-store architecture.
``It's a cross between the Body Shop and a Brookstone,'' he said.
Focus groups did not recognize the German word when it was spelled
gesundheit and helped determine the name.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, as you may have guessed from the name, plans for
an IPO within a year, Yu said. He rattled off business-plan data.
``There is 20 percent-a-year growth in the air purification
business alone,'' he said. ``And 38 percent of the population has
allergies, versus 20 percent in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   These statistics turn out to be mostly accurate, according to
Dr. Ira Finegold, chief allergist at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital
Center and a past president of the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology. A survey by the college in June 1999 asked
1,004 adults if they had allergies. Of those, 38 percent said yes.
They hadn't necessarily been diagnosed by a doctor, but the figure
was still surprisingly high. ``The figure people used to always
talk about was 20 percent,'' Finegold said.
</P>
<P>
   We think of allergies as an outdoor problem. But in fact, the
more adults and children stay indoors, the doctor said, the more
susceptible they are to the allergens that get trapped inside the
hermetically sealed modern home.
</P>
<P>
   I asked my own allergist, Dr. Arthur M. Lubitz, to examine
Gazoontite.com and give me a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's legit,'' he said, after stopping by the store
last week, with some caveats for allergic emptors. The HEPA (High
Efficiency Particulate Air) purifiers ``do next to nothing'' unless
you have a pet, he said. And changing the filter on a window-unit
air conditioner is as effective a guard against airborne pollens.
Pillow and bed covers, the store's top sellers so far, are useful
if you're allergic to dust mites, but not every allergic person is.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is, I'm jealous,'' he added ruefully.
``Every allergist always says how much money there is in
allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Mayor John Lindsay pledged during his
administration to eliminate ragweed from New York City, but this,
like many such pledges, did not pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get rid of ragweed, and every single person in New
York has a cat,'' Lubitz noted. ``Allergies are an urban disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that urbane.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms will erupt later Saturday from Kansas to
Texas as a dry line, which marks the boundary between very humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the Rockies, is
activated by a potent jet stream disturbance. Large hail, damaging
winds and tornadoes are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, showers and thunderstorms will develop along a
cold front stretching from the western Great Lakes to the central
Plains. Deep in the cold air north of the front, pockets of
generally light snow will likely develop from parts of South Dakota
to the upper peninsula of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture associated with the heavy rain in Florida Friday will
flow into the northern Middle Atlantic states, setting the stage
for moderate to locally heavy rains in parts of Northern Virginia
and the Delmarva Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET TRANSITION
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2.5 inches of rain fell in 90 minutes at Miami
International Airport Friday as heavy showers and thunderstorms
bombarded South Florida. The rain prompted flood advisories for
metropolitan areas of Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. April is the
transition from the dry season in South Florida to the wet one.
While winter is the dry season, occasional cold fronts produce
modest rains. From May to October, frequent thunderstorms
associated with se-breeze fronts and tropical systems bring more
than two-thirds of Miami's annual average rainfall of about 60
inches.

 &HT;    Beowulf: A hero for our time
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is a scene in Woody Allen's 1977
film, ``Annie Hall,'' in which the comedian gives academic advice
to his girlfriend:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take any course where they make you read `Beowulf','' he
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The whole history of ``Beowulf,'' the oldest poem in the English
language, is one of hairbreadth escapes from fire, bombardment,
disdain, neglect, the yawning boredom of undergraduates and the
stony indifference of the English-speaking public. ``Beowulf'' is a
powerful, jagged poem, but it is usually considered too remote, too
outlandish to interest anyone but scholars. The names are
especially confusing: Hrothgar, Hygd, Hygelac, Heorot, Heothalaf,
Hunferth, Hnaef, Hengest and Hildeburh.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's Heaney, and suddenly ``Beowulf'' is back with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney has rescued and
re-created the 3,182-line Anglo-Saxon epic in a powerful new
translation that has soared to 13th place on The New York Times'
best-seller list _ a dizzying success for a book of verse. Heaney's
achievement is to place ``Beowulf'' before the eyes of a mass
audience for the first time in history, without watering it down,
tarting it up or turning it into Ye Olde Englysshe jingles.
</P>
<P>
   There have been approximately 65 English translations of
``Beowulf'' by now, with most students relying on Francis Gummere's
1910 version, or R.K. Gordon's 1926 prose rendition, published by
the Everyman library. Heaney's, put out this year by Farrar Strauss
and Giroux, has a sticker price of $25 but can be had for less than
half that from online booksellers. It has won the prestigious
Whitbread Award in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beowulf'' is available in a comic book version, and in 1976,
author Michael Crichton reworked the story in his ``Eaters of the
Dead,'' recently reissued as ``The 13th Warrior,'' which is
available in video and DVD. But Heaney's version is extraordinary
for its clarity and immediacy. The original Anglo-Saxon text is
printed on facing pages.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney began working on ``Beowulf'' 30 years ago, tried doing 20
lines a day, gave up and put the project aside. Then one day, as he
relates in a thoughtful preface, his memories of Ulster and the
simple gravity of the common, everyday speech in Northern Ireland
made him realize suddenly that he had a special affinity for
Anglo-Saxon poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I am saying is that I consider `Beowulf' to be part of my
voice-right,'' Heaney says.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, `Beowulf' is a poem broken into two parts, which deals
with a hero's battles against three monsters. The first is Grendel,
``a kind of dog-breath in the dark,'' Heaney calls him in his
preface, ``some hard-boned and immensely strong android frame.''
Beowulf waits for Grendel to emerge from his foul fen and raid the
hall, seizes the creature's hand with his own bare hand and _ such
is the strength of his grip _ rips Grendel's hand off. Grendel
flees and bleeds to death.
</P>
<P>
   This arouses the wrath of Grendel's mother, an underwater
creature described in the original Anglo-Saxon as ``merewif,
brimwylf, grundwyrgen,'' (''water-woman, she-wolf of the sea,
accursed she-monster of the deep''). She visits the hall on an
errand of murder, and Beowulf pursues her, plunging underwater to
slay her with a massive sword he finds hanging on the wall of her
lair. So poisonous is her blood that the blade dissolves in it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the third part, which happens 50 years later, the
aging Beowulf confronts a dragon that menaces his people. He and
the ``fire-drake'' kill each other. The poem ends with Beowulf's
funeral pyre, his entombment in a ship within a great mound, and
the keening of the hero's tribeswomen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the work deals with a succession of fantastic
monsters, even though it is written in a high, heroic, allusive
style _ the sea, for example, isn't called ``the sea'' but instead
``the whale path'' _ Heaney insists ``Beowulf'' is a serious,
direct poem that is ``always, paradoxically, buoyantly down to
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The description of the hero's funeral pyre at the end of the
poem, the crackle of the flames, the bursting of his ribs in the
heat, the lamentation of the women ``could come straight from a
late-20th-century news report, from Rwanda or Kosovo,'' Heaney
asserts. They provide ``a nightmare glimpse into the minds of
people who have survived traumatic, even monstrous events and who
are now being exposed to a comfortless future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were disconsolate
</P>
<P>
   and wailed aloud for their lord's decease.
</P>
<P>
   A Geat woman too sang out in grief;
</P>
<P>
   with hair bound up, she unburdened herself
</P>
<P>
   of her worst fears, a wild litany
</P>
<P>
   of nightmare and lament: her nation invaded,
</P>
<P>
   enemies on the rampage, bodies in piles,
</P>
<P>
   slavery and abasement. Heaven swallowed the smoke ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Fire consumes Beowulf, and fire almost consumed the ``Beowulf''
manuscript. The poem is preserved in one single manuscript written
on parchment, the tanned hide of a sheep, about the year 1000. Its
whereabouts for 700 years are unknown. It turns up first in a 1705
catalog of the library of an antiquarian, Sir Robert Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   A disastrous fire broke out in Cotton's library on a winter
evening in 1731, and servants flung smoldering books from the
windows to save them. Much was destroyed, but the ``Beowulf''
manuscript survived, though so grievously charred around the edges
that many words were lost. The fire dried out the parchment, which
crumbled more and more as the years passed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, an inquisitive Danish scholar, G.K. Thorkelin,
traveled to Cotton House in 1787 and made two careful
transcriptions of the manuscript, one in his own hand, the other
commissioned. The burnt edges of the parchment were in somewhat
better condition in Thorkelin's time, and his copies have proved
invaluable to subsequent scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Thorkelin took his copies back to Copenhagen _ where they nearly
perished in a British naval bombardment in 1807, during the
Napoleonic Wars. Thorkelin's translation of the poem perished in
flames, but his two valuable transcriptions of the text survived
and are still in the Royal Library in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The bombardment set Thorkelin back eight years. He had to redo
his translation from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the first published translation of ``Beowulf''
appeared in 1815, not in England, but in Denmark. Nor was it called
``Beowulf.'' Instead, it bore a ponderous Latin title that
signified ``Concerning the History of the Danes, in a poem of the
Danes in the Anglo-Saxon Dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   A facsimile of the manuscript was published in 1882. In 1931,
the precious manuscript was rebound and the parchment leaves inset
in paper to protect their edges. Today, it is in the British
Museum, under glass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the poem remained a curio, dismissed by critics like the
distinguished W.P. Ker, who wrote: ``The fault of `Beowulf' is that
there is nothing much in the story. The hero is occupied in killing
monsters ... It is too simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things happened in the 1930s to turn the tide in
``Beowulf's'' favor. The first was a 1936 essay by J.R.R. Tolkien
(famed today as the author of ``The Lord of the Rings''), called
``Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolkien, who had served at the front in World War I, pointed out
that monstrous evil and random murder were not just things that
lived in a swamp, like Grendel, or at the bottom of a pool, like
Grendel's mother, or atop a hoard of jewels, like the dragon. They
were _ they are _ lurking still on the dark edges of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``Beowulf,'' Tolkien says, ``We look down as if from a
visionary height upon the house of man in the valley of the world.
A light starts ... and there is the sound of music; but the outer
darkness and its hostile offspring lie ever in wait for the torches
to fail and the voices to cease. Grendel is maddened by the sound
of harps.''
</P>
<P>
   The second event was the discovery in 1939 of a vast, rich
ship-burial at Sutton Hoo in Sussex. Armor, a glorious helmet, a
shield, an entire ship dating to the seventh century were excavated
from ancient mounds lying on the property of Edith Pretty, a local
landowner. Suddenly, the age of ``Beowulf'' came brilliantly to
life.
</P>
<P>
   A legal battle followed, over whether the treasures belonged to
the government or to Pretty. If they were a ``treasure-trove,''
buried with the intent to dig them up again some day, they were
forfeit to the government. But if they were buried with no intent
to recover them, then they were not Crown property.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, 1939, a coroner's jury heard testimony that included
a reading from ``Beowulf,'' lines 3156-68, describing how the
hero's burial mound was built and filled with ``rings and jewels
... the wealth of nobles ... gold in the earth, where it still
exists as useless to men as it was before ... ``
</P>
<P>
   The gold wasn't meant to be dug up. It was buried as a mark of
honor. It was meant to be ``useless.'' The jury ruled in Pretty's
favor. The hoard was hers.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Pretty then donated the entire Sutton Hoo trove to the
British Museum, where it can still be seen today.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney's translation is another leap forward for ``Beowulf.''
The translator confesses his especial love for the lines describing
the great hall of Heorot, where there are the echoes of
</P>
<P>
   `` ... the harp being struck
</P>
<P>
   and the clear song of a skilled poet
</P>
<P>
   telling with mastery of man's beginnings,
</P>
<P>
   How the Almighty had made the earth
</P>
<P>
   a gleaming plain girdled with waters;
</P>
<P>
   in His splendour he set the sun and the moon
</P>
<P>
   to be earth's lamplight, lanterns for men,
</P>
<P>
   and filled the broad lap of the world
</P>
<P>
   with branches and leaves; and quickened life
</P>
<P>
   in every other thing that moved ... ``
</P>
<P>
   All of which Grendel hears, and hates: Roused by the music, the
monster wends his way in darkness, toward the bright hall.

 &HT;    Idealistic composer bridges `Distance' by performing live
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you've written one of the most
enduring pop songs of the past couple of decades, what can you
possibly do for a follow-up?
</P>
<P>
   For Julie Gold, the composer and lyricist of ``From a
Distance,'' there's only one answer: You start singing it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 44-year-old Gold isn't grateful to Bette Midler for
her hit rendition _ or to the countless other artists who have
claimed the song for themselves. It's just that Gold has her own
particular idea about how to perform ``From a Distance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it exactly the way I wrote it,'' she says of her simple,
declarative approach, speaking by phone from her New York home.
``It never gets tired or old for me. It's like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the story of the song's genesis speaks to the very
heavenly ideals behind it. Although Gold, a Philadelphia native
reared in a Jewish home, insists she never attached any religious
significance to the words _ ``Writing about God is easy and normal
for me. It's the same as writing about love or a flower,'' she says
_ she admits there had to be a bit of divine inspiration. At the
time she composed it in 1986, she was a struggling songwriter,
paying the rent through odd jobs as a secretary, waiting for her
big break. To help her along, her parents agreed to ship her
childhood piano to her Manhattan apartment to replace the cheap
electronic keyboard she had been using. A day after it arrived _
she was warned by the movers to let the instrument rest _ she wrote
``From a Distance'' in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just poured out of me,'' Gold recalls. ``It had been
ruminating inside of me for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The song was not an easy sell at first. Gold got a handful of
rejections from various publishing houses and artists _ and has
hanging in her apartment the pitch letter she sent to Midler that
initially went ignored. The first to finally claim it was
country-folk singer Nanci Griffith. In 1990, when a still
struggling Gold was getting by with financial support from her
parents, Midler's people finally called.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the single sold more than one million copies and
earned Gold the Grammy for ``Song of the Year.'' The songwriter,
who still didn't expect Midler's name to guarantee a place for
``From a Distance'' on the top of the charts, describes the
phenomenon like this: ``It really burned its way through the heart
and soul of humanity.'' To the dismay of Gold, an ardent pacifist,
the song was even used as a rallying cry for the American troops in
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Gold was able to devote herself to music full time after the
success of ``From a Distance.'' Although she's never had another
song achieve the same degree of commercial recognition, her music
has been performed by artists ranging from R&AMP;B diva Patti LaBelle
to Broadway star Lea Salonga to chanteuse Andrea Marcovicci. But
the focus of Gold's work in the past decade has been on performing.
She's developed her own cabaret show, appeared as a member of the
singer-songwriter revue Four Bitchin' Babes and recorded an album,
``Dream Loud,'' of 12 of her songs, including, ``From a Distance.''
(Her version, by the way, will easily make you forget everyone
else's.) A second album is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, whose musical influences range from classical to Broadway
to '60s rock, admits her lyrical style, both as a singer and
songwriter, is out of fashion in today's musical scene. Her
compositions range from a gentle musing on her mother's struggle as
an immigrant (``Goodnight, New York'') to a charged ballad that
touches upon recent political events (``Tiger in New Jersey''). Her
belief is in the power of the song, not the sales figures. ``The
joy is in the birthing process,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Gold do when she finishes giving ``birth'' to a
song? ``I kiss the keys and I say, `Thank you, God,''' she says.

 &HT;    King monument lacks 2 key words
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A handsome black granite monument
dedicated last week honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and makes
West Palm Beach a far better place.
</P>
<P>
   But the monument's inscription omits, arguably the two most
important words in King's life: The Reverend. Unfortunately, that
badly serves the man and the source of his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Most people today know that King was a clergyman. Future
generations may not. Doctor is an academic title. The Reverend is a
title of commitment, discipline and promise.
</P>
<P>
   King's gift to us is rooted in Christian ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He did represent a legion of cultural symbols. He was, among
other hot-button icons of the '60s, an outspoken Southern black
man, Baptist preacher, civil rights leader and practitioner of
nonviolent protest.
</P>
<P>
   But King fundamentally was a man of God, a disciple of Christ,
rooted in the grand heritage of thundering Old Testament prophets.
They proved that the pen is greater than the sword. King's words
did the same and will endure as his greatest monument.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming granite wall at the north end of Currie Park
overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway on Flagler Drive is a
marvelous addition to both the landscape and the spirit of West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   It was dedicated Saturday, April 8, to mark the 32nd anniversary
of King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Prophets are often victims of violent death. They speak a
simple, unsettling truth that can neither be denied nor embraced by
those who would preserve an unjust status quo. So most prophets are
killed.
</P>
<P>
   King, convinced he was called to the terrifying task of speaking
God's word, did so in the mold of classic Hebrew prophets such as
Isaiah and Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   Most prophets, King included, generally make only two points.
</P>
<P>
   They condemn, in the name of God, flagrant injustice they see
taken for granted in a self-satisfied society. They point out
glaring contradictions between a people's words and their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew prophets called Israel to account for honoring the God of
the poor while trampling the poor underfoot. King exposed, as few
had, the blatant racial inequalities abroad in a land that claimed
all men were created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Prophets then offer hope. Hebrew prophets told a chastened
nation that God would act to bring new life to Israel. Christians
claim God did that in the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   King's hope was a dream of brotherhood, equality and peace among
all races. He denounced injustice and gave us promise in the name
of a righteous and compassionate God.
</P>
<P>
   This giant of a man is better remembered as The Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ancient times, when I was a teen-ager, parents had
two perennial questions: ``When are you going to cut that hair?''
and ``When are you going to wash those jeans?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never'' was the usual answer to both, though mothers had a
sneaky way of absconding with the jeans while we overslept,
answering wailed complaints with comments like ``They were so dirty
they could stand up without you.'' The fact that the pants had
molded perfectly to your imperfect body after long weeks of wear,
that the dusty, ragged hems had to be that way because everyone's
were, that each day of adolescent angst was so traumatizing that
just putting them on in the morning offered the same solace that
slippers did at night _ none of that seemed to matter.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help remembering those times last week as I stood at
the Denim Bar at Barneys New York with Megan Mitchell, the
department's buyer. It seems that while I was sleeping, I missed
more than the laundry. Jeans are back, and they have left Woodstock
decidedly behind. They are the season's biggest fashion trend,
running the gamut from sequined to studded, dark to light, hot
pants to cropped to full length.
</P>
<P>
   The trendiest part of the trend, dirty denim, reflects the rest
of our instant theme park culture: it has been dirtied for you in
advance _ prestained, preburnt or prepainted. After all, with
trends moving so fast, who has time to wear them in?
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of despairing when you see white pull marks shoot
across your thighs, you must rejoice. It's not that you're too fat;
the manufacturer has ``whiskered'' the pants for you. Hems, pockets
and waistlines are ripped and frayed _ distressed is the fancy word
for it. At $195, you can buy a pair of pants that look as if you've
been road-tripping with Thelma and Louise, coated triumphantly in
dust. No longer do you own jeans forever and fondly remember when.
The manufacturer has gotten there first, and retailers say they
can't keep the product on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been building up to this,'' Mitchell said. ``We've
noticed increased sales in denim during the last few seasons. Denim
is comfortable, it comes in a variety of fits, people especially
like stretch denim, and you can dress it up or down.''
</P>
<P>
   Why dirty? ``It's just another way to express yourself in
denim,'' she said with the placid acceptance of the absurd that all
successful fashion executives employ. ``It looks newer to me. We
had dark denim a couple of years ago. Now we need another option.''
She also said that denim's versatility _ mixing and matching it,
dirty or otherwise, with beaded tops or ostrich skirts _ adds to
its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell could only describe the paint-spattered and burnt
jeans, however: they had already sold out. The stained jeans were
still available, by Helmut Lang in black ($162) and blue ($195).
There were also Anna Sui jeans, cropped and full length with an
antique wash (sort of faded), that were studded and decorated with
sparkles for $435.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just pocket change compared with Bergdorf's. There,
you can take your jeans to J. Mendel, its in-house furrier, which
will rework them with sable or mink trims for $2,350 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Herman, the owner of Ron Herman at Fred Segal Melrose in
Beverly Hills, who has been selling cutting-edge jeans since 1970,
dismisses the dirty denim trend as ``a meaningless, superficial,
insignificant flash in the pan.'' His store would never stoop to
dirty denim, he said, only authentic vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Less incensed was Jack Markus, the owner of Cheap Jack's, the
used clothing mecca on Broadway. Genuinely ``dirty'' jeans sell
there for $19 to $60. ``In the mid-'80s I used to slice up the
jeans, rip, dye and patch them,'' Markus said. ``The worse they
looked, the better they liked them. Designers always follow street
fashion, and street fashion starts when there's too much of
something that people can buy for cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   With this wisdom in mind, I went to Intermix on Madison Avenue.
Debbie Baron Rosen manages this boutique, where Helmut Lang dirty
jeans sell for $189 ($6 less than at Barneys), and when I cited
high school visits to the Army Navy for $25 jeans, her look was as
dirty as the denim. ``Have you been shopping lately?'' she asked
sharply, dumping me in the dressing room as an assistant informed
her that someone from a public relations firm was out front. First
though, she quickly assessed my behind in the jeans (the length was
ridiculous, way too long) and nodded approvingly. ``If you find a
pair of jeans that fit well, you pay anything,'' she advised.
``Everybody has jeans. People want to look different somehow, and
these are a great fit and make your legs look long.''
</P>
<P>
   How six inches of extra material flapping around my ankles made
my legs look long was not a subject she wanted to pursue, and she
took off for the greener pastures of pulling clothes for an unnamed
celebrity client while her representative squealed appreciatively
at every tank top that was presented.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at some denim dresses with embroidered hems and a denim
bandeau top with matching skirt and tried on a $138 Earl Jeans
jacket, which I had no interest in buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't faint from the prices!'' Baron Rosen called as I left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha, ha, I waved back. What did I expect, shopping for jeans
on Madison Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, I found a simpatico soul in Michael Macko,
its publicity manager, who had pulled some dirty denim pieces for
me to borrow for the weekend. Two things fit: a Helmut Lang jacket
for $350 and a DKNY cropped shirt with three-quarter sleeves for
$125. Both looked reasonably filthy, though because of the shirt's
sleek cut, the dissonant effect was more pronounced. I decided I
would wear it out for a night of cocktails, theater and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As Macko wrapped them up and answered my smart-alecky question
about how to wash dirty denim to keep it dirty (in the washing
machine _ the dye won't come out), he explained denim's appeal in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denim nowadays is all about what you can do to make it look
different,'' he said. ``It all started with Gucci when Tom Ford did
beaded and feathered jeans. We're seeing a lot of studs lately,
too; Dolce &AMP; Gabbana has studded denim bustiers.'' He stopped to
inhale with alarm at a hapless, middle-aged woman, trying on an
enormous denim ball skirt.
</P>
<P>
   He turned away hurriedly, as if to wipe the image from his mind.
``Denim is a basic fabric now,'' he continued. ``We have denim
halter dresses and hot pants, even denim hair accessories. Stila
makes a denim makeup collection in shades of blue and the packaging
looks like denim. Denim is the great equalizer, a common
denominator, a great fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sold, all the way until I got dressed to go out that
Sunday night. I had matched the DKNY top with a straight black
skirt and black boots, and started to worry that I might be too
underdressed for a cocktail party celebrating ``Now This,'' the new
book by Judy Muller, an ABC correspondent. But even though the help
was dressed better than I was, no one looked askance at my outfit,
and I made it to the Manhattan Theater Club ego intact. In that
crowd, I was certainly no more underdressed than anyone else, and
during intermission I realized why no one I encountered had
registered the impact of this latest fashion trend: they were all
my age or older and had all grown up with the same dirty jeans, the
same long hair, the same nagging parents I had. Dirty denim wasn't
new and exciting to them. It was old and familiar. They all had the
same stuff at home. Whether it still fit them or not.
</P>
<P>
   That must be what makes a trend, I thought, taking my seat for
the second act. You have to be young enough to believe that it's
new.

PLANTS THAT SPEAK FOR THEIR SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 16)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nature puts no particular premium on perfection _ least of all
as it's defined by gardeners _ so it should not count against
flowering quince and beautyberry that they are essentially
one-season plants.
</P>
<P>
   Trees aside, there aren't many outdoor plants that can be truly
called all-season ornamentals. Blueberry bushes, maybe, and
hollies. Russian sage comes close. Most other ornamental plants
look gorgeous for a brief period each year and then fade drably
into the background. Even evergreens get the blahs in midwinter,
when they look good only because the alternative is no green at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Consider forsythia. For a few weeks in early March (or a little
earlier or later, depending on latitude and the severity of
winter), forsythia is a fountain of gold to gladden the heart _
assuming that it hasn't been sheared into a fat gumdrop shape in
some misguided attempt at tidiness. The rest of the year, forsythia
is at best a humdrum bush, green but otherwise nondescript.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, I itch to rip out the forsythia bushes and replace
them with something that has more oomph. But I don't. I just prune
out about a third of their tangled branches and ignore the boring
green blobs until the following March, when I am very happy to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with flowering quince. It's a spectacular sight in the
early spring, with its bare branches covered in waxy, inch-wide
blossoms in shades of rose, red, pink or orangey-red. There are
single, semi-double and fully double flowers, all a credit to the
rose family, to which flowering quince belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Out of bloom, though, a flowering quince is just a leafy, thorny
thing in the yard. The fact that gardeners are willing to devote
space to flowering quince _ and often to several varieties of
flowering quince _ is a tip-off to how spectacular those spring
flowers are.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes flowering quince will set a few hard, greenish fruits.
The fruit isn't much to look at, but it makes good jam and it
smells nice. Some gardeners put quinces in the linen closet to
scent the sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Some varieties can grow to 10 feet, but quinces grow so slowly
that they're even favored by bonsai enthusiasts. A small plant will
take 10 years to grow 3 or 4 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivars or hybrids of Chaenomeles japonica, or Maule's quince,
(known in the South as Japonica bush) are naturally dwarf. But the
taller C. speciosa varieties offer a broader range of flower
colors, and you can prune the shrub at any time of year to keep it
the height you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Beautyberry wisely squanders its single season of splendor in
the autumn. Spring is already overcrowded with splashy
short-timers. Beautyberry can also grow to 10 feet, with foliage
that is pleasant but not showstopping. Its summer flowers are so
tiny you practically have to squint to see them.
</P>
<P>
   But in autumn, it bears fat clusters of shiny berries in a
preposterous shade of metallic lavender. Hence, its genus name,
Callicarpa, from the Greek kallos (beauty) and karpos (fruit). The
berries would probably last well into the winter, making
beautyberry a two-season or at least a season-and-a-half plant, but
what I don't cut for flower arrangements the birds eat.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, flowering quince is the tougher plant. It is hardy
into New England and is often described as carefree. That means it
isn't fussy about soil conditions and, once established in a sunny
spot, will survive even if you never get around to watering,
fertilizing or pruning it.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, very easy to ignore flowering quince once it's
done blooming, but you will get more of the lovely spring flowers
if you prune lightly every year to encourage the growth of new
wood. Flowers appear only on new growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of fabulous cultivars. Jet Trail has snowy
white flowers, Texas Scarlet is bright red and Cameo is a lovely
salmon, the most common color of flowering quince. Apple Blossom
has white flowers that age to pale pink, and Simonii has dark red
blossoms. Winter Cheer, one of the earliest quinces to bloom, has
scarlet flowers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad idea to buy quinces in bloom. Unlike some
flowering plants, they don't require stressful forcing to be in
bloom during the prime spring sales season. So the plants you see
in garden centers will probably be blooming at their natural time,
and you'll get a chance to see what the flowers look like.
</P>
<P>
   Beautyberry, in the verbena family, is a little less hardy than
flowering quince. It will survive and bear fruit as far north as
Boston, but gardeners in colder areas will need to put it in a
protected spot and mulch it. It likes sun or a partly shady area
and is ideal under trees like locusts that don't cast impenetrable
shade.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, and as far west as Oklahoma, the beautyberry
species C. americana grows wild on roadsides and at the edge of
woodlands. C. americana boasts large berries, but it is tall and
rangy-looking. Nurseries more commonly offer the species C.
dichotoma, a shorter plant that rarely grows taller than about 4
feet.
</P>
<P>
   I've grown C. dichotoma successfully in a perennial border,
cutting it back to the ground each winter and letting it sprout
anew in the spring. It's quite at home with the herbaceous
perennials, most of them also plants that attract little attention
outside their prime season.
</P>
<P>
   When the right moment arrives, they perform their roles
flawlessly, which might be nature's definition of perfection and
ought to be mine as well.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms will erupt later Saturday from Kansas to
Texas as a dry line, which marks the boundary between very humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the Rockies, is
activated by a potent jet stream disturbance. Large hail, damaging
winds and tornadoes are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, showers and thunderstorms will develop along a
cold front stretching from the western Great Lakes to the central
Plains. Deep in the cold air north of the front, pockets of
generally light snow will likely develop from parts of South Dakota
to the upper peninsula of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture associated with the heavy rain in Florida Friday will
flow into the northern Middle Atlantic states, setting the stage
for moderate to locally heavy rains in parts of Northern Virginia
and the Delmarva Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET TRANSITION
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2.5 inches of rain fell in 90 minutes at Miami
International Airport Friday as heavy showers and thunderstorms
bombarded South Florida. The rain prompted flood advisories for
metropolitan areas of Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. April is the
transition from the dry season in South Florida to the wet one.
While winter is the dry season, occasional cold fronts produce
modest rains. From May to October, frequent thunderstorms
associated with sea-breeze fronts and tropical systems bring more
than two-thirds of Miami's annual average rainfall of about 60
inches.

BRITISH CONSORTIUM MAKES COUNTERBID FOR ROVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ BMW AG of Germany said Friday it had received a
counterbid for its money-losing Rover division from a British
consortium seeking to rescue the Rover name and thwart plans by the
venture capitalist firm Alchemy Partners to turn the company into a
niche producer.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's most prominent member is John Towers, a former
chief executive of Rover in the early days of its ownership by BMW,
which bought the company for $1.2 billion six years ago in what
became a nightmare investment of losses. Last year Rover lost $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Towers, Rover's chief executive from 1994 to 1996, did not
return calls to his business headquarters in the English Midlands,
where he runs a privately held components company called
Concentric. The consortium is thought to include Rover dealers and
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Juerg Dinner, a BMW spokesman in Munich, said Towers'
bid was received Friday _ just days after an exploratory meeting
between Towers and BMW executives _ and would be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner indicated that the new bid _ for which no financial
details were immediately available _ was for the same troubled
Rover plant at Longbridge near Birmingham as last month's bid by
London-based Alchemy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy has said that it plans to phase out the Rover brand,
with thousands of job losses, and begin producing a much smaller
number of sporty sedans under the MG name.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW spokesman said exclusive negotiations with Alchemy were
expected to end soon. ``If the new bid has substance, we may
discuss it after the conclusion of the Alchemy negotiations,''
Dinner said. Some German analysts, however, suggested that the
counter-bid had only limited chances of success because BMW's
negotiations with Alchemy were so far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   BMW was said by people with knowledge of the Alchemy deal to
have offered the Longbridge plant to Alchemy at virtual fire-sale
prices, free of debt and with net assets valued at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   News of Alchemy's plans for job reductions sent shock-waves
through the plant's 9,000-employee work-force and provoked a bitter
spat between BMW and the British government. It also spurred the
government to offer a $203 million aid package for the region
around Longbridge, where tens of thousands of jobs in the supply
industry depend on the the auto plant.
</P>
<P>
   British officials made no secret of their approval for the
counter-bid, but said there was no direct government involvement in
it. They also said they believed the bid would extend Rover's life
as a mass volume automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, Britain's trade and industry minister, said
Towers' proposals for the Longbridge plant ``offers a better
prospect than perhaps anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Nagle, a spokeswoman for Byers, said the British
government had always said it would prefer Rover to remain as a
volume car-producer. She said the British government would consider
supporting Rover financially if Towers' bid were successful.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   British newspapers have reported that Towers wants to use the
Longbridge plant to manufacture a new, midrange Rover car _ the R30
_ and to take over production of a revamped Mini car which BMW had
planned to keep on producing itself. BMW's deal with Alchemy last
month was combined with a separate agreement to sell the Land Rover
sport utility vehicle division to Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alchemy said the company had no direct knowledge
of the counter-bid and planned to conclude its negotiations with
BMW by the end of April. Reflecting investors' worries that the
counter-bid could slow BMW's disposal of Rover, BMW shares fell 1.2
euros, or 3.74 percent, to close at 30.9 euros in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry analysts said, the consortium could need to come
up with an offer of around $1.3 billion to take over the R30 and
the Mini from BMW. But there was no immediate confirmation of this
from either BMW or the consortium.

ANTI-MILOSEVIC RALLY DRAWS 100,000 TO DEMAND EARLY ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ At least 100,000 people jammed sunny
central Belgrade Friday for an opposition rally demanding early
elections to oust the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first opposition rally in many months, and the first
since 1997 that brought together the two rival leaders of the main
opposition parties, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement
and Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, who even shook hands on
stage, although gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric from the various political leaders was sometimes
uninspiring, and they provided no clear strategy to bring about
early elections on all levels, which the traditionally fractured
opposition has agreed upon as its goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the real message to Milosevic came less from the speakers
than from the size of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout, which some estimated at 150,000, will be registered
by Milosevic, who said in mid-February that Serbia did not have ``a
real opposition'' but only traitorous politicians in the pay of the
same Western countries that bombed this country a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it will also oblige the opposition, which will take heart
from the size of the crowd, to work harder not to dissipate this
new energy and superficial unity in further squabbling and
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major public speech since August, Draskovic caught
the mood of the crowd when he said he knew why they had come in
such numbers. ``It's because the life we are leading is not a life
any more, because we are being killed, beaten, arrested, because we
live in misery, humiliation and sorrow,'' he said. He then listed a
catalog of ills from high emigration and unemployment to a low
birthrate, the loss of Kosovo and attacks on the opposition and the
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his ``gang of killers'' is ``the only chief of
state in the world who calls more than half of his people
enemies,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic told the crowd that the whole country was watching and
asking, ``Are we united enough to carry out change? And we will
answer: `Join us and we will be united enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   No speaker gave the listeners any notion of what they could do
except vote when the time comes. But for some of those who came
Friday, the rally itself was motivation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 54 and I cannot live off my salary,'' said Dragan Vujacic.
``The electricity bill is half my salary and food takes the other
half, and my wife can't find a job and I've got two kids. I've been
working for 25 years and I have a salary of 100 German marks,''
about $55 a month. He continued: ``I'm here to change something. I
don't want my kids to live abroad or be married to foreigners and
my grandchildren speaking a foreign language. I want to live
normally in my Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragisa Jovkovic, 27, who trained as a psychologist but works as
a secretary, said she came ``to give my support to the people who
want a better life.'' The opposition had problems of credibility,
she said. ``But I know for sure who I am against, even if I'm not
sure who I am for. And now, that's enough. It would be very hard
for someone to be worse than these authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers, like the centrist Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate
nationalist who appeals to some disaffected Milosevic supporters,
spoke about restoring dignity and limits to the state. ``When we
win, our mandate will be limited and our power controlled,'' he
said. ``That is democracy. Democracy is not absolute power. Only
Serbia is forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he decried the regime's division of people into
patriots and traitors. ``These patriots destroyed our country and
made countries for the others,'' he said, in a clear reference to
the dissolution of Yugoslavia. ``Slobodan Milosevic has done the
worst thing to his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, Kostunica said he had been wary of this rally,
worried that the opposition had too little concrete information to
offer. ``We've had more rallies than any country in Eastern Europe
and less change,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Dragoljub Micunovic noted that 10 years ago, he and
Draskovic organized the first major rally on this same square,
Nenad Stefanovic, a reporter with the weekly magazine Vreme, said,
``This is rather sad proof of 10 years without success.'' While the
opposition would gain some momentum from Friday, he said, ``they
are also quite capable of wasting all that energy again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milan Milosevic, an analyst for Vreme and no relation to the
Yugoslav president, said the rally will force the government to
take the opposition more seriously, while encouraging the
opposition to press harder for early elections in Serbia. Elections
are not due now until at least the summer or fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections are due sometime before the end of this year,
most probably in the fall, but the opposition already controls the
big cities and towns, and their outcome will have little impact on
Milosevic's hold on power. His term as Yugoslav president does not
expire until the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition hopes that a sizable victory in the Serbian
elections will crack the regime and bring Milosevic, who cares for
legal niceties, to hand over power. But Milan Milosevic said that
as head of the largest party in the country, Milosevic would retain
significant power over politics and business, and would probably be
able to negotiate some protection for himself and his family, in
the style of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, from any new
government.
</P>
<P>
   While the police were watchful, there were no incidents Friday.
The government did try to keep the size of the rally down, however,
blocking some busses from entering Belgrade. More effective,
perhaps, was the well-advertised decision by the state-owned
Television Politika to show a non-stop schedule of brand-new movies
not yet released here, including Oscar-winner ``American Beauty,''
``The Matrix'' and the latest James Bond film.
</P>
<P>
   Live coverage of the rally on the television station Draskovic
controls, Studio B, was partially jammed, the station said. Studio
B, which usually covers Draskovic as state-controlled television
covers Milosevic, has been pressed by Washington and the West to be
more open to the views of other opposition leaders.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nissan, having struggled in recent years to carve out its place
in the sun, has landed on a formula that has long worked with
consumer products from toothpaste to dishwashing soap: new,
improved and more.
</P>
<P>
   With every model it has introduced in the past two years, from
the compact Altima to the mid-size Maxima to the Pathfinder sport
utility, Nissan has offered a much-improved car or truck over the
previous one. In general, those vehicles have delivered more space,
more power, more substance and more features than the earlier
generation. While that recipe is typical of all automakers today,
Nissan has thrown in another ingredient: to be tops in horsepower
performance within the class.
</P>
<P>
   The latest model to adopt the more- is-more formula is the
entry-level Sentra, which began arriving in dealerships in
February. Indeed, the Sentra has moved from its previous life as an
econobox to a refined small car that has more room, more power and
more features than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   After a pleasant weeklong test drive of the sporty,
top-of-the-line Sentra SE, however, I wondered if more would be
enough in the intensely competitive small-car market.
</P>
<P>
   The Sentra is up against a large and expanding list of
competitors in a market that has been in a slump for nearly three
years. There are the usual suspects: Chevrolet Cavalier and Prizm,
Dodge Neon, Mazda Protege, Mitsubishi Mirage and Ford Escort, to
name only a few. In addition, some innovative new contenders have
cropped up, like the cute Volkswagen Beetle, the flashy Ford Focus,
the funky Toyota Echo with its under $10,000 sticker price, and
even, it could be argued, the retro-looking Chrysler PT Cruiser
just hitting the market. To top it off, Honda will redesign its
segment-leading Civic later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan says the 2000 model is the first Sentra designed
exclusively for North America. The new Sentra appears more ample
than its predecessor. Its body has been stretched by more than six
inches, widened by almost an inch and its height raised an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Its beefier, raised back end gives the impression that this car
has substance. Still, the Sentra, compared with the Focus or the
Beetle, is bland. No one will call it ugly, but no one will turn to
take a look either.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sentra is also more substantial inside. The chassis has
been bulked up for improved ride and handling and enhanced
crashworthiness. Nissan engineers say the side-to-side rigidity of
the vehicle has been increased by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While I couldn't measure it, I could certainly feel it. I
distinctly recall my last test drive of the previous-generation
Sentra. I was suburb-bound on one of Detroit's heavily traveled and
well-worn freeways. Driving the Sentra was downright scary. It felt
tinny and vulnerable in the rush-hour traffic, with which it could
not keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the new Sentra is roomier than its predecessor
by more than two cubic feet. In fact, it has moved up a class from
subcompact to compact, according to Environmental Protection Agency
classifications. The interior was a collaborative effort of
Nissan's worldwide design offices led by its European studio.
</P>
<P>
   Materials, including the seat cloth, appeared to be of higher
quality than the previous model, which had a rental-car feel.
Storage compartments, including an odd one that lifts open on the
center dash, have been added to the cabin. The front seats were
raised slightly to make it easier to climb in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The Sentra comes as the base XE, mid-level GXE and
top-of-the-line SE as well as the environmentally friendly CA. Side
air bags and anti-lock brakes are available on the GXE and SE for
$699 in the same option package. The SE also adds four-wheel disc
brakes, instead of the front disc and rear drum combination of the
other models.
</P>
<P>
   The front-wheel-drive Sentra offers a choice of two twin-cam,
four-cylinder engines. One is 1.8 liters rated at 126 horsepower;
the other is 2 liters at 145 horsepower, 5 more than on the
previous version. A five-speed manual transmission is standard; a
four-speed automatic is optional.
</P>
<P>
   The tested Sentra SE was outfitted with the larger engine and
the manual transmission. This fun-to-drive package would be my
choice, though I haven't driven the other versions, and, at
$16,397, it would likely would not fit the budgets of many
small-car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sentra SE reminded me of the Dodge Neon. The peppy engine,
among the top in its class for horsepower, provided confidence for
merging onto freeways, passing on the highway and darting in and
out of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Even the noise level reminded me of the Neon. While not quite as
noisy as the raucous Neon, the Sentra, despite the claims of Nissan
engineers to the contrary, it did not seem nearly as quiet as the
Toyota Corolla and its twin, the Chevrolet Prizm. The noise was not
from the engine but from the road. It resonated rather loudly
throughout the interior cabin on Michigan's choppiest freeway
pavements. I also wondered while driving on the rough asphalt if
the suspension was tuned too firmly for mainstream buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the added horsepower, the Sentra still achieves
respectable fuel economy, ranging up to nearly 30 miles per gallon
on the highway in some versions.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Sentra does not have more of is price. A goal of
the Sentra development program was to reduce the cost to design,
engineer and build the car so the savings could be put into
features the customer notices. To that end, the Sentra's basic
architecture will be shared with six other models sold in Europe
and Japan, with more variations in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Sentras intended for the United States market
are being assembled in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where wages are low,
instead of in Smyrna, Tenn., where it was previously built.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the basic Sentra starts at $12,169, including
delivery charges, about $150 less than its predecessor; the Sentra
SE starts at $16,219.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the new Sentra, with its increased roominess, higher
horsepower and more substantial styling, is a competent contender
among small cars. But it lacks a hook, a necessary ingredient even
among the industry's lowest-priced vehicles. &QL;

`DAVID COPPERFIELD': ABUSED CHILD LUCKS OUT DICKENS-STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Copperfield's world, as envisioned in the new
``Masterpiece Theater'' treatment of the Dickens classic, is
louder, earthier, more vivid than life as we know it. Whiskers and
sideburns defy laws of gravity and grooming. Canes make a noise
reminiscent of a Concorde at takeoff as they whoosh toward young
knuckles or backsides. Faces are rounder and ruddier than any
today; food must be chewed longer and more ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Such tidbits suggest both the delights and the dangers of trying
to put ``David Copperfield'' on film. The story is so full of
detail and eccentric characters that it begs to be played to the
hilt, but those same attributes give it a sort of gravitational
pull that constantly tries to drag everyone over the line into
cartoonish caricature.
</P>
<P>
   In this two-part rendition, to be broadcast Sunday and Monday on
PBS, the director Simon Curtis does an admirable job of not letting
his big-name cast get sucked into the forbidden zone, or at least
not for very long.
</P>
<P>
   In ``David Copperfield'' Dickens mixed a bit of autobiography,
splashes of high humor and a lot of melodrama to tell the tale of a
boy who bounces from an abusive stepfather to a nightmarish
boarding school to a sweatshop to, finally, a peaceful adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people David meets along the way would fit
comfortably into ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' beginning
with his donkey-despising great aunt, Betsey Trotwood, played to
delightful perfection by Dame Maggie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McNeice needs almost no dialogue to capture the daffiness of
Mr. Dick, Betsey's not-quite-all-there companion, and Bob Hoskins
seems unencumbered by the ghost of W.C. Fields as he dives
enthusiastically into the role of David's verbose friend Mr.
Micawber, which Fields played in the 1935 film version.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this ``Copperfield,'' while enjoying the novel's frivolity,
is far from frivolous. Murdstone, David's stepfather, is played so
darkly by Trevor Eve that young viewers, and a few older ones,
might find themselves cringing right along with David. And when the
boy, trying to stave off a beating, gives Murdstone's finger the
bite that gets him banished to boarding school and sets all else in
motion, it is no casual nip.
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest scenes, Curtis makes clear that he means to
give Dickens' light and dark sides equally unflinching treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His actors join that spirit, creating characterizations that
linger long after the closing credits. Some may overindulge _ Ian
McKellen's Creakle, the cold schoolmaster, is almost distractingly
unbalanced, and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the distasteful Uriah Heep at
times lets his expressive eyes do a little too much talking.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance the roles are full without becoming foolish.
Pauline Quirke as Peggotty, the beloved nanny, and Amanda Ryan as
Agnes, David's soul mate, both find the power in their
comparatively quiet _ and normal _ characters.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the character who makes the least impression is
Copperfield himself, both as a boy (Daniel Radcliffe) and as a
young man (Ciaran McMenamin). But David Copperfield is a person
things happen to more than he is a person who makes things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to streamline a novel as sprawling as ``David
Copperfield'' for television, even two parts' worth of television,
of course involves choices, and analyzing the ones that went into
this production could make for a lively discussion among Dickens
devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, for instance, might propose this rule for future
adaptations: Never add; only subtract. The proof is a stagecoach
ride that features a gluttonous passenger who munches an impossibly
huge leg of _ well, what? Ostrich? It is a drumstick that looks as
if it came from the Monty Python prop closet, and it probably
should have stayed there. In the novel, the coach passengers are
napping.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the power of subtraction, chillingly
demonstrated in an early scene. Murdstone and David's mother
(Emilia Fox) are arguing, and back talk was obviously not something
Murdstone expected from his new wife. In the novel, he tells David,
``As this is not a fit scene for the boy _ David, go to bed,'' a
line that could be read with varying severity. But Eve truncates it
to a cold command, delivered as he levels a look of pure fury at
his wife: ``David, go to bed.'' There is little doubt what awaits
the woman once the boy is out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Subtraction doesn't always work so well. In this production,
David's early friendship with his schoolmate Steerforth is reduced
to a fleeting encounter, though their relationship will be central
later. But it is a forgivable gap in an otherwise rich and
rewarding treatment.

   Fundamentals To the Rescue? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the latest leg of the technology route left many
of the sector's longtime bulls scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   After all, last week's plunge came just as most United States
companies were preparing to report first-quarter earnings, which by
all accounts are likely to be spectacular. And ``confession
season,'' the period at the end of every quarter when companies
whose earnings will fall short of expectations disclose the bad
news to Wall Street, ended without much pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now the good news is beginning to flood out, as company after
company soundly beats sell-side analysts' expectations (a process
made easier when analysts cooperate with the companies they cover
to set profit estimates a few pennies a share below the companies'
internal projections). Many technology companies are expected to
report year-over-year profit growth of 30 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be another record-breaking quarter as
earnings go,'' said Joseph Kalinowski, equity strategist for IBES,
which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   All this has technology stalwarts gnashing their teeth. They are
complaining that investors have turned away from fast-growing
new-economy companies just as the companies have begun to deliver
on their promises.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the timing of the sell-off makes perfect
sense. Sure, earnings are great _ but the mere fact that earnings
are being reported has forced investors to take another look at the
enormous valuations they have given to technology and Internet
companies like JDS Uniphase and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a stock's most basic fundamental is its
price-to-earnings ratio. And in the last two years, those ratios at
many new-economy companies have risen to 100, 200, 300 or even
more, implying that it will take centuries for the companies to
achieve cumulative earnings equal to their current valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Even bulls agree that in the long run, P/E ratios that high are
unsustainable _ either earnings must rise or prices must fall to
bring them back to historical norms.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening now is a little of both, as prices go down
while earnings rise, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist
at First Albany. ``We're very very slowly and very very painfully
closing the gap between companies that are overvalued and those
that are undervalued,'' Johnson said. ``The `E' is just fine. The
`P' is too high.'' &QL;

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portfolios That May Need A Diversification Push &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering why your diversified stock fund seems to be
tracking the fortunes of the fast-imploding Internet sector, it may
be because (surprise) it is not particularly diversified.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent data from Morningstar Inc., the
average mid-capitalization growth fund had a fat 48.1 percent of
its assets invested in technology stocks. Not surprisingly, such
funds have suffered in the great Nasdaq sell-off, losing 23.5
percent of their value from March 10, Nasdaq's peak, through
Thursday. Small growth funds, with 45.1 percent of their assets in
technology, are down even more, 25.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Large-cap growth funds, with 42.1 percent in technology, have
held up relatively well, however, losing just 7.9 percent over the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar calculated its sector weightings on Thursday by
using funds' latest available portfolio disclosures. As such, they
can be months out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, of course, did not care about the heavy
weighting in technology until recent weeks. In the first quarter,
many were overjoyed to see their actively managed funds beating the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which has about a one-third
weighting in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guess that they were not aware to the degree that the
typical mid-cap growth and small-cap players have been weighted in
tech,'' said Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at
Morningstar, adding that investors should concentrate on the sector
weightings of their entire portfolios, not individual funds. ``If
its 50 percent in technology, that's an extremely volatile
portfolio,'' Kinnel said.
</P>
<P>
   Among value-oriented funds, the percentage of assets in
technology stocks was in the low teens. For blend funds, which
typically use a combination of value and growth styles, it was in
the 20s.

LET THE BEST MAN _ AND CAR _ WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When NASCAR decided it was going to use its rule-making
authority to even up competition, its intentions were good.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as it tried to do this within broad parameters _
making sure the cars weighed the same, limiting everybody to the
same size fuel cells, things like that _ it could put down a base
for everybody to build on.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that general guidelines won't produce
equal competition because everybody isn't equal to start with. Some
people are smarter than others. Some are stronger. Some are more
instinctive. Some think and perform better under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for that, in its efforts to produce equality, NASCAR
often has to blunt creativity. And this has caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, Chevy teams began hollering
because they couldn't produce the downforce they felt was necessary
to compete with the new Fords. Eventually, a NASCAR rule change
made the Fords and Chevys almost equal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NASCAR's own numbers, taken from wind tunnel
tests, clearly show that Pontiac is at a distinct disadvantage in
downforce, having significantly less than either Ford or Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, Pontiac has never had much influence with
NASCAR, which seems more concerned with keeping the Chevy-Ford
battle under control.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of good Pontiac teams. In fact, Pontiac could
become extinct soon. But it does have one powerhouse entry, Joe
Gibbs Racing. With two of the best drivers in the business in Bobby
Labonte and Tony Stewart, Gibbs' team started kicking butt late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the two cars are still competitive; Labonte leads the
current point standings.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, the Gibbs team has been grumbling, and
rightfully so, about the handicap it has to work with.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, NASCAR should do something so that Pontiac has as
much downforce as the other makes. But it won't.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't because if it did, you might have another Jeff
Gordon situation with Labonte and Stewart dominating competition.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Gibbs' team got where it is through its own
creativity. Now it's being penalized.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR can only do so much to ensure equality. It should give
everybody the same base and let the best man _ and car _ win.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The new one-dollar Sacagawea coins are turning up
in some boxes of breakfast cereal. And Abraham Lincoln and
Alexander Hamilton are younger looking in the portraits on the new
$5 and $10 bills coming into circulation May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been changing more things in your money than has ever
been done before at any one time in history,'' said Mary Ellen
Withrow. She should know: as U.S. Treasurer, Withrow's job is to
run the U.S. Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
   Withrow, who spoke earlier this week to about 235 credit union
managers in Albany, delighted the crowd with behind-the-scenes
money tales, including stories about the designs of the $100 and
$20 bills, and the changes in store for the $10 and $5 bills.
</P>
<P>
   She recounted the biography of Sacagawea, honored on the new
dollar coin released in January. Sacagawea acted as a guide to
explorers Lewis and Clark as they traversed new American wilderness
from 1804 to 1806. Withrow said she marveled at ``a 15-year-old
girl with a 2-month-old baby, taking off with a group of men, not
knowing where her next meal was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wanted to ensure the popularity of the coin, so
it made sure the brass-copper-manganese dollar works in vending
machines. Some coins were released through Wal-Mart stores to get
into broad circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea is also showing up as a prize in some cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in every 2,000 Cheerios boxes have them,'' Withrow said.

COLUMN: A GORGEOUS TAPESTRY WOVEN AS YOU LISTEN: THE ART OF FUGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to Johann Sebastian Bach, I would be just as happy
commemorating the 251st anniversary of his final illness or the
277th anniversary of his employment at Leipzig. But given our
preoccupation with numbers divisible by 50 or 100, I am content
with using the 250th anniversary of his death as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   So while reading a fine new biography, ``Johann Sebastian Bach:
The Learned Musician'' by Christoph Wolff (W.W. Norton), I have
also been listening to several sets of recordings, packaged in
honor of the occasion. These recordings, released by Teldec and
Harmonia Mundi, offer some of the finest Bach performances now
available.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians like the conductors Philippe Herreweghe (Harmonia
Mundi) and Nicholas Harnoncourt (Teldec) or the harpsichordists
Kenneth Gilbert (Harmonia Mundi) and Gustav Leonhardt (Teldec) have
spent most of their lives trying to reconstruct and reimagine the
musical universe of Bach's time. And though these recordings
actually filter the music through a modern sensibility, no
emotional chord is left unsounded: the exquisite pain of the
cantata arias, the spunky energy of the orchestral music, the
spritely dances of the suites, the pungent despair of the passions.
But above all, there is the spirit of the fugue.
</P>
<P>
   The fugue now seems a strange musical form: with its imitating
and intertwining voices it embodies the tastes of an antique era.
For the last two centuries, we have been preoccupied elsewhere.
Much concert music has been thought of as having two ingredients: a
melody and an accompaniment. The melody is the solo voice: the
instrumentalist or the singer expressing emotion, demanding
attention. The accompaniment is the background, emphasizing a
melody's tensions or commenting upon them, embracing a voice or
confronting it. But melody reigns supreme. When we praise music, we
are often praising its melody. Even symphonies, with their hundred
instruments, are often remembered mainly through their themes.
</P>
<P>
   The fugue is an entirely different story. It is all melody, or,
perhaps, all accompaniment. It does not have an individual voice;
it has many individual voices. And each voice is an image of the
others, accompanying them by echoing them. A fugal theme may not
even be distinctive as a melody. It might seem awkward, incomplete,
lacking resolution or purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But set that theme in motion. Then, after a few measures, set
another voice to work, singing the same theme, perhaps at a
different pitch; then a third, or a fourth, or a fifth. Build
tension as these voices echo each other in cascades of fresh
entrances; release tension as they break into free-form episodes.
Invert a voice so it moves up where it once went down and down
where it once went up. Fracture the theme or expand it. Keep the
separate voices in a state of nearly perpetual motion and then
confound the ear by allowing them to intertwine.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the fugue _ a drama not about the individual voice at
large in a society of sound, but a drama about a society of sound
created by related individual voices. It is an astonishing
structure, constructed with intense concentration. In the midst of
that musical society, combinations can never be random or
arbitrary. Rules govern these interactions. And the character of
the theme helps determine the character of the fugue itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is not really how we commonly think about music and its
effects. If the fugue were our primary musical model we would have
no song, no opera, no symphonic drama, no pop tunes. Of course, the
fugue is still a presence in musical life. There are 20th-century
fugues, by, say, Bartok and Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   The fugue has also served as a provocation for contemporary
composers. Elliott Carter, for example, has created what might be
thought of as counter-fugues: many of his compositions are composed
of seemingly autonomous voices; the only catch is that instead of
imitating each other, these voices contradict and avoid each other.
But such enterprises remain at the margins of musical culture.
Elsewhere, melody and accompaniment reign unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   So where does this leave Bach? Bach was so renowned for his
fugues that after King Frederick II of Prussia challenged him to
improvise a fugue based upon a mischievously slithering theme, Bach
countered with a masterpiece of inventive play, ``The Musical
Offering.'' And during his final years Bach worked on a nearly
encyclopedic exploration of fugal possibilities in ``The Art of
Fugue''; it was left unfinished at his death, but not before the
composer had begun work on a fugue that included a theme based on
the letters of his name.
</P>
<P>
   The current anthologies of recent Bach performance provide one
way of understanding the fugue's manifold meanings. Aside from
performances by the pianist Glenn Gould, whose glinting brilliance
upended all critical categories, earlier recordings of Bach fugues
tended to have a ponderous, weighty character, properly proclaiming
the music's intellectual and emotional grandeur. But in these
recordings, grounded in what was once called the ``authenticity''
movement, the fugue has a quicksilver quality. It does not proclaim
its profundity or insist on attention. It dances, lightly and
clearly, every step guided by reason and taste. The Bach fugue
becomes a product of the Enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Each fugue's theme has a distinctive character;
each character constructs its own society; and each society is
bound by law while allowing extraordinary liberty. The fugue is a
model of an ideal society in which obligation and independence
coexist, in which the individual is incomplete without the society
and the society unthinkable without the individual, in which
passion erupts but reason rules. Such an 18th-century-Enlightenment
vision couldn't last _ not in the face of the desires and demands
of the individual voice finally freed from the old world's social
strictures. But the fugue, in all its antique, sublime intricacy,
reminds us of what was once imagined, and what, someday, may be
hoped for again.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 16, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CONFESSIONS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As the Supreme Court prepares
to revisit the landmark Miranda decision on confessions by criminal
suspects, there is something appropriate about the timing.
Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ seems to have
become a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller
list, revelations of appalling intimacy on TV. Politicians are
expected to admit to all manner of personal transgressions. Now,
long after other milestones of the Warren Court were absorbed by
the criminal justice system, Miranda still stirs passions. By Linda
Greenhouse. (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-POVERTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ On all sides of the
debate about globalization, in rich and poor nations alike, there
lurks a disturbing, shared sense that even as Internet millionaires
are being made and industry expands around the Third World,
something is going very wrong in the poorest economies and most
disadvantaged societies. The dispute is about how and why this is
happening, or what can be done about it. By Barbara Crossette.
(Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-DEATHPENALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Several
prominent law-and-order conservatives have recently raised
questions about the death penalty. Some urge more DNA testing to
help acquit the unjustly convicted. Others seek more procedural
safeguards. Pat Robertson wants a moratorium on executions because
the death penalty discriminates against minorities and the poor.
George Will thinks ``skepticism is in order'' about capital
punishment. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   CEO-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1992, Bill Clinton decried the
soaring salaries of America's chief executives. In the eight years
since then, CEOs' average pay has more than tripled to $11.9
million, but this year's presidential candidates have not mentioned
it. The populist issue has paled. The changing American attitude
toward money may have something to do with it. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   WEAPONS-COSTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has always
insisted that there can be no price tag on national security:
weapons represent America's global superiority, and if they are
costly, so be it. But the issue of how wisely the Pentagon spends
money persists. Little has changed since 1969, when an Air Force
financial analyst told Congress that the 77-aircraft C-5A program
was $2 billion over budget _ an unheard-of sum back then.
Billion-dollar cost overruns are now commonplace at the Pentagon.
And telling the truth about costs still comes hard. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSTUDENT-STOCKSCAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ To cynics, the news that
three Georgetown law students had settled SEC charges of running an
Internet stock manipulation scheme probably came as no surprise.
After all, lawyers have had an image problem at least since
Shakespeare. But even people who think the phrase legal ethics is
an oxymoron may have been surprised by Georgetown's announcement
that it would take no action against the students, who did not
admit or deny wrongdoing. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-GENOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The human genome project could
enable medicine and medical research to return to some of its best,
and most old-fashioned, traditions. In fact, the emerging gene
sciences will reunite the patient, doctor and researcher, in ways
not seen since the 19th- and early 20th centuries. By David A.
Shaywitz and Dennis A. Ausiello
</P>
<P>
   WWII-ART-THEFTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Art institutions and private
and governmental agencies around the world are beginning to publish
catalogs on the Internet describing artworks in their holdings that
could have been confiscated or looted by one of the belligerents in
World War II and, if so proved, should be returned to their
rightful owners. By William Honan.
</P>
<P>
   PSYCH-VIOLENCE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Psychiatrists say
predicting violence accurately is impossible, but there are tools
that help them make clinical judgments. Most important is the
individual interview. A sampling of some notes from such an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   XFL-FOOTBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vince McMahon has turned his
attention from the raunch of his staged World Wrestling Federation
events to creating the XFL, a high-octane, ``smash mouth'' football
league, in partnership with NBC. But for the strategy behind Vince
McMahon's secret plan to turn himself into Vince Lombardi with
bulging pectorals, let's turn to his manifesto, ``The XFL: An
Accident Waiting to Happen.'' By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-CUBA-REVIEW (Seoul, South Korea) _ Cuba's Fidel Castro
has been the intellectual scold of the powerful, preaching to the
world's rich nations about their obligations to the world's poorest
nations. North Korea has been seen as intransigent, introverted and
unpredictable and un-worldly-wise. But judging by recent events,
it's the North Koreans who seem to have come first to a reluctant
understanding of how the world really works these days: That what a
desperately impoverished communist outpost sitting next to a
capitalist hotshot needs most is not an enemy to rail against but a
partner to join futures with. By Howard W. French.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 16, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CONFESSIONS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As the Supreme Court prepares
to revisit the landmark Miranda decision on confessions by criminal
suspects, there is something appropriate about the timing.
Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ seems to have
become a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller
list, revelations of appalling intimacy on TV. Politicians are
expected to admit to all manner of personal transgressions. Now,
long after other milestones of the Warren Court were absorbed by
the criminal justice system, Miranda still stirs passions. By Linda
Greenhouse. (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-POVERTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ On all sides of the
debate about globalization, in rich and poor nations alike, there
lurks a disturbing, shared sense that even as Internet millionaires
are being made and industry expands around the Third World,
something is going very wrong in the poorest economies and most
disadvantaged societies. The dispute is about how and why this is
happening, or what can be done about it. By Barbara Crossette.
(Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-DEATHPENALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Several
prominent law-and-order conservatives have recently raised
questions about the death penalty. Some urge more DNA testing to
help acquit the unjustly convicted. Others seek more procedural
safeguards. Pat Robertson wants a moratorium on executions because
the death penalty discriminates against minorities and the poor.
George Will thinks ``skepticism is in order'' about capital
punishment. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   CEO-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1992, Bill Clinton decried the
soaring salaries of America's chief executives. In the eight years
since then, CEOs' average pay has more than tripled to $11.9
million, but this year's presidential candidates have not mentioned
it. The populist issue has paled. The changing American attitude
toward money may have something to do with it. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   WEAPONS-COSTS-REVEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has always
insisted that there can be no price tag on national security:
weapons represent America's global superiority, and if they are
costly, so be it. But the issue of how wisely the Pentagon spends
money persists. Little has changed since 1969, when an Air Force
financial analyst told Congress that the 77-aircraft C-5A program
was $2 billion over budget _ an unheard-of sum back then.
Billion-dollar cost overruns are now commonplace at the Pentagon.
And telling the truth about costs still comes hard. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSTUDENT-STOCKSCAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ To cynics, the news that
three Georgetown law students had settled SEC charges of running an
Internet stock manipulation scheme probably came as no surprise.
After all, lawyers have had an image problem at least since
Shakespeare. But even people who think the phrase legal ethics is
an oxymoron may have been surprised by Georgetown's announcement
that it would take no action against the students, who did not
admit or deny wrongdoing. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-GENOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The human genome project could
enable medicine and medical research to return to some of its best,
and most old-fashioned, traditions. In fact, the emerging gene
sciences will reunite the patient, doctor and researcher, in ways
not seen since the 19th- and early 20th centuries. By David A.
Shaywitz and Dennis A. Ausiello
</P>
<P>
   WWII-ART-THEFTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Art institutions and private
and governmental agencies around the world are beginning to publish
catalogs on the Internet describing artworks in their holdings that
could have been confiscated or looted by one of the belligerents in
World War II and, if so proved, should be returned to their
rightful owners. By William Honan.
</P>
<P>
   PSYCH-VIOLENCE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Psychiatrists say
predicting violence accurately is impossible, but there are tools
that help them make clinical judgments. Most important is the
individual interview. A sampling of some notes from such an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   XFL-FOOTBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vince McMahon has turned his
attention from the raunch of his staged World Wrestling Federation
events to creating the XFL, a high-octane, ``smash mouth'' football
league, in partnership with NBC. But for the strategy behind Vince
McMahon's secret plan to turn himself into Vince Lombardi with
bulging pectorals, let's turn to his manifesto, ``The XFL: An
Accident Waiting to Happen.'' By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-CUBA-REVIEW (Seoul, South Korea) _ Cuba's Fidel Castro
has been the intellectual scold of the powerful, preaching to the
world's rich nations about their obligations to the world's poorest
nations. North Korea has been seen as intransigent, introverted and
unpredictable and un-worldly-wise. But judging by recent events,
it's the North Koreans who seem to have come first to a reluctant
understanding of how the world really works these days: That what a
desperately impoverished communist outpost sitting next to a
capitalist hotshot needs most is not an enemy to rail against but a
partner to join futures with. By Howard W. French.

 &HT;    Bow-tied anchor of CBS Sunday A.M. news program is an affable
everyman
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walk down a street in Midtown Manhattan with Charles
Osgood, and you see smiles. Not stares, not whispers, not snickers
... smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood returns each one in kind. As the veteran broadcaster
strolls down West 57th Street on a mild spring afternoon, near the
anonymous building where he anchors CBS News' ever-classy ``Sunday
Morning,'' a man at a fruit stand nods to him pleasantly and Osgood
replies, in his mellow baritone, ``How are ya?'' And it's
impossible to tell whether the grocer is acknowledging Osgood as a
celebrity _ known 'round the world from the TV newsmagazine and his
``Osgood File'' on CBS radio _ or simply recalls him as the fellow
who, say, bought a newspaper and a navel orange from him last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the genius of Charles Osgood, broadcasting's most regular
guy. Every ``Sunday Morning,'' when he smiles into the camera with
his bow tie and mischievously arched eyebrow, and speaks through
vocal cords that sound as if they've been warmed with Irish coffee,
the 66-year-old brings to mind the hearty favorite uncle who used
to come to your house for holiday dinners. The uncle with the
stories to tell. Whether Osgood narrates his own ``Sunday Morning''
report or introduces another reporter's segment (he edits them all,
deftly), or delivers an ``Osgood File'' or one of his celebrated
poems on TV or radio, he's above all a storyteller. Osgood
convinces you so completely that he's telling the tale to you, now
_ as you stew in traffic, dress for church _ that you forget about
all the people at that moment who feel exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood binds America together in a million tiny audiences of
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about Charlie without using the word
`comfortable,''' says ``SM'' reporter Bill Geist, ``but he's more
than that. There's a sophisticated man under those little poems.
There's wit. Integrity. Charlie never hypes you or tries to sell
you any snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Rand Morrison adds: ``What you see on the
screen is exactly what you get with Charlie. Working with him is
beyond joy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Having lunch with him is pretty good, too. Osgood chooses a
quiet, unassuming French bistro a few blocks from the studio _ an
``old CBS haunt'' _ and recalls seeing Mike Wallace and Harry
Reasoner there at their ease. Osgood looks like a man who enjoys a
good meal, and does not disappoint. Pitching into a plate of calf
liver and onions with a glass of cabernet (no bean sprouts and
sparkling water for this celeb) he recounts an undying love affair
with radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember this, but my mother tells me that when I was
barely old enough to talk, I used to walk around the house banging
a frying pan and singing the theme song from `Omar the Mystic,' a
popular radio show of the time,'' says the New York native.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's first assignment as a reporter for ABC radio in New
York was a nightmare: interviewing Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr.
after the 1962 Paris air crash that killed dozens of Atlanta arts
patrons. Allen got on the phone and calmly began asking technical
questions about what kind of tape equipment the cub reporter would
use, etc. Finally, after a countdown, Allen went on-the-record with
a lightning switch to a tragic mood. Osgood relishes imitating the
mayor's bombastic tones: ``My heart ... is heavy ... tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   When Osgood started making up humorous rhymes to comment on the
news, at New York's ``Newsradio 88'' in the 1960s, an order came
from CBS chairman William Paley: ``Send me a tape of Osgood's
poem.'' The station's news director was so rattled at the presumed
displeasure of the big boss that whenever such a memo arrived, he'd
cancel Osgood's remaining segments for the day, even though it
always turned out that Paley loved the poems.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps to explain why Osgood rose to become a CBS star in
the 1970s, anchoring weekend newscasts on TV but spending more of
his time on radio. Even now he describes himself as ``a radio guy
who finally stopped being terrified of the camera.'' He produces
four ``Osgood Files,'' brief but entertaining, per day. Phil Chin,
his producer for more than 20 years, pulls story ideas off the wire
services and the Internet in the evenings and faxes them to Osgood
at his New Jersey home so that he can see them when he rises at
2:30 a.m. He gets to the studio at 4 and starts writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never fails to amaze me how that writing shines every
day,'' Chin says. ``Once, I gave him an idea about people mistaking
eye drops for glue, and Charles whipped up a poem with the phrase,
`Old Glue Eyes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since he also prepares ``Sunday Morning'' segments late in the
week and goes on the air live Sundays, it makes for a punishing
schedule. The payoff, Osgood says, is plenty of time at his
vacation home on the French Riviera, but even there he tapes radio
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I wear my bow tie at the mike,'' he cracks,
``and I tell them they'd be surprised what I don't wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood is proud that all five children he's raised with the
former Jean Crafton speak fluent French. Which is more than can be
said for Osgood pere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was in trouble the day I took my youngest son into a
French shop and he said, `Ehhhh, let me do the talking, Dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   While Osgood was still a rare sight on TV, in 1979 the network's
other Charles, Charles Kuralt, similarly beloved for his touch of
the poetic, helped launch CBS' ``Sunday Morning.'' It became one of
television's best magazines for feature stories _ certainly
commercial TV's best showcase for the arts. With its bracing
musical intro on classical horn, its visual signature of beaming
sun faces, ``Sunday Morning'' has the sunniest of dispositions but
plenty of hard news, too. It's an oasis of intelligence in a TV
landscape that's come to resemble Oz's description of the Tin
Woodman: a clinking, clanking collection of caliginous junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `60 Minutes' guys make all the money,'' ``SM'' reporter
Geist cracks, ``but we get all the time (the show is 90 minutes
long) to tell our stories, and that's another kind of gold.'' He's
joined by Rita Braver, Martha Teichner, Billy Taylor, John Leonard
and others in one of TV's finest reporter stables.
</P>
<P>
   When declining health forced Kuralt off his high anchor stool in
1994, ``There was a lot of consternation,'' Geist says. ``I mean,
would they hire Geraldo Rivera?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an immense relief when they brought in Charles Osgood,
and I say that personally because he and I share a sense of
humor,'' Geist continues. ``Evening newscasts avoid humor like the
plague. At `Sunday Morning,' we don't tell you about the latest
hatchet murder _ we like you to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Osgood had been named ``SM'' anchor that he
found out that Kuralt, who died in 1997, lobbied on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles was a very private man,'' Osgood says, on a day when
the papers carry news of the legal settlement between Kuralt's
widow and longtime Montana mistress over his estate. ``As much as
we respected his talent, I don't think any of us really knew him
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood cracks, ``Kuralt was a good predecessor for me _ not just
another pretty face.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, it's hard to imagine any other anchor donning the
Kuralt mantle as superbly as Osgood has done. He was lead reporter
in a show devoted entirely to the legacy of Ernest Hemingway, his
home in Cuba, the changes in that country. He visited a British pub
and played World War II-era songs so rousingly on the piano that
everyone came and sang along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even Osgood's narration of the sports highlights has his own
charming inflection (``There he goes again: slam-dunk!''), as if he
were on a small-town, low-watt station, bragging about the school
team to a few dozen of his neighbors. In an age where viewers' only
sense of ``community'' may be a subdivision behind locked gates,
Osgood is a great connector _ a rallying point for frayed nerves
and sagging optimism on a day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Geist says his only piece to be ``killed'' by Osgood was a
humorous take on O.J. Simpson, showing the editor's determination
to keep the show above the tide of TV tabloidization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no other show less pressured by ratings,'' Geist
declares. Still, ``SM's'' audience ``skews old'' in an industry
that lusts after ever-younger viewer flesh. Producer Morrison,
while cherishing ``the great traditions of the show,'' is making
gentle changes that he hopes ``will get us noticed more.'' One
couldn't help noticing that in a recent interview with Sophia
Loren, the Italian guest interviewer harped on the star's sex life
more than the show's regular correspondents would ever do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to get many teenagers tuning in at 9 a.m.
after a date night,'' Morrison says. ``But we may have a piece on
`body art' that brings in new viewers. We'll always have the great
piece on Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's final Sunday duty is to introduce the footage of
outdoor scenes, nature's beauty. Without inflicting any music or
narration (not even PBS is so generous), this hugely popular
segment leaves the viewer feeling restored by the chuckle of a
mountain stream, the eerie cry of an elk or the rustle of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to bring this real world into our homes than that
realest of hosts?
</P>
<P>
   Nudging his glass playfully back and forth across the tablecloth
_ so that the wine sloshes up to the lip but never quite out _
Osgood says, ``Most TV executives don't even hear what's being said
on the air. They look at their little monitors (he imitates them,
staring into space with mad-scientist intensity) and say, `Does it
have enough reds? Enough yellows? And is it moving?!'''
</P>
<P>
   He lets out a deep, ironic chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, `Sunday Morning' has beautiful pictures. The words
are pretty special, too. That's why we're a friend of the family.''

 &HT;    Hip-hop's contribution finding home in museums
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   True to hip-hop's origins in battles between competing artists,
there is not one group but two attempting to honor the music with a
hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an organization in Manhattan formally introduced
itself as the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. Like the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon, it
plans to have annual induction ceremonies for artists before it
builds an actual museum.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Mayor Ernest Davis of Mount Vernon, N.Y., announced
that he is converting an old firehouse into a Hip-Hop Hall of Fame,
which will be unrelated to the Manhattan project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has been showing for
five months what it claims is the world's first major museum
exhibition on hip-hop culture. Through August, on three floors,
artifacts ranging from Run-DMC's signature hats, sunglasses and
Adidas sneakers to the handwritten lyrics of ``Tennessee'' by
Atlanta act Arrested Development will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   All of this for a genre that only turned 20 last year, when
pundits and fans alike marked the 1979 release of the first
commercial rap record, the Sugar Hill Gang's ``Rapper's Delight.''
It's a genre still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop culture has a serious hold on American culture right
now,'' says Ramona DeBreaux, music director and midday announcer at
Atlanta hip-hop station Hot-97.5. ``To sell Pop-Tarts, people are
rapping. Sports network ESPN uses hip-hop terminology to talk about
sports. It's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Chuck D, whose group Public Enemy brought blistering
politics to hip-hop and who contributed artifacts to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame's exhibit, thinks the recognition should have
come a long time ago. Establishing an infrastructure to recognize
hip-hop and chronicle its evolution is important: ``I wish the two
places in New York would put their heads together and consolidate
and maybe have branches all over,'' says the Atlanta resident.
``But there's more than 20 years of recorded hip-hop _ yeah, give
it the respect that it's due.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Manhattan, the spokesman for the ``official'' Hip-Hop
Hall of Fame says it will have its first induction ceremony of
artists _ voted on by fans _ by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard about other people with ideas,'' says Steven
Burns, ``but we own the rights to the name _ lock, stock and
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this is a big world,'' said Davis, who wants his museum,
which he expects to be under construction for a year, to be a
combination hall of fame, history exhibit and job training center.
``But we are the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound like fighting words?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounds like hip-hop.

 &HT;    Lincoln gains mythic proportions in sermons
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his assassination on Good Friday of 1865, Abraham Lincoln
took on mythic proportions, even to some people who opposed him
during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons preached immediately after his death reflected this,
said Patrick Graham, director of the Pitts Theological Library at
Emory University. The library has collected many of those sermons
and made them available online.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some people's minds, he becomes Father Abraham of the
Bible,'' said Graham. ``What this ends up doing is investing this
kind of public image of Lincoln with all that is good and noble and
heroic that is associated with Abraham of the Bible, the great
leader of his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministers also compared Lincoln to other biblical characters,
usually Hebrew heroes who led their nation through wars and
hardships, Graham said. ``By selecting one of those you kind of add
to the luster of Lincoln's halo.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ministers also used Lincoln's death to attack the South and
its policies, and others saw it as an opportunity for moral
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is done to pay tribute to a person no longer with us and
is also intended to see that something good comes of this,'' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from some of the Emory sermons:
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Lowe
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Unitarian Church in Archdale Street, Charleston,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the noble Ship of State, safely guided through
storm and night, had come at last, with colors flying and with crew
rejoicing, to the very entrance of the port, soon, safe within the
haven, to find peace and rest. And yet she is first to be piloted
over the bar; and when, just as she is headed in, he on whose clear
eye and firm hand they had relied for this service, as for every
thing before, is smitten down, who can picture the consternation
which takes the place of the rejoicing and the hope?
</P>
<P>
   My friends, you who have dwelt here, shut out from intercourse
with the North, and receiving only infrequent and usually distorted
statements in regard to current events, can faintly understand the
sentiment, in regard to Mr. Lincoln, which has gradually taken
possession of the entire population of the Northern and Western
States. ...
</P>
<P>
   I feel no ill will or spirit of condemnation toward any person,
simply because he is on the opposite side. I know the power of
education, and of prejudice, and of example. I know the terrible
contagion of opinion and purpose, when once an earnest sentiment
takes possession of a community; and, when I think how every thing
of social influence has combined to lead them as they have gone, I
dare not boast to myself, that, if I had been similarly placed, I
might not have been similarly misled.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Henry C. Badger
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Cambridgeport Parish, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, who had been unjustly dismissed from the Army,
was reinstated on appealing to the ever-patient head of the nation,
whose task it was to undo the evil deeds others had done; but, as
the president restored to him his commission, perceiving the young
man's fault, he said kindly, and with a father's faithful rebuke,
``I fear, my young friend, that you are inclined to be
quarrelsome.'' And when the young man, willing to justify himself,
said that that might not be so grave a fault in a soldier, whose
business was fighting, the president rejoined, ``No, sir: you are
mistaken; I find that the quiet and peaceable young men make the
best officers and bravest soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this kindly faithfulness that made him so dear to the
people as ``Father Abraham.'' They trusted to him as to a father.
They knew that he was diligent and conscientious, patient and
sincere. They saw his manly simplicity, his freedom from
ostentation, his sadness in adversity, his humility in success, his
steadfast trust in God, and his careworn face, as he bore all the
people's sorrows on his heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J.G. Butler
</P>
<P>
   Pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran Church, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though our beloved Chief Magistrate lies in the chilling embrace
of death today, and our honored Prime Minister of State lingers in
pain beneath the assassin's blow, our government still lives. Men
may die _ be murdered _ but truth never. Jesus may, by wicked
hands, be crucified, but his cause lives. That is a part of God's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln has fallen a martyr to truth, to principle, to
freedom, to law and order, and good government. But whilst our
hearts are bleeding, our hopes are not crushed. ... We have been
laying upon our country's altar our most precious treasure. It is
all covered with the blood of our husbands and fathers, and sons
and brothers _ cpursuing a fleeing foe, treason nerves
her fiendish arm to strike down our Moses, who, under God, has led
us through the wilderness, as he stands upon Pisgah, in full view
of the Promised Land, the land flowing with milk and honey.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emma Hardinge
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Cooper Institute, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, brave, and immovable in the hour of trial and calamity,
Abraham Lincoln practiced the last crowning virtue of a great man's
life, the divine attribute of mercy; and after having gallantly
conquered, generously forgave the foe, uniting again in one
fraternal clasp the severed hands of North and South, and silenced
every jealous lip or rebellious tongue by a clemency calculated to
win more hearts by his kindness than the invincible armies of the
North have subdued by their arms. In all his public acts, even to
the very last, we see him ever casting himself trustingly and nobly
on the fealty of the people. Surely he must have loved them, for
who ever before so trusted them?
</P>
<P>
   ... The Southern institution, enemy alike of God and man, has
slain the South, and as the monstrous blossom of a poison-tree, has
slain its friend and honor in Abraham Lincoln ... I do not tax this
deed upon the South but on its spirit; if not upon the men of the
South, yet on its institutions; and if not the act in very person
of slave-owners, the blood of Lincoln lies at the door of SLAVERY!

 &HT;    Human rights groups are fighting anti-Semitism and other forms
of bigotry found in cyberspace _ using their own Web sites as an
antidote to online venomBy Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ A new site on the World Wide Web has
been launched in tiny offices in this Argentine capital to battle a
dramatic rise in anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom Online, a newly-formed human rights group, is particulary
concerned that, while most of the Ten Commandments still are
largely ignored around the world, the admonition against ``bearing
false witness'' is causing new problems, thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes murder, says Gabriel Avram, chief executive of
Shalom Online.
</P>
<P>
   Though Shalom Online just launched a new Web site in Spanish
(shalomonline.com), he says the page will be available later this
year in Portuguese, English and French.
</P>
<P>
   The group monitors ``an alarming rise'' in Web hate sites from
Mexico to Argentina, he says, many of which have links to similar
``anti-everything'' pages in the United States and Europe.
Monitoring such hate sites is critical now, he says, because
anti-Semitic and other hate propaganda picks up around Jewish
holidays such as Passover, which starts Wednesday at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the eight-day Passover holiday is freedom, a
commemoration of the Hebrews' exodus from slavery in Egypt
thousands of years ago. It's a time when Jews are asked to reflect
on slavery and the joys of freedom at a festive meal called a
Seder.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Jewish belief that is recalled during the Seder that
no one is truly free unless everyone is, and that means freedom
from prejudice as well as slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, says Avram and other human rights activists,
prejudice of all kinds seems to be rising.
</P>
<P>
   So Shalom Online and other groups are using the Web as a forum
not only to monitor those who hate, but as a way to fight them.
People spotting hate groups online are encouraged to contact the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery; HateWatch in Cambridge,
Mass.; Amnesty International and the Anti-Defamation League in New
York; and B'nai B'rith in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Avram says it's easier to reach the targets of hate than its
purveyors _ thus the new Web site. Like other hate group watchers,
Shalom Online monitors prejudicial pages on the Web and offers
advice for adults and children on how to deal with bigotry, as well
as information on Passover and other holidays.
</P>
<P>
   When new sites are reported by Web users, the Southern Poverty
Law Center and other human rights groups complain to Internet
service providers, some of which try to control the pages they
host, says law center spokesman Joe Roy.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Blazak, an Emory University sociologist and expert on
hate groups in Atlanta, Ga., says it's hard for service providers
to do anything about them, even though some have rules against hate
language on pages they host.
</P>
<P>
   His students have told him they've found venomous hate sites
while doing research papers on the Net. Some human rights groups,
such as the Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, headed by well-known
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, and HateWatch, actually make it easy
for Net surfers to find such sites by providing links.
</P>
<P>
   Blazak agrees with Avram that the growth of hate sites is due in
part to America's First Amendment, which shields skinheads,
Klansmen and other racists, homophobes and xenophobes in countries
like Germany where it's illegal to stir up prejudice. Many Latin
American and European hate group sites are registered in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of hate sites has been blamed for
numerous atrocities in Latin America, Avram says, including the
1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy here, which killed 28 people,
and a blast that killed 82 at a local Jewish community center two
years later. No suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Hate sites have been blamed for terrorism in the United States,
says Jordan Kessler of the ADL in New York. People who knew the two
youths who killed 13 fellow students and teachers in Littleton,
Colo., last year described them as Net experts who'd made
``visits'' to neo-Nazi sites. The massacre took place on Hitler's
birthday, April 20. Also, one of two brothers suspected of killing
a gay couple in Redding, Calif., and of torching several Sacramento
area synagogues reportedly scanned racist Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has at least 15 such hate sites, and a similar number
are posted in Brazil and Chile, says Sergio Widder, head of the
Wiesenthal Center in Buenos Aires. But the big problem is in the
United States, says Jay Kaiman of the ADL in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're monitoring 250 pages in (the United States)
and in the Southeast, where we know of about 15,'' including some
in Georgia, he says. ``For the first time, hate groups don't have
to rally at a Stone Mountain. They can go into their apartment or
house and rally on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked 305 hate sites in
the United States this year, up from 254 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet grows, we can expect this to grow,'' Kaiman
says. ``The number of hate groups had started a downward trend
until the Internet caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy says a big concern now is that kids surfing the Net often
stumble onto such pages while researching papers on the Holocaust
or World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Leon Klenicki, a native of Argentina who now works for the
ADL in New York, says ``intolerance is the essence'' of his
homeland, but it's not directed just against Jews. Foreigners,
trade unions, Protestants, homosexuals and immigrants also are
targets, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Siegel Vann, Latin affairs director for B'nai B'rith, says
intolerance is hard to fight in a country that openly sympathized
with Germany until two months before the end of World War II. She
says Shalom Online is ``a great initiative,'' a good first step.
</P>
<P>
   Blazak says hate groups in other countries often set up links to
sites in the United States, which can be done as easily as
e-mailing a page to a like-minded person in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cyberspace,'' Blazak says. ``There are no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's hopeful that by monitoring and reporting hate sites,
Internet service providers may be forced to take more stringent
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Simon Moguilevsky, who presides over the oldest
congregation in Argentina, Congregacion Israelita de la Republica
Argentina, says Net hate is ``a big problem'' in Latin America in
part because of its legacy of harboring Nazis after World War II.
But if groups like Shalom Online stay vigilant, he adds, ``we hope
for better.''
</P>
<P>
   David Goldman, founder of HateWatch in Cambridge, contends the
best way to hurt hate groups is to fight fire with fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, people were saying the Internet was the
greatest thing that has happened to hate,'' Goldman says, because
it allows hate groups to operate in anonymity and saves them money
on mailings. ``But we think it's also the worst thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, who's forever vigilant, contends most Net users are
smart enough to know what's right and wrong when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the vast majority of caring, concerned but
politically uninvolved Americans are now becoming aware of the
situation, concerned enough to act,'' Goldman says. ``We're saying,
`Go and look for yourself.' Then come and talk to us.''

 &HT;    'Redeemer President' offers religious view of Lincoln
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had Abraham Lincoln adhered to the norms of his strict
Protestant upbringing on that Good Friday evening, history may have
been different.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   There, he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   He died the next day, on April 15, 1865, exactly 135 years ago
today.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's love for the theater was but one of his departures
from his strict Calvinist parents, said Allen C. Guelzo, author of
a new book looking at Lincoln from a religious perspective,
``Abraham Lincoln, Redeemer President'' (William B. Eerdmans
Publishing Co., $29).
</P>
<P>
   Guelzo took the title of his book from an editorial by Walt
Whitman calling for such a figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He redeemed the country from slavery, disunion and from a
general sense of disillusion with popular government,'' said
Guelzo, dean of the Templeton Honors College at Eastern College in
St. Davids, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Often portrayed as a rough frontiersman, Lincoln was actually an
intellectually and theologically complex man as Guelzo paints him.
He had both a strong optimism about the ability of the populace to
function in a democracy and a deep pessimism about the capacity for
individual choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who was working out complexity in his own life,''
said the author.
</P>
<P>
   The future president was born into a severely Calvinist Baptist
family in Appalachia. His parents were ``utterly
predestinationists,'' Guelzo said. ``They believed people didn't
make choices for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln rebelled against his father's religion and immersed
himself in Thomas Paine, Robert Burns and the other authors of the
Enlightenment. The contrast with Lincoln's beginning is not as
great as it seems, said Guelzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Enlightenment thinkers were ... captured by the
beauty of science, especially Newtonian science,'' said Guelzo.
``And what did Newtonian science preach? Order in the universe,
things happening in certain ways human will could not interrupt.
That sat very naturally beside Lincoln's inherited Calvinism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln gained a reputation as a scoffer and an infidel that
softened later in his life. By the 1860s, Lincoln described himself
as a religious seeker.
</P>
<P>
   A ``real change'' came upon Lincoln during the Civil War, Guelzo
said. The president concluded that there was a purpose at work
greater than that of humans.
</P>
<P>
   With the Emancipation Proclamation after Antietam, Lincoln was
fulfilling a covenant with God that he would take Gen. Robert E.
Lee's retreat from Maryland as a sign that he should free the
slaves, according to the diaries of two of his Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, this is staggering,'' said Guelzo.
``Here is the president of the United States in the midst of the
greatest civil crisis in American history, about to make the most
important social decision in the history of the country, and his
justification is 'God told me to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guelzo added his own volume to the stack of Lincoln biographies,
he said, because he wants to ensure that Lincoln is seen as a man
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern American discourse really concentrates on the nuts and
bolts,'' Guelzo said. ``It's good to make the traffic lights work,
but it impoverishes something in government when you can aspire to
nothing higher than traffic lights. The American popular government
after all was founded not on solving problems, but on articulating
ideas _ a proposition that all men are created equal.''

 &HT;    Professor and essayist practices the art of living well in the
mountains of North Georgia
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. _ He props himself on the corner of a desk,
looking more companionable than professorial, and asks, ``So what
do you think Herrick is saying here? Is this poem about waking up
in the morning?''
</P>
<P>
   A hand shoots up, then another and another, all females.
</P>
<P>
   Boys, especially big boys, don't like to think themselves
bashful about sexuality, but the half-dozen who had taken their
stations in the rear of the room were sitting this one out.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued while they held their counsel was a discussion
between a 50-year-old father of four and a handful of young women,
students in English 102 at Young Harris College. ``If you wait in
life to seize the opportunity for love,'' Steven Harvey asked by
way of dropping a clue, ``is the natural world going to wait for
you? No, it's going to go on. So the bed is a retreat from the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hands were soon petitioning their turn, still all females.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row a young woman said the poet, Robert Herrick,
seemed to be implying an awakening to sex.
</P>
<P>
   Hands folded over a raised knee, Harvey weighed her words in the
noncommittal way that signals ``OK, but. ...''
</P>
<P>
   You could see him wanting her to go deeper, explore her thought
one step further. Thirty years separated teacher and student, but
Harvey was willing to meet her halfway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think Herrick is really talking about the whole
array of activities that are part of the physical side of love?''
Harvey asked her.
</P>
<P>
   Half-sentences ricocheted in rapid response, and the subject was
seen as a larger and more interesting one than mere coupling.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Harvey would confirm the impression that poetry of a
certain kind speaks more to women than to men. ``I find that the
women are more open to these things,'' he said. ``The men are a
harder crust. They don't take to it as easily. But then you'll come
across the exception, and you see those feelings run very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem they were reading was a minor one _ ``Corinna's Going
A-Maying'' _ by a minor poet, but all the better for making
Harvey's point: ``I think too often we define things in the
negative,'' he told his class. ``But it is a sin not to embrace
life, and that includes the physical as well as the spiritual. Not
living is the real sin here.''
</P>
<P>
   He let the point settle in, and then deftly brought in the
leavening. ``I heard from one of my little spies,'' he said, ``that
you all are tired of these love poems and you want some drinking
poems. But Herrick is one of our great drinking poets. He'd meet
his friend Ben Jonson and they'd recite poems while drinking
flagons of ale.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a ripple of muffled amusement, and a husky fellow in
the rear raised his head from a page that might as well have been
Greek grammar and saw a glimmer of light where before there had
only been darkness.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Harvey himself wrote poems before finding his real
voice in the personal essay. In two essay collections, ``A Geometry
of Lilies: Life and Death in an American Family'' and ``Lost in
Translation,'' he writes with fluent ease about love and marriage,
about change and loss. His tone is by turns winsome and reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what my books are about,'' he says. ``It's very
hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He will write of his kids ganging up on him (``I marvel at the
transparent guile of their planning huddles, the determined looks
as they gather courage for the synchronized assault, their reckless
confidence as they throw their bodies at their father'') or of
discovering that he is perfectly happy living without a television.
(``Our mind connects the dots, lending depth and perspective, and
ultimately, meaning to the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube.
And yet, the experience sedates us, engaging just enough of our
senses to lull us into a stupor.'')
</P>
<P>
   He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind always
seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what might be
called the universal.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Pickering, one of the best-known practitioners of the
personal essay, is among Harvey's admirers. ``I've never met
Harvey, but his writing is musical and lyrical, with a firm sense
of place and an awareness of the small things that appoint our
days,'' Pickering says. ``Although his pieces are set in a small
place, it transcends where he lives. In some ways, looking at
something closely expands rather than narrows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey has also edited a collection of essays by men on middle
age, ``In a Dark Wood,'' and in June the University of Georgia
Press will publish ``Bound for Shady Grove,'' in which his love for
mountain music and its instruments _ the banjo, the fiddle, the
guitar _ becomes a means for exploring the changing seasons of
one's life.
</P>
<P>
   He had been assigning his classes to read essays for years. ``I
imagine the essay,'' he says, ``as the solitary thinking mind
allowing you a glimpse of itself, a rarity in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing of them was more personal still, an unburdening that
freed him of the obligation to write of a central event in his life
_ his mother's suicide when he was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mother's suicide was one of the reasons I first
began to write, although I don't think it's the source of my
writing. I don't think I could write about it. I don't think I
could get it back. I tried to write a novel about it and that
didn't work. I tried to write a poem about it and that didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The best he could do was write about trying to write about it.
In the essay ``Suicide Notes'' in ``A Geometry of Lilies,'' he
begins by recalling himself at 17: ``I let my hair grow long,
wandered downtown late at night, hid poems in my desk, gave
recitations aloud in empty schoolyards, and filled 89-cent
composition books with the usual undergraduate drivel.'' He was
drawn to images of ``crows, stubble fields and winter trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotions were deeply felt, but the art forced. Remembering
her was enough; he did not have to embalm her in words. And so, by
the end of the essay, he is writing of his daughter Neesa _ born on
April 6, the same day his mother died. She is 6 or 7 at the time,
skipping on ahead of him, ``kicking up gravel as she goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, you lose what you love, Harvey wrote in another
essay, so best to hold onto it while you have it. He was telling
his class this, in so many words, knowing they might be too young
to fully appreciate the transitory, fragile moments that make up
the unseen life.
</P>
<P>
   If the essay is the form in which Harvey found his real voice,
it was in the classroom, he says, that he found his vocation. ``I'm
a teacher more than I am a writer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He says it like a man telling you which way is north and which
is south. They have meaning only in relation to one another, but he
doesn't want you to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Bettie Sellers, the outgoing poet laureate of Georgia, claims
credit for the discovery, and no one disputes her. ``I guess it's
been 20 years now,'' she says. ``I sat beside him at a seminar at
Callanwolde there in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 24 years, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers was head of the humanities department at Young Harris,
and Harvey was teaching eighth-graders at Charlotte Country Day
School in North Carolina. ``I was looking for someone to teach
English,'' Sellers says, ``and my good angel said, `Bettie, this is
a real teacher.' He loves the teaching and he loves the kids. He's
very good at bringing out the best in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The social atmosphere of a well-to-do private school wasn't
entirely to Harvey's liking, but he came to Young Harris for an
interview with no expectation that he'd spend half his life here.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his wife, Barbara, had ties to Georgia _ she grew
up in North Carolina, he in New York, Chicago, Kentucky and New
Jersey _ and neither was sold at first sight on this mountain town
just beyond Blairsville. (Pickering, uncertain of its name, said,
``That place where he lives _ Young Harvey or whatever it is.'')
Georgians know it _ if they know it at all _ as the hometown of
former Gov. Zell Miller, not as the site of Young Harris College.
</P>
<P>
   Walking from the campus to show a visitor where they first
lived, Barbara Harvey says there still are moments when she feels
isolated. But it was here that they became middle-aged, saw three
more children follow the infant they brought with them and in time
saw their two oldest move off to pursue their dreams, young in the
same way they once were themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Barbara Harvey, in fact, were even younger than oldest
son Matt, 25, and studying for a Ph.D. in mathematics at John
Hopkins University, and daughter Neesa, 22, married and living in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1968, the pivotal year of a pivotal decade. A student at
East Carolina University, Barbara was waiting tables

   Pushing a popular election-year issue, Al Gore wants to ban guns
from churches and other places of worship. Gore, in a speech in San
Jose, Calif., was announcing support for legislation banning
firearms in churches, synagogues and mosques, as well as where
school events are held. Gore: ``I believe we need to seize upon the
growing consensus that it is time to get guns away from those who
should not have them.'' Gore said he has always believed in the
right of hunters to carry weapons _ ``but America cannot afford
another Columbine, or another Paducah, or another Jonesboro.''

<P>
   BUSH-GAYS MEETING IRKS BAUER ...
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush was praised by gay leaders for reaching out
and meeting with them for an hour, the gathering drew immediate
fire from the religious right. Gary Bauer, the former GOP
presidential hopeful, said: ``Just by meeting with this group of
gay supporters, Gov. Bush has elevated the gay rights agenda to a
level of recognition ... that contradicts our long-standing
commitment to pro-family values.'' Gays who attended the private
gathering, all hand-picked by the Bush campaign, said they wanted
to ``raise his consciousness'' on certain issues _ and report
achieving that goal. Bush said the meeting made him a ``better
person,'' buy did not change his opposition to gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ... AS DOES RIDGE'S PLATFORM POSITION
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer Friday also criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge's
comments regarding the anti-abortion plank in the Republican Party
platform. Ridge ``is disastrously wrong about a central issue in
the Republican Party when he says the right-to-life plank of our
platform should be removed or watered-down, Bauer said. Ridge made
the comments a day earlier as he unveiled the on-line press room at
the Republican convention site this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER TO GIVE THAN ... RIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton paid $92,104 in federal income taxes
and contributed $39,200 to charity this time around, according to
tax returns released Friday. Al and Tipper Gore paid $59,178 in
taxes and gave $15,000 to charity. Following their usual practice,
George W. and Laura Bush will seek an extension while awaiting
information from a blind trust that manages his assets. He'll make
an estimated tax payment Monday to cover any money owed.
</P>
<P>
   UH, BETTER GIVE THAT REPORT ANOTHER LOOK
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, smarting from news that its
leader contributed to Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, postponed
public discussion of a report said to criticize Mayor Rudy
Giuliani's New York Police Department. The commission denied any
connection. Mary Frances Berry contributed to the first lady's
campaign. Berry gave $250 last year to Clinton and another $300 to
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Said Giuliani: ``It
doesn't take much to figure out this is a political operation.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK, IT'S RUDY PULLING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani has moved back ahead of Hillary Rodham Clinton in
the latest poll, but within the margin of error. The survey by
Zogby International found the mayor leading the first lady 45
percent to 44 percent; the margin of error is 3.8 percentage
points. Giuliani had fallen behind Clinton in recent polls,
apparently because of a backlash over his handling of the latest
fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING TIDE IN CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has moved ahead of George W. Bush in
Connecticut, according to a just-released presidential poll. The
Quinnipiac College Poll (3.2 percentage point margin of error)
found gave Gore a 48 percent to 39 percent lead. In February, the
race was considered a dead heat among Connecticut voters, while
back in October Bush led Gore.
</P>
<P>
   TIT FOR TAT, TALLY FOR TALLY
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns are crunching some serious numbers
as each scolds the other for ducking separate issues: Al Gore, the
media; Republican George W. Bush, a candidate debate. ``Al Gore
today canceled a scheduled news conference, which would have been
the first in 54 days,'' declared a news release by the Bush
campaign. Gore ducked reporters in North Carolina, it charged, so
as to avoid questions about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez . Not to be
outdone, Gore aides released their own statement showing off some
math as well: ``George W. Bush has managed to bob and weave away
from debating Gore for 30 days in a row,'' referring to an e-mail
debate challenge sent last month.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RAPPORT WITH REPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, when the presidential race was gathering steam,
the reporters covering George W. Bush flew in a different plane
than he did, run by a company with a name just begging to be
spoofed. Access Air, the charter outfit's title, became No Access
Air, the passengers' lament. Bush insisted for months that his
visits with traveling reporters be off the record. But that was
then; this is now. With John McCain out of the running now, Bush
has reached boldly for the mantle of Chattiest Candidate. He talked
and talked and talked, about the serious and frivolous, everything
and nothing, for an hour during one flight and nearly 90 minutes
during another recently, underlining a striking evolution of his
methods.
</P>
<P>
   HE COULD HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO GOLF WITH O.J.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest political race in Southern California is looking
lopsided these days, with Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil
Garcetti lagging so far behind challenger Steve Cooley that some
say he can't come back. Amid a burgeoning police scandal, a Los
Angeles Times poll this week showed Garcetti trailing Cooley, his
deputy, 55 percent to 18 percent. The rest were undecided. Some say
the gap is insurmountable, with voters intent on showing
disapproval of him. But who knows? After all, he he won re-election
in 1996, when the acquittal of O.J. Simpson was still fresh in
voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MUCH HEAT IN THE KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ``personal attacks'' on his personal life, George Grogan
abandoned his quest for the Nebraska Senate seat left open by the
retirement of Democrat Bob Kerrey. Grogan, a businessman whom polls
had running second to state Attorney General Don Stenberg in the
primary contest, said his family had been hurt by news disclosures
about his three divorces, a business bankruptcy and an arrest on a
charge of disorderly conduct _ a charge he said was eventually
dismissed. The Democratic nomination is expected to go to former
Gov. Ben Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   WASTE NOT, WANT NOT
</P>
<P>
   A demand by top congressional Republicans that President Clinton
sign a newly passed bill creating a national nuclear waste disposal
site in Nevada is making life politically difficult for John
Ensign, a former congressman running for retiring Democratic Sen.
Richard Bryan's Senate seat. Ensign is a Republican, too, but one
who adamantly opposes the waste site, as do many Nevada voters and,
not least of all, Ensign's Democratic opponent, Ed Bernstein.
Ensign led Bernstein, a lawyer, by more than 20 points in the last
poll and, in an effort to hold that edge, he accused his fellow
Republicans the other day of ``wasting time and energy'' by pushing
for passage of a bill that Clinton has promised to veto.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY AND THE TELEPHONE
</P>
<P>
   Brian Schweitzer, a Montana Democrat and rancher running for the
seat of Republican Sen. Conrad Burns, has accused a polling company
of illegally using automated telephone messages to fight his plan
to lower drug prices. Montana law prohibits the use of automated
systems to dial telephone numbers and play messages designed to
sell a product or promote a political campaign. Schweitzer said the
polling company was hired by Citizens for Better Medicare, which
supports Burns. The group acknowledged that phone calls had been
made, but said people called were asked only for their their views
on health care, and if any violation had occurred, the calls would
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY AND THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites are trying to make money by turning Internet
users into armchair political activists. About a dozen for-profit
democracy portals have popped up in the last few months, bringing
with them the technology to track the interests of users and then
sell that information to politicians and special-interest groups
trying to target potential supporters. Some of these Web sites are
vote.com, bettervote.com and grassroots.com. Project Vote Smart, a
nonprofit organization that runs a similar democracy site, has
assumed the role of watchdog _ trying to encourage debate about
where to draw the line between privacy and money-making.

   ELIAN _ MIAMI _ Both sides in the Elian Gonzales case remained
defiant Friday as they awaited the decision of a federal appeals
court on whether the 6-year-old Cuban rafter must be transferred to
the custodianship of his father. Large crowds remained outside the
Little Havana home where the boy is staying with relatives. But in
Washington, there were indications the government's patience is
wearing thin. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner said the relatives are ``not in
compliance with the law'' and vowed the feds will take
``appropriate'' action ``when we're ready.'' (MWilliams, Cox News

TURMOIL IN ZIMBABWE WORRIES SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In a warning that underscores the
widening reach of Zimbabwe's economic and political meltdown, the
biggest business and trade organization in South Africa this week
urged its 40,000 members to delay any new investment in the
crisis-ridden neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Already a number of South African companies with significant
interests in Zimbabwe have taken steps to shield themselves from
the escalating problems there, said Kevin Wakeford, the chief
executive of the trade organization, the South African Chamber of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of farms in Zimbabwe have been raided in recent weeks
by black squatters, raising concern about the state of the
country's important agricultural sector and heightening fears

</P>
<P>
   The squatters, led by veterans of the 1970s guerrilla war
against white minority rule, say they are reclaiming land stolen
decades ago from their ancestors by white settlers.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe, who has made little progress in
redistributing land during his 20 years in power, has condoned the
farm invasions despite a Zimbabwe court order against them. Mugabe
considers the squatters disenfranchised peasants who make up most
of the country's population and who have been the base of his
party's power.
</P>
<P>
   Trade with Zimbabwe, South Africa's largest trading partner in
the region, makes up about 3.5 percent of South Africa's total
exports and heavily favors South Africa. Still South Africa, with
its far bigger economy, sees trade with its neighbor, though small
in total volume compared with the European Union and the United
States, as strategically important.
</P>
<P>
   The economic troubles have hobbled that trade, in both
directions. Zimbabwe has been short of cash, and after
international donors alleged government mismanagement and cut off
loans, the shortage worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Currency and credit problems have followed, and now the volatile
atmosphere has added another obstacle, with traders in recent days
finding it increasingly difficult to insure goods.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after days of futility, National Ingredients
Supplies, a South African food-processing company and a subsidiary
of Anglovaal Industries Ltd., finally found an underwriter for the
$8 million of soybeans it bought earlier this year. Only Lloyds of
London was willing to insure the stockpile, much of it sitting in a
silo on an occupied farm. The insurance will cost the company five
times the normal price, said Steve Brooks, National's logistics
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders said such problems, if they persist, would
erode all of southern Africa's reputation among investors and
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Zimbabwe's economic problems is reflected in the
basic financial data on the country.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation in Zimbabwe soared 70 percent last year and is
projected at 65 percent this year, according to the World Bank.
Gross domestic product growth was zero last year and is forecast to
fall 1 percent this year; the fiscal deficit is growing and the
value of the Zimbabwe dollar has fallen by half in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign exchange reserves have plunged, making it much harder
for the country and its businesses to pay for imported goods,
notably fuel.

   African Oxygen Ltd., a South African producer and distributor of
industrial gases and a subsidiary of BOC Group, sells supplies to a
sister company, BOC Zimbabwe, and the effects of the foreign
currency shortage have been severe, said Jimmy Marriott, the
executive director for industrial operations at African Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are certainly not getting the level of foreign exchange

   South Africa's Tongaat-Hulett Group Ltd., a large producer of
sugar and a unit of Anglo American Corp. of South Africa, employs
8,000 people in Zimbabwe and for the last three years has been
sitting on plans for a $100 million expansion in Zimbabwe. The
country's unpredictable land politics, the crumbling economy and
now the breakdown of law and order have kept Tongaat-Hulett from
moving forward with its plans, the company's chief executive,
Cedric Savage, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, it's still one of the best places to invest in
agriculture,'' Savage said. ``It's the lowest cost producer of
sugar in the world. It's a place where economically you'd want to
invest money, but politically just about every political action
taken discourages that.''

<P>
   Japanese scientists have found that smoking causes wrinkles by
upsetting the body's mechanism for renewing skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the finding confirms the long-held view that
smoking ages skin prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Skin stays healthy and young-looking because of a fine balance
between two processes that are constantly at work. The first
process breaks down old skin while the second makes new skin. The
body breaks down the old skin with enzymes called matrix
metalloproteinases, or MMPs. They chop up the fibers that form
collagen _ the connective tissue that makes up around 80 percent of
normal skin.
</P>
<P>
   Akimichi Morita and his colleagues at Nagoya City University
Medical School suspected that smoking disrupted the body's natural
process of breaking down old skin and renewing it. To test their
idea, they made a solution of cigarette smoke by pumping smoke
through a saline solution. Smoke was sucked from cigarettes for
two-seconds every minute. Tiny drops of this smoke solution were
added to dishes of human fibroblasts, the skin cells that produce
collagen.
</P>
<P>
   After a day in contact with smoke solution, the researchers
tested the skin cells to see how much collagen-degrading MMP they
were making. Morita found that cells exposed to cigarette smoke had
produced far more MMP than normal skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Morita also tested the skin cells to see how much new collagen
they were producing. He found that the smoke caused a drop in the
production of fresh collagen by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He says that this combined effect of degrading collagen more
rapidly and producing less new collagen is probably what causes
premature skin aging in smokers. In both cases, the more
concentrated the smoke solution the greater the effect on collagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests the amount of collagen is important for skin
aging,'' Morita said. ``It looks like less collagen means more
wrinkle formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morita doesn't know if this is the whole story of why smokers
have more wrinkles. But he plans to confirm his findings by testing
skin samples from smokers and nonsmokers of various ages to see if
the smoking has the same effect on collagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've only done this in the lab,'' he says. ``We don't
know exactly what happens in the body yet _ that might take some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dermatologists are impressed by the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fascinating,'' said Lawrence Parish, director of the
Center for International Dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia. This confirms scientifically what we've
long expected, he says. ``Tobacco smoke is injurious to skin.'' &QL;

<P>
   A drug designed 30 years ago to treat multiple sclerosis might
suppress a whole range of autoimmune diseases. It produces a shift
in the immune system that counteracts the way the body turns on
itself, say U.S. researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The body can mount two distinct types of immune response: Th1 or
Th2. The two are antagonistic _ signals that stimulate one inhibit
the other and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory, Th1-type response
destroys proteins in the myelin sheath that covers nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, researchers in Israel synthesized a drug made from
amino acids found in myelin basic protein. The drug, glatiramer
acetate (GA), seemed to protect the nerves of animals with multiple
sclerosis-like diseases, presumably by attracting immune system
cells that would otherwise attack myelin. Patients given the drug
also had fewer relapses.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Hafler at Harvard Medical School and his team have
evidence that the drug alters the immune system in a more general
way. They analyzed T-cell lines from multiple sclerosis patients
before and after a long course of GA treatment, and then looked at
how these cells responded to antigens such as myelin basic protein,
GA itself, and other proteins and peptides associated with
autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   After treatment with GA, T cells are more likely to cross-react
with many different peptides. Crucially, they also released Th2
cytokines: signals that should elicit a Th2 response and counteract
the Th1 response to the peptides involved in multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was previously thought it worked by looking like the myelin
protein,'' Hafler said. But it ``kind of looks like everything'',
because it is a random arrangement of four amino acids created
before scientists knew precisely how to generate a desired protein.
Because GA stimulates a shift away from the damaging Th1 response,
Hafler believes that it could be useful for treating autoimmune
diseases caused by other antigens.
</P>
<P>
   Hafler points out that Igal Gery at the National Institutes of
Health near Washington D.C. recently found that the drug protects
mice against an autoimmune eye disease called uveoretinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Martin, of the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, has completed a similar but unpublished study
of how GA affects T cells. He said that it would be difficult to
prove that the shift to Th2 is truly the mechanism behind GA's
effectiveness against multiple sclerosis. But he agrees that the
theory makes sense. &QL;

   Your sense of humor has nothing to do with your genes, and
everything to do with your upbringing, according to new finding by
biologists in London.
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised to find that whether you love or hate Gary
Larson cartoons depends on the way you were raised. Genes don't
seem to shape appreciation of this kind of humor at all.
</P>
<P>
   Most personality traits, such as being a shrinking violet or the
life and soul of the party, are at least partly determined by your
genes, so researchers suspected the same applies to our sense of
humor. To find out, Tim Spector, Lynn Cherkas and their colleagues
at St. Thomas' Hospital in London tested the humor of 71 pairs of
identical twins and 56 pairs of fraternal twins. Each pair had been
raised together.
</P>
<P>
   The team asked each pair of twins to go into separate rooms and
rate five cartoons from Gary Larson's ``The Far Side'' on a scale
of 0 to 10. A zero deemed the cartoon a waste of paper, while 10
meant it was one of the funniest cartoons the subject had ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that siblings tend to have similar views on
the degree to which a cartoon is funny. But identical twins, who
have exactly the same genes, were no more likely to agree on this
than fraternal twins, who share only half of their genes on
average, like ordinary siblings. That suggests it's a shared
environment, rather than shared genes, that makes brothers and
sisters laugh at the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprise, because most personality traits have genetic
components,'' Spector said. ``This implies that there's a lot of
cultural influence on humor.'' That might explain why popular jokes
vary so much between nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is interesting, because twin studies of personality
traits almost always show genetic effects,'' said Robert Plomin, a
behavioral geneticist at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
However, he would like to see a larger study confirm the findings,
and it may be that the results depend heavily on the specific
nature of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Spector agrees his team has studied only one type of humor _
so-called cognitive humor, which involves a blending of
contradictory ideas. They now hope to tackle the task of testing
other kinds of humor, such as sexual innuendo, possibly using
English saucy seaside postcards. &QL;

   Fasten your seat belts and hold on tight _ intergalactic space
travel is back on the agenda. Skeptics who dismiss the idea of
faster-than-light travel through wormholes in space may have to
think again. New calculations based on Einstein's general theory of
relativity suggest that wormholes large and stable enough to allow
intergalactic travel really can exist.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the cosmos is peppered with short cuts
through space and time has intrigued people since 1915 when German
theorist Ludwig Flamm found hints of their existence in Einstein's
equations. While attempts to unify the fundamental forces of nature
suggest that tiny quantum wormholes may exist, most experts suspect
that some fundamental law of physics prevents the formation of
large wormholes _ not least because these would theoretically allow
time travelers to go back in time and, say, prevent their own birth
by accidentally killing one of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Russian theorist has found a new type of wormhole that is
compatible with the known laws of physics, yet can be as big and
stable as you like. According to Sergei Krasnikov, a relativity
expert at the Pulkovo Observatory in St Petersburg, the standard
arguments against large wormholes assume that they all have the
same basic shape, and need to be crammed with exotic matter to keep
them open.
</P>
<P>
   Such exotic matter has never been seen, but theory suggests it
can be created literally out of nothing when space and time are
curved in the right way. What Krasnikov has found is a new type of
wormhole that can create its own supply of exotic matter _ and in
sufficient quantities to make it big enough and keep it open long
enough for people to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new wormhole, like every other, needs exotic matter for
it to form, and like some others can produce it by itself,''
Krasnikov said. ``What's new is that this wormhole actually
generates enough to make it arbitrarily large.''
</P>
<P>
   Other theorists admit to being intrigued by the new work, but
remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth taking seriously,'' said Ian Moss, a relativity
expert at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in England. ``The
main worry is that it could fall down on some technical detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Davies of Imperial College, London, adds that proving
something is theoretically possible does not prove it actually
exists. ``My feeling is that the matter is still open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnikov accepts that testing his claims by building a wormhole
is far beyond present technology. Even so, such wormholes may have
been left over from the big bang, he said. Finding one would have a
dramatic effect on interstellar travel: ``If there is a wormhole
connecting the vicinities of the Earth and the star Vega, one can
take a short cut by flying through it.'' &QL;

MIX OF COMEDY AND RELIGION IS ODDLY EFFECTIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theater previews for ``Keeping the Faith'' promise a pratfall
movie about religion.
</P>
<P>
   A young Catholic seminarian (Edward Norton) catches his robes on
fire and puts them out in the holy water.
</P>
<P>
   A young rabbinical student (Ben Stiller) attends a circumcision
and faints.
</P>
<P>
   Ha ha, cheap laughs. You can understand why the movie is sold
that way. But there is more than fall-down comedy to ``Keeping the
Faith.'' Trust me.
</P>
<P>
   For his first film as director and producer, and his first major
comedy lead, Edward Norton, our best young dramatic film actor, has
tackled an unlikely subject and come up with a winning, thoughtful
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Schram (Stiller) and Brian Kilkenny Finn (Norton) are pals
who grew up on New York's Upper West Side. As boys they shared an
interest in sports (they were crummy), in girls (they were
crummier) and religion (they were great). Jake was Jewish and Brian
was Catholic, but they supported each other's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Their only childhood female success was smart, independent Anna
Reilly. ``She was that magical blend of Johnny Quest and Tatum
O'Neal in `Foxes,''' Brian says. Anna became their pal and for a
glorious time they were like the Three Musketeers. Then Anna's
family moved away.
</P>
<P>
   Jake and Brian grow up to be religious leaders in their old
neighborhood, worshipping ``an old-world God with a new-age spin.''
Brian is the hippest priest, popular with youth, though he makes
some of the elders uncomfortable. Jake is the coolest rabbi. All
the mothers want him to marry their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Brian and Jake still work together on community projects and
interfaith understanding.
</P>
<P>
   At a crucial point in their careers, just as they are about to
advance to major positions, Anna (Jenna Elfman) moves back to town.
</P>
<P>
   Anna was great as a kid, but now she's something more. She's
attractive, yes, but more than that, she's attitude on legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work harder than God,'' she tells the boys. ``If he'd hired
me I would have made the world by Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a corporate whizbang and woman of the world, Anna still
likes to play tomboy and flirt.
</P>
<P>
   The boys adore her, but that's all they can do, right? Brian is
a priest, and Jake knows he'd darn well better marry within his
faith or kiss advancement goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   If only life, religion and human emotions were that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Director Norton and screenwriter Stuart Blumberg (``Mad TV'')
have enriched the inevitable complications, not only with a lot of
laughs but also with a respect and affection for the characters and
for their faiths.
</P>
<P>
   We can guess right away that both Jake and Brian will find their
traditions or vows challenged, that they will have a falling-out
over Anna, and so forth. What is far less expected is how deftly
and sincerely it is handled.
</P>
<P>
   On a Central Park walk, Anna asks Brian if he'll answer a few
personal questions all priests hear eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we gonna have the sex talk here?'' he asks her with
patience. ``I know you've got a list of questions. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   A comic scene becomes thoughtful as Brian explains why he places
his spiritual needs above his physical ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are several such moments of underlying seriousness in
``Keeping the Faith,'' but we're not shortchanged on laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The ending gets a little too cute, and isn't true to Anna's
independent nature. Oh well, to forgive is divine.
</P>
<P>
   Actors say good comedy comes out of drama, so it should be no
surprise than Norton, twice Oscar-nominated (``Primal Fear'' and
``American History X''), can handle it just fine. Stiller's comic
talents also shine.
</P>
<P>
   The film's real treat, however, is Elfman. Her Anna is the
antithesis of the sweetly daffy love interest we find as the female
lead in too many Hollywood romantic comedies. Rather than cute,
Elfman makes her sassy, brainy, competitive, outspoken and sexy.
She's even taller than both men. Movies need more women like her. &QL;

RENEWED FOCUS ON HOLOCAUST VICTIMS' UNTRACED ASSETS IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a basement meeting room in the Israeli
Parliament, a committee of legislators is trying to unravel a
tangled and troubling legacy of the Holocaust that has gone
unexplored for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, led by Colette Avital, a lawmaker from the
governing One Israel Party and former Israeli consul-general in New
York, is investigating what happened to bank accounts, plots of
land and other assets that were held in Israel by Jews who died in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in February at Avital's initiative, the parliamentary
inquiry reflects a growing sense here that Israel should practice
what it has preached.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Jewish organizations, backed by Israel, have
demanded, with considerable success, disclosure by foreign banks
and governments of accounts and other property of Holocaust victims
and survivors they may be holding, so the assets can be returned to
the victims' relatives and the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland agreed more than a year ago to pay compensation of
$1.25 billion after more than 54,00 dormant accounts traced back to
World War II or earlier were found in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   An international panel investigating insurance policies held by
Holocaust victims announced last week that it would publish 19,000
names of policyholders who are owed money.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also emerged that there are untraced assets of
Holocaust victims in Israel. Although the scope of the property is
thought to be far smaller than the assets held in Europe, its very
existence here has raised unsettling questions, especially among
survivors and their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come with clean hands when we make demands on
foreign institutions,'' said Gil Raveh, a lawyer from Tel Aviv who
is trying to trace what became of 1,000 pounds deposited in the
1930s in British-ruled Palestine by his great-grandfather and a
business partner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Sanbar, chairman of the Center of Organizations of
Holocaust Survivors in Israel, said that when it came to tracing
property of Jews who died in the Holocaust, ``Israel has a greater
moral responsibility and should set a good example, not a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jewish investments in Palestine were of a different nature than
the money transferred to Swiss banks for safekeeping. Jews in
Europe bought plots of land and opened bank accounts in Palestine
in the 1920s and 1930s as a way of taking part in the Zionist
enterprise or as a nest egg for possible immigration by them or
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of the investments has never been determined, with
estimates ranging from $40 million in deposited money to land
believed to be worth tens of millions more, including prime real
estate in the heart of Israel. European Jews also bought stocks and
bonds from Zionist agencies and kept money in safe deposit boxes
whose whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   After the outbreak of World War II, land and bank accounts held
by Jews from countries under Nazi rule were seized by the British
mandate government in Palestine as enemy property, and most of the
money was transferred to England.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement with Israel in 1950, the British government
paid back 1.4 million pounds as compensation for the removed funds.
Records of the seized accounts and land were turned over to the
Israeli government and some restitution payments were reportedly
made, but the fate of other accounts and properties remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the matter generated little interest here. Holocaust
survivors who came to Palestine and later to the nascent state of
Israel were focused on rebuilding their lives and tracing missing
relatives, not recovering lost property.
</P>
<P>
   In those early years of nation-building and in subsequent
decades there were other priorities, said Dr. Yossi Katz, a
professor at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv whose study of
Holocaust-era assets in Israel, ``Forgotten Property,'' was
published this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the '90s the issue didn't trouble the public,'' Katz
said. ``Other matters were seen as far more important, such as
security and absorption of immigrants. It's safe to assume that had
the issue not come up recently in Europe, it would not have come up
in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reluctance here to deal with the the Holocaust in
economic terms,'' Katz added. ``It was inconceivable to turn the
Holocaust into a material issue. A younger generation had to come
along that was not directly linked to the Holocaust and could deal
with it less sentimentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Avital said that on the official level, bureaucratic inertia had
prevented effective action to trace and return the unclaimed
assets. ``There was a lot of neglect and lack of sensitivity,'' she
said. ``The attitude was, why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Holocaust-era claims were pressed loudly in Europe,
concerns were voiced that a similar campaign to find assets here
would provoke foreign demands that Israel first put its own house
in order, undercutting the drive for full disclosure abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument was exactly the opposite,'' Avital said. ``We have
a much better moral position when we can go to the Swiss banks and
say we're asking of you what we're asking of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank disclosures abroad led to similar steps in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by hearings in a parliamentary banking committee,
Israeli banks last year handed over lists of 5,000 dormant accounts
to the administrator-general, a Justice Ministry official who
manages unclaimed property. In 1997 the administrator general's
office published a list of more than 11,000 unclaimed bank accounts
and real estate holdings it manages.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Leumi, an Israeli bank that succeeded the pre-independence
Anglo-Palestine Bank, where many of the deposits by European Jews
were made, published on its Internet site in January a list of
accounts that have been inactive since 1955 or earlier. The Jewish
National Fund, a land development agency, published on its site a
list of plots it holds that were sold to Jews before World War II
and remain unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli lawyer, Roland Roth, has filed suits on behalf of
relatives of Holocaust victims against Bank Leumi and the privately
owned Israel Land Development Co., originally set up by the Zionist
movement to buy land in Palestine. Arguing that the bank has not
reported all of the dormant accounts in its possession, Roth is
demanding full disclosure of the accounts and of lands bought by
Jews who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Israeli banks and the land company have resisted
opening their records to outside scrutiny, their stance and the
government's inaction are not seen here as comparable to past
attempts in Switzerland and elsewhere to deny the existence of
Holocaust-era assets and to even cover up their traces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it was negligence at best; in Switzerland it was a
crime,'' said Yona Yahav, a former legislator who as chairman of
the parliamentary banking committee pressed for the Israeli bank
disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no moral equivalence can be drawn between banks in
Israel and Switzerland, the banks here are motivated by a similar
desire to preserve their assets, Roth argued. ``Every economic body
has an interest in holding on to what it can,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet it remains unclear how many Holocaust-era assets are
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Shmuel Tsur, the administrator general, says there are few if
any Jewish-owned bank accounts and properties that were not
confiscated by the British in wartime Palestine as enemy property
and later either returned to their owners or transferred for
management by his office. Of the list of unclaimed accounts and
properties published by his office, fewer than 10 have been
recovered after claims to them were confirmed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that there is no real problem here,'' he said in an
interview. ``I don't know of any reservoir of money or property
that is hidden away somewhere in Israel. The public sense that
property is being concealed is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he was questioned in March by Avital's committee, Tsur
acknowledged that he could not be sure that he had received full
reports from the banks of all dormant accounts, adding that he was
not authorized to audit bank records. ``I start from the assumption
that the bank reports are correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to to do more to find properties of Holocaust
victims, Tsur's office has begun an examination of the 15,000 files
of unclaimed property in his office to find evidence of land or
bank accounts that belonged to Jews who perished in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary committee is considering ways to empower Tsur
or an independent auditor to examine bank records, as part of a
more active government policy to find heirs to property owned by
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a moral obligation towards these people,'' Avital
said, noting that in some cases sums returned by Tsur's office were
absurdly low, an indication that deposited money had not been
invested by the banks or maintained at its real value.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Holocaust victims who have gone to court to claim
their inheritance say they are not motivated by a desire for
material gain.
</P>
<P>
   Eleazar Shafrir, 76, a retired biochemistry professor who fled a
Nazi labor camp in Poland and fought in Israel's war of
independence, is trying to locate a plot of land bought in 1938 by
his father, who died in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get rich from this,'' he said. ``I just want
justice to be done. The state should give people back what they
deserve.''

PATRIOTS OUT OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The fact of the matter is the New England
Patriots have no idea what they are going to do when they make
their first selection in the annual NFL cattle call.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they.
</P>
<P>
   When you are picking 46th, as the Patriots will be unless they
do some difficult wheeling and dealing in a climate where they have
little to offer but a need to move up, no one who is honest about
things can hazard a guess who will be left on the draft board when
New England is called for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing at that point: Somebody will have been
picked whom the Patriots expected to be there and somebody
unexpected will still be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start picking in the second round, there's so little
predictability,'' said coach and draft master Bill Belichick this
week. ``When you pick 46th, you don't really know who'll be there.
Someone will appear, though. There's good talent in this draft and
some depth in it (at certain positions).''
</P>
<P>
   So, what do they do when it's time to do something?
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona State running back J.R. Redmond is still on the board
they should grab him because he has the kind of speed and
elusiveness they lack at that position. In addition, Redmond
catches the ball well coming out of the backfield, which is
important in a Charlie Weis offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Redmond will likely be long gone by then because most teams
feel he is the best of the second-echelon backs, the ones behind
Thomas Jones, Jamal Lewis, Ron Dayne, and Shaun Alexander. Which
brings us to Travis Prentice, a 220-pound production machine out of
Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice more than fits the Belichick size-speed ratio
requirement, as well as the one for production. He was second in
the nation in rushing in 1998, gaining 1,787 yards on 365 carries.
And last year, he didn't take a backward step _ he ran for 1,667
yards on 354 carries and did so with speed and an uncanny ability
to get into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly also has run as fast as 4.37 in the 40, so what's
the problem? Take him and be done with it, right?
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, big fella.
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL scouts believe Prentice has straight-line speed rather
than explosiveness, which is of more importance in the NFL because
the men trying to tackle you are often as fast _ not to mention
bigger _ than you are.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do the Patriots do if faced with no Redmond, a hole in
the running game the size of the Grand Canyon, and a productive
small-college player like Prentice staring them in the face?
</P>
<P>
   If there's an equally rated defensive lineman or offensive
tackle they should go in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice is considerably more of a gamble than Redmond and the
Patriots have taken too many gambles in the draft the last three
years and seldom hit on them. Belichick admits having made the same
mistake in his days picking players for the Cleveland Browns and
says he won't make that mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   When the 46th pick comes up, he may get his first chance to
prove he has a new philosophy. If he does, and Prentice is there
with all those yards behind him in the Mid-American Conference, the
temptation will be to grab him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a temptation that should be fought if there is a
higher-rated player, especially if he is an offensive lineman.
Generally, Belichick does not like to take offensive linemen that
high because they take several years to develop and he believes he
can get players who will be just as good later in the draft, or
even as free agent rookies. He proved he could do that in
Cleveland, but if Southern Cal's Travis Claridge happens to be
there, the Patriots should grab him.
</P>
<P>
   New England has scouted Claridge a great deal, an indication the
Patriots might be leaning in his direction. But if he is gone, they
should still have a shot at someone like 310-pound Cosey Coleman
out of Tennessee, who once was projected as a first-round pick, or
320-pound Hawaii tackle Adrian Klemm.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, Klemm will be gone by the late first round, as
will the prime defensive linemen. So, New England's choices will
probably boil down to running backs and linemen like Claridge.
</P>
<P>
   If that back is Redmond, the Patriots should grab him and hope
he helps improve a running game that was 28th in the NFL a year
ago, in large part due to their backs not hitting holes quickly
enough and the holes not being open for long enough, a deadly
combination.
</P>
<P>
   But if Redmond is gone and Prentice is there, they should think
seriously about getting a road grader to create some much-needed
running room.

 &HT;    Eds: Thursday is CQ
 &HT;    MP3.com buying Cox Interactive Media's share of MP3Radio.com
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MP3.com said Thursday it is buying Cox Interactive
Media's share of MP3Radio.com, an 8-month-old joint venture
designed to help radio stations make their Web sites better.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Cox Interactive, based in Atlanta, bought a 10
percent stake in San Diego-based MP3.com, for $45 million. Part of
the agreement called for Cox and MP3.com to develop what became
MP3Radio.com, a company designed to help radio stations beef up
their Web sites. Cox Interactive is a unit of Cox Enterprises,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com wanted to syndicate a radio show and promote MP3.com
musicians, said Gregg Lindahl, MP3Radio.com's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com decided that its efforts overlapped those of
MP3Radio.com, according to a news release issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. But MP3Radio.com's
headquarters will move to San Diego. Lindahl will not make the
move. He is staying with Cox Interactive but did not say what his
new job will be.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is a program that compresses digital music so it can be
downloaded from the Internet more quickly. Some musicians see the
format and the Internet as a way to cut out the middleman _ the
record publishing industry _ and reach customers directly, letting
fans download bargain-rate CDs from musicians' Web sites. The only
piece missing with the MP3 format is something called digital
rights management technology, a way to make sure everyone who gets
paid now when a CD is sold still will get paid when the music is
delivered digitally.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com and several major record labels were sued in federal
court this week by musicians seeking royalty payments for the
distribution of their songs over the Internet, according to
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes nearly four months after a trade group
representing the record labels sued MP3.com for distributing songs
online.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is still a minority investor in MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   MP3Radio.com has developed Web sites for 118 stations, 28 of
which are Cox-owned.

<P>
   Japanese scientists have found that smoking causes wrinkles by
upsetting the body's mechanism for renewing skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the finding confirms the long-held view that
smoking ages skin prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Skin stays healthy and young-looking because of a fine balance
between two processes that are constantly at work. The first
process breaks down old skin while the second makes new skin. The
body breaks down the old skin with enzymes called matrix
metalloproteinases, or MMPs. They chop up the fibers that form
collagen _ the connective tissue that makes up around 80 percent of
normal skin.
</P>
<P>
   Akimichi Morita and his colleagues at Nagoya City University
Medical School suspected that smoking disrupted the body's natural
process of breaking down old skin and renewing it. To test their
idea, they made a solution of cigarette smoke by pumping smoke
through a saline solution. Smoke was sucked from cigarettes for
two-seconds every minute. Tiny drops of this smoke solution were
added to dishes of human fibroblasts, the skin cells that produce
collagen.
</P>
<P>
   After a day in contact with smoke solution, the researchers
tested the skin cells to see how much collagen-degrading MMP they
were making. Morita found that cells exposed to cigarette smoke had
produced far more MMP than normal skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Morita also tested the skin cells to see how much new collagen
they were producing. He found that the smoke caused a drop in the
production of fresh collagen by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He says that this combined effect of degrading collagen more
rapidly and producing less new collagen is probably what causes
premature skin aging in smokers. In both cases, the more
concentrated the smoke solution the greater the effect on collagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests the amount of collagen is important for skin
aging,'' Morita said. ``It looks like less collagen means more
wrinkle formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morita doesn't know if this is the whole story of why smokers
have more wrinkles. But he plans to confirm his findings by testing
skin samples from smokers and nonsmokers of various ages to see if
the smoking has the same effect on collagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've only done this in the lab,'' he says. ``We don't
know exactly what happens in the body yet _ that might take some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dermatologists are impressed by the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fascinating,'' said Lawrence Parish, director of the
Center for International Dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia. This confirms scientifically what we've
long expected, he says. ``Tobacco smoke is injurious to skin.'' &QL;

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks went into free fall on Friday as
investors had to digest surprisingly bad news on inflation and the
fear of higher interest rates. The beleaguered Nasdaq index plunged
a near record 10 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell more than 5 percent each. The
fall ended the worst week ever for the Nasdaq composite. Almost no
company survived unscathed. All 30 stocks in the Dow fell while all
but 16 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 index were down. The impact of the
decline is even greater because it comes on the back of several
weeks of wild daily market swings and the plunge of the Nasdaq
earlier this week into bear market territory. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer and Alex Berenson.

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Floyd Norris looks at the
relationship between the stock market and the economy as a whole

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ARMS (Moscow) _ In his first legislative initiative as
elected president, Vladimir Putin on Friday won ratification of the
START-2 treaty, which the parliament had blocked for seven years.
The treaty calls for cutting the American and Russian nuclear
arsenals by half. The passage was seen as a sign that Putin seeks a
constructive relationship with the West, but also that he intends
fight hard to block American efforts to revise or abandon earlier
arms-control treaties. By Michael R. Gordon.

new trade terms for countries in Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean, setting the stage for congressional approval in the next
few weeks. Negotiators reached a breakthrough, agreeing to provide
a measure of protection for American textile manufacturers, though
not as much as the industry and its allies in the Senate had
sought. By Eric Schmitt.

<P>
   NADER-POLITICS (Minneapolis) _ Forget six year's of booming
economic growth and skyrocketing stock markets. Globe-trotting
corporations are sucking the life out of small business owners and
family farmers. Pollution is poisoning our rivers, lakes and air.
Inner city schools and health clinics are crumbling. And while the
nation burns, the rich are buying and selling politicians like
cheap baseball cards. ``Big business is on a collision course with
American democracy, and American democracy has been losing.'' Those
are the words of Ralph Nader, who is mounting another radical
campaign for the presidency. But this time things are a little
different. He's raising money this time and enlisting the help of
left-leaning celebrities like Jackson Browne and Warren Beatty.
He's also managed to pluck some of the supports of Bill Bradley who
can't quite stomach the thought of supporting Al Gore, and he's set
his sights on winning at least 5 percent of the vote for the Green
Party. So far he seems to be succeeding, elbowing out Pat Buchanan
for third place in some recent polls. And if that happens, Nader
may be Al Gore's worst nightmare. By James Dao.

federal appeals court Friday to order Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives to return the boy to his father, who agreed to stay in

that Elian stay. (Summary from wires) By David Johnston.

REDUCING THE DAMAGE WHEN IMMUNE SYSTEMS TURN NASTY

<P>
   A drug designed 30 years ago to treat multiple sclerosis might
suppress a whole range of autoimmune diseases. It produces a shift
in the immune system that counteracts the way the body turns on
itself, say U.S. researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The body can mount two distinct types of immune response: Th1 or
Th2. The two are antagonistic _ signals that stimulate one inhibit
the other and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory, Th1-type response
destroys proteins in the myelin sheath that covers nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, researchers in Israel synthesized a drug made from
amino acids found in myelin basic protein. The drug, glatiramer
acetate (GA), seemed to protect the nerves of animals with multiple
sclerosis-like diseases, presumably by attracting immune system
cells that would otherwise attack myelin. Patients given the drug
also had fewer relapses.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Hafler at Harvard Medical School and his team have
evidence that the drug alters the immune system in a more general
way. They analyzed T-cell lines from multiple sclerosis patients
before and after a long course of GA treatment, and then looked at
how these cells responded to antigens such as myelin basic protein,
GA itself, and other proteins and peptides associated with
autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   After treatment with GA, T cells are more likely to cross-react
with many different peptides. Crucially, they also released Th2
cytokines: signals that should elicit a Th2 response and counteract
the Th1 response to the peptides involved in multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was previously thought it worked by looking like the myelin
protein,'' Hafler said. But it ``kind of looks like everything'',
because it is a random arrangement of four amino acids created
before scientists knew precisely how to generate a desired protein.
Because GA stimulates a shift away from the damaging Th1 response,
Hafler believes that it could be useful for treating autoimmune
diseases caused by other antigens.
</P>
<P>
   Hafler points out that Igal Gery at the National Institutes of
Health near Washington D.C. recently found that the drug protects
mice against an autoimmune eye disease called uveoretinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Martin, of the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, has completed a similar but unpublished study
of how GA affects T cells. He said that it would be difficult to
prove that the shift to Th2 is truly the mechanism behind GA's
effectiveness against multiple sclerosis. But he agrees that the
theory makes sense. &QL;

 &HT;    2000 NFL mock draft
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig and Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Cleveland: DE Courtney Brown, Penn State _ Only natural that
Browns draft Brown. Cleveland had NFL-low 25 sacks in '99. Brown
had 13.5. He provides instant pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   2. Washington: LT Chris Samuels, Alabama _ Like a rock ...
Gibraltar, that is. The big guy didn't give up a sack or QB
pressure in '99. He'll turn offense into a crimson tide.
</P>
<P>
   3. Washington: LB LaVar Arrington, Penn State _ How badly do
Redskins want leapin' LaVar? Very. Adding Arrington to this defense
has franchise thinking ``Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Cincinnati: WR Peter Warrick, Florida State _ Bengals can't
believe Warrick is still available. He joins QB Akili Smith as
back-to-back potential No. 1s spurned by Browns.
</P>
<P>
   5. Baltimore: WR Plaxico Burress, Michigan State _ Perfect guy
to help Ravens upgrade skill positions. Here's your prototype
receiver. He's a big, strong leaper who dominates.
</P>
<P>
   6. Philadelphia: DT Corey Simon, Florida State _ Eagles want
Warrick, but need a tackle to anchor defensive front. At 6-1, 297,
he has a 41-inch vertical leap. Simon says, ``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   7. Arizona: TB Thomas Jones, Virginia _ Cardinals need premier
runner, so Jones is a good fit. Built like Emmitt Smith, the 5-10,
216-pounder hits the hole fast and explodes.
</P>
<P>
   8. Pittsburgh: WR Travis Taylor, Florida _ Coach Bill Cowher
needs to win, so he can't take QB Chad Pennington and groom him.
Taylor can jump-start Kordell Stewart's career.
</P>
<P>
   9. Chicago: OLB Brian Urlacher, New Mexico _ Defense is a huge
priority and Urlacher gets the call because he's a wonderful
athlete with the versatility to play strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   10. Baltimore: TB Jamal Lewis, Tennessee _ Freakish combination
of size (5-11, 240) and speed is too tempting to pass up. But
injury-riddled past makes him a little risky.
</P>
<P>
   11. New York Giants: TB Ron Dayne, Wisconsin _ NCAA career
rushing leader (6,397) fits team's smash-mouth style. The power
back runs over defenders. Can control a game.
</P>
<P>
   12. New York Jets: DE Shaun Ellis, Tennessee _ Jets need help in
several areas. They'll start on defense with the second best end in
the draft. Has good strength and explosion.
</P>
<P>
   13. New York Jets: WR Sylvester Morris, Jackson State _ Keyshawn
Johnson's trade leaves a huge void that the tall, athletic Morris
can fill. He scored 32 TDs last two years.
</P>
<P>
   14. Green Bay: DT Chris Hovan, Boston College _ Packers want
defensive line help and Hovan, with 21 tackles for loss in '99,
gives them a run-stuffer similar to Gilbert Brown.
</P>
<P>
   15. Denver: OLB John Abraham, South Carolina _ Broncos are
tempted to take a WR, but LB is vital with John Mobley coming off
torn ACL and Bill Romanowski slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   16. San Francisco: QB Chad Pennington, Marshall _ Niners are
ready to tap him as Steve Young's replacement. He's a quick enough
study to come in and start as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   17. Oakland: FS Deon Grant, Tennessee _ Raiders need safety help
to go with superb corners. Grant led nation with nine
interceptions, but needs to improve in run support.
</P>
<P>
   18. New York Jets: TE Bubba Franks, Miami (Fla.) _ Franks' stock
slipped after disappointing workouts, but he's a monster who can
carry load as blocker and receiver.
</P>
<P>
   19. Seattle: ILB Rob Morris, BYU _ He's 25 years old, which
scares some scouts. But Pro Football Weekly calls this sure, hard
hitter the best inside 'backer of past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   20. Detroit: LT Chris McIntosh, Wisconsin _ ``Big Mac'' is a
huge, strong, four-year starter who will provide running room for
James Stewart and protection for Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   21. Kansas City: TB Shaun Alexander, Alabama _ Answered
questions about speed by clocking 4.4 in workouts. Bengals could
trade Corey Dillon and grab Alexander right here.
</P>
<P>
   22. Seattle: WR Dez White, Georgia Tech _ He's the perfect speed
receiver to replace Dallas-bound Joey Galloway. Scouts knock his
hands, but White's a physical specimen.
</P>
<P>
   23. Carolina: RT Stockar McDougle, Oklahoma _ McDougle is a
devastating drive blocker who crushes defenders, but struggles in
pass protection against speed rushers.
</P>
<P>
   24. San Francisco: CB Rashard Anderson, Jackson State _
Rebuilding the defense starts with a corner and this 6-2, 206 pound
athlete has the size and speed the 49ers need.
</P>
<P>
   25. Minnesota: DE John Engelberger, Virginia Tech _ An
outstanding pass rusher who will work well with Ellis. He parlayed
terrific speed and quickness into 30 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
   26. Buffalo: CB Ahmed Plummer, Ohio State _ The steadiest of all
the corners, look for Plummer to become Bills' nickel while
ex-Buckeye Antoine Winfield grabs starting role.
</P>
<P>
   27. New York Jets: RT Todd Wade, Mississippi _ This massive
blocker has the strength and bulk (6-7, 326) to move people. He
also has the frame to protect Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   28. Indianapolis: LB Keith Bulluck, Syracuse _ The Colts don't
have a proven middle LB, so they'll tap Bulluck, who has all the
tools. He's fast, quick, smooth and tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   29. Jacksonville: OG Cosey Coleman, Tennessee _ When a team has
everything, what does it do? It continues to stockpile offensive
linemen. The huge Coleman is a nice fit.
</P>
<P>
   30. Tennessee: DT Steve Warren, Nebraska _ The AFC champs need
some help on the defensive front. Warren will excel playing next to
speed rusher Jevon ``The Freak'' Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   31. St. Louis: LT Adrian Klemm, Hawaii _ Although the Rams are
tempted to take PK Sebastian Janikowski, they'll turn to Klemm to
provide depth behind Orlando Pace.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Welsh hyphenate writer-director-actor Justin
Kerrigan blew into New York on Sunday night, the people at Miramax,
which is releasing ``Human Traffic,'' his film on the rave scene,
must have gone for the Advil.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Kerrigan, 26, is one of those bad boys who trash
hotel rooms. It's that he's candid about his decadent drug-fueled
lifestyle, which is celebrated in his film.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it's pretty entertaining to meet him flying without
a conversational governor in a bar in Greenwich Village, just off
the plane from London, as he sets out to party through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan is emblematic of a batch of ravequake directors who
have established a new genre of beach party movies set in the club
world of the '90s. A night with him seemed like a live-action
version of his film, jarringly unabashed and slightly blurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Traffic'' details 48 hours in the lives of five
20-somethings in Cardiff, Wales, who are stuck in dead-end jobs and
live for Saturday night, when they can take drugs and dance. It is
based on him and his friends, and the subplot about impotence is
based on his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sexual insecurity big time,'' he offered. ``But I got
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The working life of the characters in the film is also familiar
ground. Kerrigan worked in the British Home Stores when he wasn't
on the dole. That was before Miramax flew him business class on
British Airways to New York, after giving him a three-picture deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for drugs, another subplot in the movie, Kerrigan not only
likes them, he makes no secret of doing them. At 11 p.m. he broke
away from sipping Jack Daniel's and Cokes to slip into the
limousine to call a friend. He just wanted to make sure that when
he was finished drinking Jack Daniel's and Cokes he could drop by
and get stoned.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude has taken Kerrigan from Cardiff to the highest
circles. He refers to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax, which bought the
film last fall, as ``the Al Capone of the movie industry.'' Last
year, he met the Queen at Windsor Castle after ``Human Traffic''
won some awards. ``And I wanted to say, `Have you seen this
film?'''
</P>
<P>
   There he was, he said, in the Great Hall, and in came the queen
``and her posse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly she's there and I didn't know what to do, so I stuck
out my hand,'' he said. ``You're not supposed to touch the queen or
make the first move. But she was nice and she took my hand. And
then she stayed to talk. And finally I said, `So do you rent this
place out for parties?'''
</P>
<P>
   He shared the information that he smoked a joint in the Great
Hall, and that ``I woke up in Bayswater with no money, no cab fare,
and I had to stop and say, `What happened?'''
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, the car was headed uptown to party sites unknown,
and it was time for this reporter to be dropped off. Sharing his
gen-Ecstacy philosophy about success, Kerrigan made clear that
people can get all they need from the visual environment. ``I've
only read four books in my entire life,'' he said. They are
``Conversations With Woody Allen,'' ``Conversations With Martin
Scorsese,'' Douglas Coupland's ``Generation X'' and `` Nice Guy,''
by Howard Marks, a pot dealer.
</P>
<P>
   He fretted about his schedule. The next day he would leave for
other cities. ``Miramax is giving me two days off in Houston,'' he
said. ``They're turning me loose in John Wayne territory. What are
they going to make of me in Houston?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, anyone who can handle Harvey Weinstein and the queen can
handle Houston.

   COXNET INSIDE NASCAR 0413 _ At Daytona, NASCAR controlled the
rear and front shocks put on every Winston Cup car. At Talladega,
the sports governing body has said it will only be in charge of the
rear shocks, leaving the front up to the team. What do drivers
think about all of this? Do they think this will cause the cars to
perform better or worse than Daytona? What difference will it make
to be able to put in your own front shocks? NASCAR already controls
the restrictor plates at Talladega, how do drivers feel about
giving up more control with shocks? Why is NASCAR doing this?

   COXNET INSIDE NASCAR 0413 _ At Daytona, NASCAR controlled the
rear and front shocks put on every Winston Cup car. At Talladega,
the sports governing body has said it will only be in charge of the
rear shocks, leaving the front up to the team. What do drivers
think about all of this? Do they think this will cause the cars to
perform better or worse than Daytona? What difference will it make
to be able to put in your own front shocks? NASCAR already controls
the restrictor plates at Talladega, how do drivers feel about
giving up more control with shocks? Why is NASCAR doing this?

THE LAPTOP ATE MY ATTENTION SPAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., N.Y.)   By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest issue on business school campuses? It's not whether
to start your own dot-com before graduation, but whether you should
be allowed to use your laptop in the classroom as you please.
</P>
<P>
   While more and more schools _ especially business schools _
provide Internet access in class and require students to lug their
laptops with them, some are imposing rules on what their students
can and cannot do with them in class.
</P>
<P>
   But why, in the sedate hallways of graduate schools, is there
need for debate on rules of discipline? It seems that some
students, although smart enough to earn MBAs, have not figured out
how the old, generally unwritten rules of conduct apply to the
wired classroom. More and more students are sending instant
messages to one another (chatting and note-passing, 21st
century-style), day trading (as opposed to daydreaming) and even
starting their own companies, all in class.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commotion has annoyed many students. Jen McEnry,
28, a second-year MBA student at the University of Virginia's
Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, recalled that a
classmate once downloaded an e-mail attachment during a finance
lecture. The attachment automatically turned on the sound on the
student's computer, which then delivered a booming message: ``Oh my
God, I'm watching porn!'' Everyone roared at the practical joke,
but the problem was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's distracting when people are day trading, checking their
e-mails or surfing the Web,'' McEnry said. All the more distracting
because Darden relies heavily on classroom participation.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia University, the business school's newspaper reported
that a student-run ``chat room'' ended up on the overhead projector
in the middle of class. University officials denied the report. But
by January, cyberspace had so intruded on classroom space at
Columbia that a committee of professors and students came up with a
code of professional conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways professors and students can use
technology effectively and appropriately to create leaders,'' said
Jeff Derman, a second-year MBA student who heads the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how can MBA students, whose average age is about 28
nationally, not know that it's rude to click away in class? After
all, they presumably know not to walk out in the middle of a
lecture, however boring. The rules of etiquette shouldn't change
just because of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some business schools have gone beyond issuing rules. Two
years ago, Darden officials installed a switch in each classroom; a
professor can program it to shut down the students' Net-surfing at
fixed times. The students, however, found that they could override
the teacher's decision by sneaking over before class and flicking
the switch back on. It became a kind of game, the Battle of the
Button.
</P>
<P>
   The students spent hours arguing the broader issues. Should
computers be banned from class? (No, we're adults! We pay to be
here!). Should networks be shut off? (Of course not! Web access is
an inalienable right!) Should professors be able to turn off the
systems? (That's, like, so 1984!)
</P>
<P>
   Blood started to boil: Students got mad at professors,
professors got mad at students, students got mad at each other and
everyone cursed technology. Why should they have to deal with all
this when all they really wanted to do was learn how to be a
millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   McEnry proposes a standard of reasonable necessity. ``If I'm
expecting something important, like news about a job or something,
then it's OK to go online,'' she said. ``There are really pressing
issues in people's lives, and they need to have access.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not kidding. McEnry found out that she had been elected
president of the Student Association after her friends found the
news on the school's Web site and told her. In class.
</P>
<P>
   At the Columbia business school, Safwan Masri, vice dean of
students and the MBA program, takes a temperate tone. ``These kids
have grown up with computers; they can multitask,'' he said,
explaining why Columbia decided against a Web shutdown switch. ``We
don't want to act as police. They're adults. We'd like to think
they can control themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree. Let them control themselves. And if they can't, here's
my suggestion to them: Take a computer to the Metropolitan Opera.
Log on. Write e-mail. Check your portfolio. At the end of the
night, you'll be lucky to still have a computer. &QL;

THESE DAYS A DIAMOND IS FOR .... ME! 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By HADLEY DAVIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent sunny afternoon, I ventured through the
Art Deco doors of that fabled jewelry store at 57th and Fifth.
Inside, I approached a saleswoman and, in the hushed tone of a
teen-ager requesting condoms, inquired about Tiffany's latest: the
``Lucida.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've been looking for a diamond ring, and no, I don't have
a fiance (or even a potential fiance, for that matter). As the
sleek square stone was removed from the case, I thought: ``You can
have your Prada bowling bag; keep your Gucci python-print pant!'' I
had found my spring fashion fling: a diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the diamond has never gone out of style,
this season the ultimate rock _ which happens to be April's
birthstone _ has transcended its own perennial appeal. Diamond
jewelry is so much in vogue that even the engagement ring has
become a fashion item.

   Once upon a time diamond rings represented husbands. (Just ask
Elizabeth Taylor, who received both the 33.19-carat Krupp diamond
and a 69.42-carat Cartier rock as gifts from Richard Burton.) But
now ``they are considered not just tokens of affection but
accessories,'' said Anne Slowey, Elle magazine's fashion news
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about fashion and status,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Oscars _ where 5,000 carats of diamonds strolled
the red carpet _ Tyra Banks, Cameron Diaz, Salma Hayek, Lauren
Holly and Ashley Judd were among the fashionable single starlets
sporting borrowed diamond rings. And the invitation to Tuesday's
flashy W Hotel opening in Los Angeles was a fake diamond solitaire
in a velvet box with a note that read, ``We're no longer a diamond
in the rough'' and instructed the recipient to ``wear this ring to
gain admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Rings are not the only diamond jewelry shimmering in the
spotlight. In recent months, Vogue has trumpeted colored diamonds,
W has had a six-page diamond spread, and Elle has guided readers
interested in diamond shopping online. The fashion designer Michael
Kors had models dripping with the gems on his fall runway.
</P>
<P>
   In the hip-hop world, diamonds even have a new alias coined by
B.G. of the Hot Boys: Bling Bling. While hip-hop cognoscenti also
refer to them as ``ice,'' Carmen Borgonovo, the accessories
director at W, said, ``Diamonds are hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Tiffany, I slipped the princess-cut bauble over my right
middle finger (the one that we single women favor so as not to
confuse potential suitors), and sneaked a self-conscious glance at
the saleswoman to gauge her reaction. She didn't bat an eye.
Chances are she had seen the likes of me before; I'm what the
industry has come to call a ``self purchaser,'' and I may represent
the most dazzling diamond trend of all.
</P>
<P>
   The self-purchase market for diamonds increased 41 percent from
1998 to 1999, according to the Diamond Information Center at J.
Walter Thompson, the advertising agency for De Beers, the world's
largest diamond producer. ``The self-purchase market is now a $3.75
billion business in the United States,'' said Greg Distefano, a
spokesman for the center. ``Rings are the single largest type in
this market. They account for two out of every five pieces of
self-purchased jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   More women are buying diamonds for themselves because they are
earning more, marrying later and have more disposable income to
spend on self-indulgence. But it also helps that big jewelers are
right behind them, encouraging single women to splurge on trophy
trinkets as symbols of accomplishment and success. As a De Beers
advertisement puts it: ``On my left hand you will see a symbol of
my commitment. But my right hand is my independence, my uncaptured
spirit, that also wants to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliet Boghossian, marketing director at the jeweler Fred
Joaillier U.S., said her company has begun to cater to the
career-oriented professional woman age 25 to 37. ``We are making
lots of contemporary, bold middle-finger rings in the $3,000 to
$5,000 range,'' she said, ``And we advertise now in Mirabella
instead of Town &AMP; Country like we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Cartier, Piaget and Bulgari are also shooting for
a younger, trendier clientele with ``hipper, fashionable,
interesting new pave designs that don't look like wedding rings,''
Borgonovo said. Why the close-set look of miniature pave diamonds?
``Because pave offers the same luxurious glitter,'' she said, ``but
is more accessible'' _ meaning less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Pave was certainly the look for Lady Luck, a 17-year-old rapper
who signed a Def Jam record deal last year: she bought three
interlocking pave strands for her right ring finger after the deal
was closed. ``A woman who buys herself a diamond,'' she said on a
cell phone from Teaneck High School in New Jersey, where she is a
student, ``is a woman who is rising.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Sharon Dorram, the chief colorist at the John
Frieda Salon in New York, bought a yellow and white gold and
diamond Buccellati ring for her 40th birthday. ``It was time to
spoil myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I may only be in the twilight of my 20s, but I felt ready
to make my own latter-day L'Oreal declaration. (``Because I'm worth
it!'') I returned from my trip to Tiffany with ``How to Buy a
Diamond,'' the store's free printed guide and videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking open the robin's-egg-blue guide, I discovered that
finding the right diamond ring is just like finding the right guy:
there are plenty of sizes, shapes and colors to pick from. Each
stone is ``unique,'' but few are ``flawless.'' (Tell me about it.)
One must compare, to learn to distinguish the ``ordinary'' from the
``exceptional.'' (Easier said than done.) A diamond is meant to
``reward you for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the ``How to Buy a Diamond'' book, however, went
from sugar-sweet to NutraSweet in the video, a depiction of
cuddling couples describing their own down-on-one-knee blue-box
moments in sequences that recalled ``When Harry Met Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   I ejected the tape, a bit depressed. Maybe the Tiffany
``Lucida'' wasn't for me after all. Even on my middle finger the
single carat suggested that I was, at the very least, engaged to be
engaged. I realized that buying a diamond ring wasn't as simple as
it seemed. If it resembled an engagement ring, my self-purchase
would serve not as a fashionable badge of what I have, but as a
daily reminder of what I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Needing guidance, I consulted Plum Sykes, a Vogue fashion writer
who replied via e-mail. ``Colored diamonds are very in,'' she
wrote, naming pink, canary yellow, blue and brown as options. I
immediately went to Mondera.com, a diamond Web site, where I
pointed and clicked on ``fancy colored diamonds,'' and discovered
they're called ``fancy'' for a reason: a marigold and pink combo
ran $74,260.
</P>
<P>
   Too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a more affordable alternative, I went to Cartier,
whose Collection Paris Nouvelle Vague is for self-purchasers like
me. But when I tried on a striking gray, black and white pave
Jetton ring, it appeared as if a flying saucer had landed on my
Size 4{ finger.
</P>
<P>
   Too big.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block at Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels, I found a daintier style.
Shaped like a flower, with pretty pave petals and a tastefully tiny
center stone, the ring was pure girly glitter. As a Goldirocks
might say, this one was ``just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesmerized, I pondered the eternal question of why diamonds make
women melt. It's as mystifying as love itself. All I knew was that
I wanted that 0.74-carat $5,800 ring. I needed those itty-bitty
chips of ridiculously overpriced rock, and left Van Cleef all set,
with a Polaroid picture of the pave pansy and the salesman's
engraved business card. I promised to call _ but never did.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it seemed I was not yet ready to join the postfeminist
ranks of self-purchasers. Or at least my bank account wasn't. The
financial reality of single-girldom had by this time sunk in. The
money for the ring went instead for April rent, phone bills, a new
computer and hair highlights.

SAO PAULO'S MAYOR IS AT CENTER OF FINANCIAL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Paulistanos have delighted during the past
month in the saucy details of a scandal rocking this city's
government, as Celso Pitta, the mayor, has been relentlessly
attacked in the media by his estranged wife, Nicea Pitta.
</P>
<P>
   Celso Pitta was spotted in Paris during the Carnival holiday
dining with a mysterious blonde. His wife, furious, described
schemes in which the mayor's colleagues allegedly bought votes in
the city council and told how a wealthy patron maintained the
mayor's princely lifestyle with a loan worth nearly $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the possibility of Celso Pitta's impeachment looming
before municipal elections are held later this year, the most
pressing crisis gripping the world's third-largest city is
apparently not over politics or passions, but in borrowings from
years past that municipal government cannot repay.
</P>
<P>
   Home to 17 million people, Sao Paulo is facing the prospect of
drowning in about 7 billion reals, or $4 billion, in money it
cannot repay, as details of an illegal bond issuance operation
masterminded by Pitta and his political mentor, former Mayor Paulo
Maluf, come under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Sao Paulo's next mayor will absorb a municipal debt of $9
billion, or more than double the municipal budget. Nearly half the
debt came from the issuance of bonds needed to service debts
resulting from lawsuits, according to the Brazilian Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal prosecutors, who indicted Pitta and Maluf this
week on charges of providing false documentation in the scheme,
said only a fraction of the proceeds from the bond sales, conducted
in 1994 and 1995, was used for such stated purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much of the money is now thought to have been used on
the public-works projects of Maluf, who preceded Pitta as mayor
from 1992 to 1996. During that time he extended the city's concrete
sprawl, leveling shantytowns to construct highways and futuristic
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most perplexing example of pharaonic economic policy
in modern Brazil,'' said Raul Velloso, an independent expert on
public spending. ``The richest city of Latin America issues these
bonds, and services in the city are still horrible, so it leads one
to ask where the money really went.''
</P>
<P>
   It increasingly seems that most of the money from the bonds was
not used to settle lawsuits. O Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper,
recently described cases in which people who won legal settlements
against the city have been waiting for years to receive their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, this means that Sao Paulo's overburdened legal
system becomes more strained by residents who seek other legal
avenues to recover their settlements. ``It is a bureaucratic
nightmare,'' said Isabel Thompson, an attorney. ``Maybe one in 15
cases is settled on time and in full.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that the federal government will take
steps to reschedule Sao Paulo's debt over a 30-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether such a rescheduling plan is approved is beside
the point since the central government will probably end up
absorbing the city's unserviceable debts, said Velloso, the
public-spending expert. ``Not doing so would leave our largest city
crippled,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With corruption allegations against Pitta's administration
growing, many of Sao Paulo's residents already feel as if this has
happened. Pitta has received a court order removing him from
office; it was soon overturned and is working its way through the
labyrinthine legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter in the scandal came this week when it was
revealed that a Brazilian telecommunications company owned by
Fidelity Investments is under investigation by the U.S. Justice
Department for irregular payments allegedly made to municipal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The company, MetroRED, reportedly sought to quicken approval in
1998 of a $200 million plan to build a fiber-optic network in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   That an American company could also become embroiled in Sao
Paulo's economic and political problems has elevated the
international visibility of ``Pittagate,'' as the scandal has been
dubbed in the Brazilian press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sao Paulo's corruption has been transformed into a public
horror from the whispered-about horror it always was,'' said Jose
Carlos Sebe Bom Meihy, a professor of history at the University of
Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the very least this means the tools of Brazilian
democracy, notably the media, are working better to reveal the
interests that have plundered this city.''

BEER AD STIRS ANTI-US FEELINGS IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Standing foursquare in front of a screen flashing
Canadian symbols _ beavers, Ottawa's Peace Tower, the Maple Leaf
flag _ an average Joe Canuck in a checked flannel shirt rips into
American misperceptions about his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a prime minister, not a president. I speak English or
French, not American,'' he says, voice swelling with emotion. ``And
I pronounce it `about,' not `a-boot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in peacekeeping, not policing; diversity, not
assimilation,'' he goes on in the 60-second television spot as the
national icons loom over his shoulder. ``And that the beaver is a
proud and noble animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, in a country known for its aversion to the sort of
rah-rah jingoism associated with its southern neighbor, this
nationalist tirade has become an overnight sensation: taped and
shown in bars, filling megascreens at hockey games, performed live
in movie theatres.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still is the revved-up public reaction the ad is
evoking in this notoriously reticent land _ wild cheers, stamping
of feet, frantic flag-waving, and fists punching the air.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps strangest of all, the spot is not the cunning
propaganda of some ultrapatriot cabal, but a commercial for Molson
Canadian beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what to make of it. It's a pretty anti-American
message, but it's real cool the way it stands up for Canada,'' said
Josie Flynn, 22, a parttime student at Montreal's Concordia
University, as she sipped a half-pint in a west end bar. ``It
leaves you feeling real proud and kind of choked up.''
</P>
<P>
   First aired last month, the commercial has become an oddly
potent rallying point for a country where feelings of national
pride are seldom spoken; a country whose self-image often seems
lost in the cultural, political, and economic shadow cast by the
superpower next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remind ourselves who we are in the face of the
deluge of flag-waving, pure Yankee Americana,'' wrote Peter
Goddard, a columnist for the Toronto Star. ``It's taken Molson to
revive the great Canadian identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dornan, director of the School of Journalism and
Communication at Ottawa's Carleton University, said the ad seems to
have struck an especially responsive chord among younger Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see it as a straight-up expression of national pride,
even though the symbols are a bit trivial _ beavers, and that we
call couches `chesterfields' or pronounce the letter `z' as `zed,'
'' he said. ``But everyone's talking about it, and usually over
beers.''
</P>
<P>
   At Molson Breweries and its advertising agency, Bensimon Byrne
D'Arcy, both based in Toronto, the spot is known simply as ``The
Rant.'' And the makers of Canada's bestselling beer seem genuinely
astonished by the visceral response the campaign has stirred from
Halifax to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible. We've never had anything like we're getting
on this _ I mean, after all, it's a beer commercial,'' said Paul
Thomson, manager of corporate communications for the 212-year-old
brewing firm. ``It just seems to have tapped a powerful
undercurrent of feeling that a lot of people never suspected was
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson insisted the message is not meant to be anti-American.
``It's pro-Canadian. It speaks to who we are, and what we aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial also flaunts an angry edge, slashing at US
sterotypes about Canadians as much as celebrating a distinctly
Canadian identity. And it may reveal that Canadians, too, are
joining the tide of reaction against American gigantism that has
been sweeping other parts of the planet, especially Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to overanalyze a beer ad,'' said Dornan. ``But
what seems to have grabbed attention is the way it expresses
frustration with the all-pervasiveness of American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial opens with an actor alone on a stage in front of
a screen depicting Canadian images. His tone, at the outset, is
polite and diffident _ archetypically Canadian _ but quickly
gathers in intensity and assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a lumberjack or fur trader. I don't live in an igloo,
eat blubber, or own a dog sled,'' he declares, voice turning raspy
with emotion. ``A tuque is a hat. A chesterfield is a couch. It's
pronounced `zed' _ `zed!' _ not `zee.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is the second-largest land mass, the first nation of
hockey, and the best part of North America!'' he roars to a finish.
``My name is Joe and I AM CANADIAN!''
</P>
<P>
   Molson's logo is briefly shown, and the commercial ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the opening scene of Patton, or the speech in
Citizen Kane,'' Dornan said. ``Only instead of General Patton or
Charles Foster Kane, here is some ordinary guy in a lumber shirt
ranting about Canada. I have to wonder what Americans visiting the
country would possibly make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial has made a star of actor Jeff Douglass, a native
of Nova Scotia. This week, Molson sent him around Canada to perform
the bit before live audiences. Saturday night, he will perform
``The Rant'' at the opening of the playoff between the Toronto
Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people in the country love the slot,''
Douglass told a Canadian newspaper. ``They love the patriotism and
message of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (The brewing company is making rather less of the fact that the
director the commercial is an American, Kevin Donovan).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Molson has been inundated with thousands of phone
calls, e-mails, faxes, and letters from Canadians praising the ad.
There have also been gripes from unamused Americans: ``So I am
stupid, have no redeeming social value, speak `American,' and drive
a big truck with a Confederate flag,'' wrote one peevish Yank.
``That is how I've been described by you . . . jackasses.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, launched March 17, is already advertising legend,
even south of the border. The Ad Critic, a website followed by the
industry, this week ranked the commercial among the Top 10 in North
America, an unusual feat for a spot aimed solely at Canada's
relatively small market of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company says there is no way of knowing yet whether the
campaign will boost sales of Molson Canadian. But barkeepers report
the commercial is a megahit with consumers of all brands of the
frothy beverage sometimes described as Canada's fifth addition to
the four basic food groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome. Everyone yells and screams when it comes on
TV,'' Fay Kranna, manager of Courtnall's Sports Grill in Vancouver,
told the National Post newspaper. ``People say the words along with
it. They get pretty hyped.''

BULLOCK'S WAIT FOR BETTER MATERIAL COULD TAKE LONGER THAN `28
DAYS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock's refusal to take the safe route in movies is
admirable. She could spend the next five years cruising through
cute romantic comedies.
</P>
<P>
   But she needs to wait for better breakout material than ``28
Days,'' a well-intended but punchless lesson on substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is Gwen Cummings, an alcoholic sentenced to a drug
rehabilitation center after she drunkenly drives a limousine into a
house.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows someone like Cummings. When she drinks, oh boy!
She thinks she's the life of the party, unaware that she's become a
loud bore actually ruining everyone else's fun.
</P>
<P>
   With her heavy-drinking boyfriend in tow, she is 45 minutes late
as bridesmaid at her sister's wedding. She disrupts the reception
with her uninhibited dancing. ``Watch out for the wedding cake!''
</P>
<P>
   Stealing the bridal limo to find a cake shop, she locates a
front porch instead.
</P>
<P>
   The judge says jail or a rehab center. She may be a drunk, but
she's not stupid. Still convinced she does not have a problem and
cannot benefit from drying out, Cummings arrives at Serenity Glen,
a rural facility that seems like nowheresville to this hip New York
writer.
</P>
<P>
   She has a point. The choices are saying the Serenity Prayer
several times a day or chanting, not to mention hearing ``Lean on
Me'' again and again. It's enough to drive a teetotaler to drink.
</P>
<P>
   A little TLC is just what Cummings needs, however. So is meeting
new ``friends'' who are in the same boat _ if not worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings has a few false starts. Her enabler boyfriend smuggles
in pills and sneaks her out to get drunk early on.
</P>
<P>
   She finally gets sober long enough to discover what a mess she
is. But can she save herself? As one patient says, only a third of
the patients stay sober after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' comes off as earnest, with some moments of humor and
a few poignant scenes. Sometimes the goings-on threaten to get just
too precious, like when the patients put on a cute little show for
a patient who is leaving. But there is enough taste at work here to
keep it in check.
</P>
<P>
   It's not bad, but it's not very good, either. It follows a
predictable path from beginning to end. It would be unfair to call
the movie heavy-handed, but it feels like an essay on the social
problems of drinking and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Thomas (``Doctor Doolittle,'' ``The Brady Bunch Movie'')
directed from a screenplay by Susannah Grant, who did a lot better
job with ``Erin Brockovich'' and ``Ever After.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid cast plays the inevitable assortment of quirky inmates:
Viggo Mortensen, Azura Skye, Diane Ladd and Marianne Jean-Baptiste.
Steve Buscemi, in surprise casting, shows up as head of the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock does a good job with the dramatic demands of the role.
She never makes Cummings adorable, which would have undermined the
film's intentions. Bullock's likable qualities are enough to keep
this film afloat _ if just barely _ without pandering. &QL;

 &HT;    Clinton pushes for better pay for teachers
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton urged states Friday to use their
hefty budget surpluses to boost teacher pay in a major way, a move
Georgia didn't make during the 2000 legislative session despite
overflowing coffers and a year-long push to improve public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to demand more of our teachers, but we need to reward
them better,'' Clinton said in a speech to members of the Education
Writers Association in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a couple of million teachers retiring in
the next few years. We already have the largest student population
... in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're going to have to work very, very hard to get
more qualified teachers in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Gov. Roy Barnes' Education Reform Study Commission
last year found 113 of 141 local superintendents who responded said
they were experiencing difficulty filling teacher positions in one
or more subjects.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia, the shortage may only get worse. The U.S.
Department of Education has projected that Georgia's schools will
have the fastest enrollment growth rate during the next decade of
any state east of the Mississippi River. In addition, the state
Board of Education this week began implementing class-size
restrictions mandated by Barnes' school reform bill that may force
districts to hire more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The president said now, while the economy is still fairly hot
and tax revenues are flowing, is when states should be hiking
salaries to attract top job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states are in terrific (financial) shape,'' Clinton said.
``Every one of these states are facing the prospect of too many
teacher retirements. With very low unemployment, they are having
the same problem recruiting teachers we're now having with military
personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the education writers, ``When the budget surpluses
are there, the money is there, now is the best time states have had
in generations to make dramatic increases in teacher pay, and I
hope they will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' spokeswoman, Joselyn Butler, responded, ``It sounds like
the president is trying to get other states to do what we in
Georgia are proud to have already done: lead the Southeast in
teacher salaries and be at the national average.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there were grumbles at the Capitol this session that
Barnes' 3 percent teacher pay hike for the 2000-2001 school year
didn't stack up well against the gains Georgia educators have seen
of late. It was the lowest raise since the mid-1990s and was
approved despite a surplus in the neighborhood of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers received a 4 percent raise from Barnes and lawmakers
for the 1999-2000 school year after getting 6 percent pay hikes for
each of the last four years of Gov. Zell Miller's second term.
</P>
<P>
   Before Miller began his salary drive, the average pay for a
public school teacher in Georgia ranked 34th in the country. The
latest survey from the National Education Association ranked
Georgia 19th last year in teacher pay and tops in the Southeast.
The NEA estimated the average salary for teachers in Georgia at
$41,327 this year, and it's even higher in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Christmas, director of the state's largest teacher
group, the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, called
Barnes' 3 percent raise this year ``modest,'' and said Clinton's
got the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sizable raise needs to be a high priority so we don't lose
the ground we've gained,'' she said. ``In order to attract and
retain the best teachers, we've got to have competitive salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good example of needing to put our money were our
mouth is because there is a lot of rhetoric about needing improved
teacher quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also could use some help politically with teachers. Many
of them were angered by the tenor of his call to rid classrooms of
bad teachers and his successful bid to kill fair dismissal hearing
rights for new educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to regain some support from teachers. That's a block
of 87,000 votes,'' said state School Superintendent Linda Schrenko,
one of the governor's most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent has called on the General Assembly to approve
a 10 percent pay increase for teachers next year, and 15 percent
more for those willing to teach in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   She said her Department of Education saw out-of-state teacher
applicants increase from 1,000 to 15,000 annually just two years
after Miller began his series of pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is going to be a teacher shortage,'' the
superintendent said. ``They have been shortchanged for two years in
a row. I want to make up for that.''

 &HT;    Castro's sister stays above the fray in Miami
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The small pharmacy on Unity Boulevard in Little Havana
is unassuming. No Cuban flags sway from its door and no political
signs pushing for the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its
windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion of the woman who runs the modest business, which
sells everything from prescription drugs to chewing gum and toys,
carries a lot of weight in this part of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   She is Fidel Castro's younger sister, Juanita. While her brother
is the personification of evil in this neighborhood where Cuban
flags fly from beatup Buicks, Juanita Castro is a beloved and
respected member of this community.
</P>
<P>
   And while she maintains a distance between herself and the
heated rhetoric and politics that envelop Miami, Friday she had
definite opinions on the case of the 6-year-old Cuban boy that has
dominated the city for almost five months now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for this child,'' Juanita Castro said. ``This has
become too politicized, in both Cuba and Miami, and too many people
are profiting from this tragedy. I think people have forgotten that
this is a human issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Castro, who arrived in Miami in 1961, believes the
custody of the child should be worked out between his family
members. She is not certain whether the boy should stay in the
United States, but she feels that since he's been here so long, he
should be afforded the opportunity to live in a free country.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she thought the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, was being controlled by the Cuban government even though
he has been in Bethesda, Md., for the last week, she frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Juan Miguel thinks or believes,'' Juanita
Castro said. ``What I do think is that he should have arrived in
this country at least 72 hours after his son was found floating off
the coast of Fort Lauderdale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone too far. And it's now become a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark pink blazer and cream color pants, the sister
of the Cuban dictator walked around the pharmacy talking warmly
with her customers.
</P>
<P>
   She said she she sometimes talks to family members back in Cuba.
``I have sisters that I still speak to,'' she said, ``and this
situation is driving people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing on Cuban television is Elian's story, she said,
and she feels the Cuban people are getting tired of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   She does not speak to her brother and hasn't for several years.
``Nobody talks to Fidel, because he doesn't listen,'' Juanita
Castro said. ``He talks and he decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Castro said she has not visited the Miami relatives of
Elian Gonzalez and has no plans to do so. Although she supports the
cause of Miami's Cubans in their struggle against her brother's
government, she said she prefers to keep a low profile when it
comes to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just work in my pharmacy every day and I pray for a
resolution in our country (Cuba) that is without violence,'' she
said. ``And I also pray for this young boy every day because he
needs help. He's been through a lot.''

WASHINGTON, April 14 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on April 7 approved, 51 to 45, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget plan for fiscal year 2001. The measure, which would
cut taxes $150 billion over five years, would provide spending for
defense, education and prescription drug benefits for Medicare
recipients. Supporters said the bill ensures fiscal discipline
while freeing up money for tax relief. Opponents said the tax cut
was too large. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAX
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to advance a plan that would repeal
the federal gasoline tax. In a 56 to 43 vote, the plan failed to
receive the 60 votes needed for a floor vote. Supporters said the
plan would help consumers by reducing gas prices at the pump.
Opponents said the plan would jeopardize important highway and
transportation projects. A ``yes'' vote favors the plan.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 358 to 60, a plan to offer $100
million in financial incentives for states that impose a five-year
minimum sentence on people who use guns while committing violent
crimes or drug trafficking offenses. The spending, which requires
that states implement a public awareness campaign against gun
violence, would be offered to applying states over a five year
period. Supporters said the plan would dramatically reduce gun
violence. Opponents said the grant was too vague and smaller than
what is needed to reduce violence nearly one year after the
shootings at Columbine High School. A ``yes'' vote favors the plan.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 424 to 0, a plan that would make
it harder for the federal government to seize property from people
suspected of drug-dealing and other crimes. Supporters said the
plan would protect innocent people victimized by wrongful seizures.
There were no opponents to the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: AGREEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 220 to 208, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget compromise for fiscal year 2001 that finalized
plans already approved in the House and Senate. The measure would
offer tax cuts of at least $150 billion over five years, and as
much as $215 billion if the economy continues to grow. The budget
also allocates spending for defense, education and prescription
drug benefits for Medicare recipients. Supporters said the budget
plan would help eliminate the national debt, provide needed tax
relief, and boost education, defense, and health research spending.
Opponents said the budget plan offered large tax cuts at the
expense of important social programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
budget.

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before coming to the United States to begin his
studies at Columbia University in 1923, Jacques Barzun perfected
his English by studying Jonathan Swift's ``Gulliver's Travels.'' It
was an unusual primer, but Barzun's childhood, like Swift's, had
been shattered by war, and disarray and darkness were on his mind.
A few years earlier, at the age of 12, the young Barzun had
contemplated suicide. The First World War had left many he knew
dead or maimed. His parents' salon in their house in Creteil, near
Paris, at which artists and writers like Apollinaire and Cocteau
gathered, had come to an end. The French universities at which he
would have studied were decimated. So he devoted himself to
learning English under the tutelage of the sardonic Swift, before
beginning his own travels among peoples that were to him only a bit
less exotic than Gulliver's Yahoos and Brobdingnags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read a lot of books about the Indians,'' Barzun recently
explained in an interview at his daughter's apartment in Manhattan,
``I thought that I would come here and see Indians galloping across
the plains.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as he settled into New York, he began a series of
intellectual journeys, turning his back on any chance he might have
had to become a French diplomat and writer like his father. He
became, instead, one of the founders of the modern discipline of
cultural history. He wrote about 18th-century France and
19th-century Europe, about the art of the detective novel and the
life of the composer Hector Berlioz. For nearly 50 years, he taught
history at Columbia, eventually becoming its provost, and led
seminars with Lionel Trilling that were legendary for their rigor
and range. He wrote over 30 books, translated nearly a dozen more,
and now, at the age of 92, he has finished an epic chronicle of his
historical forays, a survey of 500 years of Western cultural life,
``From Dawn to Decadence'' (HarperCollins), to be published in May.
</P>
<P>
   Its 800 pages condense his teaching career, surveying the
tumultuous mixing of intellectual, religious and cultural
traditions that make up what we now call the West, creating, as
Barzun puts it, ``the mongrel civilization par excellence.'' When
he talks about his vision of this civilization and its discontents,
his conversation ranges as widely as the book, touching on Kant,
amateur musicianship, Trilling, the Rhodes Scholarship, the
counterculture and the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Barzun's face is leaner and more lined than it once was, his
voice is less vigorous and he walks carefully with a cane. But the
only other sign that he is in his 10th decade is that he has
accumulated a long lifetime of literary references and historical
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the atmosphere at Columbia during the 1920s, when
cultural history was just taking shape as a discipline. During the
1890s, he explains, the social sciences underwent ``a great
upheaval.'' Emile Durkheim was transforming sociology and William
James psychology not by defining narrow professional boundaries
but, as Barzun puts it, by starting to pay attention to ``the most
generalized form of cultural activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthropologists put the final touch to it,'' he continues,
``by defining culture among primitive peoples as everything they
did: the way they ate, their canoes, their marriage customs _
nothing was left out. When that idea is applied to history, you
find that the arts, social customs, government, religion and so
forth all become part of cultural history.''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, Barzun recalls, C.J.H. Hayes, the author of a
widely used two-volume textbook ``The Political and Social History
of Modern Europe,'' was planning its revision as ``The Political
and Cultural History of Modern Europe.'' Barzun, Hayes' student,
assisted in the research and was, as he says, ``launched.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural study of history has now become so thoroughly
mainstream _ even mutating into contemporary forms like cultural
studies _ that it might seem strange to hear just how novel it once
was. What made it distinctive, Barzun explains, was that it refused
to be bound by categories of politics, economics or philosophy.
Every thinker, Barzun suggests, ``is born into a cultural
situation, and we must find out why he picks up the thread here and
not there, and why he modifies it and how it is related to what
else is happening at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural history creates a web of interrelationships.
Understanding the past does not just mean, say, tracing a
philosophical idea through time, but seeing how that idea is woven
into a cultural fabric. And cultural history, as Barzun thinks of
it, traces the evolution of that fabric through time. It creates a
coherent view of the past and its relationship to the present. By
showing continuities and transformations in a tradition, it makes
sense of the idea of a civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the cultural historian, watching these complex
relationships unfold, is even more difficult because the frame of
reference for judging those past eras is the constantly shifting
present. In his book ``Classic, Romantic, and Modern,'' Barzun
points out that a cultural historian ``must lead a double life'':
he must ``see the strivings of past epochs with generous fellow
feeling'' and must also feel ``the needs _ which includes the lacks
_ of his own time.'' The fellow feeling means that the past is
understood in comparison with the present; the present is
understood in comparison with the past.
</P>
<P>
   This is also what Barzun tries to accomplish in ``From Dawn to
Decadence,'' which focuses on a series of evolving ideas _ ideas he
capitalizes throughout the text like EMANCIPATION, ABSTRACTION,
INDIVIDUALISM, SECULARISM.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that there have been four principal eras in recent
Western history. The first, which started with the Protestant
Reformation in 1517, dealt with the issue of ``what to believe in
religion.'' The second, which encompassed most of the 18th century
and ended with the French Revolution in 1789, dealt with the issue
of ``what to do about the status of the individual and the mode of
government.'' The third, which started with 19th-century
Romanticism and ended with Modernism after World War I, tried to
determine ``by what means to achieve social and economic
equality.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth is ending now. As Barzun sees it, the fundamental
themes are less clear than they were in past eras, partly because
old certainties are unraveling. The West may be politically and
economically triumphant, but it is plagued by doubts. Postmodern
assertions that there are no absolute truths and that all cultural
suppositions are relative displace the rigors of scrutiny that
marked the development of the West. The nation-state, which evolved
out of Western political thought during the last 500 years, is
being challenged by separatist passions. The central Western notion
of emancipation has now come to mean that ``nothing stands in the
way of every wish,'' in Barzun's words. And in the arts, creativity
is celebrated as a universal talent, diminishing the achievements
of genius. Our age is, in Barzun's words, decadent.
</P>
<P>
   A decadent era, in Barzun's lexicon, is a period in which there
is a kind of ``falling off,'' a restless period in which ``there
are no clear lines of advance.'' ``When people accept futility and
the absurd as normal,'' he writes, ``the culture is decadent. The
term is not a slur; it is a technical label.'' And though it often
seems a slur in Barzun's book, its intimations of decay also
provide some reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Barzun suggests, other more extreme periods of
decadence _ which include the corrupt 17th-century universe of
Swift or the 15th century before the Reformation challenged the
corruption of the medieval Church _ were followed by periods of
reconstruction, in which Western culture was re-examined and
reconstituted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says, the Romantic movement of the early 19th
century is too often considered a celebration of passion,
irrationality or sentiment. Instead, Barzun argues, it was an
attempt to construct a cultural order out of the wreckage of the
French revolution. Romanticism did not destroy an order; it created
one.
</P>
<P>
   That is also, in Barzun's view, what the West may be looking
forward to. If Western traditions are worn and frayed, that is
``all to the good, because it clears the ground,'' he says, leaving
the way open for future construction. This tension between
destruction and creation is also, he suggests, an essential aspect
of Western culture. The West has itself been so successful, Barzun
says, partly because of ``continual debates between orthodoxy and
rebellion and the strange ability of individuals to stand out for
their accomplishments.'' Out of such tensions, decadence may lead
to a new dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind is resilient, Barzun believes, despite his mordant view
of the present. What is to come can only be imagined: ``It is only
in the shadows; when some fresh wave, truly original, truly
creative, breaks upon the shore, that there will be a rediscovery
of the West.''

`AMERICAN PSYCHO' IS MORE A GORY SATIRE THAN A GRISLY SLASHER 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   You are Patrick Bateman, an immaculately groomed, financially
successful, well-educated vice president of a Wall Street firm. In
a meeting with your fellow vice presidents, you show off your
elegant new business card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice,'' says another VP, ``but check this out.'' His new
card has whiter, finer paper, and even more gold fleck in the
lettering.
</P>
<P>
   You're stunned. Humiliated. Sent mentally reeling. So you invite
the offending fellow to your apartment, put on a raincoat, and chop
him up with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Gross horror? Or satire?
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``American Psycho,'' especially writer and
director Mary Harron, are betting most viewers will automatically
understand the satirical bent in such outrageous material. Blood
drips on the opening titles of American Psycho, but what threatens
to be a grisly slasher movie quickly proves to be merely a
belligerent sheep in wolf's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the notorious Bret Easton Ellis book from which it is
adapted, the film of ``American Psycho'' arrives preceded by a vile
reputation. The movie, however, while hardly tame, never tries to
set records in gore or horror, and has had thoroughly excised the
misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Is there violence? Oh, yes. There are maybe 20 killings in
``American Psycho,'' or about a third of the number in a typical
Arnold Schwarzenegger film.
</P>
<P>
   And there are horror images. A brief glimpse of a head in a
freezer, some bodies hanging in a closet. If your gross-out level
is low, you've been warned.
</P>
<P>
   But if you saw, say, ``Seven,'' you'll find the tone here _
exaggerated, ironic _ less threatening. If you saw ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' you saw more violence and a lot more gore than you will in
``American Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Like last year's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' ``American Psycho'' arrives
with false expectations. Those who rush to see it anticipating a
slasher film are going to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1987, ``American Psycho'' is a harsh, stinging satire
(not comedy) on the greed of America's so-called ``me generation''
for whom serving ``self'' became an acceptable excuse for any
behavior. Christian Bale portrays Bateman as iconographic, an
overblown representation of this self-indulgence taken to absurd
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makers assume audiences will understand this without
being told. There's no point at which anyone says, ``Gee, killing a
dozen people on a whim is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But people view movies differently. Since Bateman is the main
character, narrator and protagonist, some will take this literally
while others may appreciate its satiric tone.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman, a mid-20s New York executive, spends his workday
watching TV or hassling his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) about her
shoes. (He prefers high heels.)
</P>
<P>
   He can never set a date to marry his rich fiancee, Evelyn (Reese
Witherspoon), saying he can't find the time to take off work.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his nights are spent carousing in expensive restaurants,
bars and clubs, having rambling conversations with ``friends,''
sometimes briefly getting away from their favorite topic,
themselves, to discuss important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis in Sri Lanka.''
</P>
<P>
   His main sport is figuring how to get reservations at more
exclusive places than his friends can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking of reasonable, the bill was only $570. Not bad,''
Bateman says after one dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He spends hours a day in personal grooming, dousing his body
with one outrageously expensive body enhancer after another, or
toning his already sculpted physique into zones beyond perfection,
while watching porn videos.
</P>
<P>
   These material things are his only identity, and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Patrick Bateman,'' he tells us. ``There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman, an abstraction, but there is no real me. I
simply am not there.''
</P>
<P>
   We are not sure when Bateman began killing, but the first we see
is when he stops in a dark alley to talk with a street person
asking for a handout. Chatting in a friendly manner, Bateman opens
his briefcase and instead of giving the guy money gives him a knife
in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman moves on to co-workers, friends, casual dates,
prostitutes. Most are just people who have offended him in some
mild way. Bateman hates them, himself and everything around him.
The killings seem an attempt, increasingly futile, to make his
unreal world real.
</P>
<P>
   Like those in the book, some of the murders are gross or
bizarre. A man is killed with an ax, a woman with a chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Where the book delivered gory details, the movie mostly avoids
them. We see blood splash on Bateman's raincoat, rather than the
man as he's hit with the ax.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this satire rather than horror? The film's tone, its
exaggerated realism. The prissy, ``aren't I clever?'' way Bateman
moves as he puts on the raincoat. The way he lectures his intended
victims on the great artistry of the vacuous pop music he plays as
he prepares to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Or the ridiculous way Bateman preens for the video camera he has
set up to record the sex he'll have with two prostitutes _ so
self-absorbed that he never notices they find him a total bore.
</P>
<P>
   Willem Dafoe plays Kimball, a detective investigating a murder,
but Kimball's occasional appearances only build Bateman's mounting
insanity. The only suspense in the film comes when we are waiting
to see if Bateman will kill a character we care about.
</P>
<P>
   Bale gives an absolutely creepy, self-mocking performance. He's
outrageous, without ever trying to be comic or funny or winking at
the audience. He never wants us to like this guy, even in the
frightened way we like Anthony Hopkins in ``The Silence of the
Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because we see everything from his eyes and hear his
thoughts, it's hard not to relate to him at times, which is
genuinely uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Harron, who co-wrote the movie with Guinevere Turner (``Go
Fish'') keeps it way out there, never veering far from her harsh,
hip tone.
</P>
<P>
   So effective is she in making ugly the absurdity of our
name-brand consumer culture that we leave the theater wanting to
rip the designer labels off our clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is not comedy, but it is joyously mean and evil,
somewhat in the tone of ``Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the movie depends on the novelty of its
outrageous subject and its repugnantly shallow characters for its
entertainment value. We run low in interest in both before the
movie winds to its intentionally ambiguous ending.
</P>
<P>
   And even while appreciating the guts in making this project, one
can't help but wonder about the need to adapt such an ugly premise,
even sanitized of its most vile elements. Is this really the best
way for talented folks to express the idea that society is
misguided? Surely not. &QL;

 &HT;    Browns may be leaning toward end Brown as top pick
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend's NFL draft figures to be as
unpredictable as the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   The only things that seem certain in the two-day, seven-round
draft are the players who will be chosen with the first four picks.
And that Washington, Baltimore _ thanks to Atlanta _ and the New
York Jets are all in positions to greatly improve their teams.
</P>
<P>
   No one really seems to know the order in which the top four
players will be selected. The Cleveland Browns, who have the No. 1
pick, were negotiating Friday with the agents of two Penn State
stars _ defensive end Courtney Brown and linebacker LaVar
Arrington. It is believed that Cleveland will take Brown, who would
be greeted in New York by Cleveland quarterback Tim Couch, the No.
1 pick in last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong leaning toward Courtney Brown in terms of how
the building is divided,'' Browns President Carmen Policy told a
Cleveland radio station. ``I'm not talking about 70 percent or 80
percent. I'm probably talking 65 percent. But there's a very vocal
element in this building that feels LaVar Arrington deserves the
position and we certainly shouldn't rush to judgment, and we should
stick with this evaluation down to the bitter end.''
</P>
<P>
   That would probably leave the Redskins sitting on pins and
needles. The Redskins covet Arrington, an explosive linebacker who
could shore up the league's second-worst defense last season.
Washington has the second and third picks of the draft and will
probably take Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels with one of
them. The Redskins also are considering Florida State receiver
Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go wrong with either Brown or Arrington,''
Washington coach Norv Turner said. ``Most people say this draft has
three or four great players available _ we know we're going to get
two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Redskins and Ravens have a pair of top 10 picks. Since
1970, only 12 teams have been in the same position. Of those
previous 12 teams, only the 1976 Bengals had a .500 record or
better the previous season. The Redskins were 10-6 last season and
made the playoffs; the Ravens finished 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who this week traded All-Pro receiver Keyshawn Johnson
to the Buccaneers, are the first team in league history to have
four picks in the first round. The Jets were trying to move up for
a chance at drafting Samuels or Warrick, but they hadn't found any
suitors as of late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winner of the draft figures to be Washington,
which, barring an unexpected trade, will become only the fifth team
in 30 years to make two picks in the top five. The Colts were the
last team to have two top five choices, and they improved from 4-12
to 8-8 after drafting running back Marshall Faulk and linebacker
Trev Alberts in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins already have added Buffalo defensive end Bruce
Smith, Detroit safety Mark Carrier and Minnesota quarterback Jeff
George to their roster through free agency. But Washington might be
saving its real fireworks for June, when the Redskins might make a
serious offer to All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders, who could be
released by Dallas on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little early to be talking about the Super
Bowl,'' Turner said. ``What we're talking about now is doing the
work to become a good team.''

THE CHICKEN, THE EGG AND THE REIGN OF GASOLINE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once upon a time, just after the Persian Gulf war
and the oil-price spike it caused, the government came up with yet
another plan to reduce American dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   The big idea was to promote alternative fuels for vehicles. The
plan Congress passed in 1992 was intended, by the far-off year of
2000, to replace 10 percent of the gasoline and diesel fuel used by
cars, pick-ups, vans and sport utility vehicles with something not
made from oil. By 2010, it was supposed to replace 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has been a fairy tale. There are indeed about one
million cars and light trucks on the road equipped to run on
natural gas, ethanol, methanol, propane or some other substitute,
but hardly any of them ever do. The country has made only about an
eyedropper-full of progress for each gallon of gasoline or diesel
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates of alternative fuel blame the car companies. Car
companies blame the Energy Department. The Energy Department blames
Congress. And everybody, by and large, still uses gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department say they have tried hard to
make the 1992 program work, but that they were hobbled from the
start by weaknesses in the plan, contained in the Energy Policy
Act. ``It's like going after a grizzly bear with a fly swatter,''
said one Energy Department official, who asked not to be further
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever thought it would be easy. The authors of the plan
recognized the obvious, that no one would buy a nongasoline car
until its fuel was available at filling stations all over the
country, and that no one would build the filling stations until
there were cars to use the fuel. They tried to solve the
chicken-and-egg problem by tapping the buying power of large public
and private vehicle fleets.
</P>
<P>
   The law, passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President
George Bush, required two categories of fleet owners _ the federal
and state governments, and companies that sell electricity and
natural gas _ to include a certain share of alternative-fuel
vehicles among their new purchases. The figure for the federal
government this year is 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the law contained a crucial compromise. It called for
vehicles that (italics)could(end italics) use alternative fuels,
not those that (italics)must(end italics) use them, to spare fleet
owners any danger of being held hostage by fuel suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some 30 light-duty vehicle models _ sedans, station
wagons, minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles _ are built to
run solely on some alternative fuel, usually natural gas or
propane. But ``sales are still stuck in the basement,'' said the
Energy Department official, accounting for fewer than 1 of every
1,000 light vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more successful provision called for stretching
gasoline supplies by adding filler chemicals to ordinary gasoline,
like Hamburger Helper to ground beef. But the most popular, known
as MTBE, proved to be a threat to groundwater supplies, and the
Clinton administration now wants to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the law worked better; for example, energy use
per square foot in federal buildings has been cut by more than 20
percent. But that saves coal and natural gas, not gasoline. The
effort to diversify transportation fuel has had some success in
heavy vehicles like trucks and buses, but not in the light vehicles
that use most of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   One giant hurdle is retail availability. Of the 145,000 gas
stations in the United States, only about 50 sell fuel that is more
than 10 percent ethanol. None are in Washington, so parked in the
garage beneath the Energy Department headquarters are three
ethanol-ready cars that have never seen any fuel but unleaded
regular. (The federal government is helping to open an ethanol pump
at a station near the Pentagon in Arlington, Va.)
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 places have compressed natural gas, but most are bus
depots, United Parcel Service hubs or the like. Only a few dozen
are ordinary service stations. That creates a special problem,
because natural-gas vehicles typically go only about half as far on
a tankful as gasoline vehicles do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some fuel companies tried to help; in the early 1990s, Amoco
added natural gas at 37 of its service stations at a cost of more
than $250,000 apiece. But sales were so slow _ the equivalent of 20
gallons of gasoline a day _ that the company gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the Energy Policy Act hoped that fleets would get
the ball rolling, and that high gasoline prices would lead to
demand for alternative fuels. But they were wrong, partly because
for years the price of gasoline did not cooperate. Natural gas and
ethanol are roughly competitive with what gasoline was selling for
last year, and are notably cheaper than gasoline today. But
expectations are paramount, and most car shoppers today do not
believe that gas will remain expensive for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased use of alternative fuels very much depends on
the price of gasoline,'' said Dan W. Reicher, assistant secretary
of energy for efficiency and renewable energy. ``At least today,
ethanol is a very competitive fuel.'' With a tax subsidy already in
place, he added, suppliers ``can make money at a price point
somewhat below the current price of gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for electric cars, the technology needed for the
vehicles is mostly in place. ``We've proven they work,'' said Bill
Webster, director of fleet management at the General Services
Administration, which buys much of the government's car fleet,
including 27,000 alternative-fuel vehicles. ``The problem is, you
have to have an infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that Congress gave the Energy Department
authority to require local governments and big corporations to buy
alternative-fuel vehicles too, but the department has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was optional,'' said Lisa Cutler, a spokeswoman for the
department. ``We only had to do it if it was critical to meet Epact
goals,'' she added, using a shorthand name for the law.
</P>
<P>
   And builders of alternative-fuel vehicles say one reason so few
are on the road is that many government agencies that are required
to buy them simply do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a challenge,'' said Art Garner, a spokesman for
Honda, who said his company had spent millions of dollars to
develop a natural-gas-powered Civic that California says is the
cleanest internal combustion car made. ``The letter of the law is
not pursued very stringently,'' he said. ``Nobody's complied with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ford Motor, which makes the most natural-gas-powered cars,
said sales were nowhere near what they would be if everyone were
complying. Reicher said that the shortfall was only about 500 cars
and that the Energy Department had written letters to noncompliers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public at large, voluntarily buying an
alternative-fuel car hardly makes sense on economic grounds.
Natural gas has been selling for the equivalent of 75 cents or so a
gallon, according to Gilbert P. Sperling of the Natural Gas Vehicle
Coalition _ attractive today but less so when gasoline goes for $1
or $1.10.
</P>
<P>
   For a typical household car or van, he said, ``you're paying
$5,000 more for a vehicle that uses only 500 gallons a year.'' For
buses that use thousands of gallons a year, he said, switching is
``a no-brainer,'' but for light-duty vehicles, ``we're not seeing
much activity.''

 &HT;    Answers to queries small investors are asking amid shaky market
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here are some answers to questions that small
investors are asking about their personal finances in the wake of a
volatile stock market.
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD I GET OUT OF STOCKS?
</P>
<P>
   Many studies show that the best tactic for small investors is to
buy and hold. Panic almost always causes bad decisions. Your first
step should be to review why you bought each investment and how
long you intend to hold it. If that period is more than five years,
you can usually outlast a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The experts advise you to stick with your plan, no matter how
scary the market is right now. ``You should not make radical
changes based on market bounces,'' said John Waelty, a spokesman
for Lutheran Brotherhood, a Minneapolis-based financial services
company. ``These decisions should be based on your own individual
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD I LOWER THE PERCENTAGE OF MY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE IN
STOCKS?
</P>
<P>
   That depends partly on how you feel about risk and partly on the
confidence you have in your current financial plan. If things are
getting so scary that you might panic, you may need to cut back on
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But you should take baby steps. If you find that 60 percent of
your portfolio is in stocks, you might want to trim that allocation
to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ARE SOME SAFER, OR AT LEAST STEADIER, INVESTMENTS?
</P>
<P>
   One choice is the government's I-bonds. The interest rate paid
on them is adjusted for inflation, and you can certainly expect to
get your investment back.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy I-bonds at the U.S. Treasury's Web site,
www.savingsbonds.gov, and you can use a credit card. Right now the
bonds are paying 6.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you might want the money back within the next six
months, a money market mutual fund is a good idea. You will get
regular interest payments, and you can buy and sell them as readily
as any other mutual fund. All of the major mutual fund families
offer money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DO I DEAL WITH THE STRESS?
</P>
<P>
   You can make sure your investments are diversified. If more than
5 percent of your money is in one stock, for example, you can
reduce your risk by selling some shares.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique is to focus on your long-term goals, not on
your short-term performance. That should help cut the temptations
of greed or fear. You might want to cut back on the number of times
you check on the prices of your investments. The more frequently
you look at the stock tables, the more likely you are to think you
ought to do something about those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH RISK IS TOO MUCH?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone must answer that question for himself. One clue is
whether your investments keep you nervous all the time. One way to
test yourself is to imagine what would happen to your portfolio in
a steep decline. If the idea of a 20 percent drop makes you ill,
for example, you may shift some of your money to low-volatility
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Think also about when you will need the money. If it's within
five years, your investments should not be in stocks to start with.
</P>
<P>
   IS MY RETIREMENT PLAN SAFE?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 74 years, large-company stocks have returned 11.4
percent a year. Chop that up into five-year periods, and the
chances of losing money are only one in 10. If you are years away
from retirement, the higher returns of stocks may be more
significant than the risk of losing principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's long-term money,'' said Jan Holman, a market strategist
for American Express. ``If you're investing regularly, as you
should be, you're doing exactly the right thing. You should keep on
doing it, and hold on to what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IF I'M RETIRING IN SIX MONTHS?
</P>
<P>
   A retiree should have one to two years worth of expenses in
cash, certificates of deposit or other readily available
investments. ``That's the position you want to be in,'' said
Holman. ``It gives you time to let the rest of your portfolio
recover and begin working for you again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't recommend wholesale selling,'' she added. ``I'd
wait at least until Tuesday to see what happens. Monday is going to
be the land of margin calls.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT INVESTMENTS FOR MY KIDS' COLLEGE EXPENSES?
</P>
<P>
   How old are your kids? If they are close to college age, you
probably want the money in stable investments, such as certificates
of deposit. If they are pre-teens, you've got more flexibility. You
can consider staying with the usually higher returns from stocks,
despite the higher risks.

   The New York Times plans a page and a half stories and graphics
on Friday's dramatic stock market fall.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks went into free fall on Friday as
investors had to digest surprisingly bad news on inflation and the
fear of higher interest rates. The beleaguered Nasdaq index plunged
a near record 10 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell more than 5 percent each. The
fall ended the worst week ever for the Nasdaq composite. Almost no
company survived unscathed. All 30 stocks in the Dow fell while all
but 16 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 index were down. The impact of the
decline is even greater because it comes on the back of several
weeks of wild daily market swings and the plunge of the Nasdaq
earlier this week into bear market territory. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer and Alex Berenson.

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Floyd Norris looks at the
relationship between the stock market and the economy as a whole
and the implications of Friday's big market losses.
</P>
<P>
   DOTCOM-LOSSES (Mountain View, Calif.) _ Caught in the capricious
swings of a volatile stock market, HearMe, an Internet company, has
had a remarkable ride since it went public a year ago. But nothing
compares to the last week. Last April, the day the company went
public at $18, its stock jumped to $51 before settling at $36. But
its chief executive, Paul Matteucci, son of a butcher and a man
with street-wise sensibilities, politely declines to acknowledge
the opening-day peak. But those opening-day numbers seem a distant
memory. With the Nasdaq ebbing into bear territory, HearMe's stock,
at $20 a week ago, went into free fall this week, closing at $12 on
Thursday and trading as low as $7.50 on Friday. No matter that one
analyst says HearMe, which makes software for voice chat over the
Internet, is clearly a stronger company than it was a year ago.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ For weeks the accelerating inflation
rate was confined to gasoline and energy, but in March it spread to
other areas of the American economy, the government reported
yesterday. This suggests that the robust demand generated by the
stock market had finally given business the leverage to raise
prices and make them stick. The announcement of the inflation
breakthrough _ in the form of an 0.7 percent increase in the
Consumer Price Index _ came from the Labor Department an hour
before the stock markets opened, and contributed to the huge
sell-off. By Louis Uchitelle. (900 words)

 &HT;    Season hasn't started, and Cowboys already are behind
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ By the time the Washington Redskins rake in two
of college football's elite players in today's NFL draft, Jerry
Jones and the Dallas Cowboys' scouting staff will just be rolling
out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a bench-mark day for the Redskins. With the second
and third picks of the first round, they are expected to take two
of the following: Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington, Penn State
defensive end Courtney Brown, Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels and Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of those players will be a winning hand for
35-year-old Daniel Snyder, the fiery and controversial owner of the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 miles away in Valley Ranch, the braintrust of the
Cowboys will be watching the clock, wondering who will be available
with the 49th pick. With no first-round choice in their possession,
it's going to be a long day for the boys in blue and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, the Redskins officially will surpass the
Cowboys in overall talent and potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins represent Snyder _ young, aggressive, hungry. The
Cowboys represent Jones, whose glory days have gone by.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Cowboys traded their first-round pick for
Seattle wide receiver Joey Galloway, who, with the possible
exception of Warrick, is better than any receiver coming out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is a good addition for Dallas. Combined with Rocket
Ismail, the Cowboys have one of the best receiver tandems in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   If Dallas receives a healthy contribution from receivers Jason
Tucker, former Texas Longhorn Wane McGarity and former Tennessee
tight end Jackie Harris, the Cowboys will be fun to watch on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to keep up with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   With slick maneuvering the past two years, former Washington
general manager Charley Casserley _ now with Houston's expansion
franchise _ found a way to give the Redskins two of the top three
picks this year. One came last season when New Orleans Coach Mike
Ditka struck a deal with the Redskins to ensure Ricky Williams
would become a Saint.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much, said the Redskins, who had no interest in
Williams anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Washington slid down a spot in the 1999 draft, took Georgia
cornerback Champ Bailey, and now is in line to pick one of Penn
State's All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Snyder gained ownership of the Redskins, he fired people in
almost every department, the first indication he would do whatever
it takes to build a winner. Although his team won the NFC East,
Snyder was steamed because the Redskins lost twice to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That might not happen again soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins made another good move this spring by signing
future Hall-of-Fame defensive end Bruce Smith. He lends leadership
for a team that is this close to becoming a real Super Bowl
contender.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Redskins made Jeff George the most expensive
insurance policy in the league. He will be a backup to Brad Johnson
_ at least for now _ and earn $18.5 million over four years. Daniel
Snyder will not let money become an issue in building his empire.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has had a similar attitude in Dallas, but this year he's
playing with empty pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway will be a good player in Dallas, but he's only
compensation for Michael Irvin, who will never play again because
of a spinal injury. Fullback Daryl Johnston is only a memory. Deion
Sanders no longer will be seen in prime time, at least not in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas does not have a choice in the first and third rounds
today. Jones hinted this week the Cowboys might trade their
second-round pick to gain additional picks in the late rounds. If
Jones can find an impact player after the second round, more power
to him.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Cowboys are plugging holes to stay above
water. They re-signed linebacker Dexter Coakley and safety George
Teague. They picked up cornerback Ryan McNeil in free agency to
replace Sanders. Former Indy quarterback Paul Justin replaces the
departed Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   For every step the Cowboys take forward, they take one back.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, the Cowboys will use their first pick on a
cornerback Perhaps Tennessee's Dwayne Goodrich or Florida State's
Mario Edwards will still be on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys draft a second-round cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins draft Arrington and Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed. The balance of power in the NFC East has shifted.

<P>
   For weeks the accelerating inflation rate was confined to
gasoline and energy, but in March it spread to other areas of the
U.S. economy, the government reported Friday. This suggested that
the robust demand generated by the stock market had finally given
business the power to raise prices and make them stick.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the inflation breakthrough _ in the form of
an 0.7 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index _ came from the
Labor Department an hour before the stock markets opened, and
contributed to the huge sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets move on emotion,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief
economist at Prudential Securities. ``They were nervous coming into
the trading day, and traders seized on the CPI as justification for
continuing to be bearish.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern is that rising inflation will encourage the
Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates by even more than the
quarter-point increases that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman,
has promised over the next two or three months to slow the economy
and ease stock prices down. Rich stock portfolios financed much of
the spending that has created so much demand and helped to push up
the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Rising energy prices made the biggest contribution to the
increase in the overall inflation rate, the largest one-month jump
since last April. Gasoline prices alone rose 11 percent, to $1.59.4
a gallon, on average, the highest level _ ignoring inflation _ ever
recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   What caught the market's attention, however, was the ``core''
inflation rate, which measures all price increases except those for
energy and food, which are considered too volatile to provide a
clear picture of inflation. This core rate rose 0.4 percent in
March, double the monthly increase over most of the past two years.
Not since January 1995 has the core rate risen so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to draw any grand conclusions from this core
number,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Alex. Brown. ``Whether it signals an inflection point or is simply
the result of a number of aberrations, no one can say yet. I am
more in the aberration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The increases were fairly widespread. Furnishing, renovating and
repairing a home, for example, grew more costly in March, perhaps
because families cashed in stock or borrowed against their
portfolios to upgrade their homes. Hotels and resort rates also
rose smartly. ``You have a lot of people with a lot of money, and
they apparently want to take time off and vacation,'' said Patrick
Jackman, a senior economist in the bureau division that produces
the price index.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages in these industries may also have helped to nudge
up the inflation rate, analysts said. Certainly labor costs played
a role in March's 0.5 percent increase in medical-care costs. Most
of that was a result of higher doctors' fees, although hospital
charges also rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tight labor markets are almost certainly beginning to have
some impact on consumer prices,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Airline fares jumped 4.6 percent in March, pushed up by the cost
of fuel, airlines say. And tobacco prices jumped, primarily because
of increases in cigarette taxes, especially a 55-cent-a-pack rise
in New York state. And vehicle prices rose, mainly because General
Motors canceled a $500 rebate on most of its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the still-booming stock market helped to sustain the
demand for new cars, but if this week's sell-off continues, auto
sales are likely to fall, analysts said, prompting car companies to
step up discounts, and generally easing the pressure on prices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everything could change in the next few weeks,'' said Edward
Hyman, president of ISI Group Inc., a Wall Street investment firm.
``The market is getting crushed, and if demand weakens with the
market, pricing power is going to be crushed, too. This morning the
report I got from our auto survey showed that luxury car sales in
the New York City area were as good as they could possibly be. That
cannot last without a strong stock market, and the car companies
will respond with discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, the core inflation rate was only 1.9 percent,
but with last month's jump the average over the previous 12 months
moved up to 2.4 percent. When food and energy are added back, the
12-month moving average in the overall price index has gone from
2.7 percent in December to 3.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   That is well above the inflation target of roughly 2 percent
that has guided Fed policy in recent years. If the higher inflation
rate endures, the Fed will almost certainly continue to push up
rates, probably by a quarter of a point at a time at its
policy-making meetings every six weeks. The next is May 16.
</P>
<P>
   But if stock prices keep falling or fail to rebound, that would
play a big role in Fed thinking. Greenspan has said he would cut
rates if he thought a market sell-off was endangering the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that another Fed rate increase is no longer
as inevitable as it seemed early this week,'' Yardeni said. ``The
Fed does not like to act in periods of market uncertainty.''

   A Tempest In a Condiment Cap &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz and Del Monte Foods are trading barbs over a ketchup
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz, whose iconic ketchup has been the market leader seemingly
forever, said early this month that it would introduce a cap for
its plastic containers that is designed to capture the watery stuff
that can hit your food after you start squeezing the bottle. (Water
tends to collect atop pureed fruits and vegetables through a
natural process called syneresis.)
</P>
<P>
   The new Heinz contraption has a reservoir and a small tube built
inside a tall cap. When the bottle is turned upside down, syneresis
fluid that may be present is trapped in the cap, while the thicker
ketchup is sucked out through the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new about that, retorted Del Monte, the No. 3 ketchup
marketer, behind Heinz and Hunt's. According to Maria Ruta, a
spokeswoman, Del Monte introduced a patented syneresis cap with its
plastic bottle six years ago, but did not promote it because its
ketchup formulation does not create a significant syneresis
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz contends that its technology is a first and says it may
seek a patent on its cap design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point of view is, as category leader, we're upholding a
rather long history of being first,'' said Deb Magness, a Heinz
spokeswoman. ``We were first with the squeeze bottle and first with
the recyclable bottle, and now we're first to solve the issue of
the watery stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the Del Monte cap that Ruta said worked fine back in
1994?
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a look at Del Monte's cap and found it ineffective
against our standards,'' Magness said.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz plans to trumpet its syneresis cap in a big advertising
and promotional campaign as the new ketchup bottles reach stores
over the next 60 to 90 days. &QL;

&HT;     WASHINGTON POLICE PLAN TO AVOID VIOLENCE OF SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vowing to avoid the violence that erupted last year
in Seattle, police in the nation's capital took control of the
city's sidewalks and streets Friday to thwart demonstrators' plans
to block traffic and shut down a joint meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan police Chief Charles Ramsey promised to give the
protesters ``a chance to speak'' but insisted that the IMF and
World Bank have a ``constitutional'' right to hold their meeting,
scheduled for Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These protesters have no right to come to our city and chain
themselves together and block traffic, nor do they have the right
to stop anybody from going into or out of a building,'' Ramsey told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Han Shan, a spokesman for Mobilization for Global Justice, an
umbrella group that has helped organize the protests, pledged that
the Sunday and Monday demonstrations would be nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for trouble, but we want our message to be
heard,'' he said in a small park across the street from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Shan said ``a large number'' of protesters were receiving
special training Friday for the protests. He would not detail the
tactics they plan to use, but said, ``It could be a very
interesting couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 activists are expected to stage sit-ins and
create human barricades to try prevent IMF and World Bank delegates
from reaching their meetings Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning a dump truck deposited four tons of manure
outside a World Bank building. Driven by a man dressed in a cow
costume, the rented truck was festooned with signs saying ``World
Bank: Meat Stinks'' to protest bank loans to developing countries
where animal research is conducted. Police quickly cleared the
scene and arrested the driver and his passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank provides long-term loans for economic development
projects in poor countries while the IMF arranges short-term loans
directly to countries in sudden economic crisis _ often imposing
severe austerity measures on them in return for the aid.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse groups of protesters are also calling on the lending
organizations to push for greater environmental protection,
workers' rights and wider distribution of wealth, especially
through debt forgiveness for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent protesters from blocking delegates from attending the
meeting, police have closed most streets around the World Bank and
IMF buildings, allowing only pedestrians and authorized vehicles in
the four-block area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, police have set up barriers to allow four entry and
exit points around the lending institutions' buildings for
delegates' cars. So if protesters want to block vehicles from
entering or leaving, they must cut off all four roads around the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it gives the cars four ways (in and) out instead of
one, which makes the protesters' job a lot harder,'' Metropolitan
Police Sgt. Michael Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Metropolitan police, joined by U.S. Park Police and
federal security officers, stood on downtown street corners as
other officers patrolled the area by car and bike. Several police
vans and buses also were parked around the IMF and World Bank
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they hoped that the arrest Wednesday night of seven
people who were delivering special materials to be used for
blockading streets would help keep the roads clear Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The materials _ metal and plastic tubes, chains and chicken wire
_ could be used to construct so-called ``lock boxes'' or ``sleeping
dragons'' that protesters use to chain themselves together to shut
down streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, protestors had driven two vehicles from the
Maryland suburbs to D.C. with about 300 tubes and other equipment,
which police seized.
</P>
<P>
   Used in the protests last December against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle, the tubes allow demonstrators, linking
arms inside the pipes, to form human chains. The tubes are wrapped
in chicken wire, covered with tar and overlaid with duct tape _ all
designed to foil police efforts to saw through them.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey admitted that the tubes are ``very effective'' but said
his department has formed a special unit that includes
firefighters. The unit has equipment that can extricate victims
from car wrecks or any protesters using the lock boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is prevent what happened in Seattle,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the White House also was extremely tight. Uniformed
Secret Service guards patrolled the front lawn of the mansion,
ready to grab anyone who was able to climb the 10-foot iron fence.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service police patrolled the sidewalk in front of the fence
and Metropolitan police maintained a large force on Pennsylvania
Avenue and streets surrounding the White House compound, located
two long blocks from the World Bank and IMF buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Police also patrolled Potomac River bridges linking Northern
Virginia with D.C. The patrol was designed to thwart any effort to
blockade the spans during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Last November and December in Seattle, protestors, many of whom
are in the nation's capital this week, shut down the opening
ceremonies of the World Trade Organization's annual meeting. The
Seattle demonstrations, televised worldwide, quickly turned
violent. Police sprayed tear gas and fired rubber pellets at many
peaceful protesters but failed to stop window-smashing and looting
by a relatively small group of vandals less than a block away.
Damage was estimated at several million dollars, and 600 people
were arrested. Seattle police Chief Norm Stamper, criticized for
his handling of the protests, resigned. To avoid a similar event,
Washington's Metropolitan Police Department has been preparing for
the World Banks-IMF protests for months. Nearly 1,500 officers took
a special daylong course to train for the demonstrations. They
watched videos of how Seattle police lost control and practiced
scenarios such as how to handle 5,000 protesters trying to block a
major street.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers from federal and other local area law
enforcement agencies are standing by in case they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Police here also purchased $1 million worth of riot gear for the
Sunday-Monday demonstrations, including helmets with neck
protectors and arm, chest and shin guards. In addition to service
weapons, officers are carrying gas masks. Some will bear arms that
can shoot rubber bullets or deliver tear gas. However, officers are
forbidden from launching any tear gas without orders from Ramsey or
Metropolitan Police Executive Assistant Chief Terrance Gainer.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the police precautions, protesters have managed to
cause minor disruptions around the city such as the dump-truck
incident Friday morning, which was staged by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals.

 &HT;    Falcons low on selections, options
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the NFL had an emergency room for wounded teams,
the Atlanta Falcons might be there today.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves and the Falcons are still ailing from last
year's wreck of a draft-day trade.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that deal, Reeves, who repeatedly says a team
must build through the NFL draft, will be out of action as the
first round rolls by with his team on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And the bleeding gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven players on the Falcons' roster pre-date Reeves'
arrival in 1997, but he won't be re-making the roster much this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His team has six picks, one each in rounds two through seven, a
drop from the nine choices that Reeves had in each of his first
three years as coach.
</P>
<P>
   The damaging blow came on draft day last year, when Reeves
traded the team's first-round pick in this draft for Baltimore's
second-round pick in that one.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons used that pick to select tight end Reggie Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly caught eight passes, and the Ravens own this draft's fifth
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, don't expect the Falcons to trade up from 37th
overall in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things usually cost you a lot,'' Reeves said.
``We paid dearly last year. But if there's something that would
help the team, we'd consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's salary cap requires that teams keep a lot of draft
choices, because youngplayers cost less.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 20 of the 27 players the Falcons have drafted in
three years under Reeves are on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end O.J. Santiago, linebacker Henri Crockett and guard
Calvin Collins are starters from the 1997 draft. From 1998,
linebacker Keith Brooking _ a first-round choice _ and right tackle
Ephraim Salaam start.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Patrick Kerney, the team's first-round pick in
1999, is expected to start. And Bob Hallen, a second-rounder in
1998, might start.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then more than a quarter, seven out of 27, drafted under
Reeves would be starting. That percentage is near the NFL average.
``It's even more important now (that a team draft well), because in
this system ... you can't sign all your veterans,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-the-job training has gone by the wayside. If you had the
choice, you would rather keep your core players and work young guys
in slowly, but that's not the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   What Reeves has done is similar to what has happened to two
rivals in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints, perennial cellar dwellers, and the
defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams also hired new coaches
in 1997. Each team has just six players from before then.
</P>
<P>
   On the Saints, four are former first-round picks, and one is a
former fifth-rounder. The Rams have two former first-rounders, two
players from the second round and one from the third.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, teams get a bigger contribution from better draft
choices. It is another reason that Reeves is feeling the pain in
the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons drafted only three of the seven players who preceded
Reeves to the team _ left tackle Bob Whitfield (first round in
1992), running back Jamal Anderson (seventh round in 1994) and
defensive tackle Travis Hall (sixth round in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terence Mathis, kicker Morten Andersen, punter Dan
Stryzinski came as free agents. Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle was
undrafted out of college in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, just two players who started for St. Louis in the
Super Bowl, defensive end Kevin Carter and since-departed right
tackle Fred Miller, came out of the 1995 and 1996 drafts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams got more out of recent draft choices, but they also
added vital pieces in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Marshall Faulk was acquired by trade, and
quarterback Kurt Warner was salvaged as a free agent a couple years
ago. Defensive tackle D'Marco Farr was undrafted out of college in
'94.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one way to build a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Rams' 41 draft choices the past five years, just 18 _ 44
percent _ are with the team. Nine of them start.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, the AFC champion, drafted 45 players the past five
years, and 30 of them are with the team, including nine starters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two of the 38 players the Falcons drafted in the past
five years _ 58 percent _ are still with the team. Eight of them
start.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the quality not only of those eight but also of players
added as free agents and through trades that counts most.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency affords teams a way to correct for its draft
blunders _ at a price. It all comes down to personnel evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question (that) that's correct,'' Reeves said.
``Because if (draft choices) don't perform, they'll eventually be
gone. But you'd rather not go (the free-agent) route; it's not good
business. You'd rather do well in the draft.''

`THREE KINGS' A CROWNING EXAMPLE OF A BOLD, ENERGETIC MOVIE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THREE KINGS'
</P>
<P>
   Among the many movies more deserving of a best-picture Oscar
nomination than clunky ``The Cider House Rules,'' none stands
taller than ``Three Kings,'' a bold, energizing triumph from
writer-director David O. Russell.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your typical war movie, but then, the Gulf War wasn't
a typical war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' starts as it ends: with survivors frantically
regrouping.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunism amid the mayhem takes many forms, and for Sgt. Maj.
Gates (George Clooney) this means leading some soldiers (Mark
Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze) on an unauthorized mission.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal? Gold. They've pinpointed bullion that Sadam Hussein
stole from Kuwait and hoarded in desert bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking it, they're drawn into a protective role for citizens
subject to slaughter by vengeful Iraqi soldiers. Greed then wars
with the demands of human survival.
</P>
<P>
   This strongly acted, politically charged adventure is riddled
with as many laughs as bullets, though the humor comes in weird,
twisted ways.
</P>
<P>
   With Simpsons dolls on the hoods of jeeps and jeans and cell
phones among the loot, ``Three Kings'' is spurred by the madness of
modern war in a world grown smaller through media scrutiny and
cross-cultural pollination.
</P>

   `THE INSIDER'
</P>
<P>
   Filmgoers avoided this Oscar contender because it sounded like
the world's greatest ``duh?'': A man (Russell Crowe) who was fired
by a tobacco giant blows the whistle to ``60 Minutes'' about the
company's cover-up of tobacco's harmfulness.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual true story is far more complex, as are the media
machinations involving ``60 Minutes''' failure to at first follow
through on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' features a remarkable performance by Crowe as
the lonely, courageous David facing a corporate Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   But it's often sidetracked by the star-powered showboating of Al
Pacino as a ``60 Minutes'' field producer.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino may be a great actor who commands every scene, but that's
the trouble: He gets too many scenes, and the movie shouldn't be
about him. Rather, it should be about Crowe's Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' shifts so much toward a CBS focus that it's
surprising the network balked at its creation. If anything, the
film lionizes ``60 Minutes'' by presenting it as a journalistic
paragon (albeit a flawed one) so far beyond any other that the New
York Times looks minor league.
</P>
<P>
   On the dark side _ or, at least, a self-protective one _ is
Christopher Plummer as newsman Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Vain and bullying, Plummer is great, but even he is less
villainous and more sensibly pragmatic than the film allows, once
you consider the hysterical preachiness of Pacino's endless tirades
about media integrity.

   `THREE TO TANGO'
</P>
<P>
   This comedy of confusion hinges on the premise that architect
Matthew Perry is misconstrued as gay, but its snickering,
embarrassed approach toward sexuality is distinctly retro.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and partner Oliver Platt hope to win a big contract from a
philandering, jealous tycoon (Dylan McDermott). While dangling the
carrot, the businessman picks Perry as an allegedly safe companion
for his mistress (Neve Campbell).
</P>
<P>
   When Perry falls for her but can't tell her he's straight,
predictable complications ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his wry and hapless ``Friends'' schtick, Perry tries
too hard, but at least he doesn't play gay with silly mannerisms.
Campbell and McDermott have no discernible characters to play.
</P>

end-credit wrap-up that's a hoot.

   `SUPERSTAR'
</P>
<P>
   Among the movies spawned by ``Saturday Night Live'' sketches,
this one is traditional.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a good thing. It means it's fitfully funny but
doesn't play well at feature length.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Shannon portrays Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine
Gallagher, who's prone to bizarre mannerisms and pines for a jock
(Will Ferrell). She tries to become a ``superstar'' to catch his
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon tries to make her troubled character perversely
endearing, but she's inconsistent. The same girl who innocently
longs for her first kiss has lascivious encounters with trees and
violently assails her rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Also unfunny in view of recent school tragedies is the way
``Superstar'' makes light of kids' cruelty to each other. In real
life, this is serious business; here, it's a running joke.

booklet and, much like ``Tarzan,'' an interactive read-along
feature, a trivia game and the theatrical trailer.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S RELATIVES LAUNCH NEW LEGAL ATTACK
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A day after a tense showdown and a surprise reprieve,
the fight over Elian Gonzalez boiled Friday with a new legal attack
and a simmering debate over a controversial videotape of the boy
made by his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the child's Florida relatives opened a new front in
their legal war, filing a motion in a Washington, D.C. federal
court seeking to block Elian's return to Cuba until the government
certifies that the communist island nation is in compliance with
the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor is returned to Cuba, he
``would face the risk of being persecuted for having sought asylum
in the United States,'' lawyers for Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, wrote in their pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the matter was set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a different court, lawyers for the Justice
Department stepped up their attack, asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to order the Miami family to turn the
boy over to his father until the court rules in a lawsuit stemming
from the case.
</P>
<P>
   In their filings, government lawyers told the court that Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has promised not to return with his
son to Cuba until a hearing, now set for May 11 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the Atlanta court would rule on the matter
over the weekend or wait until early next week.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, tensions subsided, a marked contrast to Thursday when
the Miami relatives defied an order by Attorney General Janet Reno
to hand the boy over to be reunited with his father. Fears that
federal marshals would come for Elian prompted thousands of Cuban
exiles to pack the Little Havana neighborhood near the Florida
family's house, with many vowing to form a human chain to stop the
removal of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains on Friday kept the crowds much smaller,
although more than 100 people huddled under a large blue tarp and
dozens of umbrellas late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father remained in the Washington area Friday, where he
has been living at the home of a top Cuban diplomat since arriving
in the United States April 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National
Council of Churches and a key supporter, told reporters that
Gonzalez has been unable to speak with his son for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami family has complete control over access to his son
and that's real hard for him to take,'' she said. ``He has tried to
talk to Elian by telephone numerous times, three times in my
presence. He gets an answering machine that's full.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez reportedly was seething with anger over a videotape
made by his Miami relatives showing his son defiantly telling his
father he doesn't want to return to Cuba. The family released the
tape to a Spanish-language television network early Thursday, and
it quickly became a hot topic of conversation on television and
radio programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on NBC's ``Today'' program Friday, Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner called the tape ``deeply
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., also interviewed on the show,
was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconscionable that they would use that child in this
way,'' she said. ``The child was brainwashed. They're doing to him
what they're accusing Castro of planning to do to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A family attorney, Spencer Eig, denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family was tired, frightened and insulted by the constant
badgering and threats of INS,'' Eig said. ``How is that exploiting
him?''
</P>
<P>
   The escalating rhetoric seemed to dim hopes that a compromise
might be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to take the boy without the family's cooperation, Reno
has offered to take both sides to a secure, neutral location where
they could live in separate quarters for one or two weeks, sharing
custody of Elian while they work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides can't agree on who would have custody of Elian
at the start _ and the end _ of such a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports on Friday that the government has
prepared a plan to extract the boy from the Little Havana home if
the Miami relatives don't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take action in a way that's appropriate when we're
ready,'' Meissner said, noting that the family is now in violation
of the law by ignoring Reno's order.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Eig responded that the family would stand aside and not
interfere if the government takes Elian, but they also would not
assist in the act or take the boy elsewhere to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family will not be the deportation officers for the
INS,'' he said. ``They won't relieve INS of its moral
responsibility in enforcing this order.''

   NOTE: THERE IS NO THIRD SENATE VOTE ON BUDGET COMPROMISE.
INFORMATION UNAVAILABLE AT TIME OF PRESS. SEE NEXT WEEK'S VOTE
CHART. WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 227.
WASHINGTON, April 14 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on April 7 approved, 51 to 45, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget plan for fiscal year 2001. The measure, which would
cut taxes $150 billion over five years, would provide spending for
defense, education and prescription drug benefits for Medicare
recipients. Supporters said the bill ensures fiscal discipline
while freeing up money for tax relief. Opponents said the tax cut
was too large. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAX
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to advance a plan that would repeal
the federal gasoline tax. In a 56 to 43 vote, the plan failed to
receive the 60 votes needed for a floor vote. Supporters said the
plan would help consumers by reducing gas prices at the pump.
Opponents said the plan would jeopardize important highway and
transportation projects. A ``yes'' vote favors the plan.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 358 to 60, a plan to offer $100
million in financial incentives for states that impose a five-year
minimum sentence on people who use guns while committing violent
crimes or drug trafficking offenses. The spending, which requires
that states implement a public awareness campaign against gun
violence, would be offered to applying states over a five year
period. Supporters said the plan would dramatically reduce gun
violence. Opponents said the grant was too vague and smaller than
what is needed to reduce violence nearly one year after the
shootings at Columbine High School. A ``yes'' vote favors the plan.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 424 to 0, a plan that would make
it harder for the federal government to seize property from people
suspected of drug-dealing and other crimes. Supporters said the
plan would protect innocent people victimized by wrongful seizures.
There were no opponents to the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: AGREEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 220 to 208, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget compromise for fiscal year 2001 that finalized
plans already approved in the House and Senate. The measure would
offer tax cuts of at least $150 billion over five years, and as
much as $215 billion if the economy continues to grow. The budget
also allocates spending for defense, education and prescription
drug benefits for Medicare recipients. Supporters said the budget
plan would help eliminate the national debt, provide needed tax
relief, and boost education, defense, and health research spending.
Opponents said the budget plan offered large tax cuts at the
expense of important social programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
budget.

 &HT;    Freaknik leaves Atlanta cold
 &HT;    By John McCosh
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Freaknik didn't go Underground Atlanta this year. It
didn't go to Lenox Square mall. And it wasn't to be found along
Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   The college students who clogged Atlanta's streets with
party-mobiles for most of the past decade apparently are sunning
themselves on the beaches of Galveston, Tex., this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place used to be packed three years ago,'' said Keith
Bruce, who arrived Friday with about 20 friends at Lenox Square's
food court from Minneapolis, Minn. ``Now just look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   What he saw in the mall's atrium Friday afternoon was a mix of
serious shoppers dressed for business, window shoppers pushing
strollers and a few groups of bored-looking young men in search of
something to do.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta wasn't a ghost town Friday, it was about 100,000
students short of Freaknik's peak in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting signs of Freaknik, conventionally known as Black
College Spring Break, included vendors selling Freaknik 2000
T-shirts. One shirt declared ``It's all about the Benjamins.'' But
not many $100 bills appeared to be changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Underground Atlanta, also a Freaknik hotspot in previous years,
was fairly busy for a Friday afternoon, with older tourists and
families strolling through. Security guards remarked that even
Hooters, one of the few public places where flesh was showing in
downtown Atlanta, didn't attract a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Galveston indicate that Freaknik hasn't
disappeared, only relocated across the Mississippi. With a promoter
funding security and clean up, the city is expecting somewhere
between 250,000 and 500,000 people to converge on a 50-block
stretch along a sea wall for an organized party scheduled to last
all weekend.

NEW EMBLEM FOR RED CROSS WOULD ENABLE ISRAEL TO JOIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The Red Cross has decided to adopt a new emblem, in
addition to its red cross and red crescent, to clear the way for
Israel to join after 50 years of exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, taken at a two-day summit of governments and Red
Cross representatives, followed pressures from the American Red
Cross to admit Israel's equivalent relief-services organization,
the Magen David Adom (Red Shield of David), whose symbol is a red
six-pointed star.
</P>
<P>
   At its founding in 1949, the International Committee for the Red
Cross adopted three symbols _ the red cross, the red crescent, and
Iran's red lion and sun, which was dropped in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has staunchly resisted adding new national or
religious symbols, insisting that each new member adopt the red
cross or the crescent. Some members are said to have specifically
resisted the entry of Israel into the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The new emblem under consideration is a red diamond. Although
details have yet to be worked out, it is envisioned now that
Israel's emblem, like those of any other national society that
wanted to change its symbol, would be an inset in a corner of the
diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations could also use a combination of symbols, which is
now forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Although it did not block the plan, the American Red Cross
argued that it was unnecessary, because the International Committee
of the Red Cross, which is responsible for civilians in war zones,
already has the authority to admit Israel's group without the
drawn-out process that approving a new emblem will entail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a consensus _ minus one _ to proceed,'' said Lawrence
Eagleburger, a former top U.S. diplomat, speaking on behalf of the
American Red Cross. He said it was ``morally wrong'' to exclude
Israel's relief organization. ``We've fought this for years. It's
gone on long enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the point, the American Red Cross last month withheld $5
million in membership dues to the Swiss-run ICRC and an additional
$350,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, which cares for disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Red Cross has to ask itself whether it is
prepared to be as active in a general institution that is doing
things that are improper or not justified,'' Eagleburger said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, he emphasized, would work, if necessary,
directly with country aid groups in humanitarian emergencies _
raising the possibility of a split in the Red Cross movement, which
now includes 188 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Red Cross officials were defiant. ``We're
prepared for a little poverty rather than just doing what they
want,'' said one, who asked not to be identified. These officials
insisted that they must move deliberately to bring all countries on
board to change the emblem and admit Israel, but others argued that
delay would be used to keep Israel out.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Lior, an Israeli foreign ministry official attending the
meeting, said it would be up to the country's relief society to
decide whether to accept a new symbol. ``It's not an easy
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Israeli relief group did not send a representative to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the emblem controversy is concern that if Palestine is
declared a state, its relief group _ which uses the red crescent _
will quickly become an official Red Cross member while Israel
remains on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross said it would hold the ICRC president,
Jakob Kellenberger, ``to the promise he made to the American Red
Cross and members of the United States Congress to invoke a safety
net if this diplomatic approach fails to grant immediate membership
to MDA (Magen David Adom) by the end of the year.''

 &HT;    Market dive hasn't hampered spending by wealthy, retailers say
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For wealthy consumers, flush with stock-market gains
but hammered by Friday's sell-off, the hangover is probably just
setting in.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the stock market's recent jitters haven't had much
impact on purchases of pricey homes, boats, cars and jewelry, said
Roger Tutterow, co-director of Kennesaw State University's
Econometrics Center. But if it lasts, ``it could have a significant
impact on consumer spending.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the market is eroding away. ``We haven't seen a
correction of this duration and intensity. Option babies are
depending on the stock market to make payments on their
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, retailers say other factors are making it too early to
tell if people are scaling back luxury purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other things interrupting people's schedules _
school vacations, Easter, Passover _ and we have to take account of
them,'' said real estate agent Bill Kramer, whose listings at Metro
Brokers Better Homes and Gardens include houses priced from
$475,000 to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people definitely will think twice before sticking their
necks out,'' he added. ``There was all that euphoria; people with
lots of money. Some of that has eroded, but others still make a lot
of money. So far, no one has specifically told me that they were
going to delay buying.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before Friday, sliding stock prices had undermined the
plans of at least one potential home buyer in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Vawter of Jenny Pruitt &AMP; Associates said he had a house
under contract that was to have closed in June at just under $1
million. ``The other agent said the buyer's stock had gone down and
he couldn't close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely will be people who hold up decisions to see
how things go. In (the summer of) 1998, when the market tanked,
sales slowed down,'' said Kramer. ``The same probably will happen
now, and April and May sales won't be as much as March.''
</P>
<P>
   Early April is also a slow time of year for luxury auto sales
because of the tax season, said several Atlanta-area dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to get their tax returns in and get their payments
behind them,'' said Bill Florence, general sales manager at
Hennessy Lexus in Atlanta. ``Certainly a lot of people would have
to be looking at the stock market, and if they had a lot of losses,
they would be delaying some purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added, ``So far our sales are still on track for our
objective this month. If (the market) continues to go down, down,
down, it will certainly have a bearing on our business. But
hopefully we'll see a rebound and that would (encourage) people to
buy big ticket items.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a slowdown in sales, it would most likely be
for entry-level vehicles, said David Smith, general sales manager
of Atlanta Classic Cars, a Mercedes-Benz dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of entry-level luxury cars tend to be new-money people,
he said.

<P>
   ``The very, very affluent are usually not going to change their
car style,'' he said. ``If the chairman of Home Depot takes a hit,
he's not going to start driving a Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   At Troncalli Jaguar, sales manager Bill Clark said next week
will give a glimpse of the market's influence on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business will likely pick up next Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday,'' he said. But he conceded that much of the Jaguar
clientele is ``pretty heavily tied to the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off one of its best sales totals for March, the boating
sales staff at Brown's Bridge Marine on Lake Lanier is not feeling
the pain of the stock market, said brokerage manager Mark Cochran.
``We've been really very busy'' selling boats $100,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   One area jeweler that sells pricey items said it may be a while
before they see another nouveau riche customer like the one who
splurged recently on a $30,000 diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, customers seem oblivious, perhaps because they were
shopping Friday and not watching stocks tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen a drop-off,'' said Greg Knox, owner of Knox
Jewelers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Queen, a manager at D. Geller &AMP; Son, said, ``Traffic has
picked up double today because most customers have already filed
(their taxes).''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The students with purple hair, the graying
academics with Jerry Garcia beards and the union organizers with
their anti-WTO buttons had crowded into the college auditorium to
hear some red-meat _ make that green-vegetable _ radicalism. And
Ralph Nader, America's foremost consumer curmudgeon, did not
disappoint:
</P>
<P>
   Globe-trotting corporations are sucking the life out of small
businesses and family farms. Pollution is poisoning our rivers and
air. Inner-city schools and health clinics are crumbling. And while
the nation corrodes, the rich are buying and selling politicians
like baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business is on a collision course with American democracy,
and American democracy has been losing,'' said Nader, who in his
dark suit was the most conventional-looking person in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The man who became famous by killing off a sporty but unstable
little car called the Corvair some 35 years ago is at it again,
running for president on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his previous presidential effort in 1996, when he
refused to raise money, spent less than $5,000 and attracted barely
1 percent of the vote, this time he is serious, Nader insists. And
that could spell trouble for Vice President Al Gore, from whose
Democratic column Nader is likely to draw most of his votes,
political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically said I wasn't going to campaign in '96,'' said
Nader. ``This is a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is cranking up that campaign just in time to step onto the
world stage this weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters
descend on Washington to demonstrate against the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Green Party affiliates from
around the world are playing a major role in the protests, and
Nader himself will address demonstrators near the White House on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not to win, of course, but to get more than 5
percent of the vote, the number that would qualify Nader for
millions in federal campaign matching funds that he says he would
use to build the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Green Party breaks 5 percent, the Democratic Party
won't be the same again,'' said Nader, still irrepressibly dour and
hauntingly hungry-looking at 66, reflecting on the prospect of
undercutting the influence of the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council and its president, Al From. ``If you think Al From and the
Democratic Leadership Council has a grip on the Democratic Party,
wait and see what a significant and growing progressive third party
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vice President Al Gore, the apparent Democratic
nominee, say they are not losing sleep over a Nader challenge.
Nader is not the most skillful of campaigners, and even many
liberal allies question his ability to move voters. Further, the
Green Party is better known for its internal squabbling than its
ability to run campaigns or raise money. Nader's aides say they
have raised thousands of dollars so far, but will not file their
first campaign finance report until next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's yielding even a few percentage points to Nader could
be damaging to the vice president if the election is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent poll by the Zogby Group showed Nader receiving
more support than Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate,
5 percent to 3 percent. The poll indicated that the vast majority
of Nader's support came from Democrats and that he was doing
particularly well in California, considered a vital state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   All of this suggests that an aggressive Nader campaign could
eliminate any advantages Gore might have gained from Buchanan, who
is expected to siphon votes from the likely Republican candidate,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nader intends to remain a thorn in Gore's side by promoting
issues that many liberals _ a large number of whom defected to Bill
Bradley in the Democratic primaries _ say the Clinton
administration has neglected: universal health care, urban poverty,
the environment and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Bradley, Nader _ like Buchanan _ is a fierce opponent
of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade
Organization, endearing him to traditionally Democratic union
members who feel the Clinton administration's free-trade policies
have hurt American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have very little loyalty to either party,'' Nader
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Nader contends that he expects to draw almost equally from both
major parties. But Republicans are a rare species in his crowds.
More common are disaffected Democrats like Stanley Campbell, 49,
who voted for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 but feels Gore has
become Bush's look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bore versus Gush,'' said Campbell, the director a church
social service agency who watched Nader speak in Dekalb, Ill.,
recently. ``I just don't know if there would be much difference
between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that this year will be different from 1996, Nader
says he has hired 15 full-time campaign workers in Washington and
will soon dispatch 10 more _ possibly including former Bradley
campaign organizers _ to get him on the ballot in every state. (The
Green Party is already on the ballot in 13 states, including New
York and California.)
</P>
<P>
   He has also vowed to raise $5 million, and he says he may get
some help from celebrities like Paul Newman, Warren Beatty and
Susan Sarandon, and musicians like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and
the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   But to get anywhere near 5 percent, Nader will have to overcome
some big obstacles, not the least of which is the Green Party
itself. The party is notoriously disorganized and fractious, with
some groups opposing any involvement in electoral politics and
others supporting another candidate, Jello Biafra, the former lead
singer for the rock group the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Nader. Gawky, shy and prone to long speeches,
he is the first to acknowledge that he is not the world's best
campaigner. He is, for one thing, painfully uncomfortable with
asking people for their votes. Last week, for instance, a Delta
Airlines workers stopped him in the Minneapolis airport to say,
``I'm a big fan.'' All Nader could say in return was, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigning takes a level of political ego I just don't have
yet,'' he said after the man had sped off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is also notoriously private, refusing to tell even co-workers
where he lives. And the only crumbs of biographical information he
salts into his hour-long speeches are passing references to his
Connecticut hometown of Winsted. Rarely does he mention that he is
the son of Lebanese immigrants, that his father owned a restaurant,
that he studied Chinese at Princeton and law at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His secretiveness has spawned a host of dark theories among his
critics. Some contend that despite his seemingly penurious
lifestyle, he is actually quite wealthy. They assert he purposely
spent almost nothing on his 1996 campaign to skirt federal election
laws, which require candidates who spend more than $5,000 to file
reports disclosing their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says he will file a financial disclosure report next
month. It will show, he said, that despite his attacks on genetic
engineering firms and Microsoft, he owns technology stocks. It will
also disclose, he said, that he earned about $200,000 last year in
speaking fees but gave half of it to charities. Most of his
remaining earnings went toward ``projects.'' He lives on about
$25,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how such a private man could run for such a public job,
Nader, who has never been married, replied, ``When you work all the
time you don't have a problem in terms of private time. There is no
private time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among many leftists, Nader is not considered the dream
candidate. In a recent essay in The Nation, Katha Pollitt
complained that Nader was a less than scintillating standard-bearer
and that his 1996 campaign had focused too much on trade issues to
the exclusion of other issues dear to the left, such as race
relations, health care, and gay and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of progressives cranking up an organization, raising
funds, fomenting energy and enthusiasm on behalf of this doomed
project,'' Pollitt wrote, ``well, it's just too depressing. If
working on Nader's campaign is the best way progressives can spend
the next eight months, it's time to hire a hearse and lie down in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who says he is running partly at the behest of Green
Party leaders, replied, ``I think she ran out of material that
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his platform seems to reflect some of the criticisms of
progressives like Pollitt. At the top is universal health care
followed by an anti-poverty program built heavily on
consumer-protection ideas, including loan discrimination by banks,
high auto insurance rates and landlord abuses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate welfare,'' one of his favorite issues, will also
play front-and-center in his campaign as he rages against
government tax-breaks and subsidies which allow big companies ``to
privatize profits and socialize risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to win support from social conservatives, he
plans to attack big media corporations for exploiting children with
their racy programming and aggressive marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   While he is counting on anti-trade protests this week to raise
his national profile, Nader says his best hope for gaining
attention will be to squeeze between Gore and Bush in televised
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The private commission that will determine presidential debate
participants has said candidates must be receiving 15 percent in
national polls to be included. Nader contends the threshold is
ridiculously high and plans to recruit Buchanan to protest the
process. And he said that if he prevails he hopes to raise the kind
of questions that will spark interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates are asked, What is your position on welfare, what
is your position on crime?' '' Nader said. That's not the right
question. It needs an adjective. What is your position on corporate
welfare? What is your position on corporate crime? We're going to
open this up. We're going to provide adjectives to these issues.''

BAD BEHAVIOR CAN BE PERFECTLY ETHICAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Maine, Wis.)   By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I became furious recently at a company that held up paying a
writing fee it owed me. I couldn't understand the delay.
</P>
<P>
   I sent e-mail messages. I left phone messages. Eventually, an
exasperated senior manager informed me that she'd been told there
were ``problems'' with the work I had done to earn the fee.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that was not so. The manager had not spoken to the
person with whom I had worked, only to an out-of-the-loop
colleague, and had been misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Incensed, I told the whole ugly story to a friend. His reaction:
``That's just plain unethical of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. Sloppy or lazy or ignorant, perhaps; or more
likely just a case of failing to ask the right person for the right
piece of information. Ethics really didn't have anything to do with
it.
</P>
<P>
   My friend's comment, however, points up how often we toss around
the word ``unethical'' whenever someone does something we don't
like.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to return a phone call is rude. Storming off the job in
a huff is impetuous. A demanding boss who expects far more from her
charges than can possibly be accomplished in a workday is, perhaps,
mean. But instead of calling those affronts by their right names,
we haul out the ``unethical'' label _ as if to make them more
substantial, more severe, more deserving of condemnation. We want
to dignify our discomfiture with a mantle of righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   But painting every kind of bad behavior as a lapse in ethics
cheapens a term that should be reserved for discussions of core
moral values and their implications.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to regroup. A good beginning would be to start carving
out a thoughtful definition of ``ethical'' by looking at what it is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical does not always equal legal. It is possible to break a
law _ say, doing 40 in a 25 mph zone _ and be perfectly ethical in
the process, if speeding was necessary to get out of the way of an
approaching ambulance. Conversely, unethical people have always
found ways to do wrong even while hewing strictly to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical doesn't always equal nice, either. People can treat you
rudely, veil their motives from you, shock you, inconvenience you
or drive you nuts with their pigheaded intransigence without
clocking up any automatic debits on the ethics register.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to distinguish manners from ethics,'' said Rushworth
Kidder, president of the Institute for Global Ethics in Camden,
Maine ``Some highly unmannerly people _ Thoreau might have been so
perceived _ were deeply ethical. And some highly unethical people _
one thinks of the Nazi commandant at Auschwitz _ were models of
good manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Crying ``unethical'' at every slight arises from a natural
desire to win sympathy for a grievance. ``People are persuaded more
by the word `ethics' than by `mean' or `nasty' or `rude,''' said
Laura Hartman, a professor of ethics at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison. ``We have come to a time in our society where we accept
those latter qualities as part of doing business, while we have
been told recently that unethical behavior should not be tolerated.
It is far more persuasive to suggest that someone has been
unethical than simply mean.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also natural for people to paint their woes in the ways
that are most likely to attract redress. Every mischance must be a
treatable disease; there are no accidents, only negligence and
malfeasance (on someone else's part, naturally). You can't get
anyone to do much about someone who does something rude, but call
the behavior unethical and, bingo, it's actionable.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that meanness, rudeness, sloth,
slovenliness, vulgarity or other obnoxious behavior
(italics)never(end italics) presents an ethical issue. Behavior so
egregious that it tramples the accepted values of a workplace might
be considered unethical. But ``might'' is the operative word.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder sees in the conflation of ethics and manners both a
cheapening and a backhanded compliment: evidence of greater
attention paid to ethics. ``If the currency of ethics has high
value, it follows that those who want to denigrate something will
be more apt to call it unethical than they once were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened awareness of ethics might be a good thing, but not at
the cost of pulling the word's teeth. Better to save it for times
when it is truly called for.
</P>
<P>
   So, you see, when I relentlessly battered those people with
messages and complaints until they finally coughed up my fee, I was
not being unethical _ just a pest. &QL;
</P>

the author of ``The Good, the Bad, and Your Business'' (John Wiley
&AMP; Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of
each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng(at)nytimes.com.

 &HT;    Cleveland may select Brown for defense
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ With talk of trading the No.1 pick in today's
National Football League draft all but dead, the Cleveland Browns
are once again, for the second straight year, on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because they seem to have established a better rapport
with Penn State defensive end Courtney Brown's agent than with
those representing Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington, the
Browns apparently are set to make Brown the first player chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Carmen Policy remained cryptic late in the week,
saying, ``My feeling is that we will exercise the pick and use it
to select a defensive player.'' Formally eliminated from contention
with those words was Florida State receiver Peter Warrick, once
seen as the likely No.1, but who now could fall to the Cincinnati
Bengals at No.4. Policy, careful not to tip his hand in light of
ongoing contract negotiations with Brown and Arrington, would not
be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems now that only an overwhelming proposal from the New
York Jets _ the only team with four first-round picks at its
disposal _ or some freak occurrence would dissuade the Browns from
selecting Brown, a 6-foot-5, 270-pounder with 4.58 speed in the 40,
unerring quarterback radar and a wingspan the length of Dikembe
Mutumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Stating the case for retaining the pick rather than dealing it,
Browns general manager Dwight Clark said, ``Talking to people
around the league, it's clear that when you have a chance at a
blue-chip player, which both of these guys are, it's tough to turn
that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is tempting. The Browns love his on-field demeanor, to
say nothing of his incredible athletic ability. But does he want to
play for Cleveland? Questions were raised last week when he
practically advised the Browns to select Brown. Arrington seems to
have his heart set on falling to the Washington Redskins at No.2
and joining a Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   While Arrington's maturity has been questioned, the biggest
knock on Brown is that he's a bit quiet and might be too nice.
Chatty and charismatic he isn't. However, he has been the best
defensive lineman in college football the past two years, according
to many scouts and draftniks. Some think he can be a better
all-around end than Kevin Carter, who helped the St. Louis Rams win
the Super Bowl. Can he match the impact Jevon Kearse made last
season as a rookie with the Tennessee Titans? That's asking a lot,
but the Browns are also investing a lot and, at this stage of their
development, can't afford to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They probably made the right choice last year, tabbing Tim Couch
No. 1 and leaving Akili Smith and Ricky Williams on the board.
Couch took over as the starting quarterback in Week 2 and proved
tough, talented and durable. ``We're going through the same
process,'' coach Chris Palmer said. ``And, hopefully, we'll be
right again.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Browns definitely would be pleased with something
resembling last year's haul, which included five eventual starters
and several other players who stuck around and contributed. They
have 14 total picks. After the No. 1 overall selection, they lead
off every round except the sixth. That pick went to Miami in the
Karim Abdul-Jabbar trade. They have two picks in rounds three,
four, five and six, then four in the seventh and final round.
</P>
<P>
   With the first pick in the second round, No. 32 overall, the
Browns are likely to select the best receiver available. They would
like to take Jerry Porter from West Virginia, but could settle for
Arizona's Dennis Northcutt, who doubles as a return specialist. If
they were to address their crying need for a tight end, Anthony
Becht of West Virginia is almost certain to be there if Miami's
Bubba Franks is not.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle rounds, the Browns aim to address needs at running
back and offensive line. They also are in the market for a big
cornerback, possibly with the intention of moving starting corner
Daylon McCutcheon, one of last year's draft prizes, to nickel back.

 &HT;    Atlanta recruit still headed to Indiana
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The night Indiana coach Bobby Knight made his at-home
visit to Westlake High School forward A.J. Moye, Moye's mother,
Beverly Hines, made a presentation of her own to the legendary
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Hines grabbed her son by his shirt collar, jerked him and looked
at Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If I'm at a game and I see you touch my son like
this, I'm coming out of the stands, and I'm coming after you,'''
Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight replied, ``And well you should.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye, this year's Mr. Georgia Basketball, has spoken highly of
Knight and his program since signing with Indiana in November. That
position is unchanged, even though a two-man committee of Indiana
trustees investigate former players' allegations of physical and
emotional abuse by Knight. This week, a videotape showed Knight
grabbing former Hoosier Neil Reed by the neck at practice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did see the footage. I mean, I'm not really too much
worried,'' Moye said from a hotel room in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
where he will play in the ACC/USA Hoops Challenge today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to play for Indiana, and I really want to play
for coach Knight. He's really a class act. He showed me a side a
lot of people don't see. He cares about me as a person and not a
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye all but solidified his decision to sign with Indiana after
Knight's home visit in September. One of Moye's friends, Travis
Davenport, died that morning, and Knight was there to comfort him
with encouraging words and a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just supporting A.J.'s decision,'' Hines said. ``When
Bobby Knight was in my home, he was the epitome of warmth. But time
will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Newton, a former Mays player and current Indiana freshman,
is a friend of Moye, and the two often talked about Knight. ``Jeff
said coach Knight was cool,'' Moye said.
</P>
<P>
   Moye told about the time that Newton arrived 20 minutes late for
a film session early in the year. Knowing Knight's reputation,
Newton froze up in expectation of the coach's wrath. Instead, he
was given a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Coach Knight) has been under heat like this before,'' Moye
said. ``When he threw the chair. There was that time when it looked
like he head-butted a player. He gets aggressive and impulse takes
over. The only reason he gets like that is because he wants the
best out of his players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moye understands that there is a limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like discipline. I've been able to thrive under it,'' Moye
said. ``But I won't let anyone take a violent act against me. And I
wouldn't give him a reason to. There's only one person that can put
their hands on me _ and that's my mom.''

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks went into free fall as investors had
to digest surprisingly bad news on inflation, the fear of higher
interest rates and the fallout from a a week-long retreat from once
popular technology stocks. The beleaguered Nasdaq index plunged

25.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than five
percent, closing out its eighth worst week since World War II. Few

SCHUMPETER'S PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 16, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all of the talk about the ``new economy,'' the government
case against Microsoft Corp. reads surprisingly like a page from
tales of the old economy. The plot, for instance, is pretty much
the same as Robert Altman's 1971 classic tale of earlier boomtimes
in the Pacific Northwest frontier, ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, gambler John McCabe (played by Warren Beatty) sets
up a saloon/bordello in a lumber town and mining camp not too far
down the coast from Seattle. Like any dealer, says the Leonard
Cohen soundtrack, ``he is looking for a card so high and wild he'll
never need to deal another.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to be his own boss, he nevertheless partners up with
Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie,) who agrees to be his manager. The
boom goes forward; the establishment prospers.
</P>
<P>
   One day a pair of polished businessmen arrive in town. They are
from the mining company, they explain, and they are authorized to
make a cash offer for McCabe's business from ``one of the most
solid companies in the United States.'' McCabe is drunk. In loutish
fashion, he tell them no. The next morning he sobers up and tries
to negotiate for twice the price that they have offered. It is too
late. They hire an implacable killer.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this is the oft-repeated complaint against
Microsoft, except that nobody gets killed. Instead, entrepreneurs
in the target zone get a meeting with Bill Gates. ``I can buy 20
percent of you or I can buy all of you or I can go into this
business myself and bury you,'' he says -- most famously to America
Online chairmman Steve Case (as describd in Kara Swisher's book,
``AOL.Com'') but literally or figuratively to many other
competitors in many other instances.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to crush Netscape in the Intrnet ``browser wars''
that began in 1994 is the case the government chose to try -- and
proved, to the satisfaction of US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion about the nature of the offense arises -- not
least of all in Bill Gates' own mind -- because of the broad
rhetorical framework in which such antitrust complaints
traditionally are framed. When the Sherman Act was passed in in
1890 -- just about the time in which ``McCabe and Mrs Miller''
isset -- Congress took the position that no elaborate definition of
``restraint of trade'' was necessary: the courts would know it when
they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since then, a loose shorthand has evolved at the
juncture of economics, law and journalism which holds that the
anticompetetive practices harm consumers by stifling potential
innovation. That has led many in the Microsoft case to observe the
obvious good the company has done by standardizing software for
persnal computers and ask where is the harm? Aftr all, innovation
is proceeding briskly in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft is such an anticompetetive monster,'' Robert
Samuelson wrote the other day, ``why has the New Economy become (at
least by reputation) become so competitive that it raises
efficiency and lowers inflation?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that it is the new technologies that do the work
and that big businesss arise to implement them. Nearly sixty years
ago, the economist Joseph Schumpeter put his finger on the paradox
at the center of the politics of antitrust. ``Capitalism, Socialism
and Democracy'' is a wounded bear of a book (``Can capitalism
survive? I do not think it can.'') But it contains some of the the
clearest descriptions of the processes of growth and development
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern standard of life of the masses evolved during the
period of relatively unfettered `big business,''' Schumpeter wrote.
``If we list the items that enter the modern workman's budget, from
1899 on, (and) observe the course of their prices...we cannot fail
to be struck by the rate of the advance which, considering the
spectacular improvement in qualities, seems to have been greater
and not smaller than it ever was before...
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor is this all. As soon as we...inquire into the individual
items in which progress was the most conspicuous, the trail leads
not to the doors of those firms that work under conditions of
comparatively free competition but precisely to the doors ofthe
large concerns -- which, as in the case of agricultural machinery,
also account for much of the progress in the competetive sector --
and a shocking suspicion dawns upon us that big business may have
had more to do with creating that standard of life than with
keeping it down.''
</P>
<P>
   How? Why? Because much of the monopoly profits those firms
charge are plowed back into extending the business, building plant
and and capacity, creating ever-larger netorks of users through
marketing, performing research and development to improve the
product -- for a time, at least. That's the story of the railroads,
of farm machinery, of steel and oil. Measured in terms of the labor
necessary to buy a certain carefully defined consumption bundle,
the cost of living fell dramatically during the years of the great
monopolistic trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the government was wrong to bust them up? Would
we have been better off if John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie
had been free to continue to pursue their ruthless system-building
ways?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. The antitust laws are about the concentration and
abuse of power among Big Businesses. They are about the kind of
injustice that forms the basis of the plot for ``McCabe and Mrs.
Miller.'' Corporations are indispensible engines of progress, and
one of the ways they achieve efficiency is by imposing standards,
but sometimes they overstep their bounds. Today, as at the end of
the 19th century, the limits of society's willingness to tolerate
the kind of routine intimidation and low-level violence that can
(but needn't) go into building a successful business empire have
been reached -- at least in court.
</P>
<P>
   (Whether Microsoft's atonishing attempt to overturn the verdict
in the court of public opinion remains to be seen. Last week the
firm admitted that it had hired Ralph Reed, former head of the
Christian Coalition and a close adviser to GOP presidential hopeful
George W. Bush, to conduct a high level national lobbying
campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is an extraordinary corporation. No student of its
methods is more acute or more level-headed than Michael Cusumano of
Massachustts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
He is co-author of ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from
Netscape and its Battle with Microsoft'' and ``Microsoft Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates must bear the brunt of the blame for creating and
continuing this mess,'' Cusumano wrote the other day in the Wall
Street Journal. ``Microsoft is an extension -- some 30,000 people
strong -- of his unique personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gates and other Microsoft people are extremely smart,
hardworking and relentless, And they understand the business of
mass-marketing software like no one ever has. At the same time,
they are arrogant, insecure and oblivious to how the world views
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insecurity comes from the knowledge that high-tech markets
change quickly, advantages are fleeting, and Microsoft as a company
has been lucky.... But the list of ways in which Microsoft used
Windows as a hammer is much too long....
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has not changed its aggressive behavior from the
days when it was a small company struggling to survive in the world
of IBM and minframe computers, fighting to fend off Apple, Lotus
and Word Perfect. Microsoft and Mr. Gates did not grow up soon
enough, so the judge and Justice lawyers have intervened with
``adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   The main difference betwen the New Economy and the old is that
in the New Economy, no one gets killed.

ARMS TREATY VOTE GIVES PUTIN CLOUT VS. US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Funny how Russian and American nuclear weapons have
evolved into little more than the world's most dangerous bargaining
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Take Friday's long-overdue vote by the Russian lower house of
parliament to ratify the 1993 START II strategic arms reduction
treaty. On the surface, this was a watershed decision that finally
will clear the way for the United States and Russia to halve their
nuclear arsenals, to about 3,000-3,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Russia did not need a 7-year-old arms control
agreement to start reducing its nukes. Time, rust and lack of cash
are already taking care of that.
</P>
<P>
   What the approval did do was to give President-elect Vladimir V.
Putin a chance to go on the offensive in Russia's bitter diplomatic
dispute with the United States over the arms control issue Moscow
really worries about. It also gave the rest of the world a glimpse
at Putin's meaning this week when he said Russia would pursue its
national security from ``a position of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasting little time after Friday's 288-131 ratification vote,
Putin proposed slashing the countries' nuclear stockpiles even
further, to about 1,500 warheads each. He also warned that Russia
would abandon all nuclear and conventional arms control agreements
if the United States went ahead with its plans to build national
missile defense system. Instead, he said, the US should follow
Russia's good example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partners should make the next steps. The ball is in their
court,'' said Putin, during a surprise appearance at the Duma,
where he was accompanied by his two aides who carry the briefcases
that contain the launch codes for Russia's nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   START II must now be ratified by the Federation Council, the
upper chamber of the Russian parliament, where easy approval is
expected. Putin, who leaves for London Sunday for a meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, said: ``We are now in a very
good position diplomatically and politically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma vote won immediate approval from the Clinton
administration, which has been pushing Russia to follow the example
of the US Senate, which ratified the agreement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on a visit to
neighboring Ukraine, welcomed the vote as a ``big step forward''
and expressed hope that she and Russia Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
would make progress on arms control in talks set for later this
month. But she remained firm on her goal to get Moscow to alter the
anti-ballistic missile treaty to allow for a US missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected decide this summer whether to
build a such a system to protect the country from potential attacks
by such ``rogue'' states as North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow sees such a defensive shield as a potential threat to the
rough strategic balance that has existed between Russia and the US
for two generations that took seriously the threat that these
weapons could end mankind. Moscow views the planned US defensive
shield as a direct violation of a 1972 pact on anti-ballistic
missiles that provided the cornerstone for all later arms control
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The national defense system has strong bipartisan support in the
United States and it is unlikely Russia can stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's events in Moscow gave Putin the political high
ground over Clinton before a United Nations conference this month
on halting the spread of nuclear weapons. Russia could further
upstage Washington in the coming weeks if the Duma also ratifies
the global nuclear test ban treaty that Clinton who failed to
persuade the Republican-dominated Senate to ratify last year.
</P>
<P>
   In getting the Duma to ratify START II, Putin accomplished what
his predecssor, Boris N. Yeltsin, was unable to do after signing
the treaty with former President George Bush in January 1993. Every
time Yeltsin sent the treaty to the Duma, his Communist opponents
who used to dominate the house would find an excuse _ NATO
expansion in 1997, the US-led airstrikes against Iraq in 1998,
NATO's assault on Yugoslavia last year _ to refuse to vote on Start
II.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions with the West are again high, this time over Chechnya.
The Communists, who lost ground to pro-Kremlin parties in last
December's elections, opposed ratification. But the majority went
along with Putin's line that START II is a boon for Russia's
cash-poor military.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the treaty would allow Moscow to modernize its
nuclear arsenal and also divert scarce funds to conventional
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nuclear forces, after the ratification of START II, will
still be able at any moment and any point on the planet to destroy
any enemy several times over and guaranteed,'' Putin told
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Russia can afford neither to maintain and protect
its existing nuclear stockpile of about 6,000 weapons, nor can it
find cash to destroy old warheads and fissile material without US
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, military experts say, many weapons are rusting
away. Under START II, Russia will be decommissioning missiles which
would otherwise become obsolete. The United States will have to
destroy newer weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's proposal of new, drastic cuts for what would be START
III reflect the growing realization here that Russia probably
cannot support more than 1,000-1,500 weapons, according to Pavel
Felgenhauer, an independent Moscow-based defense analyst. The
Clinton administration has said it wants to keep about 2,000-2,500
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Russia had to avoid a new international arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main task is to force the USA to reduce its actual nuclear
potential,'' Putin said before the vote. ``If we don't ratify this
treaty, Russia will be 15 times weaker than the USA by 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I actually don't know if the United States is
all that interested in doing this, given the changing, and in many
ways already changed, situation in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By ratifying START II, deputies also approved a package of
motions that give Putin free hand to abandon all arms pacts if the
United States goes ahead with its defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma also approved a 1997 US-Russian protocol to START II
that extends the deadline for Russia to scrap nuclear weapons from
2003 to 2007. The US Senate has yet to approve this amendment to
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer, for one, thinks it never will. And that is the
whole point. START II does not have to actually work for Moscow to
use it to gain concessions in other areas from a Clinton
administration that needs, in an election year, to be able to claim
successes, and avoid trouble, in its dealings with Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ In the charcoal-gray, predawn mist along
the waterfront, Demetrio Beltran can just make out the forms of 40,
maybe 50 trucks, stretching out in a daunting line in front of his
Freightliner.
</P>
<P>
   It will be one, two, maybe even three unpaid hours before he can
pick up his first load, and the mammoth lines, he says, not only
are a daily indignity but are sabotaging his livelihood. He earned
slightly more than $20,000 last year despite his many 60-hour
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization and increased trade may be making manufacturers
and shipping lines rich and happy, but Beltran says the story is
very different for the truckers who work this city's giant port,
the nation's largest, a wondrous jumble of bridges, berths, cranes,
ships and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 40,000 port truckers are so fed up, especially with
high fuel prices and the long lines that cut the number of paid
trips they make each day, that thousands of them have joined recent
demonstrations or strikes at all the major ports, including Long
Beach, Houston, Miami, Newark and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of bad things about this work,'' said Beltran,
a Mexican immigrant who has been a port trucker for 17 of his 42
years. ``Every time we go to the harbor, we are treated like trash.
They treat dogs better.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing all this unhappiness, the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters is seeking to unionize all 40,000 port truckers in what
is by far the union's biggest organizing drive in decades.
</P>
<P>
   For the more than 6,000 truckers at Long Beach, most of them
immigrants from Mexico or Central America, the list of indignities
stretches beyond the long lines to the lack of pensions and health
insurance, to all the Saturdays they must work, and to the lack of
bathrooms where drivers wait in line. Beltran, a short, soft-spoken
man whose dark hair is rippled with gray, is also angry that he can
afford only a two-bedroom house, making his four children sleep in
one bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Long-haul truckers often view their lives as glamorous and
macho, with their big rigs and cross-country trips, but for port
truckers, the work is anything but romantic. Theirs is a life of
long lines and short, shuttle-like trips, from port to warehouse
and back or from port to railhead and back. Drivers usually earn
nothing for each hour on line; rather they are paid a flat fee per
trip, depending on the distance.
</P>
<P>
   There is another type of line that Beltran is unhappy to be part
of _ the evolutionary line of the nation's port truckers. Over the
last quarter century, they have gone from being unionized drivers
with impressive wages and benefits, to being nonunion employees
with lower wages and benefits, as the advent of deregulation in the
late 1970s opened the door to new, nonunion competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays most port truckers are independent contractors with
low pay and no benefits _ no health insurance, no paid vacation, no
paid holidays, no possibility of disability pay or unemployment
insurance. These truckers are on the unhappy cutting edge of a
trend in which more and more companies are scaling back their
responsibilities to their workers by treating them not as employees
but as independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 10 years, my pay has remained the same,'' Beltran
said. ``And there's no way I have enough money to save for
retirement. Some weeks it gets so bad I have to choose between
fixing my truck and buying clothes for my kids, but of course I
have to fix my truck. That's the only way to support my family.''
</P>
<P>
   On an excellent day, Beltran will gross $300 and on a bad one
$100, not at all impressive, since he spends about $50 a day on
fuel and $30 on insurance. Last year, he said, he grossed $52,000,
but he netted far less because he spent $7,500 on insurance,
$12,500 on gasoline, $6,000 on payments for his truck and $5,000
for maintenance, tires and repairs. Beltran reckons his pay, after
expenses, comes to a paltry $8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the spike in fuel prices has aggravated
matters, raising some drivers' diesel bills by $100 a week.

   ``The fuel right now is killing us,'' said Tony Fernandez,
president of the drivers' association at the port in Jacksonville,
Fla. ``Since January, we've lost over 40 drivers because they
couldn't make it anymore. Some have lost their trucks and their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   His association and drivers' associations at several other ports
have thrown in their lot with the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exploited work forces in the nation,''
said Ed Burke, director of the Teamsters' West Coast Port Division.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the NCAA basketball final, 80 drivers met at a
Teamsters hall in Long Beach where they applauded a video showing
the demonstrations at the nation's ports. The union is distributing
bumper stickers and T-shirts that say ``Port Teamster,'' and while
some drivers are rushing to display them, others are scared,
fearing their trucking companies will fire them. One driver,
Lorenzo Modesto, said his company stopped assigning him trips after
he plastered his truck with Teamster stickers.

NAMING OF LIBERAL ECONOMIC ADVISER SEEN AS BELLWETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Foreign investors in Russia were buoyant this week
after President-elect Vladimir V. Putin appointed a respected
liberal as his main economic adviser and announced that his
government intends to lower taxes on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The news was especially welcome because Putin, who will be
inaugurated as Russia's president in three weeks, has yet to unveil
his economic program, and his few statements and actions on the
subject have often seemed contradictory and designed primarily not
to offend anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took the appointment of Andrei Illarionov, one of
Russia's most respected economists, as a sign that Putin's program
may turn out to be decidedly pro-free market.
</P>
<P>
   United Financial Group, a Moscow-based brokerage, called
Illarionov's appointment ``an encouraging sign which opens the
possibility of change in economic policies and the acceleration of
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Illarionov has advocated low taxes, balanced
budgets, and less bureaucratic regulation of the economy. He has
also long been a staunch opponent of foreign loans to Russia, and
has derided the government's practice of printing money to finance
deficits as ``counterfeiting.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of former President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet in the
early 1990s, Illarionov eventually resigned, saying the
government's policies were leading to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Illarionov offered his recipe for
reviving Russia's economy in the simplest possible terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't steal, don't print false money, don't have a budget
deficit, don't borrow, pay your debts, and don't have unreasonable
regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Illarionov said Russia has a chance to end a decade of economic
decline if Putin seizes the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia's economy could grow by 8 to 10 percent a year if
``serious reforms'' are implemented. The growth rate was 3.2
percent last year, and the most optimistic official forecasts
project 5.2 percent growth for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Illarionov declined to specify what reforms were necessary. A
special task force is working out Putin's long-term economic
strategy and is expected to unveil the result after the May 7
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Illarianov, however, took the media to task for labeling him an
``ultra-liberal,'' a term associated here with Western-style market
reforms. he said his ideas were simply common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are seen elsewhere as normal sensible ideas are for some
reason considered ultra-liberal in our country,'' he said. ``Our
political and economic assumptions are so distorted that perfectly
sensible economic ideas are seen as extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Illarionov's protestations demonstrated the dilemma economic
reformers face in Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, a few well-connected businessmen took
advantage of their political contacts to become fabulously wealthy,
while most Russians became destitute. As a result, terms like
``liberal'' and ``market'' have become synonymous in the public
mind with ``theft'' and ``poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here are divided on whether Putin is willing or able to
break the grip of a group of politically-connected tycoons, known
as the oligarchs, who control much of Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most said, however, that the president-elect is likely to pursue
steps like lowering the tax burden, reducing government
regulations, and protecting the rights of investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin will likely present these policies to the public as
pragmatic steps to restore Russia's cherished status as a world
power, they said. His image as a tough-talking former KGB spy, they
added, will make it easier for him to pursue a liberal economic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's main goal in life is to reposition Russia as a world
power, and the only way he can do this is to reform the economy and
attract investment,'' said Eric Kraus, chief strategist for Nikoil
Capital Markets, Moscow investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now no reasonable doubt that Putin will take a more
liberal line than had been expected,'' he said. ``He just won't
call it liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus and others said Putin's call for lower taxes is further
cause for optimism. The Kremlin has said it will present to
parliament later this month a simplified tax code that lowers rates
and closes loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses in Russia have long complained that a high tax burden
and a labyrinth of complicated laws leave them at the mercy of
predatory bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can by no means allow the tax burden to grow,'' Putin said
Thursday. ``Our aim is quite different: to make all legislation
more transparent, more comprehensive, more efficient. We can by no
means allow tax rules to lead to more pressure on small and
medium-sized businesses.''

 LONG BEACH, Calif.: Teamster stickers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Ruiz, a 32-year-old from Guatemala who has driven for 14
years, said: ``Every week is a struggle. I'm able to pay the bills,
but I'm not saving anything for my future. With a union, we can
probably make a better future for our kids. Maybe we'll be able to
send them to college. At this rate, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The unionization effort faces one huge obstacle. Under federal
law, independent contractors are not considered employees and thus
cannot form unions. Many drivers and Teamster officials argue that
the truckers are employees because the trucking companies have so
much control over them, but industry officials point to court
decisions finding otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely independent contractors,'' said Joseph
Nievez, president of Qwikway Trucking Co. and past president of the
California Trucking Association. ``The one huge defining factor in
my eyes is they have made an investment in a piece of equipment and
they're not punching a clock. Someone who invests 10, 15, 20
thousand dollars in a piece of equipment, he's in business for
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters union is plotting an unusual strategy to surmount
this obstacle. The union is seeking to persuade several unionized
trucking companies to set up operations at the ports and hire
drivers as employees. The thinking is that the port truckers would
flock from their nonunion companies to the unionized ones.
</P>
<P>
   George Cashman, director of the Teamsters' Port Division, said,
``The union's strategy will be to develop a national agreement at
companies interested in employing these employees and giving them a
reasonable quality of life, i.e. good benefits, wages and working
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the catch could be that the shipping lines might hesitate to
contract with the unionized trucking companies to transport their
loads, especially since the unionized companies might charge more
because they would pay their drivers more.
</P>
<P>
   Many trucking company officials assert that the drivers do not
need a union, saying their problems could be solved by having the
ports, the shipping companies and the longshoremen do more to
shorten the lines. That way, for instance, drivers might be able to
make six $50 trips a day, rather than four.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I feel for these guys,'' said Debbie Nako, president of Yamko
Truck Line. ``They do face long lines. If the port were able to
move the cargo in a reasonable fashion, you wouldn't have these
kinds of beefs coming from these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing such criticism, many shipping lines say they are keeping
their terminals open more hours a day as a step toward shortening
the lines.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other beefs. Many drivers complain about being
dispatched to a terminal and, after waiting in line for two hours,
learning that because of a foul-up by the dispatcher or the
longshoremen, the load they are supposed to pick up cannot be found
or remains on the ship. The drivers generally receive no payment
for those failed pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some guys tell their sons they should go into this
work,'' Beltran said. ``That's very cruel. It's the worst thing
they could do.''

IN CHINA PACT, EXECUTIVES SENSE A HORNET'S NEST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 100 chief executives applauded mildly when Gene Sperling,
the White House economic adviser, finished his pitch for the China
trade agreement. Sperling had been preaching to the choir: no one
wants Congress to ratify the agreement more than the nation's top
business executives. But their first question to him afterward
revealed a concern that, in backing the trade bill, they are
stepping on a hornet's nest.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to know what John L. Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO,
would have told them if he, rather than Sperling, had addressed
this gathering of the National Association of Manufacturers in
Miami last weekend. Labor unions oppose the bill, which would
upgrade China's trade status and open it to more American exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sweeney's general view would be that China is a
country that puts labor organizers in jail, and we don't want to do
business with a country that does that,'' Sperling replied.
</P>
<P>
   No problem so far _ the chief executives agree that labor rights
are violated in China, as are civil rights and environmental
protections. But while unions and environmentalists want rules
written into the agreement, corporate America argues that open
trade will force reform.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. If that were the only issue, Congress would probably
approve the trade agreement when it comes up for a vote in the week
of May 22. But it is not the only issue. What Sperling said next,
trying to explain Sweeney, is the hornet's nest for a growing
number of chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a dynamic economy like ours, there are dislocations, and
even with 4.1 percent unemployment a lot of people are hurt by job
loss,'' Sperling said. ``Trade and globalization have become the
whipping boys for these issues, whether they are related or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations in Seattle last November, at a World Trade
Organization meeting, and those scheduled for Washington this week,
at a meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
focus attention on this pain. Globalization has almost certainly
made America more prosperous, as corporate lobbyists for the China
bill argue vociferously.
</P>
<P>
   But public sentiment appears to be building against an open
global marketplace that fails to protect labor, civil rights and
the environment, and some chief executives are acknowledging that
this sentiment cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fearful of an antibusiness attitude, and they are
trying to avoid it,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG, a
polling organization that often surveys corporate thinking. ``They
are trying to be on the right side of this issue. And the irony is
that, in a booming economy, you can still get people worked up
about globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   An incipient reaching-out was evident in interviews with chief
executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in
January, not long after Seattle. Leaders of the demonstrations took
part in the Davos discussions. So did Lewis B. Campbell, chairman
of Textron.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my dealings with unions over many years,'' he said, ``I
have found that when you discard out of hand their views, you are
making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell proposed gathering representatives of business,
academia, unions and environmentalists into a new forum to debate
trade policy. ``If this institution were inclusive of all global
interests, and everyone had a fair voice, there would not be a need
to demonstrate,'' he said, adding that the WTOwould have to
consider the institution's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing executives in Miami reflected this thinking,
or at least some did. ``We have to get out the view _ perhaps
through a forum that includes all sides _ that yes, there are
issues with trade, but over all the economy has benefited,'' said
James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls and of the
manufacturers' association. ``Free trade has created jobs, and also
cost jobs, but the jobs gained get buried under the publicity given
to the jobs lost.''
</P>
<P>
   No compromise is afoot. Is that bad? Would the prosperity that
has come with increasingly open borders be damaged if trade
agreements included standards for civil rights, labor and the
environment?
</P>
<P>
   No. Standards _ the normal rules of a democracy _ have not been
obstacles to trade. The real danger is in fighting too hard against
standards, only to have free trade deteriorate, said Dani Rodrik, a
Harvard economist. ``Anti-dumping duties reappear, Europe turns in
on itself, China gives up on the World Trade Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what America's executives are beginning to recognize. Or
as Rodrik put it: ``Companies may be learning that they are better
off with moderate rules than with constant harassment.''

LOTS OF CRITICISM, FEW SOLUTIONS AT THIRD WORLD TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ They came from countries as different as China and
Equatorial Guinea, and from governments as varied as democratic
Nigeria and Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the 133 nations that participated in the largest gathering
ever of Third World leaders, which concluded here Friday, had a
uniform message: the global economy that has helped boost the
world's richest countries has left them poorer.
</P>
<P>
   But as the four-day meeting showed this week, coming up with a
plan to fix the imbalance is the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the stage for this week's debates was set by UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan, who on Wednesday called for closer
cooperation between developing and industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also urged leaders to enact good government practices and
to eliminate corruption within their own countries, a
recommendation that was not universally well received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Annan reflects some ideas from the north,'' Win Aung,
foreign minister of military-run Burma, said Friday in a meeting
with US reporters. ``We can't say he's wrong, but it's not
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro took a tougher stand. In his own
welcoming speech, he called for a ``Nuremberg trial'' for
international financiers and others responsible for today's global
economy. Breaking with moderate members, he also proposed
abolishing the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Castro himself found it hard to concentrate on the summit
because it in many ways has been dwarfed by the fate of a
6-year-old boy. Castro, like most everyone else in Cuba, has been
wrapped up in the latest developments involving Elian Gonzalez, the
tiny shipwreck survivor who is in the middle of an international
tug-of-war between his Cuban father and anti-Castro relatives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader abruptly left Wednesday's summit opening to
rush to a Havana television studio to attend that day's nationally
broadcast recap of international news surrounding Gonzalez. TV sets
broadcasting cable news updates, which were set up throughout the
convention center, were popular among delegates, journalists and
Cuban organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials were also hoping the group would issue a
statement calling for the boy's return to Cuba as part of its final
decree.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of 77 Summit is the first time since the organization
was founded in 1964 that the leaders representing 80 percent of the
world's population have assembled to create a united agenda. About
1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day, according a recent
UN report.
</P>
<P>
   The list of summit participants read like a Who's Who of
intriguing characters: Pakistan's military ruler Gen. Pervez
Musharraf; Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe; Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez; Palestine Authority leader Yasser Arafat; Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad; and Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leaders have found consensus on calls for debt
relief, better access to financial markets and help in building
more advanced computer and technological systems.
</P>
<P>
   The summit precedes Sunday's meeting of the IMF and World Bank
in Washington. Both organizations were heavily critcized by Third
World leaders here this week for the austere requirements often
attached to loans and aid packages and for not doing enough to
increase export opportunities with wealthier nations, especially in
agriculture and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neoliberal economy is a savage one,'' said Venezuela's
</P>
<P>
   Chavez. ``We need an economy based on humanity, not one built by
technocrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, advisers and experts attending the summit said
that future aid programs to developing countries would have to
include more partnerships with private sector investors and broad
incentives to build stronger justice systems and more transparent
and democratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth and good government is not a Western agenda,'' said
Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the UN Development Program,
which has released a plan to reduce worldwide poverty by 50 percent
by 2015. ``These are the necessary changes for the world today.''

EDITING SYSTEM FILE WILL STOP DRIVE-CHECKING AFTER A REBOOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Windows 98 being what it is, I often have to shut down my
computer after it locks up. When it boots back up, Norton Disk
Doctor starts to run in DOS. I really don't want this to run and
check all my files. It takes forever. How can I prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   A: In theory, you're always supposed to use the Shut Down
command when you exit Windows. But since Windows 98 is prone to
lockups, sometimes you have to bite the bullet and reboot.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows is not shut down correctly, it automatically
launches upon restarting an application called ScanDisk that checks
to make sure your file system is not corrupted. ScanDisk does a
cursory check and then gets out of the way, letting Windows
continue booting. It normally doesn't take very long.
</P>
<P>
   When you install Symantec's Norton Utilities, or Norton
SystemWorks, it installs an MS-DOS version of Disk Doctor and
replaces Windows' own ScanDisk. While the Norton version is more
thorough, it also takes a lot longer to process the drive. On a big
drive, it seems like an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   If you do a custom installation of Norton Utilities, you can
tell it not to replace ScanDisk. But since you've already installed
the Norton product, your best bet is to edit a system file called
MSDOS.SYS and tell Windows not to scan the drive at all.
</P>
<P>
   Use Notepad to open MSDOS.SYS in the root folder of your C:
drive. Look for a line that reads: &QL; 
 &QL; 
AutoScan1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Change the 1 to a 0, save the file and exit Notepad. Reboot.
</P>
<P>
   Beware: MSDOS.SYS is a crucial system file, and if you make a
mistake or change the wrong thing, it can cause major headaches.
Make a copy of the file before making changes.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you have to restart Windows without properly
shutting down, you won't get the Disk Doctor scan. But you should
manually check the disk soon after using the Windows version of
Disk Doctor that comes with Norton Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I boot up either Netscape Communicator or Internet
Explorer, the home page goes to someplace called GoHip. I know how
to change it back to my usual home page (CNN), but it bothers me
that this happens. It only does it when you boot up the computer
and run either browser for the first time. After you change the
default, it stays that way until the next reboot. I think a family
member clicked on something that allowed that script to be loaded
when the browsers are booted up from the start. Any idea how to get
rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The site GoHip.com, a search engine, urges people to
``enhance'' their browsing experience by downloading a plug-in.
Part of its setup is that it changes your startup page to GoHip.
</P>
<P>
   However, the usual method of resetting your startup page back to
your original preference doesn't ``stick.'' This has infuriated a
lot of people, and GoHip has taken some heat for it. I've had quite
a bit of e-mail on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   GoHip has posted on its Web site a small program that will
remove the plug-in and restore your home page to its original
setting. Get the program at
www.gohip.com/removebrowserenhancement.html.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The plunging stock market might make technology
companies think twice about accepting public stock as currency.
</P>
<P>
   And companies such as Atlanta-based Healtheon/WebMD, which often
have used their publicly traded stock to buy their competition,
might find themselves with thinner wallets if the market continues
to crater.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD is trying to move health-care related
transactions to the Internet by linking doctors, patients and
insurance companies. It also is developing a site for consumer
health information.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon has been using its stock to buy companies to flesh out
its products and services, starting with the merger of Healtheon
and WebMD last May, placing a market capitalization of almost $20
billion on the company. Between partnerships and acquisitions,
Healtheon/WebMD has made more than 80 deals in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies that recently took Healtheon/WebMD stock as part
of deals will find themselves _ if the stock doesn't rebound _
getting much less than they bargained for. Based on Friday's
closing price of $18.32, Healtheon's market cap is about $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its purchases earlier this year of Envoy, OnHealth Network and
CareInsite are pending. The deals had no ``collar,'' which means
they are worth whatever Healtheon's stock is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Wayne Gantt said that if the stock market continues to
drop it will impact the ability of companies such as Healtheon to
grow by acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to have a negative effect on a lot of the
companies that have been using a currency that is less than what
they previously thought,'' he said. ``It's not going to entirely do
away with it. As this sort-out continues, some of the companies
will survive _ the ones that ultimately start showing earnings
streams.''
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Healtheon agreed to use 35 million shares of
its stock, and $400 million, to buy Envoy, a unit of Quintiles
Transactional. Then, Healtheon shares traded for a little more than
$65. They have fallen almost 72 percent since.
</P>
<P>
   What was in January a deal valued at $2.1 billion in stock and
$400 million in cash is now worth $641 million in stock, and $400
million cash, based on Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Healtheon made two deals in three days. They
first agreed to buy Medical Manager for $5.4 billion in stock.
Healtheon shares have dropped 67.6 percent since.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Healtheon said it was using 4.6 million of its
shares, then selling for $67.87 1/2, to buy OnHealth Network for
$312 million. The deal now is worth $84.3 million based on Friday's
closing price.
</P>
<P>
   The deal last May that brought Healtheon and WebMD together sent
Healtheon's shares surging. Healtheon/WebMD shares hit a 52-week
high of more than $126 on May 20, the day the merger was announced.

FAMILY SEEKS RIGHTS PROTECTION FOR REFUGEE BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Both sides in the tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez
maneuvered feverishly for advantage in the courts Friday, even as
the federal government heated up its rhetoric by accusing the boy's
family here of acting illegally and of engaging in ``child
exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, who have tried several legal arguments
during their effort to retain custody of Elian, Friday added
another: They asked the US District Court in Washington to prevent
the Immigration and Naturalization Service from returning the
6-year-old to his homeland until the US government certifies that
Cuba complies with the UN Declaration of Human Rights and is ``no
longer engaged in `systematic, gross violations of human rights.'
''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Henry Kennedy said he would hear arguments on the
case next Wednesday, then decide whether to let it proceed.
Attorneys for Elian's relatives argued that he needs the court's
help because, if he goes back to Cuba, he would face ``the risk of
being persecuted'' and would be ``politically indoctrinated to a
much larger extent than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department fired its shots in the custody battle
Friday not in Washington but Atlanta. There, responding to an
injunction issued Thursday that temporarily bars Elian from leaving
America, the department argued that the Miami family members lack
the standing to ask for court intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The department's 61-page brief to the 11th US Circuit Court of
Appeals described Elian's great-uncle and current guardian, Lazaro
Gonzalez, as ``a mere distant relative.'' It also said that the
elder Gonzalez was seeking a judicial remedy with ``unclean
hands,'' since he had already violated a government order to
surrender custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the department struck out at the Miami relatives, it
offered them a carrot: a guarantee that Elian will stay in the
United States for as long as it takes for the legal process to play
out -- but only if they turn over custody of the boy to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez. An accompanying letter from Juan Gonzalez'
attorney said he had agreed to comply with those terms.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Atlanta issued the temporary stay Thursday in
response to a request from the boy's family for a permanent
injunction. The court ordered the government to issue its response
by Friday morning and told lawyers for the relatives to submit
their rebuttal by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether the three-judge panel will hear the case
is expected within a few days, and the Justice Department has
informally promised not to try to remove Elian from Lazaro
Gonzalez' home during that time. The department could theoretically
do so, since the injunction does not address who Elian's guardian
should be as long as he stays in the United States, but US
officials evidently don't want to further inflame an already heated
atmosphere since they believe they'll ultimately prevail in court
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The INS commissioner, Doris Meissner, not only sounded confident
of victory Friday but strongly indicated that federal authorities
soon intend to take custody of Elian, one way or another. His
relatives ignored an order from Attorney General Janet Reno
directing them to relinquish the boy two days ago, so he could be
flown to his father outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take action in a way that's appropriate to the situation
when we're ready,'' Meissner said on NBC's ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The INS spokeswoman, Maria Cardona, used even stronger language.
She implied that the federal government not only intended to get
Elian, but also might take legal steps against the relatives with
whom he has been living since he was rescued off the coast of
Florida nearly five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a stage when Lazaro Gonzalez has failed to comply
with an INS order, so we have now moved to implement an enforcement
action plan,'' said Cardona. ``He has broken the law.''
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly harsh in her assessment of the family's
decision to make and release a home video of Elian telling his
father that he wanted to stay in this country. ``I think it was the
most appalling child manipulation and child exploitation,'' Cardona
said. ``I thought it was shameful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we needed another reason to immediately move to reunite
Elian with his father, this was certainly it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though rain poured down on the area Friday, more than 100
Cuban-American supporters of Elian's relatives continued their
vigil outside the family home. Standing under large tarpaulins that
kept out most of the water, the protesters repeated their resolve
to prevent federal agents from removing the boy before all legal
efforts have been exhausted.

LEWIS WIDOW REPEATS ACCUSATION AGAINST HEART SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Frequently breaking down in tears, Donna Harris-Lewis
Friday repeated her longstanding assertion that Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge Jr. had diagnosed her late husband with a benign fainting
condition, not the life-threatening heart disorder that ultimately
caused the Celtics star's death.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony, as it did last year, contradicts Mudge's claim
that he, the Lewises, Celtics representatives, and Brigham and
Women's Hospital officials agreed to conceal the second, more
worrisome diagnosis of a heart problem from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Rossman, Harris-Lewis's attorney, asked her if Mudge had
ever given her or her husband any indication that Lewis suffered
from a life-threatening arrhythmia, an uncontrolled fluttering of
the heart that can cause death.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied Harris-Lewis, testifying for the first time in
the retrial of the medical malpractice lawsuit stemming from her
husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Reggie was discharged,'' she said, ``he was discharged
with a diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope,'' a benign fainting
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued Mudge, Lewis's chief cardiologist, for
negligence after her husband died. A first trial ended in a hung
jury last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under stern cross-examination by Mudge's attorney, William J.
Dailey Jr., Harris-Lewis faced a barrage of questions suggesting
that Lewis failed to take his medication regularly and violated
Mudge's orders not to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis denied both accusations, explaining an apparent gap
in Lewis's prescription refills by saying that a Brigham nurse gave
Lewis an extra supply of medication when he was discharged from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And although Dailey produced a note from Mudge cautioning Lewis
that, ``We need to touch base before you exercise again,''
Harris-Lewis insisted that Mudge put no restrictions on Lewis's
physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination Harris-Lewis frequently responded that
she had no ``clear recollection'' of events and needed to review
documents to ``jog'' her memory.
</P>
<P>
   During direct questioning by Rossman, Harris-Lewis echoed her
testimony from last year, describing Lewis's excitement at being
drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1987, an achievement she said
``surpassed his wildest dreams.'' She mentioned Lewis's
philanthropic work, such as urging young people to ``stay away from
bad influences, (like) drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And she recounted the shock of being told by the Celtics team
physician after Lewis's first collapse in April 1993 that he might
have a life-threatening heart condition. That was ultimately the
conclusion reached by the ``Dream Team'' of doctors who evaluated
Lewis at New England Baptist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain Lewis's abrupt transfer to Brigham and Women's
Hospital against medical advice, Harris-Lewis said she and her
husband were frustrated by a lack of communication at the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   And in testimony that moved at least two jurors to tears,
Harris-Lewis described her reaction upon learning that her husband
had collapsed and died while shooting baskets on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a state of shock,'' she said. ``He was every bit of
what a woman could want in a man, and more.''

<P>
   FARAFENNI, Gambia _ It was late when the old man returned home
from evening prayers. During the day the sand-covered street had
been busy, but the dust settled as people withdrew into their
houses and courtyards. The moon would not come out this night, and
soon the neighborhood, save his house and perhaps another one with
a generator, would sink into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the old man's courtyard, children were playing and women
were preparing dinner. But seeing an unannounced visitor, the old
man, Cpl. Bakary Dibba, a World War II veteran in his 80s, ushered
him inside his house.
</P>
<P>
   Around Farafenni, a border town in the interior of this tiny
West African nation, Dibba is known as the last survivor among the
10 local men who fought in the British army against the Japanese in
Burma. World War II changed Africa forever, in great part because
the European colonial powers drafted hundreds of thousands of young
men like Dibba from the remotest corners of their African colonies
and sent them to places they never knew existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I had heard that a great war was being fought,''
Dibba said, sitting in an armchair in his starkly furnished living
room, where a single weak light bulb hanging from the ceiling cast
faint shadows against the blue walls. ``But we never knew we were
going to fight in that war. I did not know there was a place called
Burma. It's only when we reached Burma that we realized we were to
fight in the World War.''
</P>
<P>
   A clear moral imperative may have guided U.S. and British
soldiers as they fought in Europe and Asia. But for many African
soldiers _ fighting as they did for their colonial masters, the
same men who talked of battling the racist regimes of Nazi Germany
and Japan _ there was deep ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1939, to hear Dibba tell it, when some British
officials came here for one week searching for volunteers. The a
highway that now goes through here had not yet been built, and
Farafenni was only a village of several hundred farmers.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally, Dibba recalled, African drums were played to stir
up enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after there was no volunteer,'' he said, ``they started to
use force so the youths would go. The chief went to each compound
and demanded one volunteer. When they saw you, they would just grip
you and take you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he and an older brother volunteered, the only 2
among the 10 young men who went to war. ``We knew we were going to
be forced,'' he said, ``so we decided to join.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man was between 16 and 20 years old, already with a
young bride named Binta. He did not know the year of his birth,
though he remembered the exact weight _ 70 pounds _ he was able to
carry in military gear and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The conscripts from Gambia were sent for training to Nigeria,
Britain's largest colony in West Africa. The other colonies, Sierra
Leone and Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, also sent men. The
four colonies provided a total of 167,000 soldiers organized into
seven brigades, according to the British historian Basil Davidson.
Hundreds of thousands more were recruited by the British in East
and Southern Africa, and by the French in their colonial
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed. Dibba and the others sailed for India. There was
more training at barracks near Delhi and then Calcutta. The size of
the cities astonished him. ``I realized that some people are
completely white in India and some are colored, and they have very
long hair,'' he said, excavating his memories from 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there are Hindus as well as Muslims,'' added Dibba,
who until then had heard only of Muslims, like himself, and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Away from Africa, young men from different ethnic groups worked
together for the first time for a common cause, just as they did in
the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   ``All tribes were mixed together _ Wollof, Mandinka, Fula,''
said Dibba, who is Mandinka. ``We did not have any problems because
of our tribes. We were together.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dibba took off his slippers and leaned back in his armchair. His
family had gathered outside the living room window, peering inside.
His youngest child, Yusupha, 4, clambered onto his lap. The child
was born to Dibba's 20-year-old wife, the youngest of his three
wives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With their training completed, Dibba and the others were driven
to northern Burma. Then they hiked for two days through jungle and
mountains. On the way, 10 men died drinking water from a lake that
Japanese soldiers had poisoned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Japanese forces had conquered Southeast Asia and had
overrun Burma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew anything about the Japanese people,'' Dibba said.
``In Burma, I realized these people were called the Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then many of us realized for the first time that it was a real
war. There was no way out. Nobody could escape back to Africa. We
had to fight. There was no day or night. We were fighting all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting lasted three years for Dibba. In that time, a
British officer passed on a message from Farafenni that Binta, his
wife, had died of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a couple of months after Japan's surrender in August
1945, Dibba was back in Farafenni. He has never left since. But the
experiences that he and the other veterans brought back to Africa
helped transform the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's participation in liberating Europe from the Nazis and
Asia from the Japanese strengthened the continent's push for
independence. In the signing of the Atlantic Charter of 1941,
Roosevelt persuaded a reluctant Churchill to accept as one of the
postwar goals that the Allies would ``respect the right of all
peoples to choose the form of government under which they will
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of Africa's independence leaders _
self-determination, pan-Africanism _ found a particularly receptive
audience among veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades after most of Africa gained its independence, Dibba
seems to have retained his ambivalence toward World War II. He
keeps his three medals at the bottom of a big trunk, and had
trouble digging them out. They needed polishing, he said, almost
apologetically. He is not held up here as a hero, as a World War II
veteran in the United States would be.
</P>
<P>
   Dibba's 30-year-old son, Kebba Dibba, looked surprised when he
was asked whether he considered his father a hero. ``I don't think
war produces heroes,'' Kebba said. ``We don't need to look for such
heroes. He did it and that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was getting very late. The old man had already changed into

REPORTS SEE SHAKEUP AT LA TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what one observer called ``the denouement of the whole (Mark)
Willes era,'' reports circulated Friday that the editor and
publisher of the Los Angeles Times were being ousted by the paper's
new owners, the Chicago-based Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parties would confirm that story Friday. But the
Times reported that when the Tribune Co. formally takes control,
Times editor Michael Parks would be replaced by Baltimore Sun
editor John Carroll, and publisher Kathryn Downing by Orlando
Sentinel publisher John Puerner. The Sentinel is owned by the
Tribune Co. while the Sun is part of the Times Mirror empire.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.4 billion sale of Times parent company Times Mirror to
the Tribune Co. stunned the media world when it was announced last
month. The Tribune's tender offer to purchase shares of Times
Mirror stock expires Monday, after which time official change in
control can take place.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Parks's and Downing's impending departures were not
unexpected after the last few tumultuous years for the Times under
the stewardship of Willes, the Times Mirror chief executive.
Willes, who also took the post of Times publisher in 1997, became
known for cutting jobs, for his professed desire to blow up the
``wall'' between business and editorial departments, and for his
goal of increasing Times circulation by an astounding 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, veteran Times editor Shelby Coffey III resigned
and was replaced by Parks, who had risen to prominence as a foreign
correspondent. Last June, Willes was succeeded as publisher by his
protege Downing.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when the Times' decision to share ad revenues with
the new Staples Center sports arena triggered an uproar over
journalistic ethics, the episode was largely viewed as an
indictment of the Willes philosophy that imperiled both Downing and
Parks. In a post-mortem he wrote on the Staples fiasco, Times media
writer David Shaw was critical of Downing's judgment and Parks's
failure to protect editorial integrity, and blamed the ``diminished
standards'' on Willes's watch. When the Times' sale to the Tribune
Co. was announced, Willes indicated he would be leaving the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Former Times publisher David Laventhol said the management
shakeup ``closes the loop in the sense that the Times has its top
management in place for the future.'' While expressing his
admiration for Parks, Laventhol added that ``John Carroll is a
wonderful choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-respected Carroll, who has been the editor of the Sun
since 1991, was being discussed as a successor to Bill Kovach as
curator of Harvard's Nieman Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Puerner, publisher of The Orlando Sentinel since 1993, is viewed
as an up-and-comer at the Tribune Co., where he has worked since
1979.

MORE IPOS SCRUBBED AMID PLUNGING STOCK PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As US stock markets went into freefall Friday, several dot-com
companies hastily scrubbed or delayed plans for initial public
offerings of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Among many other companies now exploring alternative options for
financing was Furniture.com Inc., an online furniture retailer
backed by CMGI Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com not only put its IPO on hold, but laid off 29
workers, or nearly 15 percent of its work force, in Framingham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to attract new customers, Furniture.com had been
offering free deliveries. Now, it plans to impose some delivery
fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is looking for e-commerce companies to become much
more focused on the bottom line,'' said a Furniture.com spokesman,
Don Goncalves. ``We've gone function by function throughout the
business with an eye to fast-forwarding our path to profitablity.''
</P>
<P>
   Also putting off a planned IPO Friday was Zefer Corp., a Boston
consulting firm that specializes in Web strategy. Zefer had hoped
to raise $58.5 million in an offering managed by Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at a stock market that just continues to
deteriorate, day after day,'' said William Seibel Jr., chief
executive. ``The worst thing we could do was take a great company
out in a skittish market.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg News, more than 25 companies have
canceled IPOs or secondary stock offerings in the last month, as
the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market headed south.
</P>
<P>
   The number of IPOs had reached record levels early this year,
Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Media Holdings Inc., the cable television unit of Hallmark
Cards Inc., was among the companies that canceled offering plans.
It had been hoping to raise as much as $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 companies, though, including AltaVista Co., which runs
a popular Internet search engine, and 360networks Inc., which is
building a North American fiber-optic network, still plan to go
ahead with IPOs next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nasdaq Composite index swooning in recent weeks, some
companies in the high-flying IPO class of 1999 have lost two-thirds
of their value, most notably Commerce One Inc. and Internet Capital
Group.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq's sharp decline has poisoned the climate for
companies that had been looking to raise money by selling stock to
the public, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In a worst-case scenario, wholesale cancellations of IPOs could
cut off the oxygen to a generation of start-up dot-coms struggling
to survive. That would not just hurt young companies; it would also
be bad news for investment banks, which earn fees for managing
IPOs. And there would likely be a ripple effect through equity
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Certicom Corp., a Canadian maker of secure-transaction software,
canceled its immediate plans for a $316 million IPO that was to
have been managed by Robertson Stephens Inc., a unit of FleetBoston
Financial Corp. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When it released first-quarter earnings this week, FleetBoston
said Robertson Stephens was part of the reason why earnings were up
22 percent over the same period last year.

STEPPING OUT WITH A WHOLE GIGAHERTZ 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speed has always been the driving trend in the development of
the personal computer. From the beginning, its creators sought ways
to make it much faster, and users applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Now microprocessor capabilities have reached a new, higher
mountain top: 1 gigahertz, which is the equivalent of 1,000
megahertz. It's a goal the processor industry has been racing
toward for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you can buy a 1-GHz PC, is it worth it? Given the state
of the art in modern computing, does anyone really need a computer
that fast?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, as always: It depends.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at one of the fastest consumer PCs you can buy _
and some thoughts on why you might or might not want to:
</P>
<P>
   Presario 5900Z-1GHz _ $3,050, Compaq Computer Corp.: Advanced
Micro Devices was the first chip maker to reach the vaunted 1-GHz
speed milestone, edging out market leader Intel Corp. by just a few
days. Compaq has opted to go with AMD's 1-GHz Athlon processor
instead of Intel's Pentium III model.
</P>
<P>
   I reviewed a Presario 5900Z with a 700-megahertz Athlon chip in
October (see www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/370363), and there
have been only minor changes made to the system since then. One of
them, though, is indicative of a change in attitude on the part of
Compaq that's to be applauded. More on that in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MACHINE LOADED FOR ACTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1-GHz model I tested came with 256 megabytes of memory; a
40-gigabyte hard drive; a 10X DVD-ROM drive and an 8x4x32
rewritable CD-ROM drive; a Creative Labs 3D Annihilator Pro
graphics card with 32 MB of video memory; a SoundBlaster Live!
Value audio card; a 56K fax modem; and a 10/100-megabit Ethernet
card. Other than the sound card _ which is a subset of the standard
SoundBlaster Live! _ there's nothing wimpy about this machine, and
that includes the price. That $3,000-plus does not include a
monitor or speakers.
</P>
<P>
   So why would anyone want a 1-GHz processor? Certainly, if you
use your computer for basic tasks _ e-mail, Web surfing, word
processing, entertainment software, simple games _ then you don't
need it. It's more than overkill for most users.
</P>
<P>
   But if you lay high-end games, work with large graphics or audio
files, need speech recognition capabilities or work in software
development, you need all the muscle you can get. And this machine
has it.
</P>
<P>
   The timedemo feature in id Software's Quake III Arena game has
become the de facto standard among power-hungry PC users for
testing just what a computer can do. It stresses the processor,
memory component and the graphics system and reports back the
results in the average number of frames displayed per second.
</P>
<P>
   With the graphics settings on Normal, the Presario 5900Z-1GHz
scored an impressive 95.8 frames per second. Ratcheting up the
settings to High Quality, it came in at 83.8 fps. On the custom
settings I normally use to play _ 1,024-by-768 resolution, with all
the eye candy turned on _ it hit 55.2 fps. These are the highest
numbers of any machine I've tested _ as well they should be!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
USER-FRIENDLY FEATURES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is obviously a great gamer's machine, but it also should be
of interest to anyone who wants to work with desktop video. It is
one of the few PCs out there that comes with a built-in IEEE 1394
port, aka FireWire. Most digital video cameras sold today can
connect to this kind of port, making it easy to get movies into
your PC for editing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1394 port is right on the front (there's another in the
back) so it's easy to plug in your camera. Compaq also includes a
copy of MGI Software's VideoWave III, an excellent program for
editing video on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that buyers of this level of computer want just one
thing _ raw speed _ Compaq has made a major change in how it loads
software on the PC. The company is notorious for having all kinds
of software running in the background on its consumer PCs, from
virus checkers to programs that auto-download patches.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq still includes those programs on this computer, but
leaves them turned off by default. When you first turn on this
computer, you are running a basic Windows 98 SE installation. It's
up to you to turn on the features Compaq normally considers a
convenience, but which can rob system performance and conflict with
other software. The system comes with instructions for doing so,
but an all-in-one control panel would be more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it should be with all consumer computers, and
Compaq's taken the right step by giving users a choice. Here's
hoping other makers of consumer PCs follow its lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I used a monitor from Compaq's commercial division,
the TFT8020, with this system. This is an 18-inch, flat-panel, LCD
display that doesn't come cheap _ $3,400.
</P>
<P>
   The 8020 is aimed at the financial and medical markets, as well
as anyone who wants a state-of-the-art, flat-panel screen. Unlike
most LCD monitors of this size, the bezel around the screen is
relatively thin, giving this a pleasing look.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is bright and very easy to see even from an angle,
with a standard resolution of 1,280-by-1,024 pixels. The monitor
accepts inputs from both digital and analog video sources, so it
can be used with almost any video card, and adjusts automatically
to the type of video signal it's receiving.
</P>
<P>
   It's an excellent monitor, but obviously not priced for the
masses. Not yet, anyway.
</P>

BRITISH CONGLOMERATE RESCUES PEAPOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peapod Inc. found a savior Friday in Stop &AMP; Shop's parent, the
Dutch supermarket conglomerate Royal Ahold NV, which will pay $73
million for a controlling interest in the ailing Internet grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement, Peapod shares rose nearly 28 percent
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, closing at $3.1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy, particularly after the past several weeks,'' sand
Andrew Parkinson, acting chief executive and founder of Peapod,
which is based in Skokie, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 30 days, Peapod's struggles have reflected the
struggles of online retailers. After spending millions of dollars
on advertising and warehouses, many failed to make a profit and
line up new funding.
</P>
<P>
   After Peapod raised $58 million in an initial public offering
three years ago, its rapid-fire growth turned the company into the
largest online grocer. It now delivers deli meats, baked buns and
other grocery items to more than 130,000 customers in Boston and
other US markets.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod executives had hoped that investors would bring another
$120 million to the table. But the funding vanished after chief
executive William Mally resigned in March, due to health reasons.
Analysts have also cited high prices and growing competition as
reasons to eschew the online grocery industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ahold's investment clearly gives Peapod ``a second lease on
life,'' said Jeff Siegel, an analyst with Ormes Capital Markets in
New York. ``Without that, it's pretty likely that they would have
gone bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Peapod lost $29 million on $73 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Operating as a stand-alone company, Peapod is expected to play a
key role in Ahold's Internet strategy. The online grocer currently
serves nine markets, including Boston, where it has a relationship
with Ahold's Stop &AMP; Shop division. Those delivery services will
eventually be expanded to the Washington, D.C., area and to other
markets in which Ahold operates.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Ahold will provide space in its stores and
warehouses, supplying Peapod with groceries. With Ahold's
resources, ``there is now the potential for Peapod to grow faster
in a profitable way,'' said Hans Gobes, an Ahold spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ahold operates five chains with more than 1,000 stores: Stop &AMP;
Shop; Giant Food of Landover, Md.; Tops; BI-LO; and Giant Food
Stores of Pennsylvania. The Dutch grocer's US sales reached $20.3
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Ahold will purchase securities
convertible into Peapod common stock at $3.75 per share. Ahold will
own 51 percent of Peapod and have warrants to purchase up to 75
percent of the company.

TECH STOCKS DEALT ONLY A GLANCING BLOW, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Market-Worst)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's ferocious stock market backlash has bloodied the
high-flying tech stocks that have defined the ``new economy.'' But
company officials and investment experts say it's only a flesh
wound.
</P>
<P>
   Technology incubator CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass. saw its stock
fall to $52.0625 on Friday, down more than 44 percent in one week.
But CMGI got off easy compared to Internet content-delivery company
Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mas., and Sycamore Networks
Inc., a Chelmsford, Mass. maker of optical networking equipment.
Shares in each of these companies lost more than 55 percent of
their value in the past seven days. Akamai slid from $145.69 to
$64.88, while Sycamore stock declined from $115.50 to $51.
</P>
<P>
   After months of warnings that tech company earnings couldn't
begin to justify their huge stock valuations, the recent selloff
seems like a nightmare come true. Still, there's no sense of panic
among the market makers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cook, money manager at Munder Capital Management of
Birmingham, Mich., says tech companies are actually becoming
sounder investments, as more of them move to tighten up their
business practices and start delivering real revenues and earnings.
``As a matter of fact, the fundamentals of the businesses are
tending to get better, not worse,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the way CMGI spokesman Bill White sees it. ``We've
got plenty of cash,'' said White, ``we've got plenty of marketable
securities.'' And, he added, CMGI has a multilayered strategy that
should see the company through market downdrafts.
</P>
<P>
   White said that his firm's 16 operating companies, including the
Internet advertising company Engage Technologies Inc., will provide
$1 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should exit the year 2000 with a revenue run rate of $2
billion,'' he added. That's real money, enough to ensure CMGI's
viability, even if its falling stock price will make it harder to
do future acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Appledorn, also of Munder, cites CMGI as evidence that
investors are bailing out too quickly. ``I'll guarantee you that's
not 20 percent less of a company than it was yesterday,'' Appledorn
said. ``They're throwing a lot of babies out with the bath water
here. This is not a very discerning or discriminating market.''
</P>
<P>
   Akamai spokeswoman Karen Converse agreed. She echoed comments
made this week by Akamai chairman and chief executive George
Conrades that his company is the victim of a vicious shift in
market momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is solid,'' said Converse. She pointed to this
week's deal with streaming media pioneer RealNetworks Inc. to help
broadcast audio and video over the Internet as proof that Akamai is
continuing its rapid growth. ``We're chugging away,'' Converse
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one of the leading technologies that allow
Internet content to be delivered faster to end users,'' said Bill
Garrahan, who tracks Akamai for Lehman Brothers in Washington, D.C.
``We think they have a solid business model, providing part of the
base structure of the Internet. They should be a very successful
companies in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, few investors seemed interested in the long term.
When will that change?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of good fundamental earnings
announcements'' from tech companies, said First Albany Corp.
analyst Ullas Naik, ``and it's going to take fortitude on the part
of institutional investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Naik said that a few days ago, he thought tech stocks were
already on the inexpensive side. ``Now, I think it's ridiculously
cheap.''

   BOSTON _ When the gun goes off Sunday morning at the London
Marathon, women will be getting a jump on things: Since 1991, the
race has provided between 75 and 100 elite women athletes a
separate start, 30 minutes ahead of the rest of the field, giving
them more visibility, more TV coverage, and less chance for any
interference, either pro or con, from men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very distinctly a women's race,'' said Nick Bitel, the
chief executive of the London Marathon. ``The feedback has been
very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems like a no-brainer for Boston? Hardly. Although race
officials concede the notion has been discussed for several years,
nothing is expected to change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, it really begins to change the very nature of
the event,'' said Guy Morse, race director. ``The formula where
women compete amongst and with the men has worked. I'm still of the
mind-set it's not even wholly endorsed by the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, surprisingly, he's right: Two of the most prominent
women ever to run here prefer the race stay as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I like to start all together,'' said Olympic gold
medalist Joan Benoit Samuelson, who won in 1979 and 1983. ``I've
raced with men all my career; I think we're all in this together.
Boston is all about tradition. They traditionally started together,
so let's just keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another voice for the status quo belongs to three-time winner
Uta Pippig. ``For Boston, I like to start together with the men
because it's a very traditional race,'' said Pippig, whose 2:21:45
in the first of three straight wins in 1994 smashed Samuelson's
1983 course record. ``Although in the last 10 years the women's
field has gotten much stronger and more competitive, the field is
still not deep enough to make the race interesting for the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Others might like to see a change, but in the end bow to
tradition. Among them is Elana Meyer, who ran London last year. ``I
really enjoyed the race like that,'' said Meyer, who will be
running Boston for the fourth time. ``It's really exciting because
you know what's going on. Here, the women get a bit lost in between
the men. But in Boston what you have is so much tradition, so much
history, you don't really want to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Phooey, said KathrineSwitzer, who knows a little something about
the downside of tradition. ``I've said it for years: I'd love to
see the women start ahead and have a separate race,'' said Switzer,
who in 1967 became the first woman to officially run Boston when
she entered as K. Switzer. ``It makes for a cleaner, clearer
race.''
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning may be the linchpin of change, elsewhere if not
at Boston. When Tegla Loroupe ran 2:20:47 in Rotterdam two years
ago to better Ingrid Kristiansen's longtime world best of 2:21:06,
her performance was tinged by questions of unfair assistance from
male pace setters, who shielded the 4-foot-11-inch, 85-pound Kenyan
from the wind and handed her fluids. (Loroupe lowered the mark by 4
seconds last year in Berlin and, interestingly, will run in the
women-first London Marathon Sunday.) As a result of the ensuing
controversy, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which
is the governing body of the sport, recently decided it will
recognize world bests by women only if they are set in either
single-gender races or races in which the women start at least 15
minutes before the men.
</P>
<P>
   While such a ruling doesn't directly affect Boston, whose
point-to-point course and net elevation drop make it ineligible for
world bests, it could prompt changes elsewhere that would have a
trickle-down effect here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that becomes the standard way of doing business, we would
continue to look at it,'' said Morse.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons beyond tradition for the mixed feelings. Some
elite women say the men around them can be annoying, getting in the
way at the elite-women's fluid tables and jostling for camera
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes men go in front of you because they want to be seen
on television, and it bothers you,'' said Lornah Kiplagat of Kenya,
who has marathon wins in Amsterdam and Los Angeles and is making
her Boston debut. Others say the opposite: ``I like to run with the
men; you have some company,'' said Pippig.
</P>
<P>
   Others involved in the sport are solidly for a separate start.
``Yes, 1,000 percent,'' said Mark Wetmore, the Boston-based agent
for defending champion Fatuma Roba. ``It takes any questions away
from the race. Plus, I think it makes it more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It also, in some ways, makes it more difficult. In marathoning,
there are no women rabbits because the talent pool is not yet deep
enough: Any woman fast enough to set a world-record pace through 25
kilometers is almost certainly going to be running to win the race,
not to help anyone else. So, women in a mixed-gender race often key
off some man in front of them, either to draft or simply to match
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women like the idea and understand what we're doing,''
said Bitel, the London official. ``Others, I'm sure, would welcome
a windbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is technically illegal in US road racing for a woman
to be paced by a man, the infraction would need to be blatant
before it could e detected, much less enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a women-only start adds a degree of difficulty. ``It's not
as much fun,'' said Switzer. ``You have to focus harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the logistics. Some, said technical director Dave
McGillivray, actually become easier: access to elite fluid
stations; safety around the women's lead vehicle, which now has to
weave among the men in front of it; earlier TV coverage instead of
having to wait until the 7-mile mark, when the mass of runners
finally thins out enough for a camera truck to ease into the crowd.
Others, not so: foremost among them the likely need for earlier
road closures in the eight cities and towns along the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a change here in Boston, we have to be 100
percent sure it enhances the race and that there's minimal
downside,'' said McGillivray. ``We have to make sure what we
ultimately decide will absolutely work.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure. If ever there was an overriding reason to
start the women first, Runner's World publisher George Hirsch found
it Friday:
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of Wellesley,'' he said dreamily.

INVESTING WITH NICHOLAS S. BATTELLE: STANDISH SMALL CAP
TAX-SENSITIVE EQUITY FUND

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicholas S. Battelle is fond of fly-fishing for lunker bass in
Boston Harbor and loves to tour the Berkshires on his motorcycle, a
1998 Triumph Thunderbird with 900 cc under the tank. But ask him
where his mind wanders as he frolics amid New England's natural
bounty, and he acknowledges: ``I think about work.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau, Battelle is not. But as portfolio manager
of the $263.3 million Standish Small Cap Tax-Sensitive Equity fund,
he has a work ethic that has produced some smart returns. The fund
gained 55.6 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through
March 31, compared with 35.2 percent for its category of small
growth funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, the fund aims to minimize taxes. Its
annualized tax-adjusted return, assuming a 39.6 percent tax
bracket, is 55.3 percent over the same period _ just 0.3 percent
below its outright return. That compares with a tax gap of 2.4
percentage points for its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has a minimum investment of $100,000, so interested
individuals may want to consult a financial adviser, who can pool
clients' assets to help meet the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In picking stocks, Battelle said from his office in Boston, ``we
look for small capitalization, aggressive-growth companies that
deliver high-octane growth, focusing on new companies with large
future potential.'' These are mostly companies with market
capitalizations of $300 million to $2.5 billion in the areas of
technology, business services and technology-related health care.
</P>
<P>
   With such a leaning towards new-economy stocks, it is no
surprise that the fund has not escaped the recent Nasdaq sell-off;
it fell 8.7 percent from March 10 through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Batelle, 57, says his methodology is tried and true. ``Call
it old-fashioned security analysis,'' he said. ``Our stock-picking
process is more organic than systematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other money managers, he does not use computers to
screen company financial data. Instead, he works closely with the
fund's three analysts in look for companies with annual growth of
at least 20 percent _ but not necessarily profit growth. Because
two-thirds of the fund's companies are unprofitable, growth can be
measured in a variety of other ways. For Internet companies, they
consider customer volume and sales growth and evaluate business
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   They talk to management to assess a company's competitive
strength _ reviewing its products, product cycles, technology and
marketing. Battelle particularly likes companies that are only
beginning to gain market share but whose sales growth is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Any major changes in the portfolio's 70 or so stocks, he said,
must be approved by at least two of the four people who work on the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   He generally sells a stock when its price jumps 20 percent to 30
percent higher in a month than the overall market, or when it
exceeds 5 percent of the fund's assets. He may also sell when he
sees fundamental changes in the company or its industry.
</P>
<P>
   Selling can be tricky, given the fund's emphasis on minimizing
taxes. When a stock's price falls at least 20 percent below its
initial cost, it is usually though not always sold; the loss can be
used to offset gains in other stocks. The fund sold Great Plains
Software at $44 a share on Monday, generating one such loss; it had
bought the stock on March 1 at an average price of $67.
</P>
<P>
   The fund did not distribute any gains to shareholders in 1996,
1997 or 1998, but Battelle anticipates some gains this year, as he
has sold many stocks he bought at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's sell-off, he remains bullish on small
stocks. ``We've done the correcting, and much of the damage is
done,'' he said. ``I feel good about the prospects of small-cap
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Battelle sees bargains among some biotechnology companies, radio
broadcasters and even business-to-business Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent slump in its stock price, he likes Gene
Logic, a Gaithersburg, Md., company that builds genomics reference
databases, which map the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The company is rapidly signing up subscribers among big drug
companies, researchers and health care organizations, he said,
calling its market opportunity ``open ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subscriptions are high-octane revenues,'' he said, because
once they build the database and absorb marketing costs, additional
subscriptions are almost pure profit.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects the company to break even in 2002. He bought the
stock at $56 in January, before the technology sell-off; it now
trades at $25.4375, and Battelle has recently added to his
position.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is the CoStar Group of Bethesda, Md., which
maintains an online database of commercial real estate that is used
by brokers and corporate relocation managers. Subscriptions are
growing 60 percent a year, Battelle said, and the company will soon
offer online property auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Battelle bought shares in January 1999 at $18.56; they now trade
at $27.375. He expects the company to break even at the end of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes iGate Capital of Oakdale, Pa., an information
technology consultant that once specialized in solving Year 2000
computer problems. It now designs and builds Internet and intranet
systems to link company operations, customers and suppliers, he
said, and is an incubator for Internet businesses. Describing its
market opportunity as ``unlimited,'' Battelle expects initial
public offerings for seven of its nine subsidiaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the stock in January at $26.34. Despite the market
sell-off, the shares trade at $32.50.

FOR NET'S INCUBATORS, A MARKET OVERHEATING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, investors couldn't lose with Internet incubators:
Stocks of companies like CMGI, Internet Capital and Safeguard
Scientifics climbed 5-, 10-, even 25-fold, and those who bought
shares on any weakness were quickly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attraction was the incubator business model. The
companies finance Internet start-ups, provide them with managerial
expertise, then push them out of the corporate nest in what have
been lucrative public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, in turn, get a degree of diversification, smart
management and a chance to buy into fledgling Web companies at the
same low prices as venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be the thinking man's way of
participating in the Internet without having to think too hard
about the winners,'' said Steven Appledorn, a portfolio manager at
Munder Capital Management, which holds positions in several
incubator stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the party is over. While the Nasdaq composite has fallen
34.2 percent since March 10, the incubator stocks have taken even
deeper plunges from their recent lofty levels. CMGI has lost 68
percent from its high on Jan. 3, Internet Capital is off 76TK
percent from the same day, and Safeguard is off 66 percent from its
high on March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser-known incubators like Rare Medium and Acacia Research
have suffered, too _ down 84 percent and 76 percent, respectively,
from their highs on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Why such punishment? Part of the problem is the optimistic
assumptions that analysts built into their valuations. Many
analysts, for example, would value an incubator in part by
assigning a potential market value to its still-private holdings
based on comparable publicly traded stocks, then perhaps double
that amount to account for the synergies and management expertise
provided by the incubator parent.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, did not take into account that the Internet
market was overvalued, that synergies might not materialize or that
management expertise might matter little.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the valuation did not account for the
possibility of a cooling market in new stock issues. Such a chill
may be under way, as 13 of the 84 Internet-related scheduled new
issues this year through Friday have been postponed or withdrawn.
Through Friday, 64 percent of new issues this year were trading
below their offering prices, according to CommScan, a research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these incubators are going to fall off the map just as
fast as they got on the map,'' said Chris Selland, a vice president
at the Yankee Group, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   One key test may come this week, as Alta Vista, the Internet
portal in which CMGI has a majority stake, is expected to go
public. If the deal, originally scheduled for March 6, is delayed
again or fizzles, a result could be further weakness in the group,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alta Vista is not successful, it's going to put more
emphasis on which stocks can survive without additional capital,''
said Phil Leigh, an analyst at Raymond James Financial, a brokerage
firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. If the deal is a hit, he added, ``it
could turn sentiment, but not to the unbridled enthusiasm we saw
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh has a buy rating on CMGI, which now trades at $52.0625;
his 52-week target is $100.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts continue to recommend the stocks. Pat D.
Walravens, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, has a strong buy and $200
price target on Internet Capital, as he has for months. It now
trades at $38.984375. Barry Chubrik, an analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston, started coverage of Rare Medium on March 27, rating
it a strong buy with a 52-week target of $80. It is now at
$14.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Appledorn said he had been adding to his positions in CMGI,
Safeguard and Internet Capital: ``This exodus is clearly
overdone.''

MARKET PLACE: STOCKS' TAILSPIN MAY QUICKLY HURT ECONOMY, BOTH OLD
AND NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET and MARKET-ADVISORY-NYT) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. economy boomed as the stock market,
particularly technology stocks, soared to unprecedented heights.
Now, with those stocks suddenly much lower, will the economy cool
off quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think so. ``We are going to find that this tech
wreck and Nasdaq crash will have a much more immediate impact on
consumer spending than the interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve
has given us,'' said Ed Yardeni, the chief economist of Deutsche
Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that forecast turns out to be true depends on psychology
at least as much as it does on economics. After all, even after
losing a quarter of its value this week, and a third since it
peaked barely more than a month ago, the Nasdaq composite index is
still higher than it was in November. Other stock indexes have
suffered much less damage.
</P>
<P>
   The booming stock market has clearly aided the economy, as
investors who felt wealthier spent more. The anticipation of higher
stock prices also helped. One survey late last year showed that the
typical investor expected the stock market to average 19 percent
annual gains for the next decade, a figure that is in line with
recent experience but far larger than long-term growth of the
economy is likely to support. Investors who believed that could
have felt less need to save, since their investments were likely to
keep rising. If that psychology changes, it could have an immediate
dampening effect on consumer spending, which has been rising
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retracement so far takes away only a small part of the
increase in financial asset values over the last few years,'' said
Henry Kaufman, an economist who runs his own money management firm.
He said it was likely to have ``only a modest economic retarding
influence,'' but added that a key ingredient would be whether the
latest market turmoil changed expectations about future gains.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it was largely taken for granted that the
so-called new economy was largely immune to higher interest rates.
The stock prices of many older companies had come under pressure
after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates last June,
on the expectation that such increases would eventually slow their
business. But the high technology part of the stock market soared
at an unprecedented rate. It was noted that few such companies had
borrowed large sums, meaning that they were not directly affected,
and it was thought that demand for their products would continue to
be strong even if the old economy faltered.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sudden weakness of the stock market may have a much
more direct impact on the new economy. Robert Barbera, the chief
economist of Hoenig and Co., noted that initial public offerings
and venture capital investments, most of them related to the
Internet, had brought in $150 billion for hundreds of new companies
since the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money was spent with the older technology
companies, as the new companies bought computers and software and
communications equipment. If the initial public offerings market is
now going to stop bringing in money, as appears likely unless the
market quickly turns around, that source of revenues will no longer
be available to companies such as Intel and Compaq and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact on the real economy will be faster than people
expect, and concentrated in technology,'' Barbera said.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market crashed in October 1987, many economists
assumed that a recession would follow. The market was viewed as a
leading indicator of the economy, and surely a fall as large as
that one indicated a deep economic problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it didn't. In retrospect, the severity of the 1987
crash reflected market imperfections more than economic realities.
Many institutional investors thought they could protect themselves
by selling stock index futures when prices fell. But so many did so
that the selling overwhelmed the market, and sent prices down even
further.
</P>
<P>
   After that crash, the Federal Reserve immediately changed its
policy and began to lower interest rates. The New York economy, far
more dependent on Wall Street than other regions were, did suffer
to some extent. But most of the country continued to grow until a
brief recession arrived in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also moved to cut interest rates when world stock
markets plunged in 1998, after the Asian crisis and Russia's
default on some of its debts alarmed investors. There was talk of a
worldwide recession, but it did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as in 1987, the Fed has been raising interest rates in an
effort to slow the economy. But it is not at all obvious that
Chairman Alan Greenspan will again reverse course. The release
Friday morning of the Consumer Price Index report, which was far
worse than expected and helped to accelerate the selling of stocks,
was viewed by some economists as providing a reason that the Fed
might decide to raise rates by half a percentage point, rather than
the quarter-point that was expected, at its meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, it is likely that the Fed will not stop raising
rates until there is clear evidence that something _ whether rising
rates or a plunging stock market or a combination of the two _ is
slowing the economy significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Another economic issue that could arise concerns the dollar.
Thanks in part to surging consumer demand, the United States has
been running a record trade deficit. That has not hurt the dollar
because foreigners were willing to invest those dollars back in
this country, many of them in stocks. If the flow of foreign money
into American investments slows, that could put the value of the
dollar under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no assurance that the recent decline of the
stock market will continue. Investors have responded to many falls
since 1987 by seeking to buy during the dips, and headlines about
plunging stock prices soon gave way to articles about new highs for
major indexes. This week's fall of 7.3 percent for the Dow Jones
industrial average was the worst since the index fell 7.6 percent
in the week ended Oct. 13, 1989. On the following Monday, the Dow
leaped 3.4 percent, and the fears were soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen again. But if it does not, one of the factors
that has pushed the economy to new heights will have been removed.
At a minimum, that means slower growth.

LEGAL ASPECTS OF ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE ARE CUT AND DRIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal battle over Elian Gonzalez turns on a narrow question
of law that makes the political fight over whether the boy should
be raised under communism virtually irrelevant to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   That question is who has the power to make decisions for the
6-year old child in deciding whether to seek political asylum in
this country, legal experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father has said he does not want to seek asylum for
Elian but the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed an
application in Elian's name on Dec. 10. He then sued when
immigration officials refused to accept the application.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is who speaks for the child,'' said Linda Silberman,
a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on
international child custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country,'' Silberman continued, ``we treat family
relationships as sacred. We don't go looking at whether people are
poor, at what people's political views are, and we only intervene
in a family when there is a very high threshold of proof that a
child is in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The case centering on the asylum issue reached the federal
appeals court in Atlanta after a decision in federal court in Miami
went against the boy's Miami relatives. It has become the main
legal battleground in the case.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the suit that a judge on the appeals court issued a
temporary order on Thursday barring Elian's father from taking the
boy back to Cuba until the full court could review a request by the
Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United States while the court
considers their case.
</P>
<P>
   Most other issues that have been swirling in the news media and
politics _ including the question of what is in Elian's ``best
interests'' _ are peripheral and are expected to be swept aside as
the appeals court begins its examination of the case, legal experts
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez is contesting a March ruling in favor of the
federal government and the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, by
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore in Miami. He ruled that
immigration officials had the power to decide, as they did this
winter, that the father, not the great-uncle, spoke for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The father had told immigration officials in Havana in December,
``He should be returned immediately to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration officials' decision, Moore said, was based in
part on two interviews they conducted with Gonzalez in Cuba in
December. The officials found no evidence that Gonzalez was an
abusive father, the judge said, which would be a ground to deprive
him of the presumption that he speaks for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Congress had given immigration officials sweeping
powers to make such decisions and had sharply limited the power of
courts to review those decisions. Only when immigration officials
abuse their discretion, for example, by making decisions that have
no basis in fact, can courts overturn the rulings. The judge held
that in Elian's case there was no abuse of discretion by
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Miami relatives have asserted that the
father cannot speak freely because he is under the control of the
Castro government. When U.S. officials met with Gonzalez in Cuba,
they tried to assess whether he was able to answer freely by giving
him written questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   He answered that he was offended that the Miami relatives were
``questioning my paternity rights.'' The Miami relatives have said
such answers cannot have been freely made because the Castro regime
is authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it was standard in cases of small children
for their parents to speak for them. ``A bedrock principle of the
Constitution is that strangers and even relatives have no right to
interfere with a parent's right to custody of his or her child,''
said Michael R. Masinter, a professor of constitutional law at Nova
Southeastern University Law Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said there is no absolute age when children are
considered able to make decisions like whether they will seek
asylum. In one much-publicized case in 1980, a Ukranian immigrant,
Walter Polovchak, was considered old enough to seek asylum at age
12, even though his parents wanted him to return to Ukraine. But
the experts said they knew of no case where a child as young as 6
was considered mature enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Friday that the legal posture of Elian's case has
been confused in public commentary about it.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Miami relatives, for example, have advocated
that the decisions concerning Elian should be handled by a Florida
family court. They have said that is because a family court judge
would consider the ``best interests of the child,'' a legal
standard typically applied in state courts when there is a contest
over the custody of a child between two parents.
</P>
<P>
   That position gained support in early January, when a Florida
circuit court judge, Rosa Rodriguez, issued an order in favor of
the Miami relatives. But this week, a new state judge in the case,
Jennifer Bailey of Miami-Dade Circuit Court, said the boy's
great-uncle had no legal standing even to raise the question of
what would be in Elian's best interest. Florida family law holds
that he is too distant a relative to make a claim against the
father, she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey also said the immigration official's decision to defer to
Elian's father's wishes superceded any state court power in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Further confusing the legal picture, the Miami relatives also
filed a separate suit in federal court in Washington Friday
asserting that Elian would suffer human rights abuses by the Cuban
government ``for having sought asylum'' if he were returned.
</P>
<P>
   Michael C. Dorf, a professor at Columbia University Law School,
said that would be a difficult suit for the Miami relatives to win
because it would give anyone who is dissatisfied with a decision
denying an asylum application a human rights claim. In addition,
Dorf said, the Washington court would be reluctant to wade into a
case that is already before the federal appeals court in Atlanta.

FORD RESTRUCTURING TO STRENGTHEN FAMILY'S CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford Motor Co. on Friday announced a complex
revamping of its ownership structure, including the payment of a
$10 billion special dividend _ the largest ever by a U.S. company _
and the issuance of additional stock to the Ford family, cementing
its grip on the world's second-largest industrial corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to let Ford distribute nearly half of its
$24 billion cash hoard, one of the largest of any company in the
world, while minimizing taxes for its shareholders and giving the
Ford family greater financial flexibility, particularly for estate
planning.
</P>
<P>
   But the big cash disbursement could leave Ford somewhat more
vulnerable in a recession, although the company will still have as
much cash after the special dividend as General Motors has now.
</P>
<P>
   The dividend may limit somewhat Ford's ability to undertake
further large acquisitions; Ford bought Volvo Cars a year ago and
agreed last month to buy Land Rover from BMW. But Jacques A.
Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that the company would not
rule out further deals.
</P>
<P>
   The recapitalization plan unveiled Friday is a delicate balance
between the interests of Ford Motor's public shareholders and the
interests of Henry Ford's descendants. Big institutional
shareholders and Wall Street analysts have been urging Ford Motor
since the mid-1990s to disburse some of its enormous cash hoard by
buying back stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ford family has always resisted share buybacks,
insisting on dividends instead because of the special class of
stock that the family holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford family holds all 71 million shares of the company's
Class B stock, along with a small number of the company's 1.1
billion common shares. Under rules that were designed to preserve
family control and were drafted when the company went public in
1956, the family holds 40 percent of the voting power at the
company as long as it continues to own at least 60.7 million shares
of the Class B stock _ even though the Class B shares make up only
6 percent of the company's overall equity.
</P>
<P>
   If the family sells too many shares of its Class B stock,
whether to pay estate taxes, cover personal expenses or simply
participate in a stock buyback, then the family's influence
shrinks. If the family's holdings fall to between 33.7 million and
60.7 million shares of Class B stock, the family wields only 30
percent of the voting power. And if the family's holdings fall
below 33.7 million shares then all special voting privileges are
lost.
</P>
<P>
   When Class B shares are sold outside the family, they revert to
common stock. Under Friday's plan, each holder of Ford's common or
Class B stock will be given a choice of receiving $20 a share in
cash or additional common stock.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and one of Henry Ford's 13
great-grandchildren, said that the members of the Ford family would
take additional stock for all of their Class B stock. Most if not
all family members would put the additional distribution into the
family's voting trust, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The extended family faces the problem of covering estate taxes
while preserving family control of the company upon the eventual
deaths of Henry Ford's two surviving grandchildren, Josephine F.
Ford and William C. Ford Sr., who are in their mid-70s. Friday's
arrangement will give the family $1.42 billion worth of common
stock to sell without touching their Class B stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor is reissuing its common and Class B stock as part of
the recapitalization, allowing the $20 special dividend for other
shareholders to be taxed at the lower rates for capital gains
instead of the higher rates for income taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford Motor said that after the recapitalization, it would also
spin off its wholly owned auto-parts subsidiary, Visteon Corp., by
distributing all of the shares to all holders of common and Class B
stock. Visteon has $19 billion a year in sales, of which $17
billion are to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr. said that he would definitely retain the
Visteon shares he received, and other family members were also
likely to keep them, providing another big asset for the family to
sell someday while safeguarding the Class B shares.
</P>
<P>
   The family had partially addressed the estate-tax problem in
1998, when Ford distributed to shareholders its 80 percent stake in
Associates First Capital Corp., a consumer lending business.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that their plan would not require special
approval by the Internal Revenue Service or the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers not involved in
putting the deal together, agreed with that assessment. He said
that the special dividend would easily be the largest ever paid,
and that the overall deal did not appear to favor the Ford family
at the expense of other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said that the distribution of common stock to the Ford family would
also align the family's interests more closely with those of other
shareholders in the future. The family will henceforth have common
shares to tender in any future stock buybacks by Ford Motor, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market welcomed Ford's plan, bidding up its stock
immediately after the morning announcement even as the rest of the
market plunged, although Ford shares also began to fall by early
afternoon and closed at $52.25, down $2.1875. But Standard &AMP;
Poor's, the credit-rating agency, lowered the rating on Ford's
long-term debt to A from A-plus, saying that Ford would have less
of a cash cushion for making bond payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has talked frequently in interviews over the years about
his desire to pass on the family's leading role at Ford Motor to
his children and grandchildren someday. Although hostile or
friendly approaches by potential merger candidates have sometimes
forced special dividends and share buybacks at other companies,
Ford said that the company was not under outside pressure and that
the family's role would continue to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has always been, and will be as long as there is a
Ford family, to keep Ford an independent entity,'' he said.

<P>
   The first thing one notices about Howard S. Jonas is his voice.
It is somewhat deep, but what really sticks out is the combination
of laconic pacing and an accent that could not spring from anywhere
but the east bank of the Harlem River. Call it a Bronx drawl.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctiveness of that voice may fade after a few moments.
But after a minute or so, it probably occurs to the listener that
the voice is still going. And going, spinning off onto tangents,
chasing allusions, moving on to new ground totally unbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas's company, the IDT Corp., is a lot like its founder:
unconventional, at times seemingly unfocused and exhaustively
restless in a search for new ideas and new concepts. Over the last
decade, IDT has created more new niches in the voice communications
market than companies that are hundreds of times its size.
</P>
<P>
   Having tried and failed to beat it, the titans of
telecommunications are now joining forces with IDT, whose first
network operations center was in a funeral-home bathroom in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, John C. Malone's Liberty Media Group agreed to
invest roughly $130 million for about 10 percent of IDT. Within a
week, a consortium led by AT&AMP;T agreed to invest $1.4 billion for a
32 percent stake in IDT's Net2Phone subsidiary, the No. 1 carrier
of phone calls using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net2Phone has established itself as the Internet's very own
phone company,'' C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That is heady stuff for IDT and for Jonas, 43, who just a few
years ago tried to promote his Internet calling service by using a
toll-free number that spelled out a profane reference to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally amazing,'' Jonas said in an interview recently at
his company's new headquarters in downtown Newark. ``Like, we were
these nobodies who started in a basement and all of these giants
were trying to kill us. It was like nobody knew who we were. And
now it's like we're the center of everything. Everyone's trying to
do deals with us. I mean AT&AMP;T, they're like the phone company. God
willing, this will just continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas, whose IDT shares are worth $300 million, almost blushed
when a visitor noticed that the back of his twisted-around tie had
a Brooks Brothers label. ``Well, you know me,'' he said abashedly,
but with a big smile. ``I wear jeans and a work shirt. But now
we're meeting with all these big guys and I need to make them feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas, who still lives in the Bronx, N.Y., with his eight
children and his wife, Debbie, first entered the communications
field in the late 1980s, while he was running a small publishing
operation.
</P>
<P>
   His partner at the time decided to move to Israel, where rates
for international calls were far higher than those in the United
States. The outsized Israeli phone bills were an aggravation, if
not a financial threat.
</P>
<P>
   So Jonas devised a way to let his partner tap into a United
States phone line, with its lower rates, using the ``call back''
system. An overseas customer phones a service in the United States
from overseas, hangs up before the call is answered and is then
automatically called back by the service.
</P>
<P>
   Call back worked, and soon Jonas was in the phone business. In
the early 1990s, AT&AMP;T tried to convince the Federal Communications
Commission to put a stop to the practice, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   The call-back business began to falter anyway after a few years,
as foreign countries opened their communications markets to
competition and international direct-dial rates fell. By then,
however, IDT and Jonas had moved on to the next frontier: Internet
telephony.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed many of its own systems to transmit calls
using Internet technology, which can be more efficient and cheaper
than traditional telephone lines. So far, however, Internet
telephone service is still directed mostly at budget-conscious
consumers, especially for international calls.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the major phone companies realized the potential of
Internet calling, IDT was already in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything, however, has gone smoothly for Jonas. In his
typically unrestrained style, he recounted recently how in late
1998 and early 1999 he suffered a severe bout of depression,
precipitated at least in part by the departure of one of his senior
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of times when I thought I would just kill
myself,'' he said. ``I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat. My
kids had to read to me, take me for walks. It was like they were
the parent and I was the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonas is back to being the endearing, slightly eccentric,
sometimes frustrating executive he has been known as. On a
conference call on March 31 to announce AT&AMP;T's investment in
Net2Phone, Jonas was in prime form. After typically corporate and
typically brief opening remarks from Armstrong and Howard S.
Balter, Net2Phone's chief executive, Jonas let loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delirious,'' he said. ``I feel like Roberto Benigni or
something at the Oscars. I wish I was a dog so I could jump on
everybody's lap and lick their face. This is unbelievable. This is
I think the biggest day in telecommunications since Bell called
Watson 120 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. Before he was essentially cut off
by Richard J. Martin, AT&AMP;T's executive vice president for public
relations, Jonas managed to thank at least 16 people by name, to
volunteer to broker a deal to relocate the golden ``Spirit of
Communication'' statue in front of AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking
Ridge, N.J., and to mention that his 11-year-old daughter beat
Armstrong at the card game spit.

DICKENSIAN ADAPTATION A SOLID STORY

Dickensian adaptation solid story &QL; 
By David Kronke &QL; 
``David Copperfield'' was Charles Dickens' favorite of his novels,
perhaps due to its autobiographical elements _ it's about a
youthful aspiring writer who survives a period of brutal child
labor and a flirtation with the legal profession. In ``Masterpiece
Theatre's'' typically handsome adaptation of the book, boy, oh boy,
does David take it on the chin again and again (well, in boarding
school he takes it on the knuckles a lot), yet proves wonderfully
resilient. After an uneventful adolescence, he goes about hooking
up with many of the same folks for more emotional roundelays and
tragedies before arriving at the splashy happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   As young David, Daniel Radcliffe plays opposite these acting
titans with elan _ ``Harry Potter'' casting agents will want to
check this kid out _ though Ciaran McMenamin is a little blander as
older David. ``Copperfield'' boasts a wealth of England's most
celebrated performers _ Maggie Smith as his fidgeting, good-hearted
aunt, Sir Ian McKellen as the comically unfeeling schoolmaster, Bob
Hoskins as the dreamer Micawber _ in small parts orbiting around
David's tumultuous life.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lyndhurst makes a nicely creepy Uriah Heep and Ian
McNeice a blustery Mr. Dick. Many of the other supporting players
are rather broad, as if they're auditioning for positions at a
Victorian theme park. At 3 1/2 hours over two nights, it's a bit
long-winded, much like Micawber, but for Dickens fans, avowed
faithfulness, as Micawber's wife discovers, has its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ---The show: ``David Copperfield.'' &QL; 
What: ``Masterpiece Theatre'' adaptation of the Dickens classic. &QL; 
The stars: Ciaran McMenamin, Daniel Radcliffe, Maggie Smith, Ian
McKellen, Bob Hoskins. &QL; 
Where: KCET. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight and Monday.

   ATLANTA _ President Clinton suggested Friday that Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas needed a lesson in arithmetic, saying his proposals
for education and promised tax cuts did not add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arithmetic is a very important element in politics and public
life,'' Clinton said, teasingly, in a speech promoting his
administration's education accomplishments to a convention of
education journalists here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take over $1 trillion out over 10 years for a tax
cut,'' he said, ``there simply will not be the money left to fund a
lot of these education and other proposals. I think it's wrong to
spend about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend
on education.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the president did not name Bush, who is expected to win
the Republican nomination for president, the implication was clear.
He praised Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee,
four times. Both candidates have made education a priority, but
their proposals differ in substance and in scope: Gore wants to
pump an additional $115 billion into education over the next
decade, more than 10 times Bush's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the
governor had ``improved education, invested more resources into
education, and delivered the largest tax cut'' in the state's
history, all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to arithmetic,'' Fleischer said in
mid-afternoon, ``we very proudly point out that there are 180 days,
11 hours 35 minutes and 50 seconds until the end of the
Clinton-Gore era.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech, at the annual conference of the Education
Writers' Association, seemed intended, in the waning months of his
administration, to reinforce what he thinks of as his legacy in
education, an issue to which he has been devoted for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The president ticked off a lengthy list of accomplishments:
expanding funding for after-school programs from $1 million in 1997
to a proposed $1 billion this year, connecting two-thirds of the
nation's classrooms to the Internet, increasing student loans and
tax credits for higher education, and pushing states to adopt high
standards. He also released a report outlining huge increases in
education funding for new and existing programs, and he announced
that he would tour successful schools next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the American Federation of Teachers for its
recommendation this morning that all teachers be required to pass a
national test, and he urged states to use their budget surpluses
``to make a dramatic increase in teacher pay.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the high-stakes tests sweeping the nation
along with new academic standards had, in some places, overwhelmed
students and schools, but he said assessment was a critical
component of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that some New York City schools are heated with
coal-fired furnaces, and that there are buildings across the
country too old and dilapidated to be wired to the Internet, the
president urged passage of a $24 billion school-construction
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental lesson of the last seven years, it seems to
me, is that an education investment without accountability is a
real waste of money,'' Clinton said. ``But accountability without
investment can be a real waste of effort. Neither will work without
the other. If we want our students to learn more, we should do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who is chairman of the House
Education Committee, said Clinton should look elsewhere for his
legacy, accusing the president of ``taking a Washington-knows-best
approach'' and hampering states with a ``straitjacket'' on the use
of federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling criticized the president's repeated calls for a
national curriculum standard, and said Republicans were ``committed
to flexibility coupled with accountability'' for states and local
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who last spoke to the education writers a decade ago in
Chicago, when he was governor of Arkansas, invited himself to
address the convention, and ignored his staff's strict scheduling
guidelines, taking unscripted questions from the floor as he shook
journalists' hands in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would consider a job in education after he left
office, the man who has joked about running for school board at the
end of his presidency promised that the Clinton library would have
an educational component.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep working on this for the rest of my life,''
he said.

FIDELITY REHIRES LITVACK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments has rehired veteran mutual fund
executive Neal Litvack to a position as its top marketing
executive, the company confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Litvack, 44, will fill the managment void since Stephen Cone
quit as Fidelity's head of retail marketing in January.
</P>
<P>
   Litvack, currently executive vice president of marketing at
Nvest LP of Boston, will become president of retail marketing
services at Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   He will have responsibility for all marketing in Fidelity's
personal investments group. He will lead the product development
and management of Fidelity's entire mutual fund line, marketing
information services, marketing communications, corporate brand
marketing, and the Fidelity in-house advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Litvack is scheduled to rejoin the company April 24. He was
unavailable for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Litvack's second management stint at the Boston
mutual fund giant. He worked at Fidelity for a decade until 1996,
when he exited as executive vice president of retail marketing.
Litvack later took a similar role at NVest, a Boston firm whose
affiliated investment firms manage $133 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Litvack's appointment extends a period of executive change at
Fidelity that began in January.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cone and J. Gary Burkhead left the company early in the
year. Burkhead, a longtime senior Fidelity manager, retired, and
Cone took a position at Citicorp's Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Gail J. McGovern was named to succeed Burkhead at that time, and
Litvack will now report to her.

   Lord of the Rings: The official Web site of the movie being made
from the beloved fantasy trilogy. &QL; 
Where: www.lordoftherings.net &QL; 
What's cool: The addition to this site of a two-minute trailer of
early shots from the movie, now less than halfway through 14 months
of shooting in New Zealand, with a December 2001 release date,
attracted a whopping 1.7 million downloads its first day. With more
than 1,200 visual effects shots (for comparison, ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' had 1,000; no one else is even
close), the movie should be a treat for the eyes. The trailer
certainly is. You'll wish you had (or be glad you have) a fast
broadband connection, and you'll need the free Apple QuickTime
browser plug-in (available at the site) to view it all, but it's
worth it. It looks great. Be careful about that address, however;
www.lordoftherings.com takes you to a site owned by another
company, with little now but a long list of links (also useful for
hardcore fans) of other Lord of the Rings sites. &QL; 
Features: Other than the trailer from New Line Cinema, there's not
a ton of other stuff here yet, but there is a place to submit
questions for an ``Ask the Director'' segment, a brief audio
interview of director Peter Jackson, and overpriced editions of the
book with a special authenticated letter from Jackson. There's also
a program that dresses up your Web browser with various Ring

WILD ON THE STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street did a lot Friday to solidify its growing reputation
for volatility, and everyone better get used to that fact of life.
In the process, the market erased a noticeable amount of worry
that, as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan likes to remark
from time to time, stock prices had an irrational quality. There's
nothing like a falling market to make price-earnings ratios look
more reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sharp drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 616
points, liquidated about 6 percent of overall market value. It's an
impressive figure but one that pales alongside the 20 percent
plunge of Oct. 19, 1987, the worst single-day drubbing the market
had taken since the 1929 crash. Wild swings up and down in the
markets have become almost normal, thanks to widely shared
professional investment thinking coupled with the ability to make
buy-and-sell decisions in the twinkling of an eye. Computer
appraisals of markets and automated decisions further accelerate
the process. Those realities will not go away, and they virtually
guarantee future lurches up and down.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive has been the decline of the NASDAQ index, driven
primarily by sharp drops in high-tech names that have lost their
allure. Now off more than 30 percent from their highs of earlier
this year, these stocks have gone through more than a correction _
they have been pummeled. The bear is prowling among them. Painful
as that has been, the unreasonable values placed on companies
barely getting started in markets that are extremely competitive
made the selloff almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, prices begin to look very attractive, and there
is a lot of money eager for bargains _ or what look like bargains
after falls of this magnitude. The rush back into the market is apt
to be just as swift as the rush from it. Modern Wall Street is not
a quiet zone.

INFLATION'S TOLL ON INFLATED MARKETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than $2 trillion in investor wealth got
vaporized last week. It was the worst week in Nasdaq history, and
one of the worst in Wall Street's.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market's ascent into the stratosphere in recent
months had been breathtaking, the speed with which this fortune
vanished was nothing short of stupefying. After the government's
announcement on Friday that the Consumer Price Index for March
showed broad and troubling increases, stocks across the board
collapsed. The Dow lost 5.66 percent, while the Nasdaq plummeted
9.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CPI kicked the market when it was down,'' said Christine
A. Callies, chief equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``Investors had decided that valuations in tech were too inflated
and needed to be adjusted. When the report came out, investors
decided that the market P/E had to come down, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is growing at a 3.7 percent rate, year over year. Tony
Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak, said investors were
troubled by higher housing costs _ up 0.4 percent _ and medical
costs, which rose 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report could be an anomaly,'' said James L. Crawford,
portfolio manager at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP; Jacobsen in New York.
``But when you look back over the past year, inflation has been
creeping up. Most people wrote that off to oil, but those folks who
have been saying inflation is nonexistent have to rethink here.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a silver lining in these ominous clouds, some
investors may hope that the decline in stock prices means that the
Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in raising rates in coming
months. Not so, said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long way to go to rein in an economy that is
growing 6 percent-plus in the past six months and going full steam
ahead in the spring,'' he said. ``Mr. Greenspan cannot afford to
take his foot off the brake in this climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nasdaq composite has fallen 34 percent from its March
10 high, the broader Wilshire 5000 index _ which Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, watches as a proxy for the overall market _ is
down only 15.4 percent from its peak of March 24. As a result,
Roach said, he expects the Fed to raise rates one-quarter point in
May, again in June, again in August _ and possibly more.
</P>
<P>
   Callies says that while the Nasdaq has been mauled, the broader
market will not necessarily follow it into bear-market territory.
``The market was never as good as the Nasdaq made it look,'' she
said on Friday, ``and today it is not as bad as it looks, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors looking to hide amid the turmoil should consider
old-fashioned value stocks, Callies said, including shares in
metals and paper companies, and energy service and exploration
concerns. Crawford likes consumer companies that have been beaten
down, like Gillette and Colgate-Palmolive, and real estate
investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation frightened investors on Friday, but Roach said the
movement in prices was still modest. A more important shift was in
the levels of risk that investors seem willing to take. ``Valuation
does matter in the stock market,'' he said. ``We're getting down to
more reasonable levels in some of the more overvalued pieces of the
market. But with the fundamentals of the economy intact and
inflation signs minimal, stocks can find a level and hold.''

DIRECTOR CAPTURES SMOKIN' PISTOLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Practically everyone was unemployed, there was a garbage
strike going on for months, and the three TV channels would go off
and on randomly. It was just a miserable time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones remembers Britain
in the mid-'70s, when the notorious and short-lived punk band rose
from the litter-stacked streets of the nation's capital to spark
chaos in record company hallways even while remaking the pop scene
in their own safety-pinned, working-class image.
</P>
<P>
   Painted against the political, economic and cultural backdrop of
a depressed London, Julien Temple's ``The Filth and the Fury''
captures the essence of the Pistols movement with footage of live
performances, rehearsals, promotional events, interviews and candid
moments with the four original band members. The 105-minute
documentary is playing at the Nuart through April 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone who saw the Pistols in the beginning, even if
they hated them and walked out in the middle, knew this would
change things,'' Temple said from his home in pastoral Somerset,
England. ``As Jones says in the film, when the band was starting
out, they'd see a few more people at each gig with short hair and
ripped T-shirts. It was a movement that grew from the grass roots,
bit by bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, who directed the well-received 1986 rock `n' roll
musical ``Absolute Beginners,'' was the perfect choice to make
``The Filth and the Fury,'' which used footage that was part of a
1986 lawsuit brought by the band members against the Pistols'
former manager, Malcolm McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed footage was originally shot by Temple for his 1980
free-form documentary ``The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle,'' which
told the Pistols' story largely from McLaren's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swindle'' put forth the idea that McLaren, a former art
student, London boutique owner and self-proclaimed revolutionary,
used the band as a sort of art project to subvert the system, make
money and cause headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' takes the opposite view, suggesting
that singer John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) was the real driving force
within the infamous punk group, whose most famous songs from their
1977 album, ``Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols''
(Warner Bros.), include the anthemic ``God Save the Queen,''
``Anarchy in the UK'' and ``Pretty Vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now living in Los Angeles and working as a record
producer, agrees with the movie's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had the look, he had the fashion sense, he was the singer
and he wrote the lyrics,'' Jones, 44, said. ``He was an anti-star,
but he was the focal point. McLaren didn't do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistols lasted just 26 months and recorded only one album,
forming in 1975 and breaking up bitterly immediately following a
concert at San Francisco's Winterland in January 1978. But in that
short time, Lydon, Jones, drummer Paul Cook and the late Sid
Vicious (who replaced original bassist Glen Matlock) altered rock
history, opening the floodgates for the alternative-rock movement
that reached its commercial zenith two decades later with Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' alternates between archival scenes of
the Pistols and present-day interviews alongside some of the band's
notorious TV appearances that shocked Britain, such as a visit to a
nationally televised tea-time talk program that quickly degenerated
into a drunken, expletive-filled free-for-all. That appearance
prompted the London Daily Mirror headline that gives Temple's
documentary its title.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the Pistols' story still has the power to inspire
and amaze. At a recent screening for the London music scene, Temple
said Liam Gallagher, front man for rock's current bad boys, Oasis,
told him that compared to the Pistols, he felt like he was part of
a ``boy band.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple believes the time is especially right for his film
because so many young people have no sense of a time as remote as
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we screened it to teen-agers in London, about a quarter
of the audience thought it was fiction and the Pistols were being
played by actors,'' he said. ``I found that hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   One element that comes through in ``The Filth and the Fury,''
which was made for less than $1 million, is the humorous side of
the band, something that's often missed in light of Vicious'
stabbing murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, and his
subsequent death from a heroin overdose in New York while awaiting
trial in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were young people basically out to have fun,'' Lydon has
said. ``They didn't realize that's what young people do; the world
was _ and is _ a horrible place, but you'll never change it by
being miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple first stumbled across the Pistols as a first-year film
student in summer 1975. While walking in London's then-desolate
East End on a Sunday, he heard a racket coming from a warehouse.
Following the noise to a second-floor rehearsal room, he found
Jones, Matlock and Cook warming up until Lydon arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued,'' he recalled. ``I'd never seen or heard
anything like them. They invited me to a gig and I got to know
them. They let me shoot all kinds of stuff for years afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new film, Temple shot interviews with the band members
in silhouette. The reason: He wanted to maintain their mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the world needs is wrinkly rock stars talking
to the camera,'' the director said. ``We wanted to keep it in the
past. Also, by keeping them in darkness, it suggests those Mafia
interviews you sometimes see on TV. Like these guys are so
notorious they have to remain anonymous.''

THE RIGHT NOT TO REPRODUCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 16, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medicine's breakthroughs have brought joy to many previously
infertile couples by helping them bear children. But these
procedures have also brought on difficult legal and ethical
dilemmas. One of these led recently to a sensible, if limited,
decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that a divorced husband could block his ex-wife
from becoming pregnant with a stored frozen embryo the couple had
created during fertility treatments. Even though the husband had
signed no fewer than seven documents saying that his wife could
make use of the couple's stored embryos if they separated, the
court wisely respected the divorced man's wish not to be made a
father against his will.
</P>
<P>
   The February ruling was followed recently by the court's written
opinion. Justice Judith Cowin wrote that ``respect for privacy and
liberty requires that individuals be accorded the freedom to decide
whether to enter into a family relationship.'' We agree.
</P>
<P>
   There have not been many court decisions in any state on issues
like this one, but those that exist have tended to uphold couples'
agreements as being enforceable contracts. Still, as Robin Charo,
professor of law and medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin,
notes, in the other cases upholding the agreements did not mean
obliging anyone to become a parent unwillingly.
</P>
<P>
   At age 44, the unnamed woman in the case has limited options for
becoming a mother again (the couple did have twins with in-vitro
fertilization), so it is easy to understand her resolve to have the
agreements enforced. Still, the most recent was signed in 1991,
before the birth of the twins. The issue comes down to whether we
as a society want to give greater weight to the right to become a
parent or not to become a parent.
</P>
<P>
   On that, the court was clear: ``As a matter of public policy, we
conclude that forced procreation is not an area amenable to
judicial enforcement.'' Plainly, the court is feeling its way
cautiously in an area that will provide it _ and society _ many
more difficult, anguishing questions to address in the future.

   The words cash and cachet come from different linguistic roots,
but they often go hand in hand. That link is not lost on Unilever,
the multinational consumer-products corporation that has just
bought up Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, the Vermont ice-cream company
with a social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics trumpet the company's sale to the $45 billion Anglo-Dutch
monolith as a triumph of cutthroat capitalism over down-home,
tie-dye economics. But Unilever would be as nutty as Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Rainforest Crunch if it did not live up to the promises it has made
to maintain the social and environmental agenda established by Ben
Cohen and Jerry Greenfield when they started out in a converted
gasoline station in Burlington in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers pay Ben &AMP; Jerry's premium prices not just because of
the products' high fat content and whimsical names, but also
because they know that the company buys its milk from Vermont dairy
farmers _ at above-market prices _ to support family farming and
sends a chunk of its profits to a range of charities. That's the
cachet that distinguishes Ben &AMP; Jerry's from Haagen-Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   Another retailer who has made this formula work is Patagonia,
the outdoor clothing maker. Based in California, the firm also has
New England roots _ its founder, the rock-climber Yvon Chouinard,
grew up in a French-American home in Lewiston, Maine. A cult-like
following developed for Patagonia gear both because of its quality
and because the company devotes a percentage of its sales to
save-the-Earth causes, not least the recent successful effort to
destroy the Kennebec River dam in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Just how serious Unilever is about pursuing Ben &AMP; Jerry's
traditional causes can be seen in one provision of this week's $326
million deal: If any Ben &AMP; Jerry's board members think the
corporation is not maintaining the mission and decide to sue,
Unilever will pay their legal fees. Indeed, Ben Cohen says he will
look at ways to improve Unilever's overall record of protecting the
environment. Strange things can happen when Big Business mixes with
the Grateful Profitable.

FLEETCENTER LAUNCHING CRUISE TO PLACATE BIG-TICKET FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be a combination Schmooze Cruise and Love Boat.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the FleetCenter, fearing the worst after the Bruins
and Celtics went into the tank, will take some of their customers
on an all-expenses-paid cruise to Bermuda in September. The reason
is to try to keep these people in their seats _ literally _ and
keep them putting their dollars into the FleetCenter's vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the kind of year (financially) we thought we
were going to have,'' said FleetCenter CEO Rich Krezwick. ``We were
counting on both the Celtics and Bruins to play at least two
playoff games each, and in the process keep their fans excited
about the future. That didn't happen. Now we have to try to keep
them happy some other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Krezwick's problem: When the FleetCenter opened five
years ago, many customers who purchased luxury suites averaging
more than $100,000 per year signed five-year leases. Those leases
are up, and if the people decide not to re-up, which they could
well do after the two stinkers the Celtics and Bruins submitted
this season, then the FleetCenter will take a big financial hit.
</P>
<P>
   It will be more of the same next year with the preferred seat
licenses. Before the building was opened, preferred seats, which
run anywhere from $11,000 to $14,000 per year, were sold in three-,
six-, or nine-year packages. The six-year licenses expire next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything we can to keep these people
happy, and with us,'' said Krezwick.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the FleetCenter chartered a cruise ship for a week
trip to Bermuda, paying back customers for the Celtics games missed
because of the NBA lockout, and running up a tab of more than $2
million in the process. This year they won't take the whole boat,
but they will spend more than $1 million trying to keep the
possible defectors aboard.

   Two years ago, your humble servant went to Buffalo for an
important late-season Saturday game between the Jets and Bills.
Three hours before kickoff, YHS went to the field looking for Bill
Parcells and through the fog saw a figure in the distance. It
wasn't Parcells. It was Keyshawn Johnson, already in uniform, while
the rest of the team hadn't left the hotel yet. I asked Parcells
about it and remember his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years of coaching, (Keyshawn) is the only player I
ever had that beat me on the first bus to leave for the stadium,''
Parcells said. ``When I get on, he's already sitting there. When we
get to the stadium, he doesn't hang around shooting the breeze, or
reading the paper, he's into his uniform, out on the field ready to
go. This guy is all football player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did not want to let Johnson go. They know he is one of
the best players in the league. He catches, blocks, doesn't make
mistakes, stays in great shape, and wants the ball when the game is
on the line. However, even though Johnson has just four NFL seasons
under his belt, he will turn 28 next season.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn had two years remaining on his original Jets contract.
He signed a six-year deal and the Jets gave him a huge bonus to
sign for that long with no loopholes. As I remember it, the Jets
offered a four-year deal, a five-year deal, or a six-year deal with
the bonus money going up with each year. Johnson took the six, but
after four he wanted more money and out of the contract, and the
Jets, strapped for cash, couldn't give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could have forced him to play out the final two years
of his contract, and then made him their franchise player. But they
didn't want to keep hearing about Johnson's contractual problems or
having him hold out of training camp, so they decided to take the
two first-round picks Tampa Bay put on the table. Tampa allegedly
gave him a record-breaking eight-year, $52 million contact. But
upon inspection, it is really a five-year deal for $25 million,
with $13 million up front in bonus money. Some $27 million of the
deal is in the final three years, when Johnson will be in his
mid-30s, and he'll never see that money.

   Harry Sinden believes Ray Bourque may get his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to take one team now to win the Stanley Cup, it would
be Colorado, and mainly because of Ray,'' Sinden said. ``He's been
the missing piece for them. They had a lot of good players, but
they are playing at a higher level now because Ray is there. He is
the best player in hockey for leading by example on the ice. Ray is
not a rah-rah guy, but once he gets on the ice there is no one that
tries to play the game better than he has. The style of game they
are playing in Colorado is more conducive to Ray's skills than the
kind of hockey we played with the Bruins the past year. Colorado
has a positive, aggressive kind of game. We were backing up all
year, and playing without any confidence. My only concern about
Colorado winning it all is Patrick Roy. He's either great or lousy
in the playoffs. If he's great, I think they will win it all, and
Ray will have a big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden feels the four best teams in hockey are all in the
Western Conference _ Colorado, Dallas, St. Louis, and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins in the West, should beat the East winner,''
Sinden said. ``But more upsets happen in hockey than any other
sport in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East is more difficult to predict. I still think the
best-balanced team is New Jersey, and I give them the best chance,
but they haven't played well lately. Washington has been the most
consistent team in the East for quite a while. Ottawa, Toronto,
Philly, Buffalo are all capable of pulling an upset. Any one of
these teams has a goalie who gets real hot and they could be
playing in the (Stanley Cup) finals.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino on the NBA playoffs: ``I liked the Lakers to win it
all before the season started, and I still do. They have really
matured as a team this season. The only team that can give them any
trouble in the West, in my opinion, is San Antonio. But if Tim
Duncan's knee injury is serious their chances are diminished. When
they are healthy, they are a good club. I don't know what has
happened to Portland. They should be better than they are but I
can't explain the way they have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the East, I think it will come down to Indiana and New
York. The Pacers have the most depth and the greatest home-court
advantage in the league going for them. (Their) new building is
something. It creates a college kind of atmosphere with the Pacer
fans. Go to one of their games and you think you are at the ACC
tournament. If they get to a seventh game at home against the
Knicks in a playoff series, home court will be big for them. I
think Indiana is the only team in the East that could beat the
Lakers. I'm not saying they would, but with their depth, and their
shooting ability, if they shot the ball well for the whole series
they could do it. They're not that great on defense, so they have
to be very good on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell is everywhere. When Pitino was down and out
emotionally after his team lost a tough game to the 76ers last
week, Russell showed up in the Celtics' dressing room and spent 90
minutes with Pitino after everyone had left the building.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino told friends later: ``It was one of the nicest things
that has ever happened to me. Here was one of the greatest ever to
play the game, sitting there all the time trying to cheer me up.
I'll never forget it.''

CLINTON CRITICAL OF BUSH'S EDUCATION PROPOSALS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton suggested Friday that Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas needed a lesson in arithmetic, saying his proposals
for education and promised tax cuts did not add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arithmetic is a very important element in politics and public
life,'' Clinton said, teasingly, in a speech promoting his
administration's education accomplishments to a convention of
education journalists here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take over $1 trillion out over 10 years for a tax
cut,'' he said, ``there simply will not be the money left to fund a
lot of these education and other proposals. I think it's wrong to
spend about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend
on education.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the president did not name Bush, who is expected to win
the Republican nomination for president, the implication was clear.
He praised Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee,
four times. Both candidates have made education a priority, but
their proposals differ in substance and in scope: Gore wants to
pump an additional $115 billion into education over the next
decade, more than 10 times Bush's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the
governor had ``improved education, invested more resources into
education, and delivered the largest tax cut'' in the state's
history, all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to arithmetic,'' Fleischer said in
mid-afternoon, ``we very proudly point out that there are 180 days,
11 hours 35 minutes and 50 seconds until the end of the
Clinton-Gore era.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech, at the annual conference of the Education
Writers' Association, seemed intended, in the waning months of his
administration, to reinforce what he thinks of as his legacy in
education, an issue to which he has been devoted for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The president ticked off a lengthy list of accomplishments:
expanding funding for after-school programs from $1 million in 1997
to a proposed $1 billion this year, connecting two-thirds of the
nation's classrooms to the Internet, increasing student loans and
tax credits for higher education, and pushing states to adopt high
standards. He also released a report outlining huge increases in
education funding for new and existing programs, and he announced
that he would tour successful schools next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the American Federation of Teachers for its
recommendation this morning that all teachers be required to pass a
national test, and he urged states to use their budget surpluses
``to make a dramatic increase in teacher pay.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the high-stakes tests sweeping the nation
along with new academic standards had, in some places, overwhelmed
students and schools, but he said assessment was a critical
component of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that some New York City schools are heated with
coal-fired furnaces, and that there are buildings across the
country too old and dilapidated to be wired to the Internet, the
president urged passage of a $24 billion school-construction
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental lesson of the last seven years, it seems to
me, is that an education investment without accountability is a
real waste of money,'' Clinton said. ``But accountability without
investment can be a real waste of effort. Neither will work without
the other. If we want our students to learn more, we should do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who is chairman of the House
Education Committee, said Clinton should look elsewhere for his
legacy, accusing the president of ``taking a Washington-knows-best
approach'' and hampering states with a ``straitjacket'' on the use
of federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling criticized the president's repeated calls for a
national curriculum standard, and said Republicans were ``committed
to flexibility coupled with accountability'' for states and local
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who last spoke to the education writers a decade ago in
Chicago, when he was governor of Arkansas, invited himself to
address the convention, and ignored his staff's strict scheduling
guidelines, taking unscripted questions from the floor as he shook
journalists' hands in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would consider a job in education after he left
office, the man who has joked about running for school board at the
end of his presidency promised that the Clinton library would have
an educational component.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep working on this for the rest of my life,''
he said.

IMPROVING SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 16, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent report by the trustees of Social Security concluding
that the system is on sound financial footing for the next three
decades ought to quiet talk that it needs to be radically
transformed. Instead, Congress should focus on improving benefits
for people who must retire early and have few resources except
their monthly Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   A bill signed by President Clinton last week will not address
that problem. The law allows workers between the ages of 65 and 69
to earn whatever they can and still collect Social Security
benefits. Under the old law, their Social Security checks would be
reduced if they earned more than $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional leaders were congratulating themselves
on a major achievement, but it is no such thing. The $17,000 limit
was scheduled to go up to $30,000 in two years in any event. The
unlimited earnings exemption will mainly apply to people earning
high incomes, and it is unclear how many will take advantage of the
change.
</P>
<P>
   This new law will not have any effect on the solvency of Social
Security. In the old system, anyone who delayed collecting payments
until age 70 would get a higher monthly check. This feature is
retained in the new law, which will still give many seniors an
incentive to wait until 70.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore had a better idea for improving the
system when he urged that special attention be paid to widows and
widowers.
</P>
<P>
   Women on average live 20 years after age 65; men only 16 years
more. Under present law, if the husband dies first, the wife loses
the smaller of the two Social Security checks, often nearly half
the family's monthly income. Gore would guarantee that these widows
(and widowers) would receive at least 75 percent of that amount. It
is a sensible proposal that would provide a much-needed financial
cushion for women in the last years of life.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's other proposal would compensate people who care full-time
for children for the lost wages that would otherwise help them get
higher Social Security benefits in retirement. It would only
produce $600 or so in additional money a year, and much of that
would go to people who already have enough saved for a comfortable
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not put a price tag on either proposal, but plans to
finance them by paying down the national debt, using the money that
would otherwise have gone for interest payments. Even with the good
news on Social Security finances, all that money will be needed to
pay the benefits already in place for the baby boomers. His first
proposal is worth the extra money; his second is not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the vice president have a solution for one of the major
problems in the system: how to better provide for those who must
retire on reduced benefits at age 62 because they are no longer up
to the strain of physically demanding work. Most of these jobs do
not pay much, and these people often depend on Social Security as
their primary means of support in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   One way to help these people is to raise benefits for low-income
workers, as long as they have worked at least 40 to 45 years. This
condition would focus extra resources on people who started work
just out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   This change would require more money, and few political leaders
are talking about the best way to raise that: an increase in the
amount of income subject to the payroll tax, which now cuts off at
$76,200. During the last two decades, the pay of high-income
workers has gone up far more than people earning modest wages. Some
of this money ought to be redistributed to help those in less
lucrative careers.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees of the Social Security system now estimate that
they can provide full benefits until the year 2037 without making
changes in the existing schedule of eligibility or payments. This
estimate is inherently flawed by the long time period it must
cover. If the economy grows faster than the trustees expect, the
system can continue making full payments indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In case it does not, Congress needs to adjust the benefit levels
and retirement criteria slightly to keep the system solvent. And it
should invest a small portion of the trust fund in the stock
market, which usually produces a far better return than the
interest on US government bonds, where the Social Security surplus
is now invested. As Congress adjusts the system to prepare for the
retirement of the baby boomers, it should keep in mind those
Americans who must retire early because they are no longer up to
their jobs.

STOCKS' TUMBLE LIKELY TO DAMPEN IPO MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET and MARKET-ADVISORY-NYT) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The initial public offering market, on fire for the
last 15 months, will probably cool off a great deal in the wake of
the market's sharp slide.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the market stabilizes and begins to rise soon, two things
will happen quickly: the volume of offerings that come to market
will decline and the quality of the companies that successfully
sell stock will improve.
</P>
<P>
   The market's downdraft ``will put a big bump in the road,'' said
Kathy Smith, portfolio manager of Renaissance Capital's $100
million IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the sell-off, ``the market will be a lot more
discriminating'' about the deals it will buy. ``You won't see
so-called story stocks, companies with an idea but no financial
results. Only the better companies will get through the window,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than attempt to sell new stock into a falling market,
companies and their investment banks are choosing to postpone the
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In the week just completed, just under half of the 50 initial
public offerings and secondary stock offerings were priced.
</P>
<P>
   ZEFER Corp., an Internet consulting and services firm that has
been in business for two years, was one company that chose to delay
its offering. And the company seems in no hurry to come to market
until conditions are noticeably better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan to go public was driven by a great market opportunity
rather than a need for cash,'' said Bill Seibel, ZEFER's chief
executive. ``Unlike many companies, we have the luxury of going out
in three weeks or three months or nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the stock market declined ZEFER had been on track to
price 4.5 million shares, a little less than 10 percent of the
total stock outstanding, in a range of $11 to $13 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Before ZEFER comes back, valuations in the market ``would have
to be a little better,'' Seibel said, ``and the volatility would
have to decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two companies are on the calendar for next week,
according to Renaissance Capital. As of late Friday, four have
already been postponed and more may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a quick improvement in the market, Smith estimated that
about 25 percent of the 300 initial public offerings scheduled for
the balance of the second quarter will not get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``And another 25 percent will get done at greatly revised terms
to attract investors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters are guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe a number of deals will be priced over the next
couple of weeks in spite of the most difficult overall market
environment we have seen in some time,'' said Mike Curtis, a
managing director in equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   A key test of demand for yet another technology company will
come early next week, when AltaVista plans to sell 14.8 million
shares at $18 to $20 a share. The company runs a popular Internet
search engine. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is the lead underwriter
for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, market corrections have always drained life out of
the initial public offering market. But since the crash in 1987 the
downturn in activity has not lasted long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant stock market corrections see equity underwriting
fall from the peak quarter to the bottom quarter by well over 50
percent,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst who covers Wall Street
firms for Salomon Smith Barney. ``A decline of 50 percent or more
is not out of the question. I think we are in for something like
that.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are called ``circuit breakers'' or ``trading
collars,'' and they can suspend or halt trading in times of market
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   First put in place after the 1987 stock-market crash, the
circuit breakers and trading collars were meant to calm investors,
or at least give them a breather.
</P>
<P>
   The system was first set up to halt trading if the Dow fell by
so many points, say 350. But as the Dow has climbed, the point
drops have become less significant.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, when the Dow fell 554 points, or 7.2 percent,
trading was halted for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But a similar sell-off now would result only in minor curbs on
trading. That is because in 1998, regulators and the operators of
the large exchanges decided that trading should be interrupted or
halted only in the event of a sell-off of 10 percent, 20 percent or
30 percent from where the Dow sits at the beginning of each
quarter. The circuit breakers don't track the Nasdaq, which has
taken the brunt of the selling lately.
</P>
<P>
   Trading collars, which restrain arbitrage trading, not the
buying and selling that small investors do, go into effect when the
Dow rises or falls 200 points. These collars have gone into effect
several times, including on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit breakers, however, are another question. At the
beginning of the second quarter, the New York Stock Exchange
announced the new point levels for circuit breakers:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Dow falls 1,050 points before 2 p.m., trading on the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq is halted for one hour; if it
occurs between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., there is a 30-minute halt;
after 2:30 p.m., trading will not be halted.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Dow falls 2,100 points before 1 p.m., there is a
two-hour halt; if between 1 and 2 p.m., a one-hour halt; and if it
occurs after 2 p.m., the market will close.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Dow falls 3,150 points at any time during the trading
day, the market will close.

 &HT;    Experts: Selling will spill over into Monday
 &HT;    By Robert Luke

<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. investors lost $2.1 trillion this week.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half those losses came Friday, causing anxiety among
investors wondering if the frantic selling on Wall Street will
spill over Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank on it, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's selloff was sparked on concern the biggest pickup in
inflation in more than five years will push interest rates
significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index _ loaded with once high-flying
technology stocks _ fell 355.49 points, or 9.7 percent, to 3321.29,
its second-largest percentage loss and biggest point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 83.95 points, or 5.8
percent, to 1356.56, as 87 of its 88 industry groups declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest point drop
ever, tumbling 617.78, or 5.6 percent, to 10,305.77, with American
Express leading all 30 stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Nasdaq lost 25.3 percent, while the Dow
dropped 7.2 percent and the S&AMP;P 500 sank 10.5 percent. Since its
March 10 record, the Nasdaq has retreated 34.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors lost $2.1 trillion this week, according to
Wilshire Associates, which tracks more than 7,000 stocks of
companies headquartered in the U.S. though its Wilshire 5000 index.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index alone forfeited $540 billion in
market value Friday and an astounding $1.68 trillion for the week,
according to Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Will the blood-letting continue? Should bargain hunters rush to
buy now as others are hurriedly selling?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and no.
</P>
<P>
   Most market observers believe Friday's selloff will spillover to
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally if you have a really bad Friday, it carries over into
Monday,'' said Phillip Larkins, market strategist at Legacy South,
an Atlanta-based money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weekend of worrying doesn't lend itself to a vigorous uptick
on Monday,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities market strategist Larry Wachtel agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see a blue Monday,'' he said. ``I think
it's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkins frets that the waves of selling could undermine
confidence in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the psychology of the market may be changing,''
he said. ``There have been so many investors who have not been
through a bad market.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ricky T. Harrington of Wachovia Securities agrees. He
thinks that many small investors may now be shifting money away
from stocks into less volatile investments, such as bonds and
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's the beginning of the migration away from
equities,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the wild swings in the financial markets are
likely to continue. Daniel Goldfarb, a portfolio manager at David
L. Babson &AMP; Co. in Cambridge, Mass., explains:
</P>
<P>
   ``If rates rise more than expected in coming months, it ``will
be another kick in the pants for stocks,'' Goldfarb said. ``People
were thinking maybe we were close to the end of rate increases.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to rush to buy stocks now that they are down,
said Bruce Bittles, a partner at J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should wait,'' he said. ``We're telling our
clients that the best time (to buy stocks) will be in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your powder dry,'' Bittles advised.
</P>
<P>
   But Herb Williamson, a vice president at Atlanta-based
Enterprise Capital Management, believes it's OK to bargain hunt for
the shares of companies with bright earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there was a lot of air in the technology stocks,''
said Williamson, whose firm manages mutual funds with about $9
billion in assets. ``This (Friday's selloff) was a way to let some
of it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shares of some solid ``bricks and mortar'' companies
were unfairly beaten up as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're throwing out the baby with the bath water, you're
throwing out a lot of good stocks with good, solid fundamentals and
earnings growth,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Larkins of Legacy South sees a silver lining to the market's
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good and healthy thing because there are too many
investors who have no appreciation of the risk factor in
investing,'' he said. ''It's not heathy to think you are entitled
to returns of 25 to 30 percent a year in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term, a little dose of reality _ a gut check _ will be
good for the market,'' Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel of Prudential Securities concurs. He said the market is
trading on emotion now, and a scientific approach that stresses
``support levels'' is useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline is in emotional proportion as the run-up has
been,'' he said, noting the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 85 percent
last year and was up an additional 25 percent since the beginning
of this year to March 10, when the Nasdaq peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the correction that we needed,'' Wachtel said. ``I
grew up in an era when people were getting 10 percent to 15 percent
(annual) returns. Now, they're firing money managers if they don't
get 100 percent. Something was out of kilter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Wachtel and other seasoned market observers know that
declines are part of the territory on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks plunged Friday, Bear Stearns Cos. Chairman Alan
``Ace'' Greenberg took swift action to calm the troops on the
trading floor:
</P>
<P>
   He busted out a Yo-Yo.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping from behind his desk on a raised dais of the firm's
trading floor, he let the toy roll up and down from the string
around his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to practice the Yo-Yo,'' he said as the Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 300 points around noon, on its way to
slide more than 700 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old head of the sixth-largest U.S. investment bank _
whose motto is ``stocks fluctuate'' _ was making a simple point
that he's made before. ``He wants people to feel there's nothing to
worry about,'' said his secretary, Laura Schreiner.

GORE SLAMS BUSH IN CALLING FOR GUN BAN IN PLACES OF WORSHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic presidential contender Al Gore called
for the banning of guns in all places of worship Friday as he
sought to remind voters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's gun-control
record and two recent church shootings in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a three-day California trip, the vice president said
he would support legislation introduced by a number of Democratic
senators that would prohibit the use of firearms in churches,
synagogues and mosques, and places where school events are held.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing the additional gun-control measure, Gore tried to
underscore the differences between himself and his Republican rival
on a campaign issue that Democrats believe will work in their favor
in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Governor Bush's record on gun violence; lax
enforcement of gun laws, more concealed weapons, guns in churches.
America deserves better,'' Gore said in prepared remarks for an
address at a youth community center in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has generally not backed stringent gun-control measures and
in 1995 enthusiastically signed into law a measure that allows
people to carry a concealed weapon in Texas
</P>
<P>
   Two years later the governor signed off on a change to that law
that allowed those with permits to carry concealed weapons to bring
them into places of worship unless those facilities specifically
posted signs banning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of bringing guns into church rose to the forefront
after two gruesome incidents in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In September a man fatally shot seven people in a Fort Worth
church before killing himself. And in March a man wielding a gun
walked into a church in the Houston suburb of Pasadena and wounded
a former lover and three others before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded to Gore's attack by noting that the
vice president's native Tennessee approved a concealed weapons law
in 1994, which they said was similar to Texas law and allowed
citizens to carry guns in churches. They claimed the measure was
sponsored by Gore's longtime friend, state Sen. Roy Herron.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said that
if Gore was really opposed to concealed weapons laws ``why didn't
he speak out when a concealed carry law was passed in his home
state of Tennessee, where residents can also carry guns in
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials justified the 1997 changes to the Texas law
giving church officials discretion on whether to allow guns on the
property. They said many ministers who lived on church grounds were
concerned that they could not protect themselves and their families
if they could not carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In his address at the Washington United Youth Center in San
Jose, Gore also touted a number of other crime control measures,
including ensuring that federal law enforcement officers are not
used for other purposes, hiring of 50,000 more community police
officers, and stiffening penalties for those who commit violent
crimes in front of children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was later scheduled to attend a Democratic National
Committee fund-raiser in nearby Atherton, where the party hoped to
raise $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He then was expected to fly to Los Angeles where he will join
President Clinton on Saturday night at a Hollywood fund-raiser.

RUG BUYING MADE EASIER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rug can change a room. A deep warm color underfoot can pull a
room together and give it a cozy feel, while a pale pastel can open
the same room up with a cool touch.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more homes showing off warm wood floors and cool
tiles, home owners are seeking out large, elaborately patterned
pieces of floor art that can help set the tone for an entire room.
Often they'll buy the rug first and decorate around it.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental rugs, known for their colors and patterns, are probably
the most sought-after area rugs. They are hand woven, unlike most
domestic or other imports.
</P>
<P>
   Rug seekers in Los Angeles don't need to search far and wide.
Practically every street corner contains a rug merchant claiming to
offer quality products. As with most handmade items, Oriental rugs
don't come cheap, and there's often misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   It's no joke when those gorgeous colors on your $20,000 purchase
start to bleed after an unfortunate encounter with a glass of
water, and you have no way of getting your money back or replacing
your rug.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers involved in a rug hunt can take steps to protect
themselves _ both in the search for a dealer and for the rug
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that if you ask enough questions intelligently,
you get more respect from the dealer you're working with,'' says
Kathy Jarvis, director of design at Glabman's Furniture and
Interior Design in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do comparison shopping. Do research. Go out and look at a
bunch of different rugs in different places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would run screaming from the store from any dealer who
started talking about rugs as financial investments,'' adds Roz
Rustigian, president of the Oriental Rug Retailers of America, the
agency that serves as a watch dog to the Oriental rug industry.
``It should be referred to that way only in terms of it being money
well spent, its long-lasting usefulness and that it be in good
condition. This is not a CD.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very much, however, an item that needs a little
pre-purchase research. Here are a few tips on what to look for and
what to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how long a dealer has been at a particular location.
Does he have a reputation within the community? Will he stand by
the product if something goes wrong, or will you even be able to
find him again? If you get a negative answer to any of these
questions, be wary. Contact the Department of Consumer Affairs, the
Better Business Bureau or the Oriental Rug Retailers Association of
America to determine whether the dealer has a history of consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer should have a decent selection _ between 500 and 700
rugs to choose from, says Rustigian.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of auctions, where a dealer might plant ``shills'' in the
audience to call out phony bids in order to jack up the price.
Avoid ``airport sales,'' in which a seller will be in one area for
a few days before moving to another city or state. Also beware of
``going-out-of-business sales'' promising huge discounts. There are
laws governing how long any establishment can be ``going out of
business,'' but you may see the same store on the same corner for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sales allow them to have big advertising: `50 percent
off, 70 percent off, 90 percent off!''' Jarvis said. ``The real
question of the consumer is `off of what?' The person selling it
will still make a nice profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugs should be displayed with labels that clearly list the
item's size, country of origin and price. Haggling may be
encouraged in other countries, but be wary if a dealer immediately
starts negotiating. A rug either has a value or it doesn't. If
there appears to be wide variation in price, consider it a red
flag.
</P>
<P>
   A potential purchaser should be permitted to get a rug
appraised, but not by the dealer who is selling it. Reputable rug
dealers also should allow customers to try out the rug in their
home with a 24-hour penalty-free return policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rug.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental rugs often have a strong pattern configuration.
Oriental doesn't necessarily mean an item crafted in China or
Japan. The term refers to rugs from the Middle and Far East,
including Pakistan, Turkey, Nepal, Tibet, Rumania, India, Iran and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A quality Oriental rug is crafted by hand, sometimes by a single
weaver, more often by two or more, even an entire family working
side by side sometimes for more than a year. Wool and silk are the
most common materials in an Oriental rug, although cotton and camel
hair are used as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about Oriental rugs is to realize
that they are handmade, the humanity factor,'' says Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take a long time to make, and in many regions, it's a
second industry only to farming. They'll go in and get their wool,
get it measured and dyed and take it back to their homes, which may
be hundreds of miles away, to make their rugs. So their living
rooms are their looms generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugs made in America, European countries or in the South Seas
are typically machine made, says Jarvis. You can tell a machine
made rug if the fringe is sewn on around the rug's edges. On a
hand-knotted rug, the fringe is created when the rug's foundation
is cut from the loom.
</P>
<P>
   The country of origin is a factor, but so is the wool.
Australian or New Zealand wool is considered the finest in the
industry. Rugs made with cheaper wool will be fuzzy with rough
textures and shorter fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The average consumer won't be able to spot the difference
between real and artificial silk. If you ask, Rustigian says, a
merchant should tell you the only way of knowing for sure is by
watching a fiber burn. Some will allow you a test, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although less expensive to use, chromium dyes used on wool are
better at holding color than vegetable dyes. Typically, the more
colors used, the more difficult a rug was to make. It is
appropriate, Rustigian says, to ask a dealer for assurance a rug
will hold its color, even potentially to test the rug using a damp
white handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think fairly highly of that person, much more so than
the one who comes swaggering into the store asking about knot
counts,'' says Rustigian.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the knot count. The old adage that the higher the knot
count, the better the quality of the rug is true. But again, watch
out. Inferior-quality rugs use a jufti knot, in which a wool fiber
is double wrapped around a strand of cotton to give the appearance
of a stronger knot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer wouldn't know it by looking at it. I wouldn't
know it by looking at it,'' says Jarvis. ``I have to know who I'm
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn the rug completely over in order to inspect the material in
the middle of the rug as well as on the ends and corners to make
sure the tightness of the weave is consistent. Avoid rugs in which
the underside is covered by a backing. Often a backing means
something about the rug is being concealed. &QL;

SUCK IT UP FOR A CLEAN RUG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a word: vacuum, vacuum and vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   That's the most effective way of keeping an Oriental rug clean.
You'll get your best results by vacuuming side to side, parallel to
the fringe end. Once a year, turn the rug over and vacuum the
underside.
</P>
<P>
   Treat spills and stains promptly. Common spills like coffee and
milk will come up easily. First blot the excess moisture. Then
apply a mixture of one capful of shampoo and lukewarm dishwater to
the stain. Lather, then blot again. Rinse until the suds are gone,
then blot again. Prop up the affected area so that air reaches both
sides for quick drying. Use straight ammonia instead of shampoo
mixture to clean up urine stains, says Roz Rustigian, president of
the Oriental Rug Retailers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Always test solutions on a corner or hidden area of the rug
before applying to a wide area. If the color starts to bleed or
fade, stop immediately and consult a professional rug cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful of steam cleaning, Rustigian warns. High temperatures
can melt the lanolin that protects a wool rug against soil.
</P>
<P>
   Special professional Oriental rug cleaners can immerse the rug
in a combination of chemicals and soap before cleaning it. The
process usually takes about two weeks.

pre-purchase research. Here are a few tips on what to look for and
what to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how long a dealer has been at a particular location.
Does he have a reputation within the community? Will he stand by
the product if something goes wrong, or will you even be able to
find him again? If you get a negative answer to any of these
questions, be wary. Contact the Department of Consumer Affairs, the
Better Business Bureau or the Oriental Rug Retailers Association of
America to determine whether the dealer has a history of consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer should have a decent selection _ between 500 and 700
rugs to choose from, says Rustigian.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of auctions, where a dealer might plant ``shills'' in the
audience to call out phony bids in order to jack up the price.
Avoid ``airport sales,'' in which a seller will be in one area for
a few days before moving to another city or state. Also beware of
``going-out-of-business sales'' promising huge discounts. There are
laws governing how long any establishment can be ``going out of
business,'' but you may see the same store on the same corner for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sales allow them to have big advertising: `50 percent
off, 70 percent off, 90 percent off!''' Jarvis said. ``The real
question of the consumer is `off of what?' The person selling it
will still make a nice profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugs should be displayed with labels that clearly list the
item's size, country of origin and price. Haggling may be
encouraged in other countries, but be wary if a dealer immediately
starts negotiating. A rug either has a value or it doesn't. If
there appears to be wide variation in price, consider it a red
flag.
</P>
<P>
   A potential purchaser should be permitted to get a rug
appraised, but not by the dealer who is selling it. Reputable rug
dealers also should allow customers to try out the rug in their
home with a 24-hour penalty-free return policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rug.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental rugs often have a strong pattern configuration.
Oriental doesn't necessarily mean an item crafted in China or
Japan. The term refers to rugs from the Middle and Far East,
including Pakistan, Turkey, Nepal, Tibet, Rumania, India, Iran and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A quality Oriental rug is crafted by hand, sometimes by a single
weaver, more often by two or more, even an entire family working
side by side sometimes for more than a year. Wool and silk are the
most common materials in an Oriental rug, although cotton and camel
hair are used as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about Oriental rugs is to realize
that they are handmade, the humanity factor,'' says Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take a long time to make, and in many regions, it's a
second industry only to farming. They'll go in and get their wool,
get it measured and dyed and take it back to their homes, which may
be hundreds of miles away, to make their rugs. So their living
rooms are their looms generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugs made in America, European countries or in the South Seas
are typically machine made, says Jarvis. You can tell a machine
made rug if the fringe is sewn on around the rug's edges. On a
hand-knotted rug, the fringe is created when the rug's foundation
is cut from the loom.
</P>
<P>
   The country of origin is a factor, but so is the wool.
Australian or New Zealand wool is considered the finest in the
industry. Rugs made with cheaper wool will be fuzzy with rough
textures and shorter fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The average consumer won't be able to spot the difference
between real and artificial silk. If you ask, Rustigian says, a
merchant should tell you the only way of knowing for sure is by
watching a fiber burn. Some will allow you a test, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although less expensive to use, chromium dyes used on wool are
better at holding color than vegetable dyes. Typically, the more
colors used, the more difficult a rug was to make. It is
appropriate, Rustigian says, to ask a dealer for assurance a rug
will hold its color, even potentially to test the rug using a damp
white handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think fairly highly of that person, much more so than
the one who comes swaggering into the store asking about knot
counts,'' says Rustigian.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the knot count. The old adage that the higher the knot
count, the better the quality of the rug is true. But again, watch
out. Inferior-quality rugs use a jufti knot, in which a wool fiber
is double wrapped around a strand of cotton to give the appearance
of a stronger knot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer wouldn't know it by looking at it. I wouldn't
know it by looking at it,'' says Jarvis. ``I have to know who I'm
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn the rug completely over in order to inspect the material in
the middle of the rug as well as on the ends and corners to make
sure the tightness of the weave is consistent. Avoid rugs in which
the underside is covered by a backing. Often a backing means
something about the rug is being concealed. &QL;

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protesters for global justice call their
headquarters a convergence center, and the abandoned downtown
warehouse does seem to attract all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up against a mound of backpacks and surrounded by the
remnants of a donated macrobiotic lunch is James Osborne, a
23-year-old self-described ``transient'' from St. Louis. Osborne
said he took a Greyhound Bus to Washington because ``someone told
him'' about destructive pipeline projects and bad trade policies.
``I believe there should be no leadership and no organization,'' he
said, though he rejected the label of anarchist.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, David H. Richardson, a 57-year-old Ph.D. economist
at the U.S. Department of Labor, checks the schedule for civil
disobedience actions intended to shut down the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. Richardson is a shop steward of the
American Federation of Government Employees, and says he worked
hard to persuade the national union to endorse the officially
sanctioned portion of the demonstrations scheduled for Sunday,
which it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is at the point that it needs support from outside the
movement,'' said Richardson, looking a little like a headmaster in
a high-school playground. ``Globalization brings a lot of different
people together.''
</P>
<P>
   If they accomplish nothing else, this week's series of protests
against the financial institutions and in favor of debt relief for
the Third World do seem likely to confirm Richardson's observation.
Globalization and the backlash against it bring disparate people
together. The cry to temper the march of capitalism around the
globe comes from voices as diverse as the Catholic Church, a cell
of anarchists and many people and organizations in between.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this unlikely coalition of protesters
and interest groups is, like so many grains of sand blown together,
liable to scatter once its members make a collective point or
achieve individual goals. Or, as some leaders hope, whether it is
the foundation of a new social movement that will apply sustained
pressure on national governments and international institutions to
rewrite the rules of globalization and limit the power of
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Though some environmental groups began pressuring international
financial institutions to become more ecologically sensitive two
decades ago, the movement is still in its infancy. The big bang for
American organizers came only a few months ago, during the Seattle
protests against the World Trade Organization, when they took
credit not only for befuddling police but also for contributing to
the collapse of world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington protests, which began last Sunday with a quiet
rally for debt forgiveness and will culminate this Sunday with an
effort to prevent world finance ministers from attending the spring
meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, are the second big test for
the movement. While it is having some social and political impact,
its main achievement is probably logistical: uniting groups with
different agendas around a common cause and attracting new
recruits, especially college students and unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met some steelworkers and we bonded right away,'' said
Margareta Lelea, 20, a sophomore at the University of
California-Davis. The agricultural development major, who stuck a
green star on her face for ``ecological awareness,'' came early to
Washington to attend nonviolence training seminars at the
convergence center. It is the first major protest she has attended,
though she sympathized with those who opposed NATO's bombing of
Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of union people as interested in the same
issues, but they are,'' she said. ``There's all kinds of
interconnections being made. Without interconnections there's no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke among lieutenants who pulled together the protest is
that there are as many 501-C-3s in their ranks as there are people,
a reference to the IRS form that independent, nonprofit groups must
file each year. The movement against the World Bank and the IMF is
in some way less a mobilization of the masses than a convention of
nongovernment organizations _citizens groups that have individual
agendas, fund-raising campaigns and, in many cases, leaders with
large egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we got people together is that we let everyone
represent their group. They don't have to join our group,'' said
Kevin Danaher, a founder of Global Exchange, one of the groups
instrumental in igniting the protests in Seattle and Washington.
``Is a lot easier for people to compromise when they don't really
have to subordinate their egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Danaher is 49 years old, tall and bald with a white goatee. He
traces his roots as a protester to the anti-apartheid movement in
the 1980s. More recently, he has led campaigns against Nike,
persuading the company to improve conditions for foreign factory
workers, and Starbucks, in which he successfully urged the coffee
chain to sell coffee produced under the TransFair ``fair trade''
label that claims to share profits with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Danaher is a smooth talker who has traveled the country,
speaking at scores of campuses as a kind of Paul Revere for
globalization's woes. ``We have to put the life cycle ahead of the
money cycle,'' is a phrase he uses often. But he says he is just an
adviser to the protests against the World Bank and IMF.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him describe it, the movement has thrived in part
because it rejects the straight-jacket of a typical political or
social movement, with its leaders and head offices and official
strategies. That allows groups to flow in and out without draining
the movement as a whole. Greenpeace, one big player in the world of
environmental activism, used to campaign against the World Bank and
IMF, but has no official role in this weekend's events.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The unofficial lieutenants of the Mobilization for Global
Justice, as the Washington protests were named, have used the
Internet to connect environmental, religious, labor and student
groups that would otherwise not be in regular contact, some 500 of
them in total.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of citizens groups autonomously coordinating
strategy has proved its effectiveness. A Rand Corp. study for the
Pentagon detailed how Mexico's Zapatista rebel movement in 1994
used media-savvy tactics _ a ``social netwar,'' the study dubbed it
_ to generate support abroad for its campaign against the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The study said swarms of independent
citizens groups can prove far more effective than the hierarchical
movements when combating established institutions because they
can't easily be ``decapitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Danaher admires the Zapatista model. ``We also have a
mosquito-bite strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the movement's strength, but it is also a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the main backers worry that the movement's successes to
date have been purely tactical _ headline-grabbing civil
disobedience and a flair for organization. They fret that the
coalition could blow apart as quickly as it came together.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the strains are showing. Though religious groups are
one of the main forces behind debt relief, they have refrained from
any direct involvement in the demonstrations this Sunday. Instead,
they scheduled their own rally last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam and Greenpeace, two the best-known names in social and
environmental activism, have severed formal ties to key umbrella
coalitions of protesters, though members of both groups are still
participating in the protests. The split came about partly over
goals. Oxfam officials, for example, say they have made progress
trying to reform the World Bank, and getting government to agree to
debt relief. Global Exchange, in contrast, wants the bank and fund
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much of this has been about tactics, getting all these
groups together and keeping things moving,'' said John Sellers, of
the Berkeley, Calif.-based Ruckus Society. The observation is
especially poignant coming from Sellers, a Greenpeace veteran who
moved to the Ruckus Socity several years ago. He runs training
camps around the country to teach varied protesters the mechanics
of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Over a beer at a Washington bookshop-cafe one recent evening,
Sellers seemed unsure whether the movement could sustain its
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if we're going to have a center of gravity we have to
figure out really what we want and where we go from here,'' he
said.

GORE CALLS FOR A BAN ON WEAPONS IN CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore said Friday that if he
were elected president he would support a ban on weapons in
churches and other places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houses of worship have always been sanctuaries, and they
should remain that way,'' Gore said. ``I say that pistols have no
place in our pews. If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will
fight for a national ban on guns in churches, synagogues, mosques
and all places of worship as well as places where school events are
held.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban has little support in Congress. But Gore's objective
was to publicize the fact that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his
probable Republican rival for the presidency, had signed a law
allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons into churches. About
20 other states, including Gore's home state of Tennessee, also
allow guns in churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign immediately pointed out that Gore never
objected when Tennessee passed its law in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore was really opposed to concealed carry and guns in
churches, why didn't he speak out when a concealed-carry law was
passed in his home state of Tennessee, where residents can also
carry guns in churches?'' Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign hopes that calling attention to the fact that
Bush signed such a law will help scare suburban swing voters away
from Bush. In an indication of his attempt to appeal to
independents and Republicans, Gore praised Republicans like Gov.
George Pataki of New York who have supported gun control measures.
And, mindful of the large numbers of hunters and sportsmen in swing
states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, he said repeatedly that he
would not interfere with their rights. But he made his announcement
in California, which has been in the vanguard of clamping down on
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators plan to introduce a nonbinding resolution
banning guns in churches before the Million Mom March, to be staged
May 14 in Washington to protest gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his comments at the beginning a three-day campaign
swing across California. His trip was primarily a money-seeking
venture, with excursions into the cash seas of Silicon Valley and
Hollywood bringing in more than $5 million at three events.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop was at the home of Jesse Singh, the chief
executive of the BJS Group, a distributor of computer components.
About 140 people, most of them Sikhs celebrating the Sikh New Year
Friday, paid $1,000 each to listen to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the final fund-raiser in Gore's drive for about
$34 million for his own campaign. But he still has plenty to raise
for the Democratic National Committee, which has set a goal of $100
million. He made a dent in that goal Friday night with a
fund-raiser that was expected to bring in $2.6 million. That event,
hosted by Joel Hyatt, a business professor at Stanford University
and son-in-law of former Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, was
attended by nearly 100 people, who paid up to $100,000 for their
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   His third fund-raising event was scheduled for Saturday night in
Hollywood with President Clinton, their first outing together since
Dec. 9. That event is expected to raise more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his announcement on guns in the gymnasium at the
Washington elementary school here in front of members of City Year,
a national youth service organization and a branch of AmeriCorps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight to protect America's families by launching the
most aggressive and comprehensive anticrime strategy that our
nation has ever seen,'' Gore declared, with Gov. Gray Davis of
California standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a ban on guns in churches, Gore said he would
create a special trust to set aside federal money for crime
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that while Bush has called for better enforcement of
gun laws instead of gun control, Texas had lax enforcement. He
suggested the governor was in the clutches of the National Rifle
Association.

 &HT;    South Florida town pinch-hitting as site for equestrian trials
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOXAHATCHEE, Fla. _ Planning for an unexpected influx of
Olympian hopefuls and their finely tuned horses comes down to small
details _ the flagpoles, the flowers, the finger food _ and big
ones: seating the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equestrian Team decided in March to move the Olympic
dressage trials from its New Jersey headquarters to Palm Beach
County because the West Nile Virus, which attacks people and
horses, had reappeared in the Northeast. The sudden move spurred
local hosts and organizers into a trot to get ready for the big
event, set for May 13-14 and May 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beavering around out here,'' said Mary Ann McPhail
of Horse Park at Equestrian Estates, where the nation's top 12
riders will vie for four Olympic team spots and two alternates.
``We're doing all the things we usually do for a big show, plus a
little extra. This is for the Olympics, and we want it to be
special.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be special for spectators _ the USET isn't charging
admission to the trials, except for a limited number of
``preferred'' seats under the cover of a tent with the added perks
of drinks and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   That will cost $20 per day, or $30 for a two-day pass for each
weekend. Preferred seats can be requested by telephoning the USET
headquarters at 908-234-1251.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want or can't get tent seating, Horse Park
will have hundreds of folding chairs set up around the main show
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Dressage (pronounced dre-SAZH) is known as the figure skating of
horsemanship. The horse does intricate step patterns, gaits and
maneuvers, controlled by the rider with nearly imperceptible
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The trials will start with a test ride of the course at 8 a.m.
each day, with competition beginning at 8:30. The 12
horse-and-rider teams will perform a series of required maneuvers
at specific locations in the arena, while five judges score their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day, May 21, the horses will perform freestyle
programs to music, but must include all the required movements in
the performance.

MARKETS EXPERIENCE HISTORIC DECLINES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stocks were pummeled Friday as this year's roiling market
collapsed in response to reports of rising inflation and the advent
of a bear market in technology shares. The three major stock
indexes suffered the biggest point declines in their history.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market, home to most of the country's most
important technology companies, concluded its worst week ever, a
selloff that spread in waves to the entire market. The trigger was
a government report issued Friday morning that said consumer prices
spiked last month and may force the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates again in May.
</P>
<P>
   The slide accelerated as the day wore on, a dramatic finale to a
week in which the Dow Jones industrial average lost 7 percent of
its value and the Nasdaq Composite index lost a record 25 percent.
Technology stalwarts such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. and
Internet startups went into freefall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bust side of the (economic) boom,'' said Allen Sinai,
president of Primark Decision Economics, a Boston consulting firm.
``This is a severe, not unexpected, and huge correction _ and
possibly a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   As investors tried to unload shares into an already shaky
market, buyers of stock virtually disappeared, an ominous sign of
what's to come Monday, Wall Street experts said. The Dow's
617.78-point drop was steeper than the 1987 stock market crash,
though the percentage decline of 5.66 percent was far below the 20
percent drop on Oct. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, which fell every day last week, has never had such a
rough time. The index sacrificed 355.49 points, falling to 3321.29
_ that is, 1125 points below its level a week ago. Friday's
percentage decline of 9.66 percent was the tech index's biggest
one-day drop since the 1987 crash, a time when Nasdaq was not
nearly as important in the financial markets as it now is.
</P>
<P>
   An 83.20-point decline, to 1357.31, in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index _ a measure of the performance of the broader market _ was
also its biggest ever. All but one of the index's 88 industry
groups dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street experts said myriad forces spurred an exodus from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In an ominous sign, nobody was buying Friday. Not mutual fund
managers, who had been responsible for the Nasdaq's remarkable
snapback from the brink in recent days. Not technology-stock
addicts whose portfolios were under water. And certainly not
conservative investors with much to lose in a treacherous market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nasdaq, you've gotten into a liquidity trap,'' said Jay
Suskind, head of trading for Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., a regional brokerage
firm in New Jersey. With buyers ``drying up,'' investors ``sell the
liquid names that trade in the Dow to meet their margin
requirements or to raise cash.''
</P>
<P>
   And investors of all stripes were selling stocks to raise money
for steep tax bills, due Tuesday, on gains scored during the
market's unprecedented rise last year. Unable to sell tech stocks,
investors were forced to sell stocks in other companies and
contributed to the Dow's rout.
</P>
<P>
   Selling by speculators all week continued Friday. Speculation
has caused the Nasdaq to spike up and down in recent months as
borrowing against stock holdings to buy shares rose to a record
$278.5 billion last month. Last week, these investors were no
longer jumping in to buy tech stocks each time one lost value and
instead were selling shares to cover margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online Brokerage Services in Iselin, N.J., reported Friday
that margin calls _ requirements that investors in declining stocks
put up more cash _ were ``in the thousands,'' said spokesman
Michael Dunn. When the market is rising, margin calls are sometimes
no more than ``a handful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really bad,'' said Mark Minervini, chief investment
strategist for Quantech Research Group in Connecticut. ``People are
going to think about it over the weekend, and they are going to get
scared we'll get another down day and they're going to sell. It's
starting to push people out of the market entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology, financial, retail, and manufacturing _ no industry
was spared during a day in which traders were dumbfounded by a
flood of orders to sell.
</P>
<P>
   More than six stocks fell for every one that rose on the New
York Stock Exchange, where trading of 1.3 billion shares was the
Big Board's eighth-most active day. On the Nasdaq, 2.5 billion
shares changed hands, the second-most on record.
</P>
<P>
   It was what Wall Street experts said Friday was predictable
fallout from a technology market that ran up 86 percent in 1999 and
was destined to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Leading tech stocks down Friday were Qualcomm, which fell
$21.125 a share, and Intel, which dropped $10.625. It was a
disastrous ending to a week in which dozens of tech stocks dropped
more than 25 percent, including Oracle Corp., National
Semiconductor Corp., Nortel Networks Corp., EMC Corp. and Cisco
Systems Inc. Some smaller companies, including CMGI Inc., Sycamore
Networks, and Firepond Inc., fell by half during the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq now stands at two-thirds of its March 10 high of
5048.62 and has returned to levels last seen in November. But could
fall more, analysts said. Everyone seemed to agree tech stocks were
wildly overvalued _ and they still are, according to said Ned
Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisers, division of State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's rout, share prices for the Nasdaq's top 100
stocks were still 90 times earnings of the companies. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index, by comparison, was valued at closer to 13 times
earnings. ``Nasdaq has further to fall,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could go down to 3000,'' said Michael Browne, head of
European equities for Chase Global Asset Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For technology, April has been a cruel month: Five of the
Nasdaq's 10 biggest percentage declines occurred this month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the stock market will remain fragile at least
until the Federal Reserve meets May 16 to set interest rates. The
fed may boost rates another half-point in response to the US Labor
Department's report Friday that consumer prices accelerated in
March. A 0.7 percent rise in inflation was the CPI's biggest
monthly increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The market's freefall dates to April 3, when a court decision
went against Microsoft Corp. in the software company's antitrust
case. Since then, troubles have compounded: In sympathy with
Microsoft, tech stocks across the board tumbled, the economy
continued to show signs of overheating, and investors grew
increasingly jittery as pessimism spread.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the impact of Friday's rout on the economy is
unclear. Primark's Sinai said a plunging market presents ``a
serious risk'' of recession. A decline in stocks could damage
consumer and business confidence and undermine a decade-long
economic expansion that has been fueled by both.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas Perna of Perna Associates in Richfield, Conn., said
the market's drop may preempt the need for another round of
interest-rate increases by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big things he'd been complaining about was how the
wealth effect was making the economy grow too fast,'' Perna said.
``The wealth effect works both ways.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What are investors in the Invesco Technology fund thinking now?
The fund has been up an average of 48 percent a year since 1994.
But it is down 32 percent since its high for the year on March 9.
Are they feeling poorer? Or is this just a blip and, on balance,
they still feel pretty good?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to these questions _ especially after the brutal
decline in stocks last week _ say a lot about the stock market's
impact on the economy. A lot rides on whether recent market
volatility is enough to slow what is known as the wealth effect _
and, therefore, consumer spending _ or whether the market will have
to decline a while longer to dampen consumers' profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that there was a lot of market volatility well
before the roller-coaster ride of the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the Nasdaq composite index. In 1997,
it moved 1 percent or more, up or down, from the previous day's
close on 33 percent of trading days. That was near a record at the
time, just below the 34.9 percent of 1974 and well above the 23
percent of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, volatility increased, with moves of at least 1 percent
on almost half _ 45 percent _ of trading days. In 1999 that figure
climbed again, to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year volatility is off the charts. Seventy-five
percent of the trading days have ended with moves of 1 percent or
more. There have been 23 days with moves of 3 percent or more,
already surpassing the previous annual record of 20 in 1999..
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that volatility has had much of an impact on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Rising volatility can be a signal of turning points in the
market; indeed, there were steep plunges in the Nasdaq and other
major market indexes in 1997 and 1998. Still, the Nasdaq ended up
21.6 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively, in those two years.
Last year, it rose an unprecedented 85.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the pace of consumer spending, as measured by personal
consumption expenditures, increased each year _ 3.4 percent in
1997, 4.9 percent in 1998 and 5.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis,
said that ``there is a lot of speculation that, other things being
equal, volatility will reduce the wealth effect.'' But, he added,
``I am unaware of evidence that confirms or refutes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil M. Soss, the chief United States economist at Credit Suisse
First Boston, says that when he looks at a ``three-dimensional''
view of the stock market this year, he cannot yet reach a
conclusion. The Nasdaq has seen record volatility and the Dow Jones
industrial average has bounced around a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wilshire 5000 Total Market index, which tracks most of
the stocks traded in the United States, had been much more stable,
at least until last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I say `Nothing much has happened'?'' Soss asked,
referring to the Wilshire index. ``Or should I say, `Yes, something
has happened; the volatility will make for a more cautious
consumer'?'' referring to the Nasdaq and the Dow. ``I don't think
the answer is in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the question is crucial to the outlook for
consumer spending and, therefore, to the pace of economic growth.
And that pace will decide how high the Federal Reserve has to raise
short-term interest rates in order to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   In five quarter-point moves since last June, the Fed has raised
its short-term interest rate target, the federal funds rate, to 6
percent. But the economy is still rocketing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So if volatility won't help slow down consumers, a deeper swoon
of the markets may be necessary. Prakken said the Wilshire index,
which finished the week down 9.7 percent, would have to stay where
it is, or fall further, for several quarters before it would have a
noticeable impact.
</P>
<P>
   But with the swoon in the market on Thursday and Friday, the
volatility and sharp declines might finally get the attention of
American consumers. For the year, the Nasdaq is now off 18.4
percent, the Dow 10.4 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index 7.6 percent.

   The 1964 Unisphere, the 1939 Trylon and Perisphere, and other
World's Fair collectibles just went up in value: The United States
has announced it will not participate in this summer's world's fair
for the first time in their 149-year history. Corporate America's
lack of interest in Expo 2000, to be held in Hannover, Germany, is
ironic given the global economy; the expositions have traditionally
been showcases for the achievements of industrial technology. This
year, business decided it had better ways of flashing its wares to
an inquisitive public: The Internet strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had no luck raising the $40 million it would have
taken to set up an American pavilion, even though they approached
most of the top corporations (US law allows no public money to be
used for such a venture). Instead, a modest Web page will be put on
the Internet to celebrate America's cultural achievements.
</P>
<P>
   That bodes ill for any repeat of America's own great fairs and
for their dramatic symbols. The 1939 New York World's Fair
epitomized the yearning for dramatic structures that set majestic
themes for such events. In Brussels, nearly 20 years later, the
Atomium expressed the great hopes for peaceful exploitation of
nuclear energy _ tarnished a bit in the execution. Seattle followed
with its Space Needle, New York again with the Unisphere in 1964-65
and Montreal produced Habitat, a marvelous jumble of irregularly
shaped dwellings that drew a stunning 50 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century fairs _ London's Crystal Palace in 1851, the
Philadelpia centennial fair in 1876, and Chicago's Columbian
exposition on the 400th anniversary of the ``discovery'' of
America, all celebrated strides in technology that reshaped the
world forever.
</P>
<P>
   Never again? The pace of life and of change has accelerated
still more, and the world may no longer have time to assemble
exhibits that can be outdated before they are completed. It is a
shame, as there is nothing like a world's fair to stir the
imagination and turn futuristic fantasies into warm memories of
epic grandeur.

WILD SCRAMBLE OF TRADES EXPECTED IN THE OPENING ROUND OF THE NFL
DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Psychics who populate late night television could not
accurately predict what will happen in Saturday's National Football
League draft. Let the trades, mind games and hyperbole begin.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Jets moving up, down, or sideways? Do they keep their
four first-round picks? Do they package them and make a run at
Cleveland's top selection? Or, as expected, will the Browns
finalize a contractual agreement with Penn State defensive lineman
Courtney Brown before the draft begins at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the agent for Brown, Marvin Demoff, was in
intense negotiations with the team. League officials believe that a
deal will be reached early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's deal might likely be a long-term contract that is not
drastically different from the one signed by last year's No. 1
overall pick, quarterback Tim Couch. Brown's contract is expected
to be in the seven-year, $45 million range with a signing bonus of
between $12-$13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's probable selection by Cleveland is the only thing that
seems mildly solidified. The rest of the first round is expected be
a wild scramble of trades and near-trades. The phone lines of teams
in the NFL will be burning hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of trades that have already happened is rare in our
league's history, and those trades will continue on Saturday,''
said Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager. According to a
league official, even the Giants considered a trade, speaking to
the Baltimore Ravens about their fifth pick. The Giants were
interested in acquiring Virginia running back Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the top 10 to 13 spots in the first round is
volatile,'' Accorsi continued. ``The reason why is the talent is
very good, and a lot of teams are scrambling to get into that top
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team in the Top 10, a league official said, has been
contacted about trades either from another team in the top 10, or
from teams outside of the first 10. Cleveland, Washington (2
selections), Cincinnati and Baltimore _ teams that own the first
five selections _ have all considered accepting trade deals to go
lower in the draft, only to, for now, rebuff those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Jets have dealt wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson to
Tampa Bay for two first round picks, then made another trade with
San Francisco, which means New York has the 12th, 13th, 18th and
27th picks. The Jets are clearly the draft's superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Where things stand now overall in the draft is uncertain.
Baltimore is considering staying at the fifth spot and taking
Florida wide receiver Travis Taylor with the fifth pick and either
Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis or a defensive lineman with the
10th selection. However, the Ravens have received numerous offers
from teams for the fifth pick, and may yet still trade it on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also continued to listen to trade offers Thursday
night. The Philadelphia Eagles, selecting sixth, have called
several teams about moving into the top five, but also have called
teams outside of the top 10 about moving down. What they do today
depends on what happens immediately ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, there is a feeding frenzy. Teams know there is a
scramble to move all over the draft board, and no one wants to be
left out of the mix. It is the NFL's version of musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when there is a lot of talk about how there will be a
lot of trades, nothing ends up happening,'' said Accorsi. ``But
this time where this is smoke I definitely think there is fire.''

BUSH'S INCOMPLETE HEALTH PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, April 17, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, like most Americans, believes health care should
be more than a luxury available only to those who can afford it.
But he is unwilling to devise a plan to make sure that just about
every American is covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush proposes tax credits, up to $2,000 per family, so
that working people could buy it on their own. ``We will not
nationalize our health system,'' he said. ``We will promote
individual choice. We will rely on private insurance. But make no
mistake: In my administration low-income Americans will have access
to high-quality health care.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan is less sweeping than that of former Democratic
candidate Bill Bradley, which would have spent about $38 billion to
$48 billion more a year, covered all children, and provided greater
incentives for adults to get insurance. It is also less sweeping
than Al Gore's plan, which would cover more children, offer a
federal-state plan to insure parents, and provide a drug benefit
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, moreover, supports Medical Savings Accounts, a concept
that encourages healthy people to buy high-deductible policies
instead of conventional insurance. If the healthy opt out of the
regular system, the cost of comprehensive policies will rise.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan is similar to both Democrats' in that it avoids a
role for government on the scale sought by Bill Clinton in 1994.
There is no attempt to control costs throughout the system, no
regional insurance-buying cooperatives, and none of the bureaucracy
that was essential to covering the vast majority of Americans while
controlling costs.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies that Bush proposes are better than nothing, though
$2,000 is far too low when family policies can cost $4,000 and up.
The subsidy could be increased by Congress to provide affordable
insurance for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more will remain outside the health insurance system as
long as ``individual choice'' determines coverage. Bush, soon to be
the Republican presidential nominee, has yet to face up to the
quandary of American health care: Improved access does not
guarantee that everyone in the country will get the health
insurance they need at an affordable cost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Caught in the capricious swings of a
volatile stock market, HearMe, an Internet company, has had a
remarkable ride since it went public a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $18, its stock went as high as $51.25 that day, but by
the next day it was trading as low as $36.375. Its chief executive,
Paul Matteucci, son of a butcher and a man with street-wise
sensibilities, chooses not to acknowledge the opening-day peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shot up to 51 for 10 minutes,'' he said. ``We think of the
high as $36.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that perspective helps soften the blow dealt this week.
With the Nasdaq ebbing into bear territory, HearMe's stock, at $20
a week ago, went into free fall. It closed below $12 on Thursday
and traded as low as $7.50 Friday before ending the day at $8.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that one analyst says HearMe, which makes software for
voice chat over the Internet, is clearly stronger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a climate that can alter a company's prospects in the course
of a trading day for no easily discernible reason, employees and
executives in the high-technology industry have found creative ways
to cope with _ and tune out _ what they cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   Executives must manage expectations of investors, partners and
acquisition candidates, sometimes uncertain of the company's value
from one day to the next. They must calm employees unsure whether
they will have enough for the down payment on a house and who are
besieged by job offers from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   A look inside HearMe illustrates how one Silicon Valley company,
and its rank-and-file employees, cope financially and emotionally
with being caught up in the market's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many of the company's 250 employees, working in
two buildings just down the block from Netscape at the center of
the Silicon Valley universe, simply refuse to look at the stock
price. They decline to calculate their net worth. Like a mantra,
they stress over and again how much they like their colleagues,
product and mission, as if saying it enough times will mask the
fluctuation in their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to look at the stock price until the end of the
day,'' Matteucci said. ``If I happen to see the stock price on my
browser, I try to forget it as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockwise, what matters, he insists, is how the company's shares
perform relative to its competitors'. He preaches to employees that
if they focus on ``building products for great markets,'' the stock
price will follow. And he notes that the company, which had $6
million in revenue and a $6.1 million net loss in the fourth
quarter of last year, still has $60 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said 90 percent of his employees realize that it is
pointless to be distracted by the stock price, while the other 10
percent _ ``including some very key people'' _ get to hear his own
story of youth and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   He tells them he spent eight years at Adaptec, a company that
makes PC cards, joining just after it went public at $10. The stock
languished at $5 for much of his time there, but rebounded
dramatically, and he later sold his shares at more than $200, on a
split-adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that might be worth hearing in and around the
cubicle of Nate Wright. Wright, 26, who joined the company in
December as a manager of Web content partnerships, has seen his
fortunes _ at least on paper _ fall with those of the company. Its
stock was trading in the high 30s as recently as December, but now
Wright's stock options _ the right to buy a set number of shares at
a given price, around $25 in his case _ are worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys were making fun of me for my strike price,''
Wright said, laughing, as if they were making fun of a bad haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Wright belongs to a breed of young workers who give both
lifeblood and fits to high-tech companies. They bring crucial
skills, but some feel something is wrong if they are not the next
millionaire, said Jim Schmidt, HearMe's executive vice president
for engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, at his third startup, does not hide his interest in
cashing in. While many others here play down this week's stock
slide, Wright, downing Mexican food and Mountain Dew in the
cafeteria, said, ``Yeah, I pay attention.'' John Alexander, the
human resources director, periodically deflects these concerns,
when the stock dips. He said he reminds employees that it takes
four years for employee stock options to vest fully anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain confidence among employees and investors, Matteucci
has not sold any of his 1.2 million shares, including options.
``I'd like to be in a position to sell 20,000 shares a quarter,''
he said. ``But I don't like to sell when people are watching and
it's this volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gyrations are not without material impact. For
example, HearMe has made two key acquisitions this year, and the
stock's volatility had an effect on both.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the company negotiated to acquire Resounding
Technologies, whose software lets people talk directly from PC to
PC, rather than through a server. During negotiations, HearMe's
stock dropped to $10, then started climbing. Resounding executives
would say, ``The stock rose 3 points today; what caused that?''
Matteucci recalled. ``We told them what we knew, which wasn't a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations in February and March to purchase AudioTalk,
the stock was again fluctuating. To compensate, the sides built
into the negotiations a clause to fix a rough dollar value to the
transaction, rather than a number of shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it is a little clearer why the stock is fluctuating.
During a December roller coaster ride, the stock started at 17,
rose into the mid-30s, then dropped into the 20s. But in that case,
the moves seemed tied to a new product and distributions
announcements, while the drop seemed tied largely to a falling
market, said Matt Finnick, an industry analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Finnick said HearMe was a much stronger company than it was a
year ago, when it went public as Mpath Interactive. And this week's
steep fall, he said, cannot be traced to anything it is doing
wrong. ``It's the market,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the stock falls on good news. It did so on Jan. 19,
after the company announced better-than-expected revenues. ``We
went down,'' Matteucci said, shrugging. ``I have no idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was no surprise that Friday, with Nasdaq down
almost 10 percent and HearMe losing a third of its value, he was
focused on other things. ``I haven't checked the price yet,'' he
said just after the final bell, trying to tune out the cacophony of
a cascading market. ``Do I want to know?''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Clinton has long been treated like a star by
Hollywood's movers and shakers, who have opened their gilded
pocketbooks and glamorous homes to the charismatic president.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Clinton's understudy, Al Gore, is angling to move up to
leading man, some of Tinseltown's biggest names appear ready to
shower their affection on the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton will be the main attractions Saturday night at
a Democratic Party fund-raiser in Beverly Hills hosted by David
Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the trio that
heads DreamWorks production company whose most recent movie,
``American Beauty,'' swept the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   At what DreamWorks spokesman Andy Spawn called an ``intimate
dinner for 125,'' the Democrats anticipate collecting $2.5 million,
with the entertainment industry stars and moguls shelling out
between $25,000 and $100,000 a piece to see and hear the president
and his possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   The star-studded event at the Greystone estate, a 12-acre spread
where the movie ``Ghostbusters 2'' was filmed, is an indicator that
Hollywood's affinity for Democrats has not changed all that much
this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Baucus called
the rare joint appearance by Gore and Clinton ``a symbolic passing
of the torch.'' But Baucus also played down the importance of
Hollywood dollars in the upcoming election saying, ``We enjoy
support all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Hollywood dinner, Clinton and Gore will be stumping
in Silicon Valley, helping the party raise more money from the
high-tech wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance with Gore at the DreamWorks event, however,
may also be a way of helping the vice president mend fences with
some in the entertainment industry, who were furious with the vice
president' wife, Tipper, for leading a campaign in the mid-1980s
against lewd and violent rock lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Hollywood is as comfortable with Gore as they are
with Clinton. They don't know him as well as Clinton and what they
remember about Tipper's crusade makes them uncomfortable,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate
Schools in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But Spahn said the tension between Gore and the industry is
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 15 years ago. A lot has changed since then,'' said
Spahn. ``There has been a lot of dialogue. Certainly the vice
president and Mrs. Gore have taken a very responsible approach to
the issue of violence in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood endorsements have proven a financial windfall for
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Democrats raked in $2.6 million in entertainment
and media contributions, known as ``soft money,'' or unrestricted
giving to political parties, according to a study by Common Cause.
Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg, who hosted a Democratic
congressional fund-raiser at the same location last year, forked
over a total of $238,000 to the party in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Republicans received a total of $804,220 for the
year from the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presidential campaign also scored well in the trendy
90210 Beverly Hills zip code, where he received $285,350 in
restricted campaign donations compared to $149,876 for Bush,
according to breakdown of giving from Jan. 1999 through January of
2000 prepared by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Empire mogul Hugh Hefner as well as actors Candice
Bergen, David Caruso, Jack Nicholson and producer Aaron Spelling,
who developed the steamy teen TV hit ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' all
chipped in to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans do receive their share of contributions
from Hollywood executives who believe in playing both sides of the
political fence.
</P>
<P>
   And although GOP politicians have long mocked Democrats' link to
liberal Hollywood, their presidential candidate George W. Bush last
year was well received at a cocktail reception attended by a number
of high-profile studio executives and actors, including Warren
Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Horowitz, a conservative activist in Hollywood,
said that Bush's move to the right in his primary against John
McCain dampened enthusiasm for the Texas governor among Hollywood
Republicans whom, he said, tend to be more libertarian than
socially conservative in their ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on a real roll in this town until then,'' Horowitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Khachigian, a California-based Republican consultant who
worked with McCain, said that aside from a number of outspoken
conservatives, such as Charlton Heston and Tom Sellick, he does not
expect Hollywood to cross over in large numbers to the GOP this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mostly on the left,'' he said. ``The kind of money
they have is obscene, and the big government programs with the big
taxation does not affect them and assuages their consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry who may have had past qualms about Tipper
Gore's anti-lewd lyrics campaign say the Republicans have not been
better on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, noted that in 1997 Bush approved a measure that would have
banned state investment in companies that produce objectionable
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not like Tipper is the bad guy and George Bush is the
good guy,'' said Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas amendment, aimed at curbing ``gangsta'' rap music, was
attached by a state senator to an appropriations bill that was
signed by Bush. It was later thrown out by a state court judge in
Austin who ruled that the music amendment could not be hitched to a
bill that dealt primarily with unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen and others said that many in the music and movie industry
base make their political choices on issues unrelated to their
careers and tend to favor the Democrat's positions on such issues
as abortion, gun control and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1988, when Gore first ran for president, his wife's
crusade clearly hurt him among the Hollywood set. In 1985 Tipper
Gore, upset at the music her then-teen daughter Karenna was
listening to, joined a number of spouses of lawmakers and Cabinet
officials to lobby the recording industry to place parental warning
labels on records with particularly violent or pornographic lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry and rock musicians, led by Frank Zappa,
condemned the effort, which was highlighted at a bizarre Senate
hearing, where musicians such as Dee Snider of Twisted Sister
squared off with then-senator Gore over the meaning of song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later when Gore sought the Democratic presidential
nomination a number of liberals shunned him as the backer of
censorship. Tipper, who was mocked as a prudish scold,was often
greeted cooly on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But as evidence that times have changed, Snider recently said
that he would vote for Gore, although he acknowledged his choice
had more to do with his disdain of the Republican alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And the late Zappa's widow, Gail, has been a big fan and donor
to the Democratic Party, contributing $114,000 in soft money last
year.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats benefit financially from the Hollywood backing,
it is unclear whether such high-profile support translates into
more votes either in the all important state of California or
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore adviser Bob Shrum said the splashy DreamWorks fund-raiser
was not intended to sway voters in a state and city that is
accustomed to celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that the Hollywood glamor can rub off on the
candidate, particularly if it helps him get on the local news in
the tough Southern California market, where politics generally
ranks far behind highway chases and animal stories in news
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing next to Barbra Streisand and David Geffen can help
turn out the cameras,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican political
consultant who recently worked on the McCain campaign.

 &HT;    Impromptu stops take political edge off Clinton visit to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All they expected was to see the limousine drive past.
Or maybe a wave from inside the tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   But then the big black car stopped. As a tall, gray-haired man
emerged from the back seat, a cheer erupted from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had come to Holy Innocents' Episcopal School
in north Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Molly Collins, a senior at the
1,500-student school, after shaking the president's hand. ``School
has pretty much stopped for the day. We kind of skipped class.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impromptu stop _ impromptu to the degree that Secret
Service agents had time to erect temporary plastic poles and yellow
police tape for a makeshift rope line before the president arrived
_ was just a small part of his nine-hour tour of Atlanta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton used an 11 a.m. speech to the national
Education Writers Association to highlight his support for tougher
public school standards. In an exclusive residential neighborhood
near Holy Innocents', he helped U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.)
raise $300,000 for her re-election campaign (and took an indirect
swipe at the Confederate emblem on flags in Georgia and other
Southern states.). At a hotel near Hartsfield International
Airport, he feted U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) on his 60th birthday
_ and helped him raise $500,000 in campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The extended visit reflected that Clinton's time in office is
drawing short. His remarks throughout the day sounded as though he
were delivering valedictory addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in 25 years I'm not running for
anything,'' he told the 300 people at McKinney's fund-raiser. ``And
I'm OK with it _ most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He used his speech to the writers association to review the
accomplishments of his administration. And he told McKinney's
supporters _ many of whom were black or natives of foreign
countries _ that he had tried to improve relations between people
of different ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the McKinney event that Clinton criticized the use of
Confederate emblems in state flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Atlanta, the home of more international companies than
any other American city, and we're still fighting in the South
about whether there should be a Confederate flag,'' Clinton said.
``There's something wrong with this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not specifically mention Georgia's flag, however. His
comment came after Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, who has declined to
take a position on changing the state banner, had left the event.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lewis party, Clinton recalled meeting the long-time civil
rights leader a quarter-century ago when both worked on former
President Jimmy Carter's campaign. Lewis told the then-29-year-old
Clinton stories of the civil rights marches of the '60s, including
one at Selma, Ala., where Lewis was beaten by state troopers as he
tried to cross the Edmund Pettus bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how quickly time passes,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Lewis has forgiven those who attacked him, Clinton
said, teaches him valuable lessons as he prepares to leave office.
Like Lewis, Clinton said, he hopes to forgive ``those who beat us
up, at least with words.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political purposes of his Atlanta visit, Clinton
found time to mingle with ordinary Atlantans _ at least those lucky
enough to be bystanders during his pre-arranged appearances.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the McKinney fund-raiser, at the home of a
physician and his wife, Clinton crossed the street despite a chilly
drizzle to greet several neighbors. Nine-year-old Jackson Davis
handed the president a photo of Air Force One, and Clinton
autographed it for him.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Innocents', students clad in navy blue shirts and khaki
shorts or pants lined the road. Clinton joked with one student
about his role in the school play, and shook hands with dozens of
children before getting back in his limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children will remember this forever,'' said school
librarian Barbara Berryman, standing amid a group of kindergarten
students.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Dana Tofig contributed
to this report.

FUNDS FOR FAMILY PLANNING
</HEADLINE>
 
(For release Monday, April 17, 2000) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having appeased the antiabortion movement last year in order to
win funding for the United Nations, the Clinton administration and
congressional supporters of family planning are now trying to undo
the damage. It will be difficult to wrench the egregious language
restricting the actions of family-health agencies overseas out of
this year's UN appropriations. But the administration is obligated
to repair the mess it created.
</P>
<P>
   Last year legislation to pay back some $1 billion in UN dues was
taken hostage by a small band of antiabortion zealots who insisted
that riders be attached restricting the funds. The language
prohibits nonprofit organizations receiving US funds from lobbying,
advising, or educating about abortion, even with their own money.
In other words, these groups are precluded by US law from
exercising democratic rights in their own countries. As Clinton
himself said last week in a speech urging Congress to lift the ban:
``That's not the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and many in Congress were genuinely anguished at this
devil's bargain, but they succumbed in order to achieve the crucial
goal of fully funding the nation's commitment to the UN. This year,
however, Clinton has submitted a budget restoring international
family planning efforts to 1995 levels _ $451 million _ and he is
asking that Congress appropriate the money without the riders.
</P>
<P>
   The request will not be honored easily. Already Representative
Christopher Smith of New Jersey, a chief antagonist of women's
reproductive rights, has pledged to fight what he calls ``US
subsidies to the international abortion industry.'' His rhetoric is
not just overheated, it is false. It is already law _ and has been
for almost 30 years _ that no American funds can be used to pay for
abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians wrangle, women in developing countries die
from hemorrhages in childbirth, victims of eight or nine
pregnancies by their 25th birthdays. Or they die in botched illegal
abortions. Or their babies die. The pressures of a growing world
population strain public health, the environment, even peace across
borders. To ignore such suffering is also not ``the American way.''

CLINTONS PAY $92,104 IN TAXES; GORES PAY $59,178 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising money for the down payment on their new home in
Chappaqua, N.Y., meant that President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, had to pay substantial capital-gains taxes last year, the
couple's tax return, released by the White House on Friday, showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons paid $92,104, or 22.1 percent, in federal taxes on
income of $416,039.
</P>
<P>
   Capital gains accounted for $179,849 of their income; $122,094
of this was long-term gains, on which they paid a tax of $24,419.
The short-term gains were taxed as ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   The couple put down more than a third of a million dollars on
their new home, said Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman. The
house was bought a few months before Hillary Clinton formally
announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported income of
$240,930 and paid $59,178, or 24.5 percent, in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee
for president, plans to release a synopsis of his income-tax return
on Monday and expects to release a finished tax return in the fall,
said his spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four years, the Clintons paid more in
federal taxes than the law requires, the result of their decision
four years ago to take as income the royalties from Hillary
Clinton's book ``It Takes a Village'' and then to give away the
after-tax value. Hillary Clinton received $20,214 in royalties in
1999, on which she paid $2,856 in self-employment taxes to cover
Social Security and Medicare taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Clintons have given $937,358 to children's and
health charities since 1996, $109,000 less than they could have if
they had given ownership of the book to a donor-advised or
donor-directed fund at a community foundation. The difference went
to income taxes and to self-employment taxes, which will increase
Hillary Clinton's Social Security income when she is over 65 by
about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton followed a different approach with her second
book, ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy,'' about letters that children had
written to her family's pets. She gave the copyright to the
National Parks Foundation in 1998, which meant that all of the
royalties flow untaxed to this charity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons gave $39,200 to charity last year, of which $17,358
was the net royalties from the Village book, $12,000 came from a
``pin money'' fund for first ladies and $9,842 came from their
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton earned $200,000 as president, the couple had $6,008
in interest, $11,396 in dividends, $20,214 in royalties and
$179,849 in capital gains, and received a deduction for half of
Hillary Clinton's self-employment tax, giving them an adjusted
gross income of $416,039. The couple also received $9,917 in
tax-exempt interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons declared themselves residents of Arkansas, as the
tax law allows, avoiding the much higher income taxes imposed by
the District of Columbia. They paid $18,850 in Arkansas state taxes
and $13,081 in property taxes on their Chappaqua home, which they
bought in November.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the size of their deductions and the components of
their income, the Clintons also had to pay $4,943 in alternative
minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   That tax, enacted in 1969, was intended to make sure all
high-income Americans paid at least some federal income tax, but
because it has not been fully adjusted to reflect inflation, it now
applies to people making as little as $28,000 annually, and 1,800
people last year still paid no federal income tax despite an income
of over $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' tax return, which listed them as residents of
Tennessee, showed that they own far fewer assets than the Clintons.
In addition to Gore's salary of $175,400, the couple reported
taxable interest of $1,267, but no dividends or tax-exempt
interest. The Gores reported $29,260 in capital gains and $20,371
in income from renting real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also received $16,457 in royalties on the reissue of his
1992 book ``Earth in the Balance,'' on which he has built an image
as an environmentalist. He took $2,468 in unspecified expenses,
reducing the taxable proceeds to $13,989.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores gave $15,000 to charities and listed areas of giving
like illnesses, religious organizations and educational
institutions, but did not specify whether any of the donations were
to environmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Gores gave $15,197 to charity, but in 1997 they gave
just $353, less than 0.2 percent of their income, prompting intense
criticism. In 1996 the couple gave away $35,530, all but $530 of it
royalties from a book.

COMMENTARY: WHY NOT SPEAK OUT? 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Serbs captured three U.S. soldiers during the
Kosovo war a year ago, President Clinton warned President Milosevic
of Yugoslavia: ``Make no mistake _ America takes care of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fine sentiment. But the president has signally failed to
apply it in a case that should nag at his and the country's
conscience. It is the case of Lori Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, a 30-year-old American, is being held in an isolation
cell in Peru _ a cell without light, heat or running water. ``She
has been in prison four years, four months, ten days today,'' her
father, Mark Berenson, said when I met her parents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian government of Alberto Fujimori says that Berenson
helped the Tupac Amaru terrorist movement: a charge that she firmly
denies. She was convicted of ``treason'' _ against a country of
which she is not a citizen _ after what no civilized society would
regard as a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers wearing ski masks to conceal their identities
conducted the proceeding. Berenson was not allowed to call
witnesses or testify herself. She was sentenced to life in prison
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never participated in the planning of a violent act
...'' she wrote to human rights groups. ``I do not believe in
violence, and it would not be possible for me to participate in
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does believe _ a left-wing view of poverty and misery
in Peruvian society _ she does not conceal. Indeed, her outspoken
statement of those views played into the hands of Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   When she was arrested, in November 1995, she was held without
access to the outside world for 39 days, the last 11 in a cell with
a naked, desperately ill woman who was given no medical care.
Suddenly Berenson was brought out, put in front of television
cameras and told to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in angry tones, in Spanish, she said: ``Nobody can deny
that in Peru there is much injustice ... If it is a crime to worry
about the sub-human conditions in which the majority of this
population lives, then I will accept my punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori used the video clip to paint Berenson as a terrorist _
and an interfering American. One of his popular achievements as
president has been the crushing of terrorist movements.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot know for sure whether Berenson conspired with the Tupac
Amaru or, as she says, simply interviewed some members _ names
unknown to her _ as a freelance journalist. What is beyond doubt is
that her trial lacked any semblance of due process of law. Amnesty
International called it a ``parody of justice.'' Javier Valle
Riestra, a noted constitutional lawyer, was Peru's prime minister
until he condemned the Berenson trial methods and said she should
be pardoned. He did not last long in the Fujimori government after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The flagrantly illegitimate trial makes Clinton's passive
posture on the case puzzling. When 180 members of the House urged
him last year to secure her release by carrying out a statute that
calls for U.S. action on behalf of Americans held improperly
abroad, he replied only that he was seeking a ``just and
expeditious solution.'' He has not condemned the lack of due
process at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, who knows about unjust imprisonment firsthand,
signed a copy of his book for Berenson: ``To Lori, Best Wishes &AMP;
Admiration. God Bless.'' But he has not spoken out against the
nature of her trial.
</P>
<P>
   The election in Peru this week demonstrated, in two ways, why
the Berenson case demands U.S. action. Fujimori used smears, dirty
tricks and ballot-rigging. But when other Latin countries and the
United States put on real pressure, he held off from giving himself
a first-round victory. Pressure works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of law, the innuendoes in the election were there in
Lori's case all along,'' her mother, Rhoda Berenson, said to me.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was a professor of statistics at Baruch College in
New York for 30 years, her mother a professor of physics at Nassau
Community College for 25. Both have given up their jobs, their
normal lives and their savings to campaign for Lori Berenson's
freedom. Every two weeks or so, one of them flies 8,000 miles to
speak with Lori for an hour through a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally believe my daughter,'' Mr. Berenson said. ``One day,
God willing, you'll see for yourself.''

CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON HMO
APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to rewrite and to expand by 350 words) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a breakthrough, House and Senate negotiators
said on Friday that they had reached a tentative agreement on an
appeals process for patients denied care by health maintenance
organizations, a major issue in legislation to define patients'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, patients could obtain ``an independent
medical review'' of any decision in which an HMO denied care or
coverage on the ground that a particular service was not medically
necessary or was experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could also obtain an independent review whenever an HMO
concluded that a particular item or service was not a covered
benefit. The review might be done by lawyers if it involved only
the interpretation of an insurance contract. But it would be done
by doctors if it involved a medical question _ whether, for
example, a surgical procedure was purely cosmetic or was needed to
correct a medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not resolve several other contentious issues
still before the conference committee negotiators, but it is the
most significant agreement Democrats and Republicans have had on
the patients' rights legislation to date.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest such issue is whether patients should have a federal
right to sue HMOs for injuries caused by the delay or denial of
care. But negotiators said that a well-designed appeal process, by
resolving disputes promptly, could reduce the number of lawsuits.
Moreover, the agreement suggests that the conferees have begun to
develop a fragile sense of trust and cooperation that may help them
resolve the stickier issues.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and HMOs, foes in the debate over patients' rights,
reacted favorably to the agreement. In separate interviews, Dr.
Thomas R. Reardon, president of the American Medical Association,
and Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, said they were encouraged by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' Reardon said. Ignagni
said Congress ``appears to be calling for a system driven by
scientific evidence and the best medical practice,'' not just by
the opinion of a patient's treating physician.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the
conference committee, said, ``This is a substantive, significant
agreement that will guarantee patients have access to an
independent medical review if a plan denies them health care.''
Under the agreement, Nickles said, patients in ``every
employer-sponsored plan in the country'' _ 125 million people _
would have the right to an independent review of health plan
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks of negotiations, Republicans and Democrats from
the House and the Senate issued a detailed summary of what they
called a ``bipartisan bicameral agreement'' on the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Patients would pursue their appeals by going to an ``independent
external review entity,'' which could be a unit of a medical school
or a nonprofit corporation. This entity would then select one or
more doctors to do the actual reviews. The doctors would have to be
experts in a field relevant to the patient's case.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cautioned that it was an agreement in principle, a
conceptual agreement, to be translated into legislative language
over the spring recess. Lawmakers are still haggling over the
criteria to be used in deciding whether the denial of a claim can
be appealed. But Democrats confirmed that the conferees had made
substantial progress on one of the most important provisions of the
legislation to define patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states have laws or regulations that require managed
care plans to have some type of ``external review'' procedure so
patients can challenge a denial of care or coverage. In general,
HMOs, state officials and consumer groups say the appeal procedures
have worked well. Reviewers rule in favor of patients in about half
the cases, for insurers in the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say the appeal procedures can raise the standard of
medical care, by requiring doctors to heed the views of outside
experts when deciding whether a particular treatment is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Nickles and liberal Democrats like Sen.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts found they could agree on the
proposition that medical decisions should be made by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky., a member of the conference committee
and a family doctor, described the agreement as ``a major
bipartisan breakthrough.'' Under the agreement, Fletcher said, ``if
your HMO denies the care you need, you will be able to appeal, thus
ensuring that medical decisions are made by physicians, not by
insurance bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets forth a wide range of factors that would have
to be considered by medical reviewers. Specifically, it says, their
decisions would be based on a patient's medical condition and
medical records; ``valid, relevant scientific evidence and clinical
evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature''; and the
consensus of experts on what treatments were appropriate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agreement includes these provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _Patients could appeal if the denial of a benefit created a
significant risk to a patient's life or health, or if the value of
the benefit exceeded ``a significant threshold'' to be specified by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   _A patient filing an appeal could be required to pay a $50 fee.
The money would be refunded if the patient prevailed. Low-income
people would not have to pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   _The Department of Health and Human Services would set standards
to ensure that reviewers had no conflicts of interest and no
financial incentives to rule in a particular way.
</P>
<P>
   _The decisions of independent medical reviewers would be binding
on HMOs and other health plans. The plans could not appeal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president of Empire Blue Cross and Blue
Shield in New York, said his company had been allowing patients to
appeal the denial of health care services for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal challenges to Empire have substantially decreased over
the last few years,'' Stocker said. ``I'd like to think that's
partly because of the external review process, which gives patients
a sense of assurance.''

   Dueling With Dollars (or Francs, at the Least) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France's two battling billionaires are at it again. Like boys
boasting the better stamp collection, Bernard Arnault, the chairman
of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and his archrival, Francois
Pinault, who owns the Au Printemps department stores, have a
history of wanting what the other covets. Last year, Pinault won
their fight for control of Gucci. Also last year, when Pinault
plunked down $1 billion for Christie's, Arnault bought the smaller,
but still fine auction house Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   So few people were surprised last week when Arnault announced
that he was paying $3.8 million for the exquisite French art
magazine Connaissance des Arts. The main attraction for Arnault?
Maybe that Pinault also coveted it. But then the two have also
faced off over prized collectibles. In 1995, in a legendary bidding
war, they competed at the Paris auction house Drouot for a
magnificent 18th-century secretary in Japanese lacquer by one of
the great makers of the age, Bernard van Risenburgh. That time,
Arnault won, too, for roughly $1 million.

   An Economist in Demand &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in six years, Paul Krugman, economist and
author, is changing universities, joining Princeton and leaving the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I am surprised at myself
that I am doing this,'' Krugman said. ``My wife and I did not want
to make a change now, but there was the offer on the table, and we
asked ourselves, `Would our lives be a little easier?'''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, 47, will have a joint appointment as a professor in the
economics department and at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. His
wife, Robin Wells, 41, also an economist, will do research at
Princeton in the theory of the firm. Krugman is a columnist for The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, he will teach three courses every two semesters _
half his load at MIT. His appointment, effective this summer,
carries the same salary, he said, as at MIT, between $150,000 and
$200,000 a year. Wells will also have a lighter load, but roughly
the same five-figure salary as at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman's parents recently moved to a retirement community near
Princeton, and being closer to them was one reason for his move. He
is their only child. The Krugmans left MIT for Stanford in 1994,
then returned in 1996. &QL;

University of Arkansas: Move any football games back from Little
Rock, my hometown, to Fayetteville, your more remote hometown, and
I won't let you play with my jets any more.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Razorbacks have divided their games between
Little Rock and Fayetteville. The costs of renovating the
Fayetteville stadium prompted the school to move about a game a
year back from Little Rock to Fayetteville, effective this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephens says that moving even a game a year dashes his own
plans for fixing up the Little Rock stadium. No longer will
Stephens underwrite the post-game shows that supplement the coach's
salary, nor will his firm's six jets ferry coaches on recruiting
missions. As Stephens put it, ``The whole level of our support for
the Razorback program is up for review right now.''

   The best place to find businesspeople to support repairs to
Versailles, where Louis XIV's gardens were blasted by storms last
Christmas? Try New York. And so last week more than 100 guests
including Richard and Kathy Hilton (as in the hotels); Lawrence
Herbert, chief executive of Pantone Inc. and his wife, Michele; and
the investor Peter Price and his wife, Judy, raised several hundred
thousand dollars to mend the estate, as well as to keep up Claude
Monet's Giverny. At the Carlyle hotel, this slice of mostly
American royalty was welcomed by Prince and Princess Michael of
Kent, sipped vintage Taittinger in the Versailles Room, then dined
in the Trianon Room.

organizer, who grew up at Versailles, where her stepfather was
curator.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department Friday asked an appeals
court in Atlanta to lift an emergency injunction and give federal
law-enforcement officials the power to reunite Elian Gonzalez with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal court cancels an order issued on Thursday that
blocked the child's transfer, the government will be free take him
from his Miami relatives and allow the father to return home to
Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   The swirl of legal maneuvering took place as hope for a
settlement dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Elian's Miami relatives showed no sign that they
would soften their determination to keep the boy even as
immigration officials wrote to Lazaro Gonzalez, the child's
great-uncle, reminding him that his legal authority over the child
ended on Thursday at 2 p.m. when he was ordered to take Elian to
authorities at an airport north of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a mood of grim resolve replaced the
disappointment over Attorney General Janet Reno's fruitless trip to
Miami on Wednesday to try to talk the relatives into giving up the
boy. Officials said that Reno was at last resigned to taking the
step she had hoped to avoid: a tactical law-enforcement operation
to remove the child from Miami forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Reno had quietly met law-enforcement
officials in Washington and Miami to discuss the operation.
</P>
<P>
   They said she alone would choose the timing and nature of the
action, adding that it was likely to be carried out using a minimum
of force at a time of the day when demonstrators were not likely to
be massed in the streets of the Little Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said it was possible that Reno would delay a
tactical operation until next week, when there would be fewer
people available to take part in protests than on Saturday or
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it is clear that there is no injunction, the
government will move to implement its enforcement action to enforce
our order,'' an immigration official said Friday. ``It seems clear
that the relatives have no intention of working with us on a
cooperative agreement to turn over the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, downpours reduced the number of demonstrators outside
the Gonzalez house from the thousands who marched in the streets on
Thursday to about 150 people, some of whom sang songs about Elian
during their soggy vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed its brief with the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. A judge on the panel had
issued a temporary order on Thursday, which prevented the
government from transferring Elian to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and blocked the boy's return with his father to Cuba.
Gonzalez is now waiting in Washington for a reunion with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief said, ``It is very important to
Elian's long-term well-being that Elian be transferred to his
father's care as as soon as possible, that the transfer be
unambiguous, that his care-givers since his arrival in the United
States prepare him for and participate in the transfer in a
supportive manner and that the transfer occur at a neutral
location.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that that Reno and the immigration commissioner,
Doris Miessner, ``have gone to extraordinary lengths'' to obtain
the cooperation of Elian's Miami relatives in the last week. But,
the legal paper argued, the relatives had refused to obey lawful
government directives, like the order to hand Elian over to
authorities at the Opa-Locka airport north of Miami by the Thursday
afternoon deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's filing said that if the relatives
surrendered the child the government would use its authority to
keep Elian in the United States while the appellate court
considered the relatives' appeal of a decision by a federal
district judge in Miami who ruled that the government could allow
the child to return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that Gonzalez had agreed, in a letter sent on
Thursday to the Justice Department, to remain in the United States
for the appeal _ so long as he is given custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate legal action Friday, a lawyer for the relatives
asked a federal district judge in Washington to prohibit the boy's
return to Cuba unless government officials can certify that the
government of Fidel Castro would not violate Elian's human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Henry H. Kennedy Jr., postponed consideration of the
matter pending the outcome of the legal action before the appeals
court in Atlanta. A Justice Department official said the legal
action would have no bearing on the custody battle over the boy.
``Legally, the official said, ``this is no issue.''

ACCORD IN CONGRESS ON HELPING AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 500 words. Eliminates one byline.)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate leaders have reached broad
agreement on a bill to give African and Caribbean countries
wide-ranging trade benefits intended to help their flagging
economies by opening new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, R-Miss., personally intervened Thursday night to resolve
differences that had deadlocked the measure for months. Left
unresolved, the impasse could have imperiled a landmark accord to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges that the House is
scheduled to vote on next month.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators still have to work out many details
in the bill, which would reduce or eliminate tariffs and quotas on
a wide range of goods made in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters voiced confidence that the House and Senate would
approve the bill when Congress reconvenes early next month. Last
year, the Senate approved the bill, 76-19, after the House had
passed it, 234-163.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton strongly supports the measure, which would be
the first major trade-promotion agreement enacted in the United
States since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, a law
that established duty-free commerce among Canada, Mexico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a win-win proposition for the United States and
for our friends in Africa and the Caribbean Basin,'' Clinton said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free benefits on
apparel and textiles to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries
that will be extended to 48 African nations. The House had not
included the Caribbean in its bill mainly because lawmakers from
textile states and those with many union constituents argued that
exports from that region would threaten American jobs. The American
Textile Manufacturers Institute said Friday that the deal could
harm 600,000 workers in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate dropped a requirement that limited duty-free status
to clothing made with fabric, thread or yarn from the United
States. But in a concession to textile makers, the agreement
initially caps the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of
textile imports. That cap grows to 3.5 percent over eight years, to
encourage foreign investment in fledgling African markets.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest African countries would be eligible for duty-free
treatment with no restrictions for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure argue that it would increase economic
growth on a continent where U.S. trade is relatively small. Last
year, American merchandise exports to Africa totaled $6.7 billion,
while imports amounted to $13.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican leaders worked out the major sticking points
Thursday night. But the deal still has to be formally approved by
negotiators from each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement marks a significant milestone for a strong and
meaningful trade mechanism in the African and Caribbean Basin
regions,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the Ways and
Means Committee, which oversees trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
committee, said: ``This bill will make a significant difference in
the lives of millions of Africans. It will create jobs in Africa
and jobs in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that multinational corporations would exploit
African workers and that the compromise failed to address crucial
issues like debt relief and AIDS in Africa. ``This bill is worse
than no bill at all,'' said Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., D-Ill., who
opposed the original House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Democrats who supported the House bill, like Jim
McDermott of Washington and William J. Jefferson of Louisiana,
grumbled that the compromise might fall short of what they could
accept.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant, because both legislators have indicated
their support for the China trade deal hinged on a satisfactory
outcome for the Africa measure, which they say has been receiving
short shrift from the White House and congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nailing down an acceptable Africa bill could swing three to five
critical Democratic votes for the China measure, said Rep. Robert
T. Matsui, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, anticipating dissent from textile-state senators, strongly
endorsed the deal, saying, ``These are free-trade provisions that
will help business and industry in America, everything from cotton
to retail to textiles to yarn.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision, to create a mechanism to retaliate against unfair
trade practices committed against the United States, was included
as a favor to Carl H. Lindner, an Ohio executive and big political
fund-raiser whose Chiquita Brands International is locked in a
trade war with Europe over bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision for American garment makers, including Fruit
of the Loom, a big political donor to both Republican and
Democratic causes, would cut the cost of manufacturing apparel in
the Caribbean with yarn and fabric from the United States.

   VIENNA, Austria _ Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria
criticized on Friday a lawsuit filed against the government and 80
of the country's leading companies by lawyers representing
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks $18 billion for former slave laborers under the
Nazis and for people whose property was confiscated after the Nazi
annexation of Austria in 1938. Schuessel said the amount of payment
should be determined by a compensation fund being created by his
center-right government, one that will not address the issue of
stolen property.

H&AMP;R BLOCK TELLS CLIENTS ABOUT TAX-SOFTWARE GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block sent overnight letters to 3,080 customers on Friday,
warning them that income-tax payments that they authorized the
Internal Revenue Service to take from their bank accounts would not
be made, because of a software error.
</P>
<P>
   The affected taxpayers must mail their payments to the IRS,
which is reviewing its records to determine whether to waive late
fees or penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Those affected filed their federal income-tax returns
electronically, using the company's Tax Cut software or its online
version. They owe the Treasury $1,000 or more, which was to be
debited from their bank accounts, said Gene Goldenberg, senior vice
president for software and e-commerce at Block, which is based in
Kansas City, Mo. About 18 million taxpayers use Block software or
tax preparers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software read the comma in amounts of $1,000 or more as
the end of the line,'' Goldenberg said, ``so if you owed one
thousand in taxes, only $1 was taken from your bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would pay any penalties or interest that the
Internal Revenue Service assessed these customers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS asked Block for the Social Security numbers of the
affected taxpayers so it could flag the accounts to review whether
late fees and penalties should be waived, Goldenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dealt with every single person affected,'' Goldenberg
said, sending each one both e-mail and an overnight package that
included a stamped envelope for mailing the payment. ``There have
been similar problems with software in the past, and we have worked
with the IRS, and they have rarely, if ever, penalized anyone if
there was a problem with the software.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, in a statement, said affected taxpayers should mail a
check and include the letter from Block that came in the overnight
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Tax forms and payments must be postmarked by April 17 except in
parts of upstate New York and New England, where the deadline is
April 18 because Monday is Patriot's Day, a holiday in
Massachusetts, where those taxpayers file their returns.
</P>
<P>
   Block learned of the problem on Tuesday from a customer whose
bank account was tapped for only $1 on April 3, Goldenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fixed the problem, and anyone who files now and
authorizes the IRS to debit their account on a specific day will
have the full amount paid,'' Goldenberg said.

VARGAS TO RISK IBF TITLE, UNBEATEN RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LAS VEGAS _ We'll know a lot more about Fernando Vargas after
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated junior middleweight from Oxnard has had an
impressive career so far. He won the IBF championship at 21 _ the
youngest to do so _ and has defended three times.
</P>
<P>
   However, he hasn't faced an opponent like Ike Quartey, his
opponent tonight at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, from Ghana, Africa, is one of the most feared fighters
on the planet. He's quick and strong, he has a left jab that would
make Larry Holmes jealous, he's as fierce as they come and he's
experienced. In other words, he's the type of opponent who could
make or break a young fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one came up to me and asked whether or not I wanted to
fight him,'' Vargas said. ``!ital!I wanted to fight him. I feel I
can beat this kind of guy. I have the skills, the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take fights like this, you have to take risks if
you want to be a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas (18-0, with 17 knockouts) would seem to have significant
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey (34-1-1, 29 KOs) has fought only once _ against Oscar De
La Hoya in February of last year _ in 2 years. His focus has been
on his business interests in the capital city of Accra, not on
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   What has Vargas been doing? He's had a career: All of his fights
have taken place in that time span.
</P>
<P>
   No one can blame Quartey, 30, for the inactivity. Scheduled
fights with Pernell Whitaker, Felix Trinidad and De La Hoya fell
through during that period, although he ended up fighting and
losing a close decision to De La Hoya. Still, one wonders how it
will affect the former welterweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey dismisses the issue, pointing to a strong performance
against De La Hoya after a 14-month hiatus. Even Vargas' camp has
downplayed it, saying repeatedly that they expect a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   However, they lick their chops in more candid moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obvious advantage, !ital!too obvious,'' said Eduardo
Garcia, Vargas' trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas also might have a physical edge: This will be Quartey's
first fight at 154 pounds, at which Vargas has fought his entire
career. Quartey dismissed that issue, too, saying he has had
difficulty making 147 and will be stronger _ and better _ at 154.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned that De La Hoya, a 147 pounder, put Quartey
down twice and wondered whether the heavier Vargas might be even
more powerful than his Los Angeles-area rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Quartey said. ``I think I'll be stronger
than Vargas at 154.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's principal advantage is his experience.
</P>
<P>
   He has fought and beaten Oba Carr and Vince Phillips, drawn with
rugged Jose Luis Lopez and lost to De La Hoya. Vargas' best
opponents were Yory Boy Campas and Ronald ``Winky'' Wright, a
talented left-hander who lost a disputed majority decision to
Vargas in the champion's last fight in December.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot help but to think of the Trinidad-David Reid fight in
March, in which Trinidad, moving up to 154, pummeled the young,
overmatched Olympic teammate of Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey predicted that ``we're in for the same thing'' tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has he fought?'' Quartey said. ``He hasn't fought anyone.
. . . Oscar is better than he is. He fought better fighters, he's
better, quicker. He's far better than Vargas.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Vargas scoffs at such a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   He's coping well with ``personal problems'' he said hindered his
performance against Wright, has pushed his assault case aside for
now and really !ital!has never been in better shape: He hired a
personal trainer and has redesigned his body.
</P>
<P>
   To him, that all adds up to a victory and matchup with Trinidad
later this year that could define his career and net him a lot more
than the $1.35 million (to Quartey's $1.25 million) he'll make
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives me? Superstardom,'' Vargas said. ``That's what I
want. And this fight can give it to me.

RESISTANCE TO RETURNING LONG CENSUS FORM IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing concerns in Congress that the questions in
this year's census are intrusive, Census Bureau officials said
Friday that they saw new, worrying signs that many people were
refusing to complete and return the longer version of the form.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's latest figures show that 65 percent of all
households that received the short version of the form had returned
it, compared with 51 percent of those that received the longer
version.
</P>
<P>
   That 14-percentage-point gap differs markedly from the results
of the 1990 census, when the gap was only six points. In 1990,
after households that did not return the forms were visited, the
gap closed to 4.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   The long form, which has 53 questions, is mailed to one in every
six households. It seeks data on a variety of subjects, including
income, education and disabilities. The short form has only eight
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials did not draw a direct connection between the
shortfall in households completing the long form and the recent
comments of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have suggested that the
questions in the form are intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate passed a resolution urging that people who
refuse to answer particular questions on the census not be
prosecuted, though it was doubtful that anyone would be charged
with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is concern among census officials that the privacy
debate might lead some people to refuse to fill out the long form.
</P>
<P>
   The results compiled from the long forms are considered vital to
both the government and private companies. Data from the long form
is also used in developing key economic indicators, including the
Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the long form was a major blemish on what
otherwise was a good week for the Census Bureau. Earlier this week,
census officials announced that the overall mail return rate for
census forms had reached 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong 62 percent,'' said Kenneth W. Prewitt, the
census director. ``I think we're in reach of getting to 65 percent
before we close down this part of the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If that trend holds, census officials will have made good on
their desire to halt the long-term decline in mail-back response
rates that had dropped to 65 percent in 1990 from 83 percent in
1970, the first year the forms were mailed.

TIME TO REACH FOR THE ASPIRIN, OR THE PHONE?  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.J., Calif.)   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not a prerequisite, but to persevere as an investor in
technology stocks these days, it helps to have some masochistic
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   No, wild swings in the prices of companies with four-letter
stock symbols are not new. But the speed with which the current
decline has occurred, and the wide, deep swath it has cut, have
made the slide in the Nasdaq market over the last month
particularly painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks that were way overvalued are giving that up, and that
is appropriate,'' said Lise Beyer, director of Internet/Net media
research at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``But others that are
generating cash are getting hammered. We are throwing the baby out
with the bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say that markets, while usually efficient, are often
not rational. And the irrationality currently on display in
technology stocks has created pockets of opportunity for the right
kind of investor.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody considering bottom-fishing in the suddenly chilly waters
should take into account a couple of none-too-reassuring factors.
Foremost among them is that at these levels, many technology stocks
still carry major downside risk. Even if the market is at, or near,
its bottom, a rebound may take months or longer to get under way.
</P>
<P>
   And it is also a good time to remember that because the tide is
not necessarily flowing in your favor, picking high-quality stocks
_ not the cheapest ones _ makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stocks are really beaten up, but you can come back to
them because they have really good growth stories that are
intact,'' said Kevin Landis, portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds,
a $6.2 billion, technology-focused fund family.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten up might understate the case. Many of these stocks have
been flogged raw.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that from its March 10 peak, the Nasdaq composite index
is down 34.3 percent, a decline that comes close to matching the
slide that occurred in the late summer and early fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That decline masks (italics)really(end italics) deep holes in
segments of the Internet space, as well as biotechnology.
E-commerce stocks aren't worth mentioning: they were pummeled in
January and have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Three equity trusts, called Holdrs, introduced early last month
by Merrill Lynch, are indicative of the extent of the decline. The
trusts, which are traded on the American Stock Exchange, are
baskets of specific kinds of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Since it peaked at $111.625 on March 11, the Internet Holdr
consisting of business-to-business stocks has declined by more than
69 percent. Merrill's Internet infrastructure Holdr has lost 62
percent of its value since its peak on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet architecture Holdr _ a basket that includes big
companies like Cisco Systems, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell
Computer _ has done the best of the three. That group peaked on
March 27. Since then it has declined by just over 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one strategy would be to buy one or more of the
Holdrs, or a technology sector fund for that matter, and hope for
the best. But that means forfeiting the opportunity to cherry-pick
the stocks that are likely to bounce back strongest from the
technology meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is down, and down big,'' said Paul Cook, co-manager
of the Munder NetNet fund. ``When that happens and things bottom
and start to come back, the companies that outperform tend to be
the better companies, the ones with profits.''
</P>
<P>
   David G. Dietze, president of PointView Financial Services, a
Summit, N.J. money management firm, said the strategy of buying
blue-chip technology stocks that have been pulled down along with
the rest is not only sound, but one that he follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was buying Intel on Wednesday, and Cisco,'' he said. ``And I
would still buy Oracle and Sun Microsystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the established companies she follows, Beyer said companies
like Yahoo, Intuit and America Online are ripe for a turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies that have fundamentally good businesses,''
she said. ``It seems like they are due for a bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these companies _ and the rest of the technology
group _ could fall further. Some portfolio managers are in no rush
to buy stocks right now. ``We have been thinking all along that it
would take four to six weeks to digest the run-up we had from early
February to the middle of March,'' said Dennis McKechnie, who
manages the Pimco Innovation fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on how much more we have to go on the
down side,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his fund has been selling more stock than it has bought
over the past week. Among the stocks it shed was Vignette, a
business-to-business software company. But McKechnie said he had
been adding to positions in cell phone vendors and semiconductor
manufacturers, buying companies like Nokia, Qualcomm, Micron
Technologies and Applied Materials.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case to be made, of course, that despite the steep
slide in many of these stocks, valuations are still very high.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at PaineWebber,
reiterated that point on Wednesday. In a note to clients, he said a
group of stocks he calls the ``new new industrials'' _ a collection
that includes Internet infrastructure companies like Exodus
Communications and Verisign, business-to-business companies like
Ariba and Internet Capital Group and Internet architecture concerns
like Ciena and Juniper Networks _ are still overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new new industrials could fall by another 33 percent
before even aggressive assumptions would put their valuations on a
par with established large-capitalization technology stocks,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, said the aftershocks from the current slide could last
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like it is going to be a V-shaped bottom,'' he
said. ``We had a correction in the Internet stocks last summer, and
in biotechs in 1992. But this time the enthusiasm infected so many
areas that when it ended and came apart, a whole lot of people got
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Murphy said he has been buying little pieces of
biotechnology companies in recent days. ``Start with the bigger
names like Biogen, which has come down pretty sharply,'' he said.
``But these stocks are so volatile, they could be down another 20
percent over the next couple of weeks.''

BROKERS FIND RISK IN RIDING A WAVE

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the new economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Once-stodgy financial firms have jumped onto the technology
wave, adding an extra element of risk and unpredictability to their
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the high-yielding havens they once were for investors
fleeing a downturn, the biggest banks are now susceptible to sharp
reversals _ even without a sudden change in interest rates. And the
fortunes of the biggest securities firms, long seen as a weather
vane for the overall stock market, are now clearly tied to the
gyrations of the most volatile technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is treating the brokers different than other
financials, like insurance companies or banks,'' said Jeff Morris,
who manages the Invesco Financial Services fund in Denver. ``It is
treating the brokers as a proxy for the IPO market for tech
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of March, he added, other financials seem to be
``lumped in with the old-economy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That divergence has been especially pronounced on the Nasdaq's
darkest days. Last week, when the Nasdaq composite sank more than
25 percent, shares of major Wall Street firms also plunged, while
bank stocks held up well or, in a few cases, rose.
</P>
<P>
   Among the securities firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped
$16.8125 for the week, or 20 percent, to $67.75. Goldman Sachs fell
$19.75, or 19.3 percent, to $82.75.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading underwriters of initial public offerings and
other stock sales by technology companies, Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs have gained the most from the Internet stock boom _
and they stand to lose the most if it is ending. Investors are
starting to worry that earnings estimates for the brokerage sector
were built on optimistic assumptions about a nonstop bull market
for new issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the quarter's business was already in the books,''
said Richard Strauss, an analyst who follows financial stocks for
Goldman Sachs. ``But from this point a lot will depend on what
happens to Nasdaq over the course of the next week.'' Still, he has
a 12-month price target on the stock of $95.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street firms start reporting disappointing earnings,
said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, ``it would be
the first time in almost a decade that the brokers would show
notable deterioration in earnings momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   But major investment banks and brokerage firms are not the only
financial stocks that are tethered to the Internet sector. Much of
Citigroup's recent profit gain has been provided by its Salomon
Smith Barney securities unit. Chase Manhattan, one of the nation's
biggest commercial banks, derives a growing share of its revenue
from underwriting technology stock issues through its Chase/H&AMP;Q
securities unit and from investing in private companies through its
venture capital arm, Chase Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Connections to the new economy have weighed on the shares of
those companies, while the prices of smaller, more traditional
banks have been rising from depressed levels. ``In the last four
weeks or so, the banks have had a very good bounce off their lows,
most visibly the regional banks that were underperforming,''
Kraushaar said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the fuel for that rally has been ``money looking for a
home, trying to find a bit of a defensive play,'' Kraushaar said.
But he has been warning investors that the bank-stock rally may not
last long, because it has been driven more by the relative safety
of bank stocks that were trading at 8 or 10 times earnings than by
fundamental improvements in the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who considers himself a growth investor, does not own
many bank stocks. Those he does own are either broadly diversified,
like Citigroup, or dominate market niches.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Bank of New York, for example, for its efficient and
profitable securities-processing business. His other favorites
include Charles Schwab, for its combination of Internet-based
brokerage and a national branch network.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pounding the table for regional banks, Kraushaar has
been recommending Chase and Citigroup for the very reasons that
those stocks have become riskier: He thinks that they can use their
huge balance sheets to finance further incursions into Wall
Street's traditional businesses, which he believes will adapt
quickly to shifts in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   He says Chase and Citigroup, which closed on Friday at $78.875
and $58, respectively, can hit $100 and $75 in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential investment-banking business out
there in old-economy industries,'' Kraushaar said.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks essentially act as efficient fee-seeking
missiles. Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said that for much of last year there was a strong correlation
between the stocks of Wall Street firms and the consumer commerce
companies that were popping up over the Internet. When the fever
for those business-to-consumer ventures died down, the brokerage
stocks started moving in rhythm with the new hot segment _
business-to-business Internet companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The correlation seems to be between the brokerage stocks and
the narrow segment that's dominating the underwriting backlog,''
Solotar said. ``Last year, that was B-to-C, now it's B-to-B.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as investors keep pouring money into some sector of the
new economy, investment banks will benefit from underwriting fees
and trading commissions, analysts said. The biggest threat to
earnings? An economic slowdown that snuffs demand for stocks and
dampens trading activity.

CONSERVATIVES CONCERNED BUSH MAY CHOOSE ABORTION MODERATE AS
RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush positions himself closer to the political
center, prominent religious conservatives are expressing concern
about signals he has sent that he might consider a running mate who
supports abortion rights. Should he make that choice, several
religious conservatives said, he would lose.
</P>
<P>
   No one interviewed explicitly criticized Bush for making
overtures to party moderates. And some said the Texas governor
would continue to benefit from conservatives' desire to wrest the
White House from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But reactions to Bush's campaigning with Gov. Christie Whitman
of New Jersey, a supporter of abortion rights, and Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania, who has urged the Republican Party to modify its
anti-abortion plank, suggest that the party's presumptive nominee
could alienate a group that is a major constituency of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, James Dobson, a nationally known
psychologist whose radio broadcasts reach five million Americans,
said Bush would forfeit the support of many conservatives if he
chose a vice-presidential candidate who favored abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just going to stay home,'' said Dobson, president of
Focus on the Family, a nonprofit religious organization that
produces a syndicated program on marital and child-rearing issues.
He added that said many religious conservatives would not vote for
Vice President Al Gore, whom they consider ``anathema.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former head of the conservative Family Research
Council who briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination
himself, said he believed rumors that Ridge ``is on the shortest of
short lists are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's public statements about the need to change the party
platform, coupled with the belief that he could be Bush's running
mate, ``looks disturbingly like a trial balloon,'' Bauer said,
adding, ``That's why I found it disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primary campaign, Bush tried to dodge the question
whenever he was asked whether he would accept a running mate who
supported abortion rights. But late last month, in an appearance
with Whitman, he seemed to indicate that he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good people can disagree on the issue, and I understand
that,'' Bush said then. ``I mean, I'm standing up here with a
friend of mine. We disagree on some aspects of the issue. That
doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same thing -- being on the
same team. And I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March 7, when he beat back a challenge from Sen. John
McCain of Arizona by winning presidential primaries in major states
like California, Ohio and New York, Bush has sought to identify
himself with a constituency broader than the Republican
conservatives he relied on in earlier primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush met for an hour with a dozen gay Republicans
at the governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, although he emerged
from the meeting to say he continued to oppose gay marriage. So
far, the response from conservatives to that meeting has been
muted.
</P>
<P>
   The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, a Bush supporter, said
in a brief statement that a president must represent ``all the
people'' and should not be criticized for listening ``to the
concerns of any segment of the population.'' Criticism would be
appropriate, Robertson added, only if that person embraced ideas
that went against ``his own deeply held convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Jerry Falwell a Baptist minister whose
former organization, Moral Majority, inspired many religious
conservatives to take part in politics, said in an interview that
he had no problem with Bush's meeting with gay Republicans,
Whitman, Ridge ``or any American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of the gay session yesterday still saying, `I
oppose same-sex marriage,''' Falwell said. He also said he would be
``greatly surprised'' if Bush chose a running mate who supported
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cost him the election,'' Falwell said. He added that
he had promised Bush his support and would still vote for him under
such circumstances, and could not support either Gore or Pat
Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would vote for him,'' Falwell said of Bush. ``But I could
not ask my constituents to follow me.''

PUTIN WINS DUMA'S APPROVAL OF ARMS REDUCTION TREATY 
</HEADLINE>

START II is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Putin, in his first legislative initiative as
Russia's elected president, on Friday won approval of the
long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start II from
the lower house of parliament. The landmark agreement, which was
negotiated seven years ago, calls for cutting the American and
Russian nuclear arsenals by half.
</P>
<P>
   The passage was seen as a sign that Putin seeks a constructive
relationship with the West but also that he intends to resist the
U.S. program to develop and deploy antimissile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Putin warned that Russia's willingness to carry out the treaty
depended on Washington's continued adherence to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which sharply restricts the testing
and deployment of antimissile systems. The United States has been
trying, unsuccessfully so far, to get Russia's approval to alter
the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress that, in this case, we will have the chance
and we will withdraw not only from the Start II treaty, but from
the whole system of treaties on the limitation and control of
strategic and conventional weapons,'' Putin said in an unexpected
appearance before parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty on nuclear arms still must receive the approval of
the upper house of parliament, which is not in doubt. Additionally,
the U.S. Senate has yet to approve several protocols to Start II
which extend the schedule for carrying out the weapons reductions
to 2007 and clarify the terms of the ABM treaty. The Russians made
it clear Friday that they would not implement Start II until the
Senate acts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the approval of the treaty in the lower house by a
vote of 228-131 reflected the more centrist makeup of the new
parliament and the diminished influence of the Communist bloc,
which opposed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty was also strongly supported by the Russian military,
which does not have the resources to support the huge nuclear
arsenal developed by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament's move was welcomed by the Clinton
administration, which chose to focus on the ratification of Start
II and to highlight the opportunities to make even deeper
reductions as part of a follow-on Start III accord, but to ignore
Putin's pointed warning to preserve the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate President-elect Putin and his government,
members of the state Duma, and Russian citizens who supported this
giant step toward a safer future,'' President Clinton said in a
statement. ``Now we and Russia can and must seize this opportunity
to intensify our discussions on both Start III and the ABM treaty,
so we can take further concrete steps this year to strengthen the
security of the United States, Russia and indeed the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Start II, the two sides have agreed to cut
their nuclear warheads to no more than 3,500 on each side by 2007.
Russia currently has 6,472 warheads while the United States has
7,763, according to the Arms Control Association, a nongovernmental
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the treaty would ban multiple-warhead land-based
missiles, such as Russia's SS-18 missile and the United States' MX.
Such weapons have long been viewed as the most destabilizing
strategic arms because an attacker might be tempted to use them to
carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
</P>
<P>
   During the administration of Boris Yeltsin, Russia appeared to
be on the verge of ratifying the accord on several occasions. But
U.S. attacks on Iraq and the crisis in Yugoslavia soured the mood
and Yeltsin was unable to push the accord through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, those disputes faded. NATO's expansion also
failed to sink the treaty, as critics of the alliance's decision to
accept new Central European members had feared. Putin told
parliament Friday that the treaty would protect Russia's security
by reducing American forces and saving money that could better be
used to improve conventional weapons, which could be used in
conflicts like the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the present situation in the world, local
conflicts will pose the main threats to Russia,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kremlin was not taking any chances. To make
parliament more pliable, the Defense Ministry promoted 150
legislators who serve in the military reserves. Gennadi A.
Zyuganov, the Communist leader, was promoted to a colonel in the
reserves. He assailed the accord anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has promised to open talks on Start III after Start
II was ratified. And the United States and Russia are expected to
intensify their negotiations over future arms control agreements in
coming months, as Clinton seeks to establish a legacy. Unlike his
predecessors, he has yet to negotiate a major accord cutting
strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides have significant differences. The Russians,
for example, have been pressing to reduce the number of strategic
nuclear warheads to 1,500 under Start III. But the United States
has resisted making such deep cuts, saying it would consider
reductions to a level of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian insistence on deeper cuts is largely driven by
budgetary considerations. Russia does not have the funds to build
many new Topel-M long-range missiles, which it is currently
producing at a rate of only 10 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The American reluctance to make deeper reductions reflects the
thinking at the Pentagon, which has insisted on retaining a
smaller, but still sizable, nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty has also become a stumbling block. The United
States would like to amend the accord in order to permit the
deployment of a limited antimissile defense against hostile Third
World powers, like North Korea. Senior U.S. officials have even
raised the possibility of withdrawing from the accord if the
Russians refuse to agree to modify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have been concerned that an American
antimissile defense would give Washington nuclear superiority, and
have strenuously opposed the move. By linking Start II with
adherence to the ABM accord, Putin was apparently trying, in part,
to strengthen his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ratification has two aims,'' said Aleksandr Pikayev,
an arms expert at the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``The first aim is to send a message to
Washington that Putin is ready to improve relations that have
deteriorated over the past several years. The second aim is to put
Russia in a better position to press on the ABM treaty issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have speculated about a possible trade-off in which
the United States would agree to make deep cuts in strategic arms,
along the lines Moscow would like, in return for Russia's agreement
to amend the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin spurred speculation about such a trade-off by telling
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a recent meeting that
Russia considered it vital to uphold the principles of the ABM
treaty, a comment that was taken by some American officials as a
hint that Russia might be willing to negotiate an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, speaking to a domestic audience, Putin gave no
hint of flexibility. Washington had a choice, he said. The United
States will have to renounce its plans to develop a national ABM
system in order to preserve Start II and the agreement limiting
conventional forces in Europe. If it does not and discards the ABM
treaty, Putin said, the United States will ``become in the eyes of
the world the party that is guilty for destroying the foundations
of strategic stability.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors turned away from stocks Friday in a sharp,
almost panicked wave of selling that closed one of the worst weeks
in the history of U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered Nasdaq index plunged nearly 10 percent to finish
the worst week in its history with a 25.3 percent loss. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 5.66 percent and ended the week down
7.3 percent in its worst performance since 1989. Both indexes had
their biggest losses ever in terms of points Friday, and both
finished the day near Friday's lows, a development that does not
bode well for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Friday's sell-off was a Department of Labor
report that core consumer prices _ excluding food and energy _ had
risen 0.4 percent in March, more than economists had predicted.
That news caused investors to dump technology stocks, deepening a
rout that began in mid-March and has sent shares in many well-known
technology companies down 30, 40, or even 50 percent in just three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day wore on, the selling spread across the board.
While technology stocks led the plunge, few companies escaped
unscathed. All 30 stocks in the Dow fell, while all but 16 stocks
in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dropped. And only five of the
100 biggest companies in the Nasdaq index managed to finish up on
the day.

   ``The market was levitating on hope and irrational concepts of
stock market value, and now it's coming down to earth, but it's
probably not down yet,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   This rout began on March 28 when Goldman Sachs' chief investment
strategist, Abby Joseph Cohen, warned that technology stocks were
``no longer undervalued.'' The selling deepened the next week after
a federal judge ruled against Microsoft in its antitrust case with
the government, a decision that seemed to finally pull the rug out
from the technology sector. And while a lot of the so-called old
economy stocks resisted at first, they have now been caught in the
downdraft.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and investors offered many rationales Friday for the
deepening skid, with the most common explanation involving
overextended investors who have to sell stocks to pay off margin
loans and tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the explanations was a deepening sense of worry
that this sell-off will not follow the pattern of previous years,
in which nearly any slide was followed by an immediate and strong
bounce. Many of the investors who were most enthusiastic about
high-flying technology stocks have no spare cash left to invest.
More conservative investors are not yet ready to buy technology
issues, many of which remain quite expensive by historical
standards, with price-earnings ratios of 100 or higher despite
their recent slide.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off has already proved painful for many investors.
Between Monday and Friday, investors lost more than $2 trillion, or
$7,000 on average for each person in the United States, according
to Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak &AMP;
Co., a bond dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, short-sellers, who make money on market declines and
have been battered over the last several years by what they see as
the irrationality of many technology investors, said Friday's
action vindicated their long-held views that many stocks were
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is going to be the market is not a game, the market
is not a casino, it's a serious thing for serious people, and if
you're wrong, be prepared to lose,'' said Marc Cohodes, general
partner of Rocker Partners, a hedge fund that has both long and
short positions. ``There are some people who are broke, and they
only have themselves to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are signs in stock mutual fund data that fresh money is
still flowing nicely into stock funds and that those who have sold
technology stock have bought stock in other companies, rather than
abandoning the stock market. But many would-be buyers Friday seemed
content to wait for shares to fall even further, rather than
jumping in as they often have when a market plunge made companies
look cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Welch, who stopped by a Charles Schwab branch in midtown
Manhattan around 1 p.m. to check his account, said he thought
technology stocks were still too expensive. Welch, a 64-year-old
stock market veteran who characterized himself as a value investor,
said he might step in to buy technology shares if the sell-off
continued ``for a month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the outlook for the economy, despite a
surge in inflation last month, is still good. And if a decline in
the stock market helps dampen the hot pace of consumer spending,
the Fed may be able to get the economic slowdown it has been
gunning for since last June.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, government officials played down the effects
of the plunge, saying there were no signs that it had put any major
strains on the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that
``clearing systems and the markets are successfully dealing with
processing orders and distributing price information.'' The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York reported no major problems among
securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CNN that the government
was ``watching developments in markets as we always do,'' but that
the important thing was that the economy remained fundamentally
strong. President Clinton, traveling in Atlanta, was briefed on the
situation by his aides, but he made no public statement.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said there had been no need to convene the
working group of top financial officials that coordinates a
response in the event of a market crisis. That group includes
Summers, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Arthur
Levitt, the chairman of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier in the day, Greenspan warned banks and
investment firms not to be complacent about risk, but he did not
comment on the markets or on the outlook for further interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With its 355.49 point decline, the largest ever, to 3321.29, the
Nasdaq fell 9.67 percent Friday, its second worst daily decline in
percentage terms. The technology-heavy index is now down 34.2
percent, or 1,727 points, since its record high of March 10. That
is well into bear market territory, which is considered a decline
of at least 20 percent from the most recent record high. And it is
just short of the 35.9 percent decline, peak to trough, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 617.78, or 5.66
percent, to 10,305.77, is now off 8.7 percent from its recent high.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, meanwhile, finished the day
down 83.95 points, or 5.83 percent, at 1,356.56, and is now down
11.2 percent from its record high on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, the news on inflation, although not terrible,
was unexpectedly bad. Core consumer prices jumped 0.4 of 1 percent
in March, the largest monthly increase in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   That report, coupled with the recent rise in hourly earnings,
intensified the threat of rate increases from the Federal Reserve,
which has already raised its short-term interest rate target a
quarter of a point five times since June.
</P>
<P>
   But before Friday many investors could argue that there was no
pressure on the Federal Reserve to move aggressively to slow
economic growth because there was no sign of inflationary pressure,
outside the recent surge in oil and gasoline prices. Friday's
report blunted that hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a less pregnant moment, people would say it's the first bad
core CPI number in some time and let's wait for another one,'' said
Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y.
``But because the economy is flat out booming amd the stock market
is so expensive, no one is going to wait around for the next
three,'' he said. ``This could unsettle the Fed and the markets
enough to make the economy have a harder landing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For investors looking into next week, the question is whether
the doubts generated by this sell-off, and the volatility
associated with it, will be able to be overcome by the good news on
first quarter earnings, which begin to come out in earnest next
week, and the still positive outlook for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a problem of the economy or of earnings,'' said
Wien of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They are both doing well.''
Morgan Stanley is expecting first-quarter earnings for the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 to rise about 20 percent, compared to the
first quarter of 1999. For the technology sector in the S&AMP;P, the
forecast calls for about 30 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price report initially sent Treasury prices
plunging as investors feared that higher inflation would erode the
value of their bonds. Yields, which move in the opposite direction,
shot higher. For instance, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note
leapt to 6.02 percent, from 5.91 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the selling in the stock market accelerated, some
investors seemed to take refuge in the safety of Treasuries, and
the bond market gained.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading, the 10-year note rallied, with the yield
dropping to 5.85 percent. The Treasury's two-year note also
reflected the rush of investors to safety. Its price rose as the
yield fell to 6.22 percent from 6.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Data for the flow of money into mutual funds indicates that
investors have not lost their taste for stocks. Instead, they seem
to be shifting their money around from one sector to another.
</P>
<P>
   According to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund flows,
$8.4 billion flowed into equity mutual funds in the week ending
Wednesday April 12. Nearly half of that rushed into large cap
growth funds, which concentrate their investment in what are now
being called old economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, $923 million flowed into technology mutual funds and $1.8
billion into what are called aggressive growth funds, which also
invest in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Adler, the president of AMG, there was an
outflow of $760 million from technology funds in the week ending
April 5. That was the first net outflow from such funds since
August of 1999 and the largest weekly outflow he has recorded. But
that outflow was more than offset this week.

STILL HOLDING FOUR PICKS, JETS POISED TO MOVE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-DRAFT, FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jets concluded a frantic week of trades and
telephone calls still holding four first-round picks and still
seeking an opportunity to move up in Saturday's National Football
League draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets now hold the 12th, 13th, 18th and 27th picks in the
first round, but could be poised to make a draft-day deal to move
into the top 10. The Jets picked up the 12th pick on Thursday
night, obtaining it from San Francisco in exchange for the 16th
pick in the first round and the 48th selection, in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that deal may have been the Jets' interest in
selecting defensive end Shaun Ellis of Tennessee, said several
National Football League team executives. Ellis is the second-rated
defensive end in the draft, behind the presumed No. 1 pick in the
first round, Courtney Brown of Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, the Jets were concerned that Green
Bay, which has the 14th pick, would select Ellis. So the Jets made
the deal with San Francisco to give themselves two picks before
Green Bay goes on the clock, leaving them with the flexibility to
use one pick on Ellis and one to fill another need. Ellis, 6 feet 4
inches and 280 pounds, is the pass-rush specialist the Jets
desperately need after having one of the weakest pass-rushes in the
league last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3-4 defense the Jets are expected to use, the pass
rushers are usually outside linebackers. Still, Ellis had 8 1/2
sacks and 11 tackles that resulted in yards lost last year and
although he is heavier and slower than some of the other top
defensive ends in the draft, acquiring him would alleviate one of
the Jets' most pressing concerns in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who have spoken to teams above and below them in the
draft order about trades, could still use one or more of their
picks to pull off a trade and move into the top 10 Saturday. If
they do, they might try to grab a top-flight receiver, like Plaxico
Burress of Michigan State or Travis Taylor of Florida, to replace
Keyshawn Johnson. The Jets have inquired about Cincinnati's No. 4
pick in the first round in an attempt to move into position to take
Peter Warrick of Florida State, the top receiver in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible trade partner is the Baltimore Ravens, who are
holding a veritable auction for the No. 5 pick. Friday, Brian
Billick, the Ravens coach, said that the Ravens would hold off on
trading the pick, if they do complete a trade, until Saturday,
because there were so many suitors who were jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers, who hold the No. 8 pick, have also heard from
several teams including the Jets and would be open to making a
draft-day deal, according to Pittsburgh's director of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
   This is expected to be an extremely trade-heavy first round and
the Jets, with their unprecedented four first-round picks, will be
major players, even if they choose to hold firm with their current
picks. The Jets have already been rebuffed by the Browns in an
attempt to trade up to the first overall pick. Although that
scenario seems dead now _ the Browns are deep in negotiations with
the agent for Brown _ the bid is indicative of the Jets'
willingness to wheel and deal.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a critical draft for the Jets organization,
not just because it has the ability to stockpile young talent with
so many picks, but because it is coming off a tumultuous week in
which Johnson was traded. The Jets' needs are numerous, including a
tight end and free safety in addition to the obvious interest in
acquiring a pass-rusher and a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is a deep draft for receivers, the Jets could wait
until the middle of the round _ letting Warrick, Burress and Taylor
go by _ before selecting Dez White of Georgia Tech, Sylvester
Morris of Jackson State or Ron Dugans, who was overshadowed by
Warrick at Florida State.

THE MARKET'S BREATHTAKING PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial in its editions of
Saturday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   Economists have warned for years that stock prices are
unrealistically high, needing to fall by about a third, by one
prominent estimate, to regain financial sense. But no amount of
warning could take the fright out of Friday's record drops in all
major stock averages. Investors lost about $1 trillion Friday.
Besides the horrific blow to personal wealth, there is the added
threat to the health of the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   How important an event Friday's plunge proves to be depends on
how much the market bounces back next week, and on other factors as
well. Will people reduce their spending enough to trigger a
recession? Will businesses, finding it harder to raise money on
Wall Street, cut back investment plans, delivering a blow to
long-term economic growth? On these scores, there are firm reasons
to remain optimistic. Stocks lost an astounding 23 percent on a
single day, Oct. 19, 1987. Friday's major averages dropped between
5 and 10 percent. Yet even the 1987 debacle caused relatively
little hardship on Main Street. Under the shrewd leadership of Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve kept the economy growing. Greenspan
is still in charge of the Fed, and he has the tools to make sure
that Wall Street and Main Street do not rise and fall in lockstep.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the stock market decline portends for the economy, the
sheer size of Friday's losses was stunning. The index of 30 stocks
that make up the Dow Jones industrial average fell a record 618
points, more than 5.5 percent. That is about 65 points more than
the previous record. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, a more
representative sample of American stocks, lost a record 83 points,
almost 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers Friday were owners of Nasdaq stocks,
especially technology stocks. The Nasdaq lost a record 355 points,
or almost 10 percent. The index is off about 35 percent in the past
month alone. Many will regard the drop in technology stocks _
Microsoft has lost more than $200 billion in value from its peak,
Intel about $100 billion _ as an inevitable correction. Often
prices have little connection to the profits these companies can be
expected to earn anytime soon. Some investors might have convinced
themselves that technology stocks operate by a different set of
financial rules. But this week, ordinary algebra reasserted itself.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about finding a single, decisive explanation for the
plunge. Everyone will seize a favored candidate. The important
point is that when stocks lose touch with their economic moorings,
anything _ an ugly inflation report, as occurred Friday, or a
judicial blow to a prominent company like Microsoft, which
triggered an earlier slide _ can frighten investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, investors have taken falling stock prices as
a golden opportunity to buy, so stock prices have quickly
rebounded. No one can know if that pattern will reappear when the
markets open on Monday, but every study of stock prices is
reassuring. Take any reasonably long-term period, and stock
investments do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   As a political footnote, it is worth adding that Vice President
Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will be watching the
markets closely. Both Bush's tax-cut proposal and Gore's health and
education plans depend on surplus revenues. A good chunk of the
current surplus has been supplied by a boom in tax revenues from
capital gains. A downturn could affect not only productivity and
pocketbooks, but the way politicians and voters behave later this
year.

   FRENZY OF SELLING IN STOCKS CAPS A DISASTROUS WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Investors turned away from stocks in a sharp wave of selling
that closed one of the worst weeks in the history of U.S. markets.
The catalyst was a Department of Labor report showing that core
consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in March, more than economists had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index plunged 355.49 points, or 9.7
percent, to 3,321.29, finishing the worst week in its history with
a 25.3 percent loss. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 617.78
points, or 5.7 percent, to 10,305.77. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index slid 83.95 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,356.56.
</P>
<P>
   A BREATHER FOR A HOT ECONOMY?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy boomed as the stock market, particularly
technology stocks, soared. Now, with those stocks suddenly much
lower, will the economy cool off quickly? Some economists think
consumer spending will slow, but that will depend on psychology as
much as economics.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE GLITCH AT H&AMP;R BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block warned 3,080 customers who used the company's
tax-preparation software that payments they authorized the Internal
Revenue Service to take from their bank accounts would not be made,
because of a software error. The affected taxpayers must mail their
payments to the IRS, which is reviewing the accounts to determine
whether late fees or penalties should be waived. The company said
it would pay any penalties or interest.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE BACKS NASDAQ PUBLIC OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Association of Securities Dealers voted
overwhelmingly to turn the Nasdaq stock market into a for-profit
company. The approval clears the way for the association to sell
Nasdaq by September.

SECRECY OF NUCLEAR DATA UPGRADED ONLY AFTER SCIENTIST WAS FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer files at the heart of the case against the former
Los Alamos scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee were given higher security
classifications last year only after he was fired in the midst of
an espionage investigation at the weapons laboratory, say defense
lawyers and federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Dr. Lee downloaded the files onto his computer, they
were classified but not designated secret or confidential, as the
indictment against him alleges. Instead, they were governed by a
lower kind of security precaution, according to both sides in the
case, as well as a document that federal prosecutors filed as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holscher, the lead lawyer for Lee, said the after-the-fact
change, which he said his team discovered while studying
prosecution evidence, would be a powerful weapon for the defense.
But Holscher would not say how he intended to use it, beyond
declaring, ``The indictment is deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though government officials conceded that the original security
level was low, they emphatically denied that the material Lee
downloaded was insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our indictment and look forward to litigating this
issue when Dr. Lee is tried,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice
Department spokesman. ``What Lee stole was the crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Albuquerque Journal reported the low level of
security for the downloaded data.
</P>
<P>
   Since his indictment Dec. 10, Dr. Lee has been held without
bail, in solitary confinement and under unusually tight security in
Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have accused him of seizing the heart of the
American nuclear arsenal, but his backers maintain that his actions
were nothing out of the ordinary and that he is being singled out
because of his ethnic background. A native of Taiwan, Lee is a
naturalized U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The downloaded material had a security designation ``protect as
restricted data,'' or PARD, a category applied to scientific data
so voluminous and changing so frequently as to be impossible to
assess in terms of security. It is not a security classification
per se, but rather a rule for handling potentially sensitive
materials, and is governed by the secrecy provisions of the
nation's atomic energy laws.
</P>
<P>
   While PARD material by definition is classified and the
designation holds out the possibility that some of it might be
highly sensitive, it is not subject to the same stringent
precautions applied to data designated secret or confidential. For
example, scientists working with it may leave it on their desks
overnight, rather than in a safe. And careful records are kept on
the disposal of all secret and confidential data before its
shredding and burning; PARD printouts required no such accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PARD data must be kept in secure premises at the weapons
laboratory; by law it cannot be transferred onto unsecured
computers, as the government has charged Dr. Lee with doing.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the case agree that the material Dr. Lee is
accused of downloading contained nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official intimately familiar with the legalities of
the case and strongly supportive of the government's position said
the downloaded data included computer instructions on how to
simulate the design of a nuclear warhead, including exact
dimensions and other geometrical information that when standing
alone would be guarded assiduously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is poking a major hole in the case,'' the
official said of the PARD issue. ``What would be a problem is if
things weren't as alleged in the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stu Nagurka, an Energy Department spokesman, said the agency
``can't comment on the indictment in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration weapons expert strongly contested the
idea that the PARD behind the Lee indictment was any less important
than more concentrated data on nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A duck is a duck is a duck,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team countered, though, that any critical
information was buried in a virtually indecipherable mass of benign
data.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the dispute, Steven Aftergood, a secrecy and
classification expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a
private group in Washington, said the development would throw the
government on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes some of the heat off Wen Ho Lee and puts it on the
government, and particularly on the security system,'' Aftergood
said. ``The murkiness of the classification issue takes this out of
the category of `crown jewels,' `worse than the Rosenbergs' and
`change the strategic balance,''' he added, citing descriptions of
the case. ``It's much more complicated than it seemed at first.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was arrested in December, after years of being
investigated as a possible Chinese spy, the government, in a
59-count indictment, accused him of systematically endangering the
design security of virtually every nuclear warhead in the American
arsenal through unauthorized computer transfers of many of the most
sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   While he is not charged with espionage, the indictment claimed
he acted ``with the intent to secure an advantage to a foreign
nation.'' Most of the data that Lee downloaded is missing. He
claims it was destroyed and insists that his actions were strictly
in the line of scientific duty.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Younger, director of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos,
told the federal court at a December bail hearing that the
downloaded data in the wrong hands could ``change the global
strategic balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the indictment said that in 1993, 1994 and 1997
Lee had illegally transferred secret and confidential restricted
data, the federal term for information on the design, manufacturing
and use of atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But according to ``Grand Jury Exhibit One,'' a 47-page Los
Alamos analysis of material that Lee downloaded in 1993, 1994,
1995, 1996 and 1998, the downloading involved either unclassified
or PARD data. The analysis was filed in the federal courthouse in
Albuquerque as prosecution evidence.

<P>
   After soaring 86 percent last year, the Nasdaq composite has
plunged by one-third in just five weeks _ a bear market by any
definition but one that some people say is nearing its end. After
all, much of the technology on which investors are betting when
they buy popular Nasdaq stocks seems to also have the effect of
shortening market cycles, allowing excesses to be wrung out in days
or weeks instead of months or years.
</P>
<P>
   That is the optimistic view. Other people contend that this
remains treacherous territory and that things could get
considerably worse. One of them is Douglas R. Cliggott, the United
States equity strategist for J.P. Morgan. He took time Friday
morning to discuss Nasdaq valuations and some alternative areas for
stock investment. Following are excerpts from that conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot people think we are close to a bottom in the Nasdaq,
but you don't agree. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even at 3,500 or so we're still almost 1,000 points above
where we were in mid-October. The stocks are at extraordinarily
high levels. The Nasdaq's probably trading _ even if we're very
generous and say tech earnings can grow 25 percent a year _ at a
price-to-earnings-growth ratio between 6 and 7. Some companies
warrant that, but does tech as a whole? The answer is an
unambiguous no.
</P>
<P>
   Our rough-and-ready approach is that at the 3,000 level we would
think of going back to a neutral on technology, and in the
2.000-to-3,000 range, that's what we'd consider a really true new
buying opportunity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you can say you saw this downdraft coming? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We were early. But it was inevitable. Looking back to the
1970s, there have been only two years when the Nasdaq, if it got
very far away from its 200-day moving average, didn't have a
pullback. In the summer of '98, the moving average broke and
brought the Nasdaq back to its trend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. With the latest inflation report, more interest-rate
increases seem likely. Do you agree with those who minimize the
effect of higher rates on technology companies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Tech is very vulnerable to higher interest rates for
three reasons. Capital spending of most companies buying high-tech
equipment is now significantly higher than their cash flow, meaning
they have to borrow. Investors who buy tech stocks have been using
debt; not just buying on margin but maybe instead of taking money
out of the market to buy that new sport utility vehicle they get a
home-equity loan. And a higher risk-free return, such as on
Treasury bonds, leads to a lower fair value for stock prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any technology stocks you like now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We're quite defensive. The only grouping we recommend
investors be overweighted in is information technology services and
computer services. Two companies that are very strong and have very
reasonable valuations are IBM and Computer Sciences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you say that the market generally has been, or will be,
gravitating toward what you might call brand-name technology and
away from junk technology? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd call this conservative, reliable tech rather than
high-stakes tech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have a 50 percent allocation to stocks _ and 25 percent
each to bonds and cash _ so where does this money go? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What we've been doing is recommending that investors increase
their exposure to consumer staples such as foods, pharmaceuticals,
household products and beverages _ groups that have been generally
out of favor since '97. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are people taking this advice _ to turn to these traditional
favorites that have lagged so badly? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's been a fair amount of skepticism because, except for
the drugs, these companies have been delivering disappointing
earnings. But we think that this stemmed from four factors, all of
which have reversed or are in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Revived consumer spending in other parts of the world should be
kicking in just about now. Second, a shift from a very strong
dollar to a flat-to-weaker dollar. Third, we're starting to see
improved pricing for these companies, a modest 2 percent to 4
percent, but the trend is up, not down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consumer staples lag when corporate earnings are
accelerating and we think they're right at the peak now. The next
four to six quarters will give you weaker year-over-year growth.
That's exactly when you want to own pharmaceuticals and consumer
staples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which specific companies do you favor? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We like Bristol-Myers and Schering-Plough. In household
products we like Procter &AMP; Gamble; if you liked it at 100 you've
got to love it at 65 _ and we do. In food and beverages we like
General Mills and PepsiCo.

 &HT;    Spotlight on Mayfield, Elliott after delayed Talladega
qualifying
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ It was not planned, but the Winston Cup Series
had its first night event at Talladega Superspeedway on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Due to rainy weather conditions, the circuit's first round of
qualifying was pushed back two hours. It was nearly 8 p.m. as the
final driver, Jeff Burton, finished the time trails under the dark
Alabama skies.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield ended up being the pole winner with a speed of
186.969 mph. He'll be joined on the front row by Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying was difficult. The track has lights, but not for
full-fledged racing. The stands and straightaways were
well-lighted, but the four corners were filled with darkness.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30, fans were driving around the infield with their car
lights on and photographers had to use flashes _ but NASCAR
continued to allow race cars to circle the circuit's most dangerous
track at speeds in excess of 180 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing today's forecast, the sport's governing body was
insistent on completing the first round Friday. The Weather Channel
calls for cloudy skies with a 30-percent chance of showers.
</P>
<P>
   If the first round of qualifying had not been finalized Friday
and the remaining part of trials were rained out today, NASCAR
would have had to wipe out all speeds Friday and determine the
order of the field by owner's points, a championship provisional
and six qualifying draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, this is great to (win the pole),'' Mayfield said. ``I
just can't say enough about this race team. Everybody has worked
hard and I am just so pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was the only driver able to register a faster lap than
Elliott, who will be making his 600th career start in Sunday's
DieHard 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a pretty rough weekend, but we had a fast car
today,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a little bit to learn about the new restrictor
plate, along with everybody else. We really didn't have a lot of
time for practice today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup drivers got on the track for just over an hour
of practice. Jeff Gordon was the 18th fastest driver in the
practice session, but slid back to 34th in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in more than two years that Gordon had
failed to qualify in the first round.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WELCOMES RUSSIA'S RATIFICATION OF START II 
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-ARMS)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Friday welcomed Russia's
ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start
II, saying it sets the stage for President Clinton and President
Vladimir Putin to meet to try to hammer out a grand bargain for the
next stage of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they were pleased that
Putin, unlike his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, demonstrated he could
deal with the Russian Duma and that in his appearance before the
legislators he told them Russia could not afford an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement that the action by the
Duma opened the way to further arms cuts, specifically through
intensified talks with Russia on the Start III Treaty and on
changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Russia
resists.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaudits for Putin were tempered within the
administration by a recognition that the health of relations
between the two countries long ago stopped being dependent on
Moscow's ratification of the treaty, signed by the leaders of both
countries nearly eight years ago. The treaty was signed by Yeltsin
and President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been around for so long it's hard to generate a tone of
goodwill,'' said a senior official who has dealt with Moscow's
policy on Start II.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as the White House prepares to go to a new level in arms
control negotiations, it faces a Congress which is skeptical of the
new Russian leader, particularly on the issue of Moscow's conduct
of the war in Chechnya. The Senate has yet to approve several
protocols to the treaty
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott were both questioned in separate sessions
before Senate panels in the last week over Russia's brutality
during the war in Chechnya and the lack of sanctions by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of Clinton and Putin would probably take place before
a gathering of the leaders of the eight leading industrial nations,
known as the G-8, scheduled in Japan in July, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Russian talks would most likely revolve
around how to construct a deal on national missile defense that the
administration has been seeking for more than a year, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A vital technical test of the missile defense system _ the last
of a series _ is to take place at the end of June, a factor that
could affect the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants Moscow to agree to what it calls modest
changes to the ABM treaty to allow Washington to deploy a limited
missile defense system designed to protect the United States
against the missiles of North Korea. In exchange, the
administration is prepared to go ahead, under a Start III treaty,
with reductions of offensive weapons down to 2000 to 2500 for each
side, targets set in Helsinki by Clinton and Yeltsin in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the administration faces opposition to its missile
defense system from Republicans who argue that it is too limited
and from some Democrats who question whether an election year is
the right time to move ahead with a complex issue.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush has been
watching Clinton's moves with Russia closely. Friday, his senior
foreign policy adviser, Condeleezza Rice, called the ratification
of Start II a ``long overdue and positive step.'' But she
cautioned: ``This is only one step in a much larger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said she envisioned ``how to best manage the nuclear
relationship'' with Russia becoming an issue in the general
election. It would be unwise, she said, for the Clinton
administration to proceed with very limited amendments to the ABM
treaty which would restrict how the next president could deploy
such a system.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign issued a statement saying Gore
had worked for the last seven years with the Russian government
through the U.S.-Russia Binational Commission to win ratification
of the treaty. Gore encouraged Putin to pursue more intensive talks
on Start III and the ABM treaty, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration planned to push forward as quickly as
possible with talks with the Russians, starting with a session
Monday in Geneva between the senior adviser at the State Department
for arms control, John D. Holum and his Russian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   A former administration official, Thomas E. Graham, Jr., who
served until recently as a diplomat in the U.S. embassy in Moscow,
said the White House was keen to get a new arms control accord with
the Putin government as quickly as possible. The administration did
not want to be the first in several decades not to have signed a
significant arms control agreement with Moscow, said Graham, now a
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

SPORTS COLUMN: CASUAL DRESS, ALL-BUSINESS ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a bright, brisk afternoon in Midtown Manhattan,
Peter Warrick and four other soon-to-be National Football League
rookies met the news media Friday at a predraft event at
Gallagher's Steak House.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had brought in five expected stars of Friday's draft:
LaVar Arrington and Courtney Brown, the Penn State defensive stars;
Virginia tailback Thomas Jones; Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels; and, of course, Warrick, Florida State's brilliant wide
receiver-punt returner. The five athletes took turns talking about
the drama of being drafted, the thrill of a knowing a dream was
about to come true: playing professional football.
</P>
<P>
   While the others wore suits and ties, Warrick was dressed
casually. He wore a brown outfit with a matching fisherman's hat _
front bill turned up _ and a piece of jewelry around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   On any other day, in any other city, Warrick's wardrobe might
have been out of place. But on this day and in this city, they were
congruent. The pattern on Warrick's suit was of airplanes. Some New
York football fans might say they were Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's choice of clothes _ with the airplane pattern _ could
be interpreted as a message to the Jets: Warrick is your man.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick laughed. He said that was not why he wore the outfit.
But he also said he wouldn't mind playing in New York, for the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Keyshawn's gone, I'd like to play here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I was more curious to hear how a promising young receiver, just
entering the league, was affected by a player of Johnson's stature
being effectively booted out of a place he wanted be _ New York.
Johnson was certainly stunned by the trade to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he was happy to get the $56 million contract,
Johnson also said, ``I guess no one is invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a most telling reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just felt like he couldn't believe they traded him
because he did so much for them,'' Warrick said Friday. ``He was
probably thinking `Why did they trade me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has not been lost on Warrick. ``You see a lot and
you learn a lot and you make your choices,'' he said. ``If they
trade Keyshawn, they'll trade a lot of people. That's the way it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, more than any of the other players at Gallagher's,
knows that no one is invincible. He discovered the hard way how
funky things can get when a name becomes scandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick spent most of the afternoon answering questions about an
ill-fated shopping spree at Dillard's last fall. The incident, in
which Warrick pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty theft after
underpaying for clothes by more than $380, got him a two-game
suspension, generated a season of terrible publicity and most
likely cost him the Heisman Trophy. He might also slip a notch in
the draft, but because so many teams passed on Minnesota's Randy
Moss two years ago because of character issues, this time around
clubs may be less inclined to mix church and state when they draft
someone of Warrick's caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they pass me over, it's going to be real exciting,'' he
said. ``Believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The shopping episode and the subsequent publicity have allowed
him to approach the news media, the draft and the reality of
professional football less as a starry-eyed dream than as a
high-profile business opportunity with a lucrative upside.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as evidenced by Johnson, everything is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Every team is looking for something. The Jets are looking for an
eraser, someone to help rub out any trace of a mistake they made by
trading a Pro Bowl receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, like Johnson in 1996, is coming off a record
performance in a bowl game. Johnson caught 12 passes for 216 yards
and a touchdown as Southern California defeated Northwestern in the
Rose Bowl. Last January, Warrick scored a Sugar Bowl-record 20
points, catching two touchdown passes, running a punt back for a
touchdown and scoring a 2-point conversion to lead Florida State to
a 49-26 victory over Virginia Tech for the national championship.
Warrick could be the eraser the Jets are looking for. Or the spark
of hope for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't the fastest man in the world, ``but what I do
is make plays every Saturday and, hopefully, now on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fitting imagery of the day was at Gallagher's entrance,
where slabs of ribs and steaks are dry-air cured in an aging box.
The meat was different shapes, different sizes _ and raw.
</P>
<P>
   The other players may not have seen a connection. I'll bet
Warrick did; maybe that's why he dressed so casually.
</P>
<P>
   Why wear suits to a slaughterhouse?

PENTAGON RULES OUT MISCONDUCT PROBE OF GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's inspector general Friday dismissed
all accusations against Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, who has
accused another Army general of sexual harassment, according to a
senior Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   The one-week inquiry found that there was ``no basis
whatsoever'' for the accusations made by a retired Army officer who
sent an electronic message to the Pentagon on April 7 accusing
Kennedy of personal misconduct during the 1980s, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was found,'' the official said. ``There is no there
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon refused to identify the retired officer who made
the accusation against Kennedy, the highest ranking woman in the
Army, just weeks after it was disclosed that she had filed a
complaint accusing another general of groping her in her office in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation against Kennedy had further upset senior Army
officers already divided over the first sexual harassment complaint
brought by one Army general against another. Kennedy's defenders
said they were not surprised that the accusations were groundless,
saying they were a predictable attempt to undermine her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely classic _ we've seen this in every single
case where a woman has stepped forward and made an allegation and
gotten any kind of notoriety,'' said Susan Barnes, a lawyer who has
represented military women who have brought sexual harassment
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Several women officers praised the Pentagon for quickly handling
the inquiry into the accusations against Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very crucial that this was taken care of quickly,''
said one woman who is a senior officer. ``Most of us recognize that
these things happen, and there is a tendency to blame the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed her complaint against Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith
last August _ accusing him of sexual harassment four years earlier
_ after she discovered that he had been appointed deputy inspector
general of the Army and would have responsibility over such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to comment on her accusation or discuss the
investigation of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said, however, that the Army inspector
general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, is still interviewing witnesses
in that case, which is complicated because Kennedy did not make a
complaint at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And without a complaint in his file, Smith appeared to be a
credible candidate for the post of inspector general, said one Army
official.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Kennedy's said Friday that she has told them in the
last week that she expected accusations to be made against her once
the case became public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an e-mail to me she basically said that she expected it to
get nasty,'' said one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn P. Foote, a retired Army brigadier general, said that
Kennedy told her at a lunch this week that no one should worry
about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I'm tough as leather; they're not going to hurt
me,''' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   The division over the case extends to Congress where Kennedy's
motives have been questioned. Last week Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind.,
said the timing of her complaint seemed ``to make her look
vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of Kennedy's, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said
Friday that she was asking the secretary of the Army for a status
report on the changes recommended by a senior review panel three
years ago to ``eliminate sexual harassment within the ranks and to
support those victims of sexual harassment who chose to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the furor, several professional organizations of
women in the military are preparing a reception for Kennedy next
month to honor her before she retires this year. One organizer said
the women wanted her to be remembered for much more than the sexual
harassment case she filed.

   IRELAND: IRA KILLINGS INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   The government will re-examine charges that the Irish police may
have helped Irish Republican Army guerrillas single out victims in
a dozen border area killings in the 1980s and 1990s. Justice
Minister John O'Donoghue said he did not believe the allegations
but that ``every effort must be made to reassure the public that
they have been thoroughly investigated.'' The deaths included those
of Northern Ireland's former lord chief justice, Maurice Gibson,
and four members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl has collected more than $3.7
million, more than enough to pay $3.15 million in fines imposed
against his conservative Christian Democratic Union for illegal
campaign financing during his years in power. Focus magazine said
he collected $2.8 million among business friends and personally
contributed $350,000 from a mortgage on his house. The remainder
came from cash donations. Kohl has admitted accepting just over $1
million in secret payments between 1993 and 1998.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent Friday night, Mikhail Baryshnikov sat
regally at an upstairs table in the Russian Samovar, patiently
conducting an interview with a writer from Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, he can come in here, eat wonderful food, do an interview
and have a little peace,'' observed Roman Kaplan, the Samovar's
founder, as he gazed at the dancer _ overlooking the fact that the
restaurant was anything but peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, a quartet of singers outfitted as Cossacks belted
out traditional Russian folk songs as diners clapped and stomped,
creating an uproarious, engaging din. Crowded at a long, smoky bar,
Russian intellectuals, writers, artists and leather-clad yuppies
chatted loudly as they nursed an assortment of flavored vodkas,
beers and _ the trendy cocktail of the moment _ cosmopolitans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway actors, poets, singers and people who like a touch of
the exotic come to Roman and the Samovar,'' said Baryshnikov, who
is an investor in the restaurant. ``People jam here. They discuss
problems. It's important for people to have a place where they can
come and sort things out.''
</P>
<P>
   People have been sorting things out at the Samovar for more than
a decade, making it not only a pillar of New York's
Russian-American community, but something much more than a place to
eat. Amid the vast panoply of bistros and brasseries that spreads
across Manhattan, the Samovar, on 52nd Street between Broadway and
Eighth Avenue, stands out as an inviting, unwieldy and thoroughly
singular social club.
</P>
<P>
   As platters of blini and caviar, borscht, satsivi chicken, beef
stroganoff, dumplings, smoked fish and grilled shashlik are carried
from table to table, a wide cross-section of New York's
Russian-American population funnels in and out of the restaurant,
adding to the pell-mell atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, plump, middle-age and elderly diners
animatedly eat, converse, argue and laugh before departing. Later,
the visitors become younger and more diverse: a shaggy-haired
painter here, a gangster with a buzz cut there, a slender blonde
yawning through a meal with a businessman looking much too old to
be her husband, and a group of fashionably-turned-out 20- and
30-somethings rushing through another round of drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Samovar is like a little Russian island for all of us
because we miss home,'' said Leyla Zaloutskaya, a 25-year-old
Russian who works at the United Nations. ``There's nowhere else in
America like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Samovar's clientele extends beyond the Russian
community. One recent evening, the folk singer Peter Yarrow
strummed his guitar, accompanying his daughter as she sang for a
small group of friends. Nearby, a Broadway theater manager puffed
on a cigar and mused happily about how well his newest show was
doing, while a visitor from Chicago emptied his last glass of
vodka, carefully moved some vases off a coffee table, stretched out
on the narrow table and fell asleep. The endless buzz of music and
conversation continued to waft through the Samovar until well after
2 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a certain kind of pride here because people
find things that they love about Russia _ abatjour lampshades,
sounds of the piano, friendship, the smell of good food, and
dushevno,'' said Kaplan, explaining that ``dushevno'' translates
from Russian as ``something good for the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the regulars, one of the main attractions is Kaplan
himself. He is in the restaurant on most evenings, nattily dressed
and darting from table to table to greet guests, pausing to whisper
a joke in a diner's ear or to smile warmly at a young couple as he
escorts them to their table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love this place because we're welcome here, we can relax
here, and it has very good food,'' said Vasily Yankovich, a
36-year-old singer whose booming tenor occasionally overwhelms the
notes pounded out of a white grand piano in the middle of the
Samovar's dining area. ``There are three or four other Russian
restaurants around, but none of them has Roman. Roman is what makes
the restaurant special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Samovar is a reflection of Kaplan's tastes and interests.
Downstairs, the walls are lined with photographs, paintings and
drawings by Russian artists who have given them to Kaplan. The
fringed, crimson shades that adorn lamps hanging over the tables
recall similar lampshades that many Russians once hung above their
kitchen tables in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs is a cigar bar and a smaller dining room paneled with
handsome blond wood that Kaplan said is a nod to the more refined
sensibilities of St. Petersburg. Ledges on the walls are lined with
antique brass samovars, the tall, often elegantly tooled tea-makers
that are the traditional symbols of Russian hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was born in St. Petersburg 62 years ago, when the city
was still known as Leningrad. During World War II, as German
artillery pounded the city in the Siege of Leningrad, Kaplan lost
all of his toes to frostbite and nearly starved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who went hungry for a number of years fetishizes
food,'' Kaplan said. ``I loved to cook from an early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained in the arts and with a facility for foreign languages,
including English, Kaplan emigrated to Israel in 1972 and then to
the United States in 1977. He worked as a doorman at an apartment
building nd managed an East Side art gallery before his wife,
Lara, encouraged him to open his first restaurant, Kalinka, in
1984. He sold his interest in that Upper East Side restaurant two
years later, when he opened the Samovar. Since then, the Samovar
has become a fixture on 52nd Street, although it has had its ups
and downs financially. Nonetheless, its renown has drawn a
competitor across the street, the Russian Vodka Room, which was
started by former Samovar waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Baryshnikov, Kaplan's partners include a Canadian
businessman, Fred Sorkin, and the widow of the Russian poet Joseph
Brodsky. After winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987,
Brodsky gave Kaplan some money from the award to help the Samovar
get over a financial hump.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who features poetry readings at the restaurant on
Tuesday nights, also holds annual tributes to Brodsky. A thick
scrapbook that Kaplan keeps locked away in an upstairs office
contains many photographs of Brodsky, as well as poems and drawings
from other Russian writers and artists who are close to Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the nightly traffic in food, drink, conversation and
music that most visibly defines the Samovar. ``It reminds me of all
the Russian restaurants and cabarets that were in Paris in the
30's,'' recalled Moura Petrovsky Tober, an elegantly dressed,
courtly woman in her 80's who left Russia with her parents shortly
after the revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the music and the atmosphere. Even though there are an
awful lot of young people, I feel OK because I can find my Russian
friends in here.''

FORTUNATE FIVE WILL DOMINATE FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never in the history of the National Football League have so few
held the future of so many in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, when the jousting for the best available college
talent gets under way at noon, five teams will control 40 percent
of the draft. The New York Jets, with four picks, will be in charge
of the first round and what they do will set the tone for the rest
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Baltimore, San Francisco, and Seattle have two each,
giving this lucky fivesome 12 of the 31 first-round picks. Teams
like the Patriots, Atlanta, Dallas, Miami, New Orleans, San Diego,
and Tampa Bay, who traded their first-round selections, can only
wait.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no last-minute deals, here is how the first round
might go:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Cleveland &QL; 
DE Courtney Brown, Penn State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything you want in a top pick. He's smart (4.0 high school
grade-point average) and a tremendous worker. He also has great
quickness and an 86-inch wing span. Should be a force in the league
for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
2. Washington &QL; 
LB LaVar Arrington, Penn State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is a speed rusher from the outside and the Redskins
are trying to rebuild their defense. They picked up All-Pro Bruce
Smith in free agency and putting Arrington behind him, or on the
opposite side, will give them a pass rush they haven't had since
the days of Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
3. Washington &QL; 
OT Chris Samuels, Alabama &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 325 pounds, he's very physical. Moves well for such a big
man. Alabama fans say he is the best offensive lineman in school
history. They must have forgotten a guy named John Hannah. When
Samuels gets to the Hall of Fame, they can make the comparison. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Cincinnati &QL; 
WR Peter Warrick, Florida State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warrick is the most explosive player in the draft. He would give
the Bengals a tremendous outside 1-2 punch with Carl Pickens. Some
say the Bengals will trade Pickens during the draft if they get
Warrick, but general manager Mike Brown says no. However, the
Kansas City Chiefs were talking about a trade for Bengals running
back Corey Dillon, who has been saying he doesn't want to play in
Cincinnati anymore. Brown reportedly asked for a first- and
third-round pick in the draft. The Chiefs reportedly were only
willing to offer a first and fifth. Marvin Demoff, Dillon's agent,
has been talking to other teams, including Baltimore, trying to get
them interested in trading for Dillon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Baltimore &QL; 
RB Jamal Lewis, Tennessee &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens were still debating this pick Friday night. Coach
Brian Billick would like to take Lewis. Others in the organization
prefer Corey Simon here, gambling they could get Lewis at No. 10.
Billick would prefer a running back and then a wide receiver. But
after losing veteran defensive tackle Larry Webster to a drug
suspension this week, the Ravens are seriously considering Simon.
Green Bay has offered Baltimore multiple picks, and it is believed
the Packers would move up to get Simon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Philadelphia &QL; 
DT Corey Simon, Florida State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have to do something about their defensive front.
They couldn't stop anyone a year ago, except the Patriots, and
although they would like to pick a wide receiver here, they are
leaning toward Simon, an extremely productive college player. If
the Eagles don't grab Simon, there is a possibility they will trade
down with the Jets, who would take Michigan State receiver Plaxico
Burress. &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. Arizona &QL; 
RB Thomas Jones, Virginia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost Adrian Murrell in free agency, and he is was
the only runner they had who could make a play on his own. Jones,
the best breakaway threat in the draft, will give them a chance to
improve a running game that was at the bottom of the league. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. Pittsburgh &QL; 
WR Plaxico Burress, Michigan State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burress is the Steelers' first choice, but if he is gone, they
will take Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington. Burress is 6 feet 6
inches, can leap over tall buildings, will block, but is supposed
to have a bit of an attitude problem. The Steelers took a receiver
(Troy Edwards) with their first pick last year, and will do so
again if they believe it will help beleaguered quarterback Kordell
Stewart. &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. Chicago &QL; 
LB Brian Urlacher, New Mexico &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bears are enthralled by Burress, they need more
help on defense. Urlacher appears to be the type who could line up
_ and make plays _ at several positions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
10. Baltimore &QL; 
WR Travis Taylor, Florida &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the Ravens' plan. They were great on defense
in 1999 but struggled on offense, which is why Billick is looking
for explosive players. If the Ravens choose Simon fifth, they will
take Lewis with this pick and hope to get a receiver later. &QL; 
 &QL; 
11. New York Giants &QL; 
RB Ron Dayne, Wisconsin &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have been telling everyone they like Alabama running
back Shaun Alexander here, but Dayne will be the choice if the
board breaks down this way. He is not the big-play threat Alexander
is, but he is a power runner, in the mold of Jerome Bettis, who
would make defenses respect the line of scrimmage and not play pass
all the time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
12. New York Jets &QL; 
LB John Abraham, South Carolina &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This starts the Jets' roll. They would like to get a wide
receiver, pass rusher, defensive back, and offensive tackle or
tight end with their four first-rounders. If they move up, it will
likely be to get a receiver like Burress. &QL; 
 &QL; 
13. New York Jets &QL; 
OT Stockar McDougle, Oklahoma &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This could set up the Jets with a great offensive line in the
future. Two Jets, Randy Thomas and Ryan Young, made the NFL
All-Rookie team last season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
14. Green Bay Packers &QL; 
DE Shaun Ellis, Tennessee &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Packers continue to rebuild their defensive line. With
Vonnie Holliday inside and Ellis outside, the Packers could again
be dominant up front. Gilbert Brown has virtually eaten himself out
of the league, so defensive line has become their top priority. The
Packers have offered three picks to Baltimore to move up to the
fifth spot, reportedly to take Simon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
15. Denver Broncos &QL; 
TE Bubba Franks, Miami &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos traded down to this spot figuring they could still
get the tight end they need, and Franks is the best available.
Denver coach Mike Shanahan has said Franks is just about the best
blocking college tight end he has ever seen. However, when Shanahan
traded to this spot, he didn't expect to see Pennington on the
board. There could be a surprise here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
16. San Francisco &QL; 
QB Chad Pennington, Marshall &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have traded down twice to get to this spot, picking up
second-round picks from Washington and the Jets. San Francisco
general manager Bill Walsh has said he hopes to turn his two
first-round picks into five second-rounders and then select five
players who can start the rebuilding process. However, if
Pennington is at this spot, the trading will stop and he will be
the pick. &QL; 
 &QL; 
17. Oakland &QL; 
LB Julian Peterson, Michigan State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are praying Peterson drops this far. Their biggest
need is a pass-rushing linebacker. They could go for a defensive
back at this spot if all pass rushers are gone. But owner Al Davis
has a history of trading up to get what he feels will be a star,
rather than taking a player later he really doesn't want. &QL; 
 &QL; 
18. New York Jets &QL; 
WR Dennis Northcutt, Arizona &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the Jets might go if they don't get Burress.
They need someone to replace Keyshawn Johnson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
19. Seattle &QL; 
OL Chris McIntosh, Wisconsin &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle needs to rebuild the offensive line to give Mike
Holmgren a better chance to succeed with his West Coast offense. &QL; 
 &QL; 
20. Detroit &QL; 
RB Shaun Alexander, Alabama &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lions use this choice to attempt to replace Barry Sanders.
Although Alexander is more of a power runner, the Lions need him to
help their play-action passing game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
21. Kansas City &QL; 
CB Ahmed Plummer, Ohio State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs have been trying for two weeks to make a trade. They
desperately want a running back. They tried to move up to get Jones
or Dayne but couldn't get it done. They tried to trade with
Cincinnati for Dillon but couldn't get it done. Defensive back is
their next need and they say they will take Plummer, a cover guy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
22. Seattle &QL; 
CB Deltha O'Neal, California &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, Holmgren goes defensive. O'Neal is highly regarded
and could be a surprise pick above this. The Jets and Lions have
some interest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
23. Carolina &QL; 
OL Travis Claridge, Southern Cal &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surprise first-rounder. Panthers coach George Seifert said he
would select almost anyone above him on their board if they fell to
him. He was hoping McDougle, McIntosh, or O'Neal would be here. The
Carolina staff coached Claridge in the Senior Bowl and liked his
toughness. &QL; 
 &QL; 
24. San Francisco &QL; 
LB Keith Bulluck, Syracuse &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers would like to trade down, but if they stay put it will
be Bulluck or Erik Flowers, a pass rusher from Arizona State. &QL; 
 &QL; 
25. Minnesota &QL; 
LB Darren Howard, Kansas State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green says it will be an agonizing decision
between Howard and Boston College's Chris Hovan. Green will tell
you Hovan plays harder than anyone in the draft but he plays
inside, and they need more of an outside pass-rushing threat, which
Howard could be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
26. Buffalo &QL; 
CB Rashard Anderson, Jackson State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bills will be thankful Anderson is still on the board. Their
biggest need is a cover corner. Even though they might prefer
Plummer or O'Neal, they'll still make this move. If all three are
gone they'll consider Anderson's college teammate Sylvester
Morris. &QL; 
 &QL; 
27. New York Jets &QL; 
TE Anthony Becht, West Virginia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their 1998 starter at tight end, Kyle Brady, left for
Jacksonville via free agency before last season. Their '99 starter,
free agent Eric Green, was a bust. Tight end is a huge need and
they like Becht a lot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Indianapolis &QL; 
DL Chris Hovan, Boston College &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Colts need defense and Hovan fits into what they like to do.

still be there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Jacksonville &QL; 
OL Cosey Coleman, Tennessee &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars' biggest needs are at guard, which is where Coleman
fits in the NFL, and wide receiver. Jacksonville will likely go for
a receiver in the second round. &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Tennessee &QL; 
DE Erik Flowers, Arizona State &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher says his team doesn't have any glaring
holes and will pick the best player available. Fisher was hoping
one of the highly rated offensive lineman might drop to this spot,
but that's not likely to happen, so he'll go with Flowers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
31. St. Louis &QL; 
OT Adrian Klemm, Hawaii &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Klemm fits a need. The Rams lost two of their Super Bowl
starters on the offensive line to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Seahawks free agent defensive tackle Sam Adams is the
wild card in this draft. Baltimore and Green Bay were trying to
sign him so they wouldn't have to use a first-round pick on a
defensive lineman.

SHAME ON ELIAN'S RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The quickly shrinking credibility of the Miami relatives
of Elian Gonzalez approached the vanishing point with the release
Thursday of a loony home video that purports to prove the little
boy wants to stay here permanently.
</P>
<P>
   In this farce taped in his bedroom, he defiantly insists he
wants to stay, calls Attorney General Janet Reno an ``old lady,''
and declares that if his father wants custody he'd better move to
the United States. It neatly encapsulates much of the harm he is
suffering at the center of this legal morass.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure all those sentiments were entirely the product of his
own youthful mind. I'm sure he hated Cuba every day that he lived
there, and has been dreaming of life in the United States for years
and years. I'm sure that those around the family who say he was not
coached, who are shocked that anyone might even suggest that he was
encouraged to make this speech, are all telling the truth. I'm sure
all the people around him are thinking of nothing but the best
interests of Elian, as they so tirelessly declare.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who really cared about this boy would want to reunite him
with his surviving parent and would not tolerate the three-ring
circus that has grown up around him. Anyone who cared about him
would not allow him to be interviewed by Diane Sawyer, much less
would they release some propagandistic video to bolster their claim
to custody.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is 6 years old, but he is no fool. He has been to Disney
World and been kowtowed to by one local politician and celebrity
after another. He spends each day surrounded by a huge cheering
section keeping vigil for him, and he can't appear in a window
without dozens of cameras clicking. Of course he doesn't want to go
anywhere. Why would he?
</P>
<P>
   He is too young to understand the transitory nature of celebrity
or to have heard of Andy Warhol's universal 15 minutes of fame, but
he knows he is being treated as he never was before.
</P>
<P>
   It is ludicrous to think that a small child is capable of making
such a large decision as what country he should live in. But his
lawyers and family continue to suggest that the call should be his,
while twisting and corrupting this child they claim to hold so
dear.
</P>
<P>
   On and on this has dragged, and the one thing that has become
steadily more clear is how little it has to do with the boy who
loves playing on the swingset in his backyard. The political
baggage this case has acquired is merely annoying, but the
willingness to use this child as a pawn is sad.
</P>
<P>
   The claim of the Miami relatives that this is a family matter is
being laughed out of one courtroom after another. A Florida family
court judge in Miami declared Thursday, for the second time this
week, that she has no jurisdiction in the case. Meanwhile, the
Justice Department, which so far has shown the collective spine of
a bowl of Jell-O, argued in court papers that the Miami relatives
should be forced to relinquish control before their appeal for an
asylum hearing is even heard in an Atlanta appeals court. That
seems like a minimal requirement to me.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives seem overwhelmed by the symbol Elian has become. A
few months ago, they were a poor immigrant family scraping by; now
they are celebrities _ and in their own community near-deities.
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro, and cousin Marisleysis have cheering
sections, even fans. I'm convinced that their refusal to listen to
reason has much to do with the disappointment their new admirers
would suffer if they gave in now, and their reluctance to give up
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazaro and Marisleysis, however unsophisticated, are at
least adults. Now Elian has been turned into a television performer
too, in a cheap bid to manipulate public opinion. His childhood
becomes steadily more perverted every day. He may hardly remember
what it was like to be a little boy by the time this is over.

SECRECY OF NUCLEAR DATA UPGRADED ONLY AFTER SCIENTIST WAS FIRED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer files at the heart of the case against the former
Los Alamos scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee were given higher security
classifications last year only after he was fired in the midst of
an espionage investigation at the weapons laboratory, say defense
lawyers and federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Dr. Lee downloaded the files onto his computer, they
were classified but not designated secret or confidential, as the
indictment against him alleges. Instead, they were governed by a
lower kind of security precaution, according to both sides in the
case, as well as a document that federal prosecutors filed as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holscher, the lead lawyer for Lee, said the after-the-fact
change, which he said his team discovered while studying
prosecution evidence, would be a powerful weapon for the defense.
But Holscher would not say how he intended to use it, beyond
declaring, ``The indictment is deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though government officials conceded that the original security
level was low, they emphatically denied that the material Lee
downloaded was insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our indictment and look forward to litigating this
issue when Dr. Lee is tried,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice
Department spokesman. ``What Lee stole was the crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Albuquerque Journal reported the low level of
security for the downloaded data.
</P>
<P>
   Since his indictment Dec. 10, Dr. Lee has been held without
bail, in solitary confinement and under unusually tight security in
Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have accused him of seizing the heart of the
American nuclear arsenal, but his backers maintain that his actions
were nothing out of the ordinary and that he is being singled out
because of his ethnic background. A native of Taiwan, Lee is a
naturalized U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The downloaded material had a security designation ``protect as
restricted data,'' or PARD, a category applied to scientific data
so voluminous and changing so frequently as to be impossible to
assess in terms of security. It is not a security classification
per se, but rather a rule for handling potentially sensitive
materials, and is governed by the secrecy provisions of the
nation's atomic energy laws.
</P>
<P>
   While PARD material by definition is classified and the
designation holds out the possibility that some of it might be
highly sensitive, it is not subject to the same stringent
precautions applied to data designated secret or confidential. For
example, scientists working with it may leave it on their desks
overnight, rather than in a safe. And careful records are kept on
the disposal of all secret and confidential data before its
shredding and burning; PARD printouts required no such accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PARD data must be kept in secure premises at the weapons
laboratory; by law it cannot be transferred onto unsecured
computers, as the government has charged Dr. Lee with doing.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the case agree that the material Dr. Lee is
accused of downloading contained nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official intimately familiar with the legalities of
the case and strongly supportive of the government's position said
the downloaded data included computer instructions on how to
simulate the design of a nuclear warhead, including exact
dimensions and other geometrical information that when standing
alone would be guarded assiduously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is poking a major hole in the case,'' the
official said of the PARD issue. ``What would be a problem is if
things weren't as alleged in the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stu Nagurka, an Energy Department spokesman, said the agency
``can't comment on the indictment in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration weapons expert strongly contested the
idea that the PARD behind the Lee indictment was any less important
than more concentrated data on nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A duck is a duck is a duck,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team countered, though, that any critical
information was buried in a virtually indecipherable mass of benign
data.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the dispute, Steven Aftergood, a secrecy and
classification expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a
private group in Washington, said the development would throw the
government on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes some of the heat off Wen Ho Lee and puts it on the
government, and particularly on the security system,'' Aftergood
said. ``The murkiness of the classification issue takes this out of
the category of `crown jewels,' `worse than the Rosenbergs' and
`change the strategic balance,''' he added, citing descriptions of
the case. ``It's much more complicated than it seemed at first.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was arrested in December, after years of being
investigated as a possible Chinese spy, the government, in a
59-count indictment, accused him of systematically endangering the
design security of virtually every nuclear warhead in the American
arsenal through unauthorized computer transfers of many of the most
sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   While he is not charged with espionage, the indictment claimed
he acted ``with the intent to secure an advantage to a foreign
nation.'' Most of the data that Lee downloaded is missing. He
claims it was destroyed and insists that his actions were strictly
in the line of scientific duty.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Younger, director of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos,
told the federal court at a December bail hearing that the
downloaded data in the wrong hands could ``change the global
strategic balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the indictment said that in 1993, 1994 and 1997
Lee had illegally transferred secret and confidential restricted
data, the federal term for information on the design, manufacturing
and use of atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But according to ``Grand Jury Exhibit One,'' a 47-page Los
Alamos analysis of material that Lee downloaded in 1993, 1994,
1995, 1996 and 1998, the downloading involved either unclassified
or PARD data. The analysis was filed in the federal courthouse in
Albuquerque as prosecution evidence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A brief reference to PARD was made in Lee's bail hearings in
December when Paula Burnett, a federal prosecutor, asked Cheryl
Wampler, a prosecution witness and the author of the Los Alamos
analysis, what the term meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, it stands for `protect as restricted data,'''
Wampler replied, ``and that is converted into a numbering system''
that in a computer indicates the degree of security. ``It would
have been level five,'' she added. The prosecutor questioned her no
further, and defense lawyers did not pursue the point.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, they discovered that PARD's security ranking was
five on a scale of nine, the highest level being reserved for
secret restricted data.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 Los Alamos security manual defined PARD as ``a handling
method for classified computer system output that is generated as
numerical data or related information and that is not readily
recognized as classified or unclassified because of the high volume
of output and the low density of potentially classified data.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, officials at the weapons laboratory say the category
has long been troublesome, given its ambiguous nature. Though it
was once used widely in the nation's nuclear weapons complex, the
Energy Department, which runs the laboratories, has faulted PARD as
antiquated and risky in terms of security and had moved to
eliminate it, even before the Lee case, said Jim Danneskiold, a Los
Alamos spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said the department had ordered the PARD category
eliminated by June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going away,'' he said. ``In practice, less and less has
been generated over the last five years. It's fairly rare at this
point. New PARD has not been created in years.''
</P>
<P>
   John D. Cline, an Albuquerque lawyer on Lee's legal team,
recently wrote a weapons scientist to say that ``it appears from
the evidence now available that ALL of the files (including data
files and input files) were protected at the PARD level.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cline said, ``We're examining this issue for
its potential benefit to the defense.'' Lee's trial is to begin
Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official agreed with the defense's portrayal of the
PARD ubiquity. But he added that subsequent classification analysis
showed that it was littered with state secrets, many of them major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly confident that there isn't anybody who's going to
be saying it was less than SRD,'' or secret restricted data, the
official said of expert judgments about the downloaded data.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the security of the downloaded data was changed, a
senior official in the Justice Department referred the question to
the Energy Department. A senior official there said the
investigators had evaluated the material Dr. Lee had downloaded and
then discovered it contained highly sensitive material.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation ``was done to determine the sensitivity of the
files,'' resulting in the higher security designations, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher, Lee's lead lawyer, was highly critical of the
government's action. ``The government did not disclose that the
over 20 references to secret restricted data were classifications
made after the investigation started,'' he said in an interview.
``That was never revealed in court or to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Alamos rates these materials as a five on a scale of nine
in terms of sensitivity, and then tells two federal judges that
they are the crown jewels,'' he said. ``So what do they call the
millions of documents at higher levels of classification?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers said the new development makes their client's
actions seem less like the systematic looting of the nation's top
nuclear secrets, as the government contends, and more like a
research misdemeanor, as the defense has argued.
</P>
<P>
   The development is likely to fuel comparisons between the way
the government handled evidence of computer security lapses by a
former director of Central Intelligence, who lost his security
clearance, and by Lee, whose ankles and wrists are shackled during
weekly visits he is allowed to make with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Henson, a former weapons designer at Los Alamos who in
1995 sounded the first alarms about the possibility of Chinese
spies at the laboratory, said Lee had ``probably stretched the
rules'' in downloading PARD but no more. ``Shame on him if he
did,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henson also told of his own missteps with PARD, including
once when a flurry of paper blew out an open laboratory window.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the category deserved to be eliminated as its
goals of achieving both high secrecy and relative openness were
inherently contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably illegal,'' he said of PARD, ``and that's why
they're trying to make it go away.''

 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glee has been replaced by a quiet gloom. Where there was
unchecked optimism there now creeps fear. Worst of all, monumental
profits have turned to stunning losses.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the mood along the fault lines of the Nasdaq stock quake
_ on Wall Street, of course, and in Silicon Valley. But the shock
waves are hardly confined to the capitals of commerce and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are anxious digerati in the heartland, too, in places like
Waterloo, Ontario, the low-key city 90 minutes southwest of Toronto
that is home to Research in Motion Ltd., one of the hottest _ now
coldest _ Nasdaq stocks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   RIM, as it is known, is a 16-year-old company that became an
overnight sensation early this year thanks to its BlackBerry
interactive pagers, beloved by the gadget-minded. Public only since
February 1999, RIM has lost three-quarters of its value, or roughly
$8 billion, in the last six weeks. Most of that was on Wednesday,
after it warned that its marketing costs would rise markedly in the
year ahead. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates, and the
stock fell 63 percent on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Although RIM's rise and fall has been spectacular, it is only
the latest in a long line of highflying Nasdaq stocks that have
dropped to earth in recent days, with investors demonstrating a
positively old-fashioned concern about fundamentals like costs,
sales and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the drama surrounding Research in Motion's movement
makes it something of a microcosm of the overall Nasdaq stock
market, and Waterloo _ without reading too much into the town's
name _ a microcosm of Nasdaq investors.
</P>
<P>
   As RIM's shares were rising _ they climbed from $9.25 last April
to $175.75 in February _ the company naturally became the talk of
its hometown, population 90,000. The move made billionaires out of
its co-chief executives, James Balsillie and Michael Lazardis.
</P>
<P>
   It also set fire to the local real estate market, just as the
bull market in technology stocks has done in New York and Silicon
Valley. The highest price paid for a home in the Waterloo area this
year was the roughly $960,000 that was paid _ in cash _ by a
Research in Motion employee just weeks ago, according to Helen
Alpaugh, an associate broker at Re/Max Twin City Realty. That
amount was more than double the average price for so-called
executive homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   After RIM successfully raised $150 million in a secondary
offering of stock in October, the company held a lavish party to
celebrate its fantastic good fortunes. RIM invited 1,800 people to
the event at Lulu's, a local nightclub, according to Kevin Crowley,
a technology reporter at The Kitchener-Waterloo Record, a regional
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The guests included employees, friends and students from the
nearby University of Waterloo, which produces many technology
entrepreneurs. Entertainment was supplied by the Barenaked Ladies,
a white-hot Canadian rock group whose hits include a ditty called
``If I Had a Million Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   RIM's rocketing stock also generated a flood of charitable
donations. Barely a month ago, when the shares were near their
peak, two computer programmers gave $13 million in RIM stock to the
Kitchener-Waterloo Community Foundation _ the largest contribution
it ever received, according to one board member.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the foundation sold the shares almost
immediately, cashing in near the top.
</P>
<P>
   The only unpleasantness surrounding Research in Motion's climb
over the last few months was a malady known about town as RIM envy.
It was a local version of the split in the overall market between
the haves _ those who invested in Nasdaq stocks _ and the
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   In doughnut shops and fast-food places around town, people were
constantly moaning about having missed out on the Big Move.
``People really got caught up in the story,'' Crowley said. ``It's
the emblem of the high-tech industry: the volatility, the glamour
and potential profit for shareholders here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to locals, the stock's spectacular rise drew new,
unsophisticated investors into the market. Robert C. Caldwell,
principal at the Caldwell Capital Corp., a local independent
brokerage firm, had a ringside seat for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in town bought the stock,'' Caldwell said.
``We've got shares on our books from the issue price and all the
way up. Most individuals have been holding it, tending to view it
as a long-term investment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the big decline in the middle of the week, the mood of
those investors was subdued, he said. ``We're not all that
surprised that there's been some profit-taking,'' he added. ``We're
surprised at the depth of the profit-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, RIM envy has disappeared. A local financial
adviser said reports from inside the company told of a somber mood
among employees. Neither Balsillie nor Lazardis returned calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, many Research in Motion workers are
putting a brave face on the stock's devastating decline. Liam Bali,
manager of Curry in a Hurry, a local restaurant favored by young
RIM employees, said they did not appear to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty aware that stocks do fluctuate,'' he said.
``They are very firm in their technology. They are expecting their
stock will increase tenfold within the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Denizens of the Internet chat rooms where the stock has been
popular are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man it sure hurts hitting the bottom,'' began a Wednesday
posting by a company fan using the moniker ``Me loves money'' in a
Raging Bull chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been buying the whole way down but am now nearly all in
and have no more pesos to bring to the party,'' the post said.
``Where are we going from here?''
</P>
<P>
   Another Wednesday post read: ``It not only hit bottom, but dug
another six feet down. It's going to be a long summer people.''

   IRELAND: IRA KILLINGS INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   The government will re-examine charges that the Irish police may
have helped Irish Republican Army guerrillas single out victims in
a dozen border area killings in the 1980s and 1990s. Justice
Minister John O'Donoghue said he did not believe the allegations
but that ``every effort must be made to reassure the public that
they have been thoroughly investigated.'' The deaths included those
of Northern Ireland's former lord chief justice, Maurice Gibson,
and four members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl has collected more than $3.7
million, more than enough to pay $3.15 million in fines imposed
against his conservative Christian Democratic Union for illegal
campaign financing during his years in power. Focus magazine said
he collected $2.8 million among business friends and personally
contributed $350,000 from a mortgage on his house. The remainder
came from cash donations. Kohl has admitted accepting just over $1
million in secret payments between 1993 and 1998.

   Regional elections in Italy usually measure the support of the

presidents will also test the strength of new alliances within the
center-right opposition. Campaigning by cruise ship against the
center-left government of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recently formed alliances with the
separatist Northern League and, in some regions, the Italian Social
Movement, the last remaining faction of Italy's Fascists.

BUSH FUND RAISING TOPS $80 MILLION; GAIN FOR DEMOCRATS; FALWELL

<P>
   BUSH FUNDS TOP $80 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly $70 million to secure the Republican
presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush has continued his
record-shattering fund-raising pace by exceeding $80 million. The
Bush campaign raised about $6.9 million from March 1 to April 6,
more than three-quarters of its goal of raising $10 million in
March and April, a campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, said
Friday. Bush's campaign treasury received a significant boost by
the campaign's new emphasis on Internet fund raising. A blizzard of
solicitations sent by e-mail has helped raise $1.6 million online.
</P>
<P>
   GAIN FOR DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   In the race for control of Congress, most nationwide polls are
showing Democrats and Republicans fairly even. In the latest, a
Zogby America Poll conducted April 1-4, Democrats came out 4
percentage points ahead of Republicans when voters were asked which
party's candidate they expected to vote for in their district.
Zogby has shown a tie in this poll for the last several months, and
two weeks ago found the Democrats with only a 1-point advantage.
The Democratic candidate was the preference of 38 percent of the
842 likely voters surveyed nationwide, and the Republican was the
choice of 34 percent. Since there is a 3-point margin of sampling
error for each party, the 4-point difference is still not
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   FALWELL IN REGISTRATION EFFORT
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has begun a voter registration drive that
he says is intended to enlist millions of religious believers as
voters. Falwell, an independent Baptist minister who founded the
former Moral Majority in 1979 to get religious conservatives
involved in politics, calls the effort People of Faith 2000. Its
advisory committee includes the Rev. Paige Patterson, president of
the Southern Baptist Convention, and Richard Viguerie, the
conservative direct-mail specialist.
</P>
<P>
   AD ON NUCLEAR WASTE BILL
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Nevada continued to make hay out of the House
Republicans' insistence earlier this week that President Clinton
sign a bill creating a national nuclear waste disposal site in the
state, running a new radio ad portraying Gov. George W. Bush as
sympathetic to both the plan and the nuclear power industry. The
commercial says nuclear power concerns have given Bush ``hundreds
of thousands of dollars'' and notes that Republicans voted
overwhelmingly for the plan, though it is opposed by many Nevadans,
including the Republican candidate for Senate, John Ensign. Bush
has not detailed his position on the plan, but Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., and Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, have said they
believe he favors the measure. President Clinton has promised to
veto it.

BRITISH CONSORTIUM MAKES COUNTERBID FOR ROVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs next to last graf to give stock prices in dollars as well as
euros) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ BMW AG of Germany said Friday it had received a
counterbid for its money-losing Rover division from a British
consortium seeking to rescue the Rover name and thwart plans by the
venture capitalist firm Alchemy Partners to turn the company into a
niche producer.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's most prominent member is John Towers, a former
chief executive of Rover in the early days of its ownership by BMW,
which bought the company for $1.2 billion six years ago in what
became a nightmare investment of losses. Last year Rover lost $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Towers, Rover's chief executive from 1994 to 1996, did not
return calls to his business headquarters in the English Midlands,
where he runs a privately held components company called
Concentric. The consortium is thought to include Rover dealers and
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Juerg Dinner, a BMW spokesman in Munich, said Towers'
bid was received Friday _ just days after an exploratory meeting
between Towers and BMW executives _ and would be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner indicated that the new bid _ for which no financial
details were immediately available _ was for the same troubled
Rover plant at Longbridge near Birmingham as last month's bid by
London-based Alchemy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy has said that it plans to phase out the Rover brand,
with thousands of job losses, and begin producing a much smaller
number of sporty sedans under the MG name.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW spokesman said exclusive negotiations with Alchemy were
expected to end soon. ``If the new bid has substance, we may
discuss it after the conclusion of the Alchemy negotiations,''
Dinner said. Some German analysts, however, suggested that the
counter-bid had only limited chances of success because BMW's
negotiations with Alchemy were so far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   BMW was said by people with knowledge of the Alchemy deal to
have offered the Longbridge plant to Alchemy at virtual fire-sale
prices, free of debt and with net assets valued at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   News of Alchemy's plans for job reductions sent shock-waves
through the plant's 9,000-employee work-force and provoked a bitter
spat between BMW and the British government. It also spurred the
government to offer a $203 million aid package for the region
around Longbridge, where tens of thousands of jobs in the supply
industry depend on the the auto plant.
</P>
<P>
   British officials made no secret of their approval for the
counter-bid, but said there was no direct government involvement in
it. They also said they believed the bid would extend Rover's life
as a mass volume automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, Britain's trade and industry minister, said
Towers' proposals for the Longbridge plant ``offers a better
prospect than perhaps anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Nagle, a spokeswoman for Byers, said the British
government had always said it would prefer Rover to remain as a
volume car-producer. She said the British government would consider
supporting Rover financially if Towers' bid were successful.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   British newspapers have reported that Towers wants to use the
Longbridge plant to manufacture a new, midrange Rover car _ the R30
_ and to take over production of a revamped Mini car which BMW had
planned to keep on producing itself. BMW's deal with Alchemy last
month was combined with a separate agreement to sell the Land Rover
sport utility vehicle division to Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alchemy said the company had no direct knowledge
of the counterbid and planned to conclude its negotiations with BMW
by the end of April. Reflecting investors' worries that the
counterbid could slow BMW's disposal of Rover, BMW shares fell 1.2
euros ($1.1532), or 3.74 percent, to close at 30.9 euros ($29.6946)
in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry analysts said, the consortium could need to come
up with an offer of around $1.3 billion to take over the R30 and
the Mini from BMW. But there was no immediate confirmation of this
from either BMW or the consortium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't happened quickly, to be sure, nor as wholeheartedly as
some might wish, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art seems to have
come clean about the checkered practices of its first director,
Luigi Palma di Cesnola, from his extralegal collecting to his
mix-and-match melding of ancient sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Four new galleries permanently display about 600 impressive
antiquities that Cesnola unearthed in Cyprus while he was United
States consul there from 1865 to 1876, and the presentation is as
interesting as the collection. The wall texts, the new catalog and
especially the descriptive captions attest not only to a shift from
artifice to authenticity in public taste but also to a greater
measure of truth-telling about museum policies.
</P>
<P>
   Cesnola sold some 35,000 pieces to the Metropolitan in 1873-76
for around $60,000, and in return the museum trustees agreed to
hire him as director, a post Cesnola held from 1879 until his death
in 1904. Yet in his hunger for fame, Cesnola sutured together
different pieces of sculptures and lied about the location of his
finds and the treasures he uncovered. So though the collection is
the finest of its kind outside Cyprus it has for the most part
languished in storerooms, an awkward token of discredited
make-believe and shady methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while these latest revisions to the record seem to
represent a clear movement from fraud to truth, the idea of what
constitutes authenticity in art has often been as much a function
of taste as of history.
</P>
<P>
   In art history, indeed, the color of truth is often gray. As
John Onians, author of ``Classical Art and the Cultures of Greece
and Rome'' (1999) and director of the Britain's World Art Research
Program in East Anglia, put it in an interview: ``Once
restorations, however debatable, become part of cultural history,
they acquire their own interest and value. For evidence, simply
look into the works of Francis Haskell.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell's magnum opus, ``Taste and the Antique: The Lure of
Classical Sculpture'' (1981), written with another Oxford scholar,
Nicholas Penny, documents the pervasive influence of restorations.
For example, the hands and feet, the arms and legs, of such
celebrated works as the Laocoon, the Dying Gladiator, the
Discobolus and the Apollo Belvedere are in varying degrees
conjectural implants. But for the inability of restorers to agree,
limbs would probably have been attached by the Louvre to the most
famous of female torsos, the Venus de Milo.
</P>
<P>
   Louis XIV commissioned a complete set of plaster casts of the
finest antique sculptures in Italy, initiating a craze that
persisted into the 20th century. No English country house was
deemed complete without its gleaming copies, so that classical
sculpture was considered inseparable from a white pallor. Novelists
alluded to these carvings as if they were sacred relics. In Henry
James' ``Portrait of a Lady,'' the American Isabel Archer finds
herself alone in ``the glorious room, among the shining antique
marbles'' in the Roman Capitol, where she rests her eyes on ``their
blank beautiful faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the zeal with which restorers at the British Museum
scrubbed off the color that once tinted the Parthenon sculptures,
according to the latest edition of William St. Clair's ``Lord Elgin
and the Marbles'' (Oxford University Press, 1998). The museum has
now adopted a firm restoration policy of marking each modern
addition, going so far that one curator there fears that it is too
hard for the viewer to imagine how pieces looked before.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about authenticity and what constitutes a true
representation of past art is long-running. Arguments broke out in
1880 soon after the Met unveiled the Cesnola collection at the
museum's grand opening in its new quarters in Central Park. A
French art dealer, Gaston Feuardent, sneered that the restorations
were incompetent or fraudulent, resulting in a protracted lawsuit
in which Cesnola prevailed. Nonetheless even his defenders were
uneasily aware that he was a fabulist with a zestful delight in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   With his great cape, pince-nez and walrus mustache, Cesnola had
the bearing and breeding of a soldier of fortune. Born of lesser
nobility in the Italian Piedmont in 1832 and trained as a Sardinian
cavalry officer, he fought briefly in the Crimea and Italy's wars
of independence before immigrating to the United States around
1858. When the Civil War broke out, Cesnola made his mark as a
cavalry colonel, and later claimed that Lincoln orally promoted him
to general only days before the President's assassination. A
general's gilded epaulettes thereafter adorned Cesnola's portraits,
and at the museum he was called general.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Cesnola won a political plum, the American
consul's office in Cyprus. The island was part of the Ottoman
Empire, which however otherwise poor was rich in antiquities.
Cesnola secured a permit, or a firman, for excavations in Cyprus,
assembling a collection that he shipped to Britain in 1872 in a
timely evasion of a Turkish ban on the export of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   While still consul, he courted buyers in Britain, France,
Germany, Russia and the United States. When the Met made the
winning bid, Cesnola returned to Cyprus for further campaigns,
discovered the Kourion Treasure and published an imaginative
account of his discoveries, ``Cyprus: Its Ancient Cities, Tombs and
Temples'' (1878). But Cesnola, aware that his prizes were carved in
limestone rather than marble, and in an eclectic style, used glue
and chisel to give them a more classical flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Marangou, a young Cypriot archaeologist, asserts that much
of Cesnola's collection was smashed in transit and imaginatively
glued together by Cesnola with the help of a German cabinetmaker.
In her spirited volume on Cesnola's ``Life and Deeds,'' published
by the Popular Bank in Nicosia to coincide with the gallery
opening, she argues that Cesnola's aim when possible was to give
sculptures a spurious association with the temple of Aphrodite,
near where the goddess was said to have emerged from the sea, even
adding cult objects like mirrors to statuary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Metropolitan's new galleries, the hallmark is understated
candor. The provenance of most works is phrased ``Said to be from
...'' since Cesnola scorned excavation records. Running like a
doleful leitmotif through the catalog are such comments as
``Cesnola's `restorations' have drastically altered this unusual
sculpture'' and ``these heads may not have originally belonged to
the bodies.'' All traces of color _ once covered with a wash or
otherwise scrubbed out to accord with prevailing taste _ are now
noted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS)
</P>
<P>
   Some art historians would have preferred going further, removing
all modern accretions and using wires rather than plaster when
necessary, as is the current practice at the Louvre. This is the
view of Joan Breton Connelly of New York University, who wrote her
doctoral dissertation on the Cesnola collection. Although she
complimented the galleries as ``great and glorious'' in a telephone
interview, she said that she would have purged all of Cesnola's
supposed improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Noble, an authority on classical pottery and a former
vice director of the Metropolitan, praised the candid labeling and
the chronological arrangement that shows how Greek, Persian and
Egyptian styles mixed in the Cypriot melting pot. ( Noble was
famous as a scourge of fakes, once saying: ``All forgeries are like
vampires. They should have a knife driven through their heart.'')
He did however, have a kinder word for Cesnola's alleged
overcleaning, since in Noble's view excavated pieces are often
stained by lime or root marks, and their cleaning can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even Marangou praises the new candor of the installation, adding
that she hopes it will help rebut the canard that Cypriots showed a
mercenary indifference to their island's ancient art. She points
out that it was not peasants but the Metropolitan trustees who
approved the sale at auction of as many as 20,000 pieces from the
Cesnola collection in the 1920s. The auction is described in the
new Cesnola catalog but is not mentioned in the gallery wall texts.
Old reflexes, it would seem, die slowly.

KINGS OUT OF IT ALREADY? DON'T BE SO SURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Not even the kids with posters of Luc Robitaille and
Rob Blake on their bedroom walls think the Kings have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The team claims it is not down, but it is down a game to the
mighty Detroit Red Wings, who didn't even need their best player,
Steve Yzerman, to beat the Kings 2-0 to open this best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   Kings management has asked the crowd to wear black for Games 3
and 4 back in Los Angeles. Fans must be wondering if they will be
dressing for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Kings dressing room before Friday's practice at Joe
Louis Arena, a player stood with a story to tell. Kelly Buchberger
was playing for the No. 8-seed Edmonton Oilers in April 1997.
Across the ice were the Dallas Stars, two years away from a Stanley
Cup but the top team in the Western Conference that season.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next, when the Oilers came back after losing the
first game in the first round to pull off one of the most stunning
upsets in NHL postseason history, is the reason teams play 82 games
to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of similarities,'' said Buchberger, who came
over from expansion Atlanta in March to bolster the Kings'
character. ``We thought we matched up well against the Stars in
Game 1, and we knew we had really taken it to them physically. I
mean we played every shift like it was our last. I don't think they
knew we had that in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years earlier, the Oilers were gushing with talent when
they took a 5-0 lead into the third period against the Kings in
Game 3 of Round One, a game that became known as the ``Miracle on
Manchester.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Kings tie the game in the final five seconds of
regulation, but they won it in overtime on a goal by Daryl Evans
and went on to take the best-of-five series. Edmonton advanced to
the finals the next year then won five of the next seven Stanley
Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go into the third period thinking we were going to
win the game,'' said Evans, now a Kings broadcaster. ``We just
wanted to outplay them the final 20 minutes and try to get a little
momentum for the rest of the series. Just think, we were 48 points
behind Edmonton during the regular season. How's that for an
underdog?''
</P>
<P>
   When Game 2 is played at 11 a.m. this morning, Yzerman is
expected to be in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether Buchberger's words can close the gap on
a team that scored 108 points during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings know they got the Red Wings' attention. Scotty
Bowman was upset that the Red Wings, who had the league's best
power play, went 0 for 6 with the man advantage and didn't put it
away until Sergei Fedorov's empty-netter in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger said he wasn't sure Dallas had that kind of respect
when the team's met three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton rebounded to win Game 2 4-0, but the series was kind of
a yawn. The turning point came at the end of Game 3 when the Stars
blew a two-goal lead with three minutes to play in regulation.
Edmonton tied the game, then won at the 9:15 mark of overtime on a
goal by _ Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were devastated,'' he said. ``You could see it in their
eyes. They were the overwhelming favorite, but suddenly they were
vulnerable. This was supposed to be easy for them. But we were the
team with the focus. They never recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Stars came back to win the next game, just as
Edmonton did after returning from Evans' ``Miracle.'' But the
mental approach changed for both favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember Edmonton in our year was on their way to
being maybe the greatest team of all time,'' Evans said. ``But they
found out we could score on them. It was like we knew something
they didn't. That bothered them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however one clear difference between the Stars and
Oilers and these Red Wings. Those teams had not won the Stanley
Cup. Detroit has won it two of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there isn't much they haven't seen,'' said
Buchberger, who won two Stanley Cup rings with he Oilers. ``But we
know they haven't seen us at our best yet.''

NCAA HEARS FROM CSUN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the Cal State Northridge football
team's spring scrimmage, coach Jeff Kearin was 2,000 miles away,
testifying before the NCAA's infractions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin and at least three CSUN officials _ interim president
Louanne Kennedy, athletic director Dick Dull and faculty athletics
representative Tom Shannon _ appeared at the committee's
closed-door hearing in Indianapolis Friday. However, all that is
assumed because the NCAA has issued no press release and it won't
acknowledge the hearing took place.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is one of the final steps in the NCAA's
investigation into the school's handling of its inquiry into the
football program last summer that resulted in the firing of coach
Ron Ponciano, the forced resignation of assistant Rob Phenicie and
self-imposed penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano and his lawyer, Scott Campbell, also were scheduled to
answer questions for the infractions committee. Ponciano contends
in his settlement claim for wrongful termination that the
university's report, released last August, is ``flawed as it is
long.''

LOS ANGELES TIMES TO GET NEW PUBLISHER AND EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Fla., Ky.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times, whose newsroom staged a revolution last
year against the newspaper's leadership, will be turned over to new
leadership soon after the merger of its parent company, Times
Mirror, with Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   According to editors briefed by top newsroom leaders on Thursday
evening, Michael Parks, the editor, will be replaced by John S.
Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, another Times Mirror
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Kathryn M. Downing, will be replaced by John
Puerner, who is president and publisher of The Orlando Sentinel but
has been working with Tribune and Times Mirror executives in recent
weeks reviewing The Los Angeles Times' operations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when the formal announcement of the new
appointments will be made, because the $8 billion merger deal is
not complete.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever the announcement comes, it is clear that in pairing
Carroll and Puerner, Tribune executives are arranging a marriage of
a highly respected figure in the old media world and an energetic
apostle of the possibilities of new media.
</P>
<P>
   Puerner, as publisher of The Orlando Sentinel, has worked with
the editor, L. John Haile, to turn The Sentinel into a showcase of
the Tribune's ambitions in multimedia reporting and news delivery.
At the age of 49, he is fluent in the Internet language, say
executives who know him well. Last fall, he helped engineer a
partnership intended to bring The Sentinel's news to Central
Florida users of Sprint's high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and courtly, Carroll made his reputation in a world where
dot-com companies were still unknown. Now 58, he has pursued a
reporting and editing career based on intense scrutiny of public
institutions and resistance to intimidation from those who disliked
his work, including the U.S. military in Vietnam and University of
Kentucky basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   In 27 years of editing, Carroll has helped journalists win six
Pulitzer prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Acel Moore, an associate editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer who
credits Carroll, his former city editor, with helping bring him and
a colleague a 1977 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting,
said, ``He's a man who will genuinely guard and protect
journalistic integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves are apparently intended, at least in part, to calm the
still-simmering resentments at The Los Angeles Times over the
decision of Downing to share revenues from a special issue of the
newspaper's Sunday magazine with the Staples Center, the sports
arena that was the focus of the magazine's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has said he learned of the Staples Center decision, for
which Downing apologized, after the magazine was printed, but he
made no move to scuttle the issue or inform readers of the deal. He
later said he regretted his failure to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore early this year, after the Nieman Foundation
curator Bill Kovach announced that he was stepping down, it became
clear that Carroll, who had been the top editor at The Sun since
1991, and was a top editor in Lexington, Ky., for 12 years before
that, was mulling over his future.
</P>
<P>
   By early last month, Carroll had made plans to let his
publisher, Michael Waller, know that he was talking with Harvard
University about becoming the Nieman curator, and planned to accept
if the job was offered, said a person familiar with Carroll's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then on March 13 came the announcement of the $8 billion merger
between Tribune Co. and Times Mirror. Now Jack Fuller, the
president of Tribune Publishing, needed to hear Carroll's news.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller did not want to hear it. Within three weeks, the person
said, Fuller made his counteroffer. Carroll was asked to leave The
Baltimore Sun, with its 385 journalists and a circulation of
315,000, to become the editor of The Los Angeles Times, with its
more than 1,000 journalists and a circulation of 1,078,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At The Times, the enthusiastic reviews of Carroll's former
colleagues heartened many journalists who were still sore from the
series of shocks that the past six months had brought. Some, like
John Arthur, a managing editor, made a point of praising Parks as
``an excellent editor'' who had endured ``difficult
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, who declined to be identified, worried that two
Easterners from smaller papers would have trouble understanding the
complexities of their newspaper and of Los Angeles.

ALBERT TURNER, 64, ADVISER TO MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ind.)   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Turner, a civil rights leader and adviser to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., died on Thursday in Selma, Ala. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's heart stopped while he was being prepared for an
operation to stop abdominal bleeding, said his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Turner helped lead the voting rights march from Selma to
Montgomery, on March 7, 1965. Stick-wielding state troopers turned
the peaceful protesters back on the Edmund Pettus Bridge over the
Alabama River in a confrontation that became known as Bloody
Sunday. Protesters were beaten, chased and tear-gassed. Turner,
wearing a cap, can be seen in contemporary photographs of the front
lines of marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the events of that day, Turner said in an interview:
``I fell down and ran. Then I fell down again and ran some more.''
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Chestnut, a Selma lawyer and longtime friend of Turner,
said, ``Whenever there was something of unusual danger, and nobody
wanted to, you could count on the fact that Albert and John Lewis
would lead it.'' Lewis later became a Democratic congressman from
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who was Alabama field secretary for the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference at the height of the civil rights
movement, was chosen three years after the march to lead the mule
wagon that carried the body of King at his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a sharecropper, Turner was born on Feb. 29, 1936, in
a four-room shack outside Marion, Ala. He was the fourth of 12
children. He studied bricklaying and later graduated from Alabama
A&AMP;M. In July 1963, with the help of a federal injunction, Turner
and about 40 others registered to vote at the county courthouse in
Marion. Lawsuits surrounding these efforts to register formed a
model for President Lyndon B. Johnson's voting-rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do not know of a single individual in Alabama who has
given more to the political progress of African-Americans in this
state than Albert,'' Chestnut said. ``Albert would hide the fact
that he would have a college degree, because he was trying to reach
always those people at the bottom. Martin understood that, and
that's what endeared Albert to Martin, and why Albert was the point
man in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Evelyn, Turner was cleared of voter fraud in the
1980s, when prosecutors charged them with altering absentee ballots
collected from rural blacks.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``not guilty'' verdict, President Ronald Reagan
nominated Turner's prosecutor, Jefferson B. Sessions, to the U.S.
District Court in Alabama. The nomination died in the Senate
Judicial Committee after concerns were raised about the voter-fraud
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indictments come because blacks have gotten too well
organized for political empowerment in the Black Belt of Alabama,''
Turner said at the time he was acquitted. ``They didn't spend a
million dollars because they think a few old folks' ballots were
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Turner, an insurance salesman, served on the
Perry County Commission, where he was active in preserving adequate
health care in the county, where many hospitals serving rural
communities are closing. He was also on the search committee to
find a new police chief for Marion, the county seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very smart and knowledgeable about politics in this
area of Alabama,'' said another commissioner, Charles LeCroy. ``He
supported everything King advocated, and he brought his people up
socially, economically and politically during his time in office.
He'll be missed by people here in Perry County.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is survived by his wife; three sons, Barrett of
Indianapolis, Eric of Birmingham, Ala., and Albert Jr. of Marion; a
daughter, Eldra Marcus of Tuskegee, Ala.; nine brothers and
sisters, and five grandchildren.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In ``Arthur,'' America's most popular children's
cartoon show, Buster is a floppy-eared rabbit who loves playing
detective. But if ``Antenna Ears'' could hop off the drawing boards
here at the Cinar Corp., he would run into a rich trove of
mysteries without leaving the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, why did Ronald Weinberg and Micheline Charest,
Cinar's husband-and-wife founders, shovel $122 million _ the
equivalent of one year's revenue _ into an obscure Bahamas
investment fund last year without telling their board? Why did
Cinar put the name of Micheline's sister Helene on 115 cartoon
episodes she did not write, earning Cinar about $650,000 in
royalties that later had to be repaid? And did Cinar, as some
politicians contend, falsely credit Canadians for the work of
American scriptwriters to get Canadian government subsidies?
</P>
<P>
   Although Buster and his classmate Arthur, an 8-year-old
aardvark, neatly solve mysteries by the end of a half-hour episode,
the questions about Cinar remain unanswered more than a month after
word of the Bahamas investments became public. That news wiped out
three-quarters of the company's market value before trading was
suspended in Canada and on Nasdaq. Angry shareholders have filed
class-action lawsuits, and the company is under investigation by
securities watchdogs and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the answers, presumably, could come from Weinberg and
Charest, who started the company in 1976, shortly before moving
here from the United States to pursue a dream of making nonviolent
cartoons. But on their lawyers' advice, they aren't saying much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of misinformation has come out since last October,''
Weinberg, 48, said by telephone Thursday from the couple's home in
Montreal's exclusive Westmount neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In another brief conversation Friday afternoon, Charest, 46,
said, ``It has been very frustrating not to be able to talk.'' Amid
the furor, she has resigned her positions on the boards of Quebec's
largest supermarket chain, Canada's largest telephone company and
North America's largest printing company.
</P>
<P>
   Reports say Cinar is up for sale, though its fate will be
determined by the couple, who remain on their company's board and
who jointly control 62 percent of the voting shares. Cinar's new
bosses have brought in psychologists to counsel depressed workers.
</P>
<P>
   But they say work on new cartoon series is under way _ and
officials of WGBH, the Boston public television station that is
co-producer of ``Arthur,'' promise that new episodes will be on the
air this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we are sitting here on our knees is not accurate
at all,'' said Peter Moss, president of Cinar Entertainment, the
company's production unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founders got in a big mess,'' Moss said. ``But that is
something happening at the corporate level. The creative level of
the company is as strong as ever. They fell. We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Arthur,'' other animated and live-action series that
Cinar sells to programmers in 150 countries include ``Wimzie's
House,'' ``Are You Afraid of the Dark?'' and ``The Busy World of
Richard Scarry.''
</P>
<P>
   The squall buffeting Cinar has exposed more than skulduggery
behind the scenes of the outwardly benign world of children's
television. As regulators in Washington decide whether to renew an
arrangement that speeds the listing of Canadian companies on
American exchanges, the Cinar scandal has given fresh life to
worries that Canada has lax oversight of publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   And in both Hollywood and Montreal, a growing center for
``runaway'' film and animation productions from the United States,
the affair is opening a debate over Ottawa's policy of giving
multimillion-dollar subsidies to support the production of Canadian
movies and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make an interesting movie one day _ but not a
cartoon, because too many investors have been burned, because the
reputation of Canada's leading stock exchange has been called into
question,'' said J. Richard Finlay, a management consultant who
runs the Center for Corporate and Public Governance, a private
policy research organization in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Cinar's woes are just the latest to tarnish the reputation of
the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's leading stock market.
Companies that have collapsed in scandal under Toronto's watch are
Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a prospecting company; Livent Inc., the
theater company founded by the producer Garth Drabinsky; and YBM
Magnex International Inc., which the American authorities accused
of having links to the Russian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinar is bad because we had the benefit of all those previous
disasters, and yet we see the same recurring problem: a company
board dominated by insiders,'' Finlay said.
</P>
<P>
   Until March 6, four of the nine members of Cinar's board were
insiders: the founders; Marie-Josee Corbeil, who remains executive
vice president of Cinar Entertainment; and Hasanain Panju, who was
the company's senior executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the company announced that Weinberg and Charest had
resigned their executive posts _ though not their board seats _ and
that Panju had been fired and kicked off the board. Though Cinar's
new management initially blamed Panju for the offshore dealings, a
company spokeswoman, Suzan Ayscough, later said Weinberg signed
several of the transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Charest was also aware of the transfers, according to an
affidavit filed in a Bahamas court by Nicholas Martin Hodson, a
fraud investigator in Toronto for Ernst &AMP; Young, Cinar's auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Panju, who declined to be interviewed, has acknowledged his role
in transferring some of the money, but said through his lawyer that
he did nothing wrong and that all of the money invested in the
Bahamas would be returned to Cinar. Jacques Rossignol, the lawyer,
said that he was preparing a wrongful-dismissal suit against the
company and asserted that Panju was being made a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one sacrificed for this,'' Rossignol said.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto exchange has guidelines intended to guarantee
independent, outside control of company boards, including the
recommendation that an independent director serve as chairman. At
Cinar, Charest held that post until last month, when she was
replaced by Lawrence P. Yelin, a Montreal lawyer and longtime Cinar
director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Exchange officials declined to comment on Cinar's problems. But
David Brown, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission, one of
the two Canadian regulatory agencies investigating Cinar, warned in
a speech in late March that Canada ``faces the prospect of falling
behind'' Britain and the United States in making boards independent
of management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could open a corporate credibility gap _ one that could
erode confidence in Canadian board practices and undermine
investment in Canada,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an especially untimely development, given that in
Washington, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the
status of a unique, nine-year-old arrangement that gives virtually
automatic SEC approval to securities documents prepared in Canada
according to American guidelines. In those nine years, Canadian
companies have raised more than $150 billion through debt and
equity issues in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The comment period on the plan closed last summer, and SEC
officials will say only that the agreement is still under review. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Bloc Quebecois members of parliament made their
accusations last fall that Cinar was slapping ``made in Canada''
labels on American cartoons, the company ordered Ernst &AMP; Young to
conduct an internal audit. It led in unexpected directions, and on
Feb. 18, the board was briefed for the first time on the Bahamian
fund transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard `Norshield, Norshield, Bahamas,''' recalled one of
the outside board members, who asked not to be identified _ and the
directors, this person said, asked, ``What's that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation from the auditors was that $122 million in
corporate funds had been invested secretly with Norshield
International Ltd., a Bahamas affiliate of the Norshield Financial
Group, a Montreal investment house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt betrayed; we were lied to,'' this board member said.
``Emotions ran quite high.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to save his position, Weinberg sent a letter on March
2 to Norshield in Nassau _ marked ``urgent, urgent, urgent'' _
demanding that the money be transferred to Cinar's account with a
Canadian bank there, according to Hodson's affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Norshield refused, saying that the money, plus any investment
gains, would be returned gradually this year as investments
matured, with the final payment scheduled for Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the money, they continue to manage the money, and
they will pay it back on time,'' said William Urseth, a Norshield
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Cinar's new leadership remains suspicious, noting that the
company had to go to court in the Bahamas late last month to force
Norshield to disclose where the money was invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``What investor do you know of that won't show the client where
his funds are invested?'' asked Barrie Usher, the former insurance
company executive brought in to be president and chief executive of
Cinar after the founders stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   That suit has been suspended, however, and Norshield is now
giving the Cinar board an inventory of the investments. Both sides,
now bound by a confidentially agreement, will say little more.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Dent, an analyst who follows the Canadian entertainment
industry for Yorkton Securities in Toronto, remains skeptical. ``If
there was nothing going on except conventional investing, I don't
know why the people in the Bahamas were so reluctant to reveal
details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such skepticism about Cinar and its business dealings was in
short supply until very recently. Dazzled by a share price that
leapt an average of 50 percent a year in the late 1990s,
journalists and investors seemed to have forgotten to ask the tough
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Canadian Business magazine wrote glowingly: ``If you
missed out on Disney, one of the best investment opportunities of
the century, consider Cinar Corp. This Montreal production house
delivers big _ and consistent _ payoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article a few months earlier in Maclean's, Canada's
leading news weekly, David McFadgen, an entertainment analyst with
Griffiths, McBurney &AMP; Partners, called Cinar ``an incredible
success story.'' Reached after the stock collapse, he said: ``How
were we supposed to know? We rely on their auditors. We can't go in
and audit their books.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the flow of cash over a year's time to the Bahamas was
not detected by Ernst &AMP; Young, which declined to comment on the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Cinar news release has termed the Bahamas investments
``unauthorized,'' relations between Cinar and Norshield have been
close for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Marleau, who served on Cinar's board from 1993 to 1998,
is president of Palos Capital, a merchant banking firm in Montreal
that is part of Norshield Financial. Last November, Mario Ricci,
who as Cinar's vice president for operations signed off on several
cash transfers to the Bahamas, left to become Norshield Financial's
vice president for finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say this looks cozy, but not to me,'' said Dale
Smith, the chief financial officer of Norshield Financial. ``It's a
free world. People are allowed to move from one company to another
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Marleau and Ricci did not return telephone messages seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of what often seems an uphill effort to promote Canadian
cultural identity, Ottawa doles out millions of dollars annually to
support film and television production by Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   And Cinar has been a major beneficiary. In 1998, the last year
for which the company has issued complete financial reports,
Cinar's total government subsidies equaled its profits _ about $15
million. From 1993, the year Cinar went public, through 1998, the
company received about $50 million in subsidies, substantially more
than its reported total earnings of about $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is trying to determine
how much, if any, of those thin profits came from fraud.

 MONTREAL: from fraud.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agency's investigation began after opposition lawmakers used
their parliamentary immunity to levy accusations on the floor of
the House of Commons in October. They say Cinar had illegally
obtained federal tax credits by claiming Canadian authorship for
scripts that in fact had been written by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for Cinar were huge. If American work was
passed off as Canadian, television networks here could demand
refunds. By law, they must broadcast a daily quota of Canadian-made
programs, which invariably are more expensive than imported ones.
Even the tax write-offs that Cinar took for donating to museums the
original artwork of supposedly Canadian-made cartoons could be
called into question.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Cinar officials sought to deflect the parliamentary
accusations, saying they were motivated by partisan politics.
Indeed, Cinar has cultivated good relations with Canada's ruling
Liberal Party. A Liberal senator, Jack Austin, sits on the board,
and Micheline Charest has been an important Liberal Party donor and
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But just before Christmas came the first confirmation that Cinar
was giving credit for scripts where none was due.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, Charest wrote a check to reimburse European
television customers for royalties they had paid her sister Helene
for scripts she had not written. Helene Charest, a stockbroker in
Quebec City, did not return telephone messages, though
investigators say she has cooperated with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did speak to Helene Charest, and she was straightforward
and she admitted that she never wrote any stories or any scripts at
all,'' said Sgt. Pierre-Yves Carrier, a Mountie spokesman in
Montreal. The Mounties are continuing to investigate the
allegations that the true authors of many Cinar scripts have been
Americans, not Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at what that investigation will conclude, Cinar said on
March 10 that it would have to revise its financial statements for
the last three years, ``for issues related to tax incentives,
disclosure of related party transactions and unauthorized
transactions.'' The restated financials will be ready at the end of
May, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for shareholders in the class-action suits argue that
misrepresentations by Cinar inflated share prices. ``From 75 to 90
percent of their net profits were composed of tax credits,'' said
one of the lawyers, Paul Unterberg, of Unterberg, Labelle, Lebeau &AMP;
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of cronyism are ricocheting through government
circles and Canada's tight-knit entertainment world. Carrier said
the Mounties had received ``zero cooperation'' from the government
agency that verifies Canadian content, the Canadian Audio-Visual
Certification Office. The agency says it can surrender the tax
documents that the Mounties are seeking only after a crime is
formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecois opposition members of parliament also contend that
Cinar developed a cozy relationship with Telefilm Canada, the
nation's largest source of federal film subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   At least two executives have moved from jobs at Cinar to
positions at Telefilm, or vice versa. And Gilles Duceppe, leader of
the Bloc Quebecois, has contended that Thomas LaPierre, son of
Telefilm's chairman, Laurier LaPierre, was falsely credited with
scripts for a Cinar situation comedy called ``Chris Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Basile, spokeswoman for Telefilm, said the elder
LaPierre would not comment on the accusation, adding: ``It's an
allegation. Nothing is proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the appearance of chumminess has fueled calls in the United
States and Canada for tighter controls, or outright cuts, in
Ottawa's film subsidies. Critics say the local industry has grown
beyond its infancy and can walk on its own two feet.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration on Thursday in Los Angeles, members of the
Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists union contended that tax
subsidies were helping lure jobs to animation studios in Montreal
and Toronto. Citing the Cinar affair, a union news release said
that exporting of jobs to Canada was ``putting American screen
cartoonists out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, where local and expatriate film and animation
productions generate about 30,000 jobs and nearly $1 billion a year
in revenue, The Gazette newspaper recently published an editorial
titled ``The Sins of Cinar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be clear by now that tax credits are an invitation
to plunder the public treasury,'' wrote The Gazette, the city's
English-language daily. ``The best outcome from the Cinar scandal
would be an end to the liberal practice of dishing out public money
to film companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Business, rebounding from its boosterism of a year ago,
wrote in a recent editorial titled ``Hollywood's Welfare Bums''
that Ottawa's subsidy program ``doesn't even pay effective lip
service to the ideal of promoting Canadian culture _ you know,
Canadian stories, by Canadians, for Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a subsidy, plain and simple, paid to companies such as
Cinar,'' the editorial said. ``Now, does that sound like an
effective use of your tax dollars?''

EDITORIAL: STOPPING THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   In Washington this weekend, a disparate gathering of protesters
will be rallying against what they view as the malign forces of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents' message is sometimes confused and misplaced,
especially in wanting to dismantle essential institutions like the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters, who call themselves the Mobilization for
Global Justice, also represent a popular response _ misguided but
heartfelt _ to a worldwide economic transformation that is not
fully comprehended even by the experts. To be sure, some interest
groups are trying to manipulate public concern for their own
advantage. But it would be dangerous to ignore a growing popular
unease over these trends and the need for broader educational
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dramatic stock market decline on Friday, the fact
remains that the United States has on balance benefited from the
unbridled flow of capital, goods, people and information that is
called globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The dislocations felt by American workers have been far
outweighed by the benefits of cheap imports, low inflation and
expanding opportunities for American businesses overseas. Abroad,
the poor countries benefiting from expanded markets outnumber those
hurt by them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the new world order has created hardship in
declining or newly uncompetitive industries. Some nations see
globalization as a code word for American domination. Many fear
that the World Bank, IMF and WTO are pursuing the interests of an
American-led elite, to the detriment of the poor and the
environment. Critics on both the left and right have begun to
question whether the world would be better off without these
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the institutions that manage the world economy must be
more sensitive and transparent. But their real challenge is to help
everyone understand that there is no realistic _ or beneficial _
way to reverse or even slow the forces that are driving the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as American businesses have begun to discover that in the
world of an Internet-driven economy the old rules have to be
scrapped or adjusted, so countries around the world will have to
learn to adjust to the new market forces if they want to harness
them to their advantage. Underdeveloped countries have to learn
that capital is voluntary, and does not flow to countries that do
not obey its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, there have been at least four
major currency crises that threatened to destabilize regional
economies: in Europe in 1992-93, Mexico in 1994-95, East Asia in
1997 and Russia and Brazil in 1998. Each had the potential for
spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The critics descending on Washington argue that the IMF and the
World Bank sometimes made these crises worse, while their defenders
assert that without the difficulties inflicted, the crises would
have grown worse. One thing is certain. There will be more crises
to come in the years ahead. The institutions that handle them need
to be reformed, not weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalization protesters invoke the tactics and styles
of the 1960s. But a closer analogy may be early struggles over the
burgeoning of capitalism in the 19th century. It was then that
disputes between owners and workers and about public costs and
private gain led to an age of ideological conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Today's struggle has the added element of changing definitions
of national sovereignty. Indeed, poor countries are not the only
worriers. Europeans are also increasingly wary of American demands
to open their economies to American products. As boundaries become
more economically irrelevant, one question is whether people will
seek refuge in their national identities or in the familiar if
transitory comforts of placards, chants and street theater in
places like Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today's global economic drama is deeply familiar to students
of American history _ how to reconcile the demands of economic
growth and opportunity with the need to preserve fairness,
stability and the health and welfare of each country's citizens. It
is today a challenge without borders. Meeting it calls for more
sophisticated international institutions, not a retreat into
nostalgia and economic nationalism.

PRODUCE OR ELSE, NEW CHIEF TELLS USOC 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The bottom line. Those were the first _ and appropriate
_ words that Norm Blake, the aggressive new chief executive officer
of the U.S. Olympic Committee, used to describe his opening meeting
Friday with the leaders of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's goal is to make the USOC run like an efficient and
self-reliant corporation answerable only to the bottom line and the
top podium. Within the next three years, sports that are not
producing medals will be forced to develop other means of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   When he presented his 39-page business plan to the 19 voting
members of the executive committee Friday, Blake said that many of
the members were stunned by the force and immediacy of his plans.
Nonetheless, they voted unanimously to agree in principle to his
proposal. In a luncheon meeting Saturday, the committee is set to
reaffirm Blake's plan and give him the go-ahead to restructure the
USOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there is a commitment to become more a
performance-oriented organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has been on the job for 60 days, admitted that in not
being able to consult with all the constituents of the umbrella
organization _ which includes 45 national governing bodies of the
different Olympic and Pan American sports, community-based
organizations and athletes _ he gave an impression of trying to
railroad his plan into approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice,'' he said. ``If you want to initiate change,
you need to build up momentum. If you try to do things
incrementally, the inertia of a situation overcomes it, then it
never gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next 45 days, before the next board of directors meeting
in June, members will have a chance to refine the basic principles
of Blake's plan. But the strategy is in place. In July, Blake said
he will begin negotiating business plans with the winter sports
organizations to determine how much financing they will receive.
After the Sydney Olympics, by mid-October, he hopes to start
negotiating business plans with the summer sports.
</P>
<P>
   The 45 national governing bodies rely on the USOC for between 6
and 85 percent of their funds. The committee will increase the
funds for some groups, and decrease it for others. In addition,
Blake plans to cut as many as 70 jobs to streamline the
bureaucracy. ``It will be three years from now before the full
effect of the new dynamic is in place,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To transform the committee into a viable business that will
attract other corporations as sponsors and improve medal
performance, Blake plans to name a chief financial officer, and
hopes the respective governing bodies install a CFO as well. Each
governing body will have an account management team that will work
on joint marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Locke, the executive director of USA Triathlon and a
member of the USOC transition team, said he believes the majority
of the executives support Blake's initiatives, especially because
he seems willing to evaluate each sport on the merits of its
individual business plans. ``He's not taking a cookie-cutter
approach and we like that,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports that do not participate in the Olympics, but only in the
Pan American Games, such as racquetball, are in danger of having
their USOC funds reduced, Blake said. Other sports that are on the
cusp include table tennis, team handball and the biathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the bottom line, a sport like volleyball or men's
soccer has the potential to win only one medal, yet it uses a lot
of resources for its staff and athletes. The USOC does not want to
support a struggling sport unless that sport can show it can go out
and raise money on its own.

HOW SCRIPTURE HAS INSPIRED POETS, FROM DONNE TO MILTON TO AUDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jews preparing for Passover and Christians intent on the coming
Holy Week cannot be expected to pay much heed to the fact that
April is National Poetry Month. But perhaps they should.
</P>
<P>
   Christians _ and not only Christians _ could find sustenance,
for example, in Peggy Rosenthal's ``The Poets' Jesus,'' just
published by Oxford ($29.95). It is a short, reader-friendly
account of how poets have rendered Jesus, primarily from the 19th
century to the present, from William Blake's Jesus as Romantic
poet-hero to Ranier Marie Rilke's Jesus as disillusioned anti-hero;
from the political, revolutionary or sometimes imperialist Christ
of Third World poets to the ignored or exiled Jesus of Czeslaw
Milosz; from the absent Jesus of the Welsh priest-poet R.S. Thomas
to the surprisingly present Jesus of Denise Levertov, Kathleen
Norris and Annie Dillard.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also, in passing, a swift overview of the last two
centuries of Christian theology and Western culture. A few of the
chapter titles tell the story: ``Jesus as Christ and More: The
First Eighteen Centuries.'' ``Jesus as Romantic Hero.'' ``Sliding
Into Modernism: Jesus Pale and Shrunken.'' ``Crisis of the
Secularized West: Postmodernism's Jesus as Antihero.'' ``Jesus
Absent.'' ``Jesus Present.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry has always been a privileged medium through which a
culture talks of, and to, its gods,'' Rosenthal writes. ``Poetry,
that is, searches and stretches language to probe the questions of
life's ultimate meanings that people everywhere have asked. Even
where Jesus of Nazareth is not claimed as Incarnate God, even where
that claim is dismissed out of hand, he still engages poets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal was a co-editor, along with Robert Atwan and her
husband, George Dardess, of ``Divine Inspiration: The Life of Jesus
in World Poetry'' (Oxford, 1998). That anthology, in turn, sprang
from ``Chapters Into Verse,'' a two-volume collection of poetry in
English inspired by the Bible, edited by Atwan and Laurence Wieder
and published by Oxford in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They are rich sources for seasonal reading, along with ``The
Gospels in Our Image: An Anthology of Twentieth-Century Poetry
Based on Biblical Texts'' (Harcourt Brace, 1995), edited by David
Curzon. Is there a major poet, whether devout or defiant, who has
not been inspired by Scripture? Here are Donne and Milton,
Wordsworth, Byron, Dickinson, Yeats, Pound, D.H. Lawrence, Dylan
Thomas, Pasternak, Borges, Paul Celan _ the range is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Poets fill out the moments that Scripture telegraphs, give life
to the figures that appear and drop from sight: Pharaoh's daughter,
Pilate's wife, Barabbas, Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   The second stanza of Anna Akhmatova's brief ``Crucifixion,''
translated by Stanley Kunitz and Max Hayward, goes simply:
</P>
<P>
   Mary Magdalene beat her breasts and sobbed,
</P>
<P>
   His dear disciple, stone-faced, stared.
</P>
<P>
   His mother stood apart. No other looked
</P>
<P>
   Into her secret eyes. Nobody dared.
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian poet, Yevgeny Vinokurov, jolts readers with an
unexpected pieta: a six-line evocation not of Mary but of ``The
Mother of Judas'' _ yes, he must have had a mother _ weeping at the
feet of her hanged son.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no book like ``The Poets' Jesus''
focusing on the Israelites' exodus from slavery. The first volume
of ``Chapters Into Verse,'' covering the Hebrew Scriptures,
includes just a handful of related poems, many of them (since the
anthology is of English-language poetry) written from a Christian
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Wieder, a poet and translator of the Psalms who is preparing a
one-volume paperback version of ``Chapters Into Verse'' for
publication next fall, could not think of major contemporary poems
specifically taking off from the events commemorated at Passover,
although, he said, ``any time people are talking about shaking off
tyranny or liberating themselves, they are talking about Exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about contemporary poets' treatment of Jesus' suffering
and crucifixion, Rosenthal mentioned how many simply feel ``we've
lost our ability to pay attention to the Passion,'' a result not
only of secularism's challenge to religious beliefs but also of
``the distractedness of modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   W.H. Auden diagnosed that distracted condition in ``Horae
Canonicae,'' she said, the cycle of poems that he wrote from 1949
to 1954 and organized according to the ``canonical hours'' that
structured the daily prayer of monks, nuns and priests.
</P>
<P>
   The poems are permeated with the sense that civilization, with
all its social roles and competencies, unavoidably rests on sin,
error, routine and victimization: ``For without a cement of
blood,'' Auden writes, ``no secular wall will safely stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the heart of the cycle are the hours between noon
(``Sext'') and 3 p.m. (``Nones''), when Jesus was thought to have
been dying on the cross. Jesus is not mentioned by name, only ``the
victim'' and ``this dying.'' (Indirection, Rosenthal notes, is the
homage that contemporary religious poetry typically pays to
secularity, as though modern disbelief can be overcome only by a
flanking movement and not frontally.)
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, ``the blood/ Of our sacrifice is already/ Dry
on the grass,'' Auden writes, but ``we are not prepared'' _ ``what
shall we do till nightfall?'' The crowd disperses. ``The hangman
has gone to wash, the soldiers to eat:/ We are left alone with our
feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite alone. ``The shops will reopen at 4,'' the poet
continues, and there is time for a soothing nap, and ``time/ To
misrepresent, excuse, deny,/ Mythify, use this event/ While, under
a hotel bed, in prison,/ Down wrong turnings, its meaning/ Waits
for our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, much more to Auden's ``Horae Canonicae.''
For Rosenthal, it is one of many contemporary poems declaring that
while Jesus or, equally, the God of Moses ``is very much present,''
as she puts it in her book, ``it is we who are absent.''

AT TALLADEGA TRACK, EXPECT SPEED, PATIENCE, NERVE (AND RAIN?) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Talladega Superspeedway is long and it is
wide. To get a feel for it, just think of driving on the outside
with cars racing four across.
</P>
<P>
   Think rush-hour traffic, except everybody is pressing the
accelerator as if living beyond the moment is not a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talladega is the most nerve-racking experience that you can go
through as a driver,'' said Tony Stewart, last season's Winston Cup
Series rookie of the year. ``The concrete wall was about a foot
away from me and the guy on the inside of me was about three or
four inches away from me. I can only imagine what the middle two
guys felt like. You've got guys behind you. You've got cars in
front of you. You've got cars beside you, and you're running 195
mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Stewart was exaggerating. Chances are the pack was
only going 175 to 185 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't seem to get settled down and get in a rhythm,''
he said. ``It's not about what you and your car can do. It's about
what everybody else is doing to you and your car.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Stewart, part of the Joe Gibbs Racing
Team, has learned that patience is imperative in Sunday's race.
Especially since it involves the use of restrictor plates, which
uniformly inhibit speeds, making it virtually impossible for
someone to run away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may be thrown into Sunday's race: rain.
Persistent gloomy weather has an impact on racing. On Thursday,
qualifying for Sunday's event was wiped out by inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was not as bad. A steady drizzle stopped in the
afternoon, and qualifying commenced an hour later than scheduled.
Still, the times suffered.
</P>
<P>
   In an aborted session that was to be continued Saturday morning,
Jeremy Mayfield's top speed of 186.969 mph. was the slowest here
for a potential pole-sitter since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers are expected Saturday, with the possibility of
more rain Sunday. In the 31-year history of the track, only two
Winston Cup races were postponed a day by weather, in 1978 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mayfield in qualifying was Bill Elliott, who had a
186.936 run. Elliott on Sunday will become the 12th driver, six
still active, to start his 600th Nascar race.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett , the defending series champion, posted a 186.747,
nosing out the crowd favorite, Dale Earnhardt, for a third place
start.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is seeking to win his third straight race here. The
Intimidator has won nine races here, more than twice as many as any
other driver.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gloomier faces was that of Jeff Gordon, who is without
a victory this season after winning three overall titles since
1995. His 184.136 lap left him far back in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a rocket ship,'' Gordon said. ``We've just got some
things we have to work on. We'll do that and get better.'' &QL;

MRS. CLINTON SAYS SURPLUS SHOULD GO TO DEBT, NOT TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. _ Highlighting what has emerged as perhaps the
sharpest policy difference between them in the Senate race, Hillary
Rodham Clinton asserted Friday that New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's call for deep, across-the-board tax cuts financed by the
national surplus was a threat to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton said, the surplus should be used primarily to
pay off the national debt, and she offered a plan to do that by
2013.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, taking a position that closely tracks President
Clinton's posture in congressional budget talks, said that she
would support using only $250 billion of the projected $746 billion
surplus for tax cuts, and that the reductions should be directed at
specific groups, like first-time home-buyers and parents putting
children through college.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Giuliani, answering questions about Mrs. Clinton's
proposal at a news conference at City Hall, said he would support
sizable cuts in personal and capital gains tax rates. Although
Giuliani declined to endorse any specific plan, he clearly sided
with congressional Republicans who are pushing a tax cut plan that
could be twice as large as that advocated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered her views on taxes, the national debt and the
surplus _ subjects that seem likely to shape many congressional
elections this year, including the one in New York _ in a speech in
which she sought to present herself as the fiscal conservative in
the race for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly assailed Republican tax proposals as
``risky,'' as she offered herself as a lifelong advocate of fiscal
discipline and approvingly noted her husband's successful effort to
eliminate the deficit during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be _ and I will be _ a steady and strong voice for
fiscal discipline and a balanced budget in the United States,''
Clinton, the Democratic candidate for Senate, said to 1,300 people
who turned up for a breakfast here sponsored by the Long Island
Association, a Commack-based business group. ``I grew up with a
father who didn't believe in credit cards, who paid cash for our
house. And I have a hard time breaking those habits, and will put
them to work in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told reporters in Manhattan that he believed that
sizable reductions in both the income and capital gains tax rates
would be a boon to New York state's economy, and would be
particularly helpful upstate, which has suffered economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best way to help upstate New York,'' Giuliani said.
``If you want to help upstate New York cut some of the taxes,
particularly the income tax, where we disproportionally pay it, and
you're going to leave money in the upstate economy, that then can
be used for more jobs, more commercial activity, more economic
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Their remarks Friday underscored a strong point of disagreement
between two candidates who share a number of similar views. With
his comments, Giuliani signaled that he _ like his party's presumed
presidential candidate, George W. Bush _ believed that cutting
taxes was an issue that held sway with voters, notwithstanding
evidence in polling and some recent political contests that it is
not as potent an issue as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, to some extent, is embarking on a fairly unorthodox
route in her campaign: running against a tax cut. That said, her
emphasis on eliminating the $3.5 trillion debt is part of her
continuing effort to portray herself as a moderate Democrat, at a
time when Giuliani has sought to present her as far more liberal
than most New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a dispute between Republicans and Democrats about the
size of the projected 10-year surplus; Clinton, like her husband
and most Democrats, embraced the lower figure of about $750
billion. Of that, she said, 40 percent, or $350 billion, should go
to paying off the national debt, with $250 billion for tax cuts.
The remaining $150 billion, Mrs. Clinton's aides said, would go to
financing various programs, like a prescription drug plan for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In offering her proposal, Clinton _ using language that echoed
much of what the president has said _ asserted that the tax cuts
proposed by the Republicans would undermine the prosperity that the
first lady said was the result of the economic policies of the last
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not support a tax cut that would force us to abandon
the force of fiscal discipline and spend the surplus before we have
paid down the debt,'' she said. ``We all know that some of the
noisiest voices in our country are those who say we should spend
the surplus on a large, untargeted, across-the-board tax cut. You
know, the road to risky tax cuts may appear to be easy _ and it
certainly has short-term political gain attached to it _ but it
will, inevitably and ultimately, lead to exploding deficits and a
return to the higher interest rates.''

DREAM COME TRUE FOR QUINTANILLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the motocross tracks of Southern Texas to the
streets of Southern California, Rolando Quintanilla has taken a
road less traveled to open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   But ask the Pepperdine sophomore from Calabasas what the two
types of racing have in common and he'll rattle of a laundry list
of similarities between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are cooperation and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how to win a championship and I learned how to work
with a team,'' the 19-year-old Quintanilla said between practices
at Phoenix International Raceway in preparation for the Indy Lights
season opener on Sunday during the Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   An Indy Lights rookie, Quintanilla tasted success early in life,
winning a 50cc Texas state motocross championship when he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Quintanilla has risen through the ranks of the U.S.
Formula Ford 2000 series and various SCCA divisions before landing
a seat in an Indy Lights car for Conquest Racing in last year's
California Speedway race.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his debut was less than auspicious _ he finished
18th after his day ended with a collision with David Pook _
Quintanilla earned a full-time ride with the team for the 2000
campaign. He joins veteran Indy Lights drivers Felipe Giaffone and
Chris Menninga on the Conquest Racing team owned by Eric Bachelart.
</P>
<P>
   Bachelart has decided to treat Quintanilla with kid gloves for
this weekend's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects too much from him and I don't want to put any
pressure on him,'' Bachelart said. ``My expectations are for him to
race clean and get some points. With three cars in the race, I have
different expectations for each driver. For Rolando, I want him to
finish the race. I want him to be running up front by the end of
the season. I think I have to put more pressure on him every time
and he has to progress all year.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't come as a surprise that Bachelart is going to be
patient with his young rookie. The two are practically family.
Quintanilla's father, Roberto, and Bachelart raced against each
other on the Indy Lights series in 1991. It was at the Denver Grand
Prix, where both the elder Quintanilla and Bachelart finished on
the podium, that Roberto told Bachelart that he was going to retire
at season's end and focus on his son's racing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a long-term relationship with his father,'' Bachelart
said. ``I remember giving Rolando a picture with my autograph on it
that day. We know each other very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the Long Beach race has been a little frustrating
for the Mexican-born rookie. Testing at Phoenix and Sebring
International Raceway in Florida, as he has been doing for the past
few weeks, has helped Quintanilla get familiar with his car. But
the conditions he has been practicing under can't be duplicated to
match the ones he'll have to battle on the temporary road course at
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In Quintanilla's favor, he at least knows the odds are stacked
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time,''
Quintanilla said. ``This will be the first street course I have
competed on in Indy Lights and it will be close to home. A lot of
people will be behind me down there. I want to do well and I am
hoping that I do well. But I know I am the youngest driver out
there. I know it will be a surprise if I do well. I just don't want
to run before I learn how to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachelart echoed Quintanilla's attitude toward racing at Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be silly to think his car can win this year,''
Bachelart said. ``I want to build up his confidence. For me,
Rolando is the future. He's very young and he's very talented. But
I want him to progress every time we go to race.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to competing in the season opener in front of a home
crowd, Quintanilla will have the added pressure of racing for an
owner who is a past Indy Lights champion at Long Beach. Plus, he is
the first second-generation driver to compete in Indy Lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, being in Indy Lights and racing in Long Beach, is a
dream come true,'' Quintanilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Landing in Southern California was a dream come true as well.
Quintanilla said he wanted to come to L.A. mainly for two reasons.
First, he was to go to school at Pepperdine, the same school his
sister attended and graduated from. Second, he wanted to be close
to go-kart tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from high school, I was racing shifter
karts,'' Quintanilla said. ``Most of the races were in California,
and Southern California has a lot of tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   School is as important to Quintanilla as his racing career. He
is majoring in international business and political science and has
aspirations of being an Indy Lights team owner some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is a lot of fun,'' he said. ``It keeps me focused when
I'm not driving.''
</P>
<P>
   If Quintanilla can have a successful season, he will be driving
for long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My long-term goal is to drive as long as my sponsors can
support me,'' Quinatnilla said. ``The doors of the world aren't
exactly closing for me.''

 &HT;    Bengals covet Warrick
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Cincinnati Bengals enter today's NFL Draft with
disgruntled Corey Dillon and Carl Pickens still on the roster, but
the club is full of optimism that Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick will join the club with the No.4 overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cleveland Browns tap Penn State defensive end Courtney
Brown with the first pick and the Washington Redskins grab Penn
State linebacker LaVar Arrington and Alabama left offensive tackle
Chris Samuels at Nos.2 and 3, look for the Bengals to take Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lippincott, director of pro/college personnel, said he'd
consider doing somersaults and back flips in the ``War Room'' at
Spinney Field if the Bengals land Warrick, who would join
quarterback Akili Smith in an exclusive club of potential No.1
overall picks spurned by the Browns in back-to-back drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most explosive, exciting player in college
football,'' Lippincott said. ``He's an excellent route runner. He's
got phenomenal hands. But probably even better than all that, he's
so exciting after he makes the catch. He's got those running
back-quick instincts that just make him very, very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bruce Coslet feels equally as strong about the
electrifying 5-foot-11, 194-pound Warrick, who in nine
regular-season games in 1999 caught 71 passes for 934 yards (a 13.2
average) and eight touchdowns. He also rushed for three TDs, scored
on a 75-yard punt return and threw a 35-yard TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's exciting,'' Coslet said. ``You get the ball to him 10
times and he's going to score twice. A lot of people say he's not
fast enough. He's fast. He's quick as heck. He's an exciting punt
returner. He's got great hands. He's a pattern technician. He's
just a heck of a player, a big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be disappointed if he's there (at No. 4),''
Brown added. ``I think he's good. He's a top-line college prospect.
If he's the one we end up with, we would be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL _ having undergone an offseason of turmoil with
Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis and ex-Carolina wide receiver Rae
Carruth facing murder chargers _ has placed a great deal of
emphasis on character issues leading up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is particularly so this year because of all that
has happened,'' Brown said. ``We're all familiar with the different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Warrick's personal baggage. He and teammate
Laveranues Coles were arrested last fall for purchasing more than
$400 worth of designer clothing for $21.40 at a Dillard's
department store with the help of a clerk. Coles was booted off the
team, while Warrick served a two-game suspension and pleaded guilty
to misdemeanor petty theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think character is a problem for him,'' Brown said.
``I know what his run-ins have been and I think he has faced up to
them, and my opinion is that he'll be OK for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported the New York Jets were trying to ship three of
their four first-round picks (Nos. 13, 18 and 27) to the Bengals in
exchange for the fourth pick, where New York would select Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to teams, but do I have anything to report? No, I
don't,'' Brown said. ``We haven't made a deal and that's where it
stands right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured the Bengals will get plenty of telephone calls from
teams who want to move up. The Philadelphia Eagles, at No.6, and
Jets, whose first pick comes at No.12, admire Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bengals stay put, look for them to select a cornerback,
safety and running back as insurance in case Pro Bowler Dillon _ a
restricted free agent who vows to sit out the first 10 games of the
year _ isn't traded. They'll also add depth to the offensive and
defensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: Brown is building the team around Smith, who needs
protection and weapons to succeed in his first full season as
starting quarterback in new Paul Brown Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key for us,'' Brown said. ``If he can get up and
running, we will surprise people. We will be better than people
might suspect. That's the most important thing here.''

 &HT;    Jerry D. Mead, a wine writer who long crusaded against
neo-Prohibitionism, died on Wednesday at his home in Carson City,
Nev. He was 61.
 &HT;    The cause was lymphoma and heart disease, said Edwin J. Schwartz
of San Francisco, a friend.
 &HT;    Mead, who described himself as The Wine Curmudgeon (often just
TWC), wrote a weekly column, ``Mead on Wine,'' for 32 years. It was
syndicated in California and Nevada and appeared in some 30
newspapers at its peak.
 &HT;    Mead found a national audience with Wine Trader, a magazine he
founded 23 years ago, edited and published six times a year. The
Trader was partly a politically flavored vehicle for his piquant
commentary on wine issues like warning messages on labels, which he
opposed. Its cover had headlines like ``Prohibition Returns to
Chicago'' and ``Confirmation: Wine Reduces Heart Disease.''
 &HT;    Mead, who tended to be less feisty in person than in print,
became an outspoken foe of government regulation of interstate wine
shipping years before it became a national issue. The rise of wine
sales on the Internet only fueled his ardor.
 &HT;    While Mead's targets, especially members of the Wine Institute,
the California trade association, might say he accentuated the
negative, he was positive about wine itself, relishing wine tasting
and judging. He founded the sizable New World International Wine
Competition, in San Bernardino.
 &HT;    Mead is survived by his companion, Sandra McCown; two sons, Sean
Mead and Jerry Dion Mead; a daughter, Jeanne Smith; his mother,
Mary Frances Boyd Mead; two stepsons, James Riederer Jr. and Thomas
Riederer, and several grandchildren, great-grandchildren and
step-grandchildren.
 &HT;    In 1967 he created a club for, he wrote, ``wine lovers of modest
means'' _ that is, for revelers.
 &HT;    ``It was not your lifted-pinky school of wine drinking,'' he
said. The club is called WINO, for Wine Investigation for Novices
and Oenophiles.

   NEW YORK _ Alan Betrock, whose love of rock 'n' roll propelled a
pioneering career as a critic, editor, publisher, archivist and
record producer, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.
He was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Marilyn Laverty, his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   Betrock's interest in the outer limits of popular culture began
when he was a child in Queens. ``I'd hear a record on radio and try
to seek it out, but it was very hard to find if it wasn't in the
top 30,'' he said in a 1972 interview in The New York Times. By
that time, he was a Queens College graduate publishing JAMZ, an
early fanzine.
</P>
<P>
   JAMZ led to Rock Marketplace, which united collectors nationwide
in the search for obscure recordings. Betrock broadened his
editorial vision in 1976, when he founded New York Rocker, one of
the primary organs of the burgeoning American punk scene.
</P>
<P>
   Betrock understood the connections between this new movement and
the sounds he loved from the 1960s. He championed artists who were
refreshing rock's traditions, including Blondie, Richard Hell and
the Voidoids and Television. He produced Blondie's first
recordings, including a crystalline version of the Ellie Greenwich
girl-group classic ``Out in the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1982 book, ``Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound,'' was lauded
by the critic Robert Palmer in The Times as ``everything a rock 'n'
roll genre study should be.'' By the time he published it, Betrock
had sold New York Rocker and was pursuing a dual career as a
journalist and an independent record mogul. Releases on his label,
Shake Records, introduced artists like the dB's, the Smithereens
and Marshall Crenshaw. In his writing, he ardently defended
American punk, exposing its roots in garage rock and vintage
teen-age pop.
</P>
<P>
   In later years Betrock expanded his explorations by founding
Shake Books, which published more than a dozen works on subjects
spiritually tied to rock, like teen-age exploitation films and the
history of the pinup.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, Wayne, of Manhattan, and his
mother, Gertrude Betrock of Tamarac, Fla.

   Gary Bellow, a Harvard Law School professor who was a pioneer in
creating programs to meet the legal needs of the poor, died
Thursday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 64 and lived in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from a heart transplant,
said Dr. Charles J. Ogletree, a friend and Harvard Law School
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his appointment to the faculty of the Harvard Law
School in 1972, Bellow founded the Clinical Program, a law school
version of the teaching hospital, so that law students, like
medical students, would acquire skills by serving actual clients,
and perhaps advance the cause of social justice as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinical Program, which started with one course, had
expanded to nearly 20 by 1996, and more than half its students were
taking part in clinical practice for academic credit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the time, Bellow said that the school should
be proud not only of offering clinical programs in criminal and
civil law, but that those programs had ``a service dividend'' in
that they were providing legal services to 3,000 to 4,000 poor
clients each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow also said he believed that ``all lawyers have an
obligation'' to make the legal system more accessible to those who
cannot afford a lawyer, and that there should be ``pro bono
requirements by law schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow's passion for giving poor people equal access to the
legal system was ignited by the three years he spent in the
District of Columbia Public Defender Service, beginning in 1962.
``We discovered,'' he later recalled, ``that the best legal
education America had to offer didn't teach us how to get someone
out of a cell block. We figured it out ourselves and developed our
own learning and teaching techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   He then spent two years as deputy director of the United
Planning Organization, Washington's Community Action Program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he became deputy director of the California Rural Legal
Assistance program. He worked with migrant farmworkers in the San
Joaquin Valley, including Cesar Chavez, the leader of the United
Farm Workers, and came into sharp conflict with Gov. Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Bellow was recruited by the University of Southern
California to develop a clinical legal services program for its
School of Law. Three years later, he came to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Jeanne Charn, a Harvard Law School lecturer, he
was a founder of and an instructor at the Hale and Dorr Legal
Services Center of Harvard Law School, the school's major legal
clinic in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow was born on June 9, 1935, in Brooklyn, N.Y. His family
later moved to Lawrence, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with honors from Yale in 1957 and from the Harvard
Law School in 1960. He next spent two years at the Northwestern
University School of Law, where he earned an LL.M. degree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Bellow is survived by two sons,
Douglas, of Cambridge, Mass., and David, of Boston; a daughter,
Courtenay Kettleson of Medford, Mass; and two sisters, Helaine
Gould of Manhasset, N.Y., and Bonnie Bellow of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 interview, Bellow said, ``On a personal level, what
I still get the most satisfaction from is the day-to-day work on
cases with students for people who otherwise would not have a
lawyer.''

<P>
   James Frederick Green, a State Department veteran who was an
authority on human rights, died Monday at his home in Silver
Spring, Md. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had a doctorate in international relations from Yale,
spent part of his State Department career, from 1946 to 1954,
focused on the United Nations. In 1956, he wrote a book, ``The
United Nations and Human Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the Foreign Service from 1956 until he retired in
1969, after serving as executive director of President Johnson's
Commission for the Observance of Human Rights Year 1968, and as
charge d'affaires in Ghana. Later he taught international relations
and other subjects at universities in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kansas City, Mo., he received a bachelor's degree
from Yale in 1932 and served in the Office of Strategic Services in
Washington during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Henrietta Hall, died in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include three daughters, Dr. Eleanor Hewson Green of
Presque Isle, Maine, Katharine G. Lewis-Brown of Silver Spring, and
Sybilla Dorros of Boston; six grandchildren; four
great-grandchildren; a sister, Dorothy G. Dreher of Kansas City,
Mo.; and two half sisters, Suzanne Hart of St. Louis and Sally
Sulzer of Kansas City, Mo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ramon C. Cortines does not put much stock in the
trappings of power. His spotless desk at the Los Angeles Unified
School District headquarters is not in the spacious
superintendent's suite, but in a small ascetic office just down the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's graaaaand,'' Cortines said of the bigger office
before adding matter-of-factly: ``And I'm not the superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   But in just over three months as interim superintendent of the
nation's second largest public school system, Cortines has shown
himself to be quite comfortable with the exercise of power. He was
brought in to shake up a system in crisis, and he has.
</P>
<P>
   In a hundred days, he has moved to end the practice of social
promotion, to scrap construction of a costly half-built high school
on a toxic former oilfield and to make a new reading program and
new professional training mandatory. And this week, a school board
that has seldom agreed on anything voted unanimously to adopt his
plan for reorganizing the district into 11 semiautonomous units in
an effort to bolster local control and improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's here as a change agent,'' said one board member, Caprice
Young. ``That's why we picked him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a career in education spanning nearly 45 years, Cortines has
taught English and social studies; held senior jobs in the federal
Department of Education; and run school systems in California _ in
Pasadena, San Jose and San Francisco _ and, for two tumultuous
years, in New York City. But he insists he will not stay in Los
Angeles beyond July 1, when a nationwide search is to have produced
a permanent superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm getting old,'' said Cortines, a trim, dapper man
who will turn 68 in July but who works out every day in his home
gym in Pasadena and fills his glen plaid suit with the grace of a
man half that age. ``In the last year and a half, I have really
learned to enjoy the free time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to notice. Cortines still routinely arrives in the
office before 6 a.m., holds his first meeting by 6:30 and is at
headquarters, or just as likely, visiting schools, parents and
teachers, until well into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a Pied Piper,'' said Kam Kuwata, a political manager
who has known Cortines since he was assistant superintendent in
Pasadena in 1970 and Kuwata was a student government leader in the
midst of a crisis over busing. ``Wherever he went, he got a few
more people involved around him. He has an unquenchable thirst for
information, and a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines calls the Los Angeles assignment ``the most difficult
one I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like today,'' he said in an interview, ``I was dealing with
the problem of several early childhood programs that don't talk to
each other. And that's been encouraged. It took me about three
weeks to find that there was a planning office, because it had
fallen out of favor.''
</P>
<P>
   He might not be here to see the outcome of the most delicate
challenge: contract negotiations with the teachers' union. The
school board voted this week to begin bargaining with a raise of
about a third of what the union was seeking, along with an offer of
merit pay for teachers who improved their students' scores on
standardized tests, which the union opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in merit pay, and I've never used the `m'
word,'' Cortines said, noting that his preference would be for a
system that rewarded the staff of entire schools that improved
their performance. He acknowledged that standardized tests were
just one way to measure student achievement. But with dozens of the
district's 790 schools ranking at the bottom in a recent statewide
rating system, Cortines said, ``You've got to tie this to some sort
of assessment, instead of getting into this debate, `Is it perfect,
does it measure what is taught?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you,'' he said sharply, ``what that says to me is
that nobody wants any accountability and they want the status quo,
and I think that's insidious racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines knows about defying expectations. His biological mother
was a Mexican-American from San Antonio. ``I was a bastard child,
and you know, she wanted better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He was adopted by a couple in San Francisco. His father, of
Castilian Spanish descent, was the head salad chef at the Plaza
Hotel on Union Square, and his mother, of British ancestry, worked
at the Kaiser shipyards in World War II. They were neither rich nor
well educated, but insisted that their son visit museums, take
piano lessons, and attend the San Francisco Symphony's Saturday
children's concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents told me that I came home in the fourth grade and
said I was going to be a teacher,'' Cortines recounted, but added
that even now, he does not know quite why. ``I guess it was a good
experience for me.'' To this day, when schoolchildren ask what he
does, he replies, ``I'm a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the days when the worst thing he and his schoolmates did
was play hooky from the symphony were gone for good. He insists
that schools must stop scapegoating children and parents for poor
performance, and instead do whatever it takes _ like Saturday
classes, coordination with community groups and experiments with
vouchers _ to improve learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kids need to be able to know and do is very different
from when I grew up,'' he said. ``We're never going to go back to
the two-parent family. Just because middle-class, middle-aged
people like me think it's not right if you don't have it the way it
was when we were young, let me tell you: That's not the way it's
going to be. The question is, how do you maximize the potential of
that child, using the community resources that are there?''

Protesters against world trade policies took part Friday in

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department Friday asked an appeals
court in Atlanta to lift an emergency injunction and give federal
law-enforcement officials the power to reunite Elian Gonzalez with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal court cancels an order issued on Thursday that
blocked the child's transfer, the government will be free take him
from his Miami relatives and allow the father to return home to
Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   The swirl of legal maneuvering took place as hope for a
settlement dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Elian's Miami relatives showed no sign that they
would soften their determination to keep the boy even as
immigration officials wrote to Lazaro Gonzalez, the child's
great-uncle, reminding him that his legal authority over the child
ended on Thursday at 2 p.m. when he was ordered to take Elian to
authorities at an airport north of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a mood of grim resolve replaced the
disappointment over Attorney General Janet Reno's fruitless trip to
Miami on Wednesday to try to talk the relatives into giving up the
boy. Officials said that Reno was at last resigned to taking the
step she had hoped to avoid: a tactical law-enforcement operation
to remove the child from Miami forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Reno had quietly met law-enforcement
officials in Washington and Miami to discuss the operation.
</P>
<P>
   They said she alone would choose the timing and nature of the
action, adding that it was likely to be carried out using a minimum
of force at a time of the day when demonstrators were not likely to
be massed in the streets of the Little Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said it was possible that Reno would delay a
tactical operation until next week, when there would be fewer
people available to take part in protests than on Saturday or
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it is clear that there is no injunction, the
government will move to implement its enforcement action to enforce
our order,'' an immigration official said Friday. ``It seems clear
that the relatives have no intention of working with us on a
cooperative agreement to turn over the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, downpours reduced the number of demonstrators outside
the Gonzalez house from the thousands who marched in the streets on
Thursday to about 150 people, some of whom sang songs about Elian
during their soggy vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed its brief with the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. A judge on the panel had
issued a temporary order on Thursday, which prevented the
government from transferring Elian to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and blocked the boy's return with his father to Cuba.
Gonzalez is now waiting in Washington for a reunion with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief said, ``It is very important to
Elian's long-term well-being that Elian be transferred to his
father's care as as soon as possible, that the transfer be
unambiguous, that his care-givers since his arrival in the United
States prepare him for and participate in the transfer in a
supportive manner and that the transfer occur at a neutral
location.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that that Reno and the immigration commissioner,
Doris Miessner, ``have gone to extraordinary lengths'' to obtain
the cooperation of Elian's Miami relatives in the last week. But,
the legal paper argued, the relatives had refused to obey lawful
government directives, like the order to hand Elian over to
authorities at the Opa-Locka airport north of Miami by the Thursday
afternoon deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's filing said that if the relatives
surrendered the child the government would use its authority to
keep Elian in the United States while the appellate court
considered the relatives' appeal of a decision by a federal
district judge in Miami who ruled that the government could allow
the child to return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that Gonzalez had agreed, in a letter sent on
Thursday to the Justice Department, to remain in the United States
for the appeal _ so long as he is given custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday evening, the Miami relatives made public an
affidavit filed with the federal court in Atlanta. In the
affidavit, Orlando Rodriguez, who lived near the Gonzalez family
from 1995 until he left Cuba in June 1998, said that he had
``personal knowledge'' of Juan Miguel's mistreating his former
wife, Elian's late mother, Elizabet Brotons.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said Rodriguez saw the father hit Brotons ``to the
point she went to the hospital'' and that similar acts were
inflicted on his son. The relatives also said two other witnesses
could submit sealed affidavits about such behavior by Elian's
father.

truth in sentencing legislation. However, states have also
instituted tougher parole policies for violent offenders. Probation

 &HT;    Braves find cure in Brewers
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Brewers were the perfect solution for the
Braves, off to their worst start since 1996 at 4-5 after being
swept in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers started 24-year-old Steve Woodard, who hadn't won a
game since July 1999. They're minus four players acquired in recent
trades, all on the disabled list. And they're playing in front of a
brick and steel reminder of a year's delay in construction at
Miller Park, which sits just beyond center field.
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't the Cubs and the cold. It was mild in Milwaukee and
the Braves took full advantage with a 6-3 victory, their first win
since leaving Turner Field on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After being stunned in three games by the Cubs, the Braves were
perfectly content to get back to the status quo, moving to 7-1 in
County Stadium since the Brewers joined the National League in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was the site of possibly the worst start of Tom Glavine's
career last May. But Friday was about as far removed from that as
it gets. While he equaled the number of runs allowed in each of his
first two starts (two) to the first two batters of the game,
Glavine allowed one run over the next seven innings to collect his
second win of the season. Kerry Ligtenberg and Mike Remlinger
finished, with Remlinger getting the final out for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras and Reggie Sanders, both of whom entered the game
hitting .200, broke out at the plate. Sanders, who had been moved
from second to seventh in the order for the game, doubled and
scored a run to tie it at 2 in the fourth inning. Veras doubled to
drive in the go-ahead run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez underscored their work with a two-run home run to
left off Curtis Leskanic in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   While Glavine settled down, the Braves had drawn even on a
double and a run each from Andres Galarraga and Sanders. Woodard
lost his 2-1 lead on a mistake in the fourth when he gave Walt
Weiss a breaking ball to hit with two outs and Glavine on deck.
Weiss connected for a single to right, with Sanders scoring from
second to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga set the tone for a little offensive awakening from the
newly tinkered Braves lineup when he ripped a double past Jose
Hernandez. He scored by forcing the issue on Bobby Bonilla's bloop
hit to left, drawing a wild throw from left fielder Geoff Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, meanwhile, allowed only two singles to catcher Henry
Blanco and a walk to Charlie Hayes over his next five innings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For weeks the accelerating inflation rate was confined to
gasoline and energy, but in March it spread to other areas of the
U.S. economy, the government reported Friday. This suggested that
the robust demand generated by the stock market had finally given
business the power to raise prices and make them stick.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the inflation breakthrough _ in the form of
an 0.7 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index _ came from the
Labor Department an hour before the stock markets opened, and
contributed to the huge sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets move on emotion,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief
economist at Prudential Securities. ``They were nervous coming into
the trading day, and traders seized on the CPI as justification for
continuing to be bearish.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern is that rising inflation will encourage the
Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates by even more than the
quarter-point increases that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman,
has promised over the next two or three months to slow the economy
and ease stock prices down. Rich stock portfolios financed much of
the spending that has created so much demand and helped to push up
the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Rising energy prices made the biggest contribution to the
increase in the overall inflation rate, the largest one-month jump
since last April. Gasoline prices alone rose 11 percent, to $1.59.4
a gallon, on average, the highest level _ ignoring inflation _ ever
recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   What caught the market's attention, however, was the ``core''
inflation rate, which measures all price increases except those for
energy and food, which are considered too volatile to provide a
clear picture of inflation. This core rate rose 0.4 percent in
March, double the monthly increase over most of the past two years.
Not since January 1995 has the core rate risen so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to draw any grand conclusions from this core
number,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities. ``Whether it signals an inflection point or is simply
the result of a number of aberrations, no one can say yet. I am
more in the aberration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The increases were fairly widespread. Furnishing, renovating and
repairing a home, for example, grew more costly in March, perhaps
because families cashed in stock or borrowed against their
portfolios to upgrade their homes. Hotels and resort rates also
rose smartly. ``You have a lot of people with a lot of money, and
they apparently want to take time off and vacation,'' said Patrick
Jackman, a senior economist in the bureau division that produces
the price index.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages in these industries may also have helped to nudge
up the inflation rate, analysts said. Certainly labor costs played
a role in March's 0.5 percent increase in medical-care costs. Most
of that was a result of higher doctors' fees, although hospital
charges also rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tight labor markets are almost certainly beginning to have
some impact on consumer prices,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Airline fares jumped 4.6 percent in March, pushed up by the cost
of fuel, airlines say. And tobacco prices jumped, primarily because
of increases in cigarette taxes, especially a 55-cent-a-pack rise
in New York state. And vehicle prices rose, mainly because General
Motors canceled a $500 rebate on most of its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the still-booming stock market helped to sustain the
demand for new cars, but if this week's sell-off continues, auto
sales are likely to fall, analysts said, prompting car companies to
step up discounts, and generally easing the pressure on prices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everything could change in the next few weeks,'' said Edward
Hyman, president of ISI Group Inc., a Wall Street investment firm.
``The market is getting crushed, and if demand weakens with the
market, pricing power is going to be crushed, too. This morning the
report I got from our auto survey showed that luxury car sales in
the New York City area were as good as they could possibly be. That
cannot last without a strong stock market, and the car companies
will respond with discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, the core inflation rate was only 1.9 percent,
but with last month's jump the average over the previous 12 months
moved up to 2.4 percent. When food and energy are added back, the
12-month moving average in the overall price index has gone from
2.7 percent in December to 3.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   That is well above the inflation target of roughly 2 percent
that has guided Fed policy in recent years. If the higher inflation
rate endures, the Fed will almost certainly continue to push up
rates, probably by a quarter of a point at a time at its
policy-making meetings every six weeks. The next is May 16.
</P>
<P>
   But if stock prices keep falling or fail to rebound, that would
play a big role in Fed thinking. Greenspan has said he would cut
rates if he thought a market sell-off was endangering the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that another Fed rate increase is no longer
as inevitable as it seemed early this week,'' Yardeni said. ``The
Fed does not like to act in periods of market uncertainty.''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The students with purple hair, the graying
academics with Jerry Garcia beards and the union organizers with
their anti-WTO buttons had crowded into the college auditorium to
hear some red-meat _ make that green-vegetable _ radicalism. And
Ralph Nader, America's foremost consumer curmudgeon, did not
disappoint:
</P>
<P>
   Globe-trotting corporations are sucking the life out of small
businesses and family farms. Pollution is poisoning our rivers and
air. Inner-city schools and health clinics are crumbling. And while
the nation corrodes, the rich are buying and selling politicians
like baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business is on a collision course with American democracy,
and American democracy has been losing,'' said Nader, who in his
dark suit was the most conventional-looking person in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The man who became famous by killing off a sporty but unstable
little car called the Corvair some 35 years ago is at it again,
running for president on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his previous presidential effort in 1996, when he
refused to raise money, spent less than $5,000 and attracted barely
1 percent of the vote, this time he is serious, Nader insists. And
that could spell trouble for Vice President Al Gore, from whose
Democratic column Nader is likely to draw most of his votes,
political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically said I wasn't going to campaign in '96,'' said
Nader. ``This is a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is cranking up that campaign just in time to step onto the
world stage this weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters
descend on Washington to demonstrate against the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Green Party affiliates from
around the world are playing a major role in the protests, and
Nader himself will address demonstrators near the White House on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not to win, of course, but to get more than 5
percent of the vote, the number that would qualify Nader for
millions in federal campaign matching funds that he says he would
use to build the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Green Party breaks 5 percent, the Democratic Party
won't be the same again,'' said Nader, still irrepressibly dour and
hauntingly hungry-looking at 66, reflecting on the prospect of
undercutting the influence of the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council and its president, Al From. ``If you think Al From and the
Democratic Leadership Council has a grip on the Democratic Party,
wait and see what a significant and growing progressive third party
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vice President Al Gore, the apparent Democratic
nominee, say they are not losing sleep over a Nader challenge.
Nader is not the most skillful of campaigners, and even many
liberal allies question his ability to move voters. Further, the
Green Party is better known for its internal squabbling than its
ability to run campaigns or raise money. Nader's aides say they
have raised thousands of dollars so far, but will not file their
first campaign finance report until next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's yielding even a few percentage points to Nader could
be damaging to the vice president if the election is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent poll by the Zogby Group showed Nader receiving
more support than Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate,
5 percent to 3 percent. The poll indicated that the vast majority
of Nader's support came from Democrats and that he was doing
particularly well in California, considered a vital state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   All of this suggests that an aggressive Nader campaign could
eliminate any advantages Gore might have gained from Buchanan, who
is expected to siphon votes from the likely Republican candidate,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nader intends to remain a thorn in Gore's side by promoting
issues that many liberals _ a large number of whom defected to Bill
Bradley in the Democratic primaries _ say the Clinton
administration has neglected: universal health care, urban poverty,
the environment and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Bradley, Nader _ like Buchanan _ is a fierce opponent
of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade
Organization, endearing him to traditionally Democratic union
members who feel the Clinton administration's free-trade policies
have hurt American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have very little loyalty to either party,'' Nader
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Nader contends that he expects to draw almost equally from both
major parties. But Republicans are a rare species in his crowds.
More common are disaffected Democrats like Stanley Campbell, 49,
who voted for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 but feels Gore has
become Bush's look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bore versus Gush,'' said Campbell, the director a church
social service agency who watched Nader speak in Dekalb, Ill.,
recently. ``I just don't know if there would be much difference
between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that this year will be different from 1996, Nader
says he has hired 15 full-time campaign workers in Washington and
will soon dispatch 10 more _ possibly including former Bradley
campaign organizers _ to get him on the ballot in every state. (The
Green Party is already on the ballot in 13 states, including New
York and California.)
</P>
<P>
   He has also vowed to raise $5 million, and he says he may get
some help from celebrities like Paul Newman, Warren Beatty and
Susan Sarandon, and musicians like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and
the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   But to get anywhere near 5 percent, Nader will have to overcome
some big obstacles, not the least of which is the Green Party
itself. The party is notoriously disorganized and fractious, with
some groups opposing any involvement in electoral politics and
others supporting another candidate, Jello Biafra, the former lead
singer for the rock group the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Nader. Gawky, shy and prone to long speeches,
he is the first to acknowledge that he is not the world's best
campaigner. He is, for one thing, painfully uncomfortable with
asking people for their votes. Last week, for instance, a Delta
Airlines workers stopped him in the Minneapolis airport to say,
``I'm a big fan.'' All Nader could say in return was, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigning takes a level of political ego I just don't have
yet,'' he said after the man had sped off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is also notoriously private, refusing to tell even co-workers
where he lives. (It is in an apartment he rents in the Dupont
Circle section of Washington.) And the only crumbs of biographical
information he salts into his hour-long speeches are passing
references to his Connecticut hometown of Winsted. Rarely does he
mention that he is the son of Lebanese immigrants, that his father
owned a restaurant, that he studied Chinese at Princeton and law at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His secretiveness has spawned a host of dark theories among his
critics. Some contend that despite his seemingly penurious
lifestyle, he is actually quite wealthy. Some contend that he lives
in a million-dollar town house here, not in the ill-furnished
apartment of Nader lore. (Nader says the town house he has been
spotted entering is his sister's.) They say that despite his
seemingly penurious way of living, he is actually quite wealthy,
that he purposely spent almost nothing on his 1996 campaign to
skirt federal election laws, which require candidates who spend
more than $5,000 to file reports disclosing their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says he will file a financial disclosure report next
month. It will show, he said, that despite his attacks on genetic
engineering firms and Microsoft, he owns technology stocks. It will
also disclose, he said, that he earned about $200,000 last year in
speaking fees but gave half of it to charities. Most of his
remaining earnings went toward ``projects.'' He lives on about
$25,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how such a private man could run for such a public job,
Nader, who has never been married, replied, ``When you work all the
time you don't have a problem in terms of private time. There is no
private time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among many leftists, Nader is not considered the dream
candidate. In a recent essay in The Nation, Katha Pollitt
complained that Nader was a less than scintillating standard-bearer
and that his 1996 campaign had focused too much on trade issues to
the exclusion of other issues dear to the left, such as race
relations, health care, and gay and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of progressives cranking up an organization, raising
funds, fomenting energy and enthusiasm on behalf of this doomed
project,'' Pollitt wrote, ``well, it's just too depressing. If
working on Nader's campaign is the best way progressives can spend
the next eight months, it's time to hire a hearse and lie down in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who says he is running partly at the behest of Green
Party leaders, replied, ``I think she ran out of material that
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his platform seems to reflect some of the criticisms of
progressives like Pollitt. At the top is universal health care
followed by an anti-poverty program built heavily on
consumer-protection ideas, including loan discrimination by banks,
high auto insurance rates and landlord abuses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate welfare,'' one of his favorite issues, will also
play front-and-center in his campaign as he rages against
government tax-breaks and subsidies which allow big companies ``to
privatize profits and socialize risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to win support from social conservatives, he
plans to attack big media corporations for exploiting children with
their racy programming and aggressive marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   While he is counting on anti-trade protests this week to raise
his national profile, Nader says his best hope for gaining
attention will be to squeeze between Gore and Bush in televised
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The private commission that will determine presidential debate
participants has said candidates must be receiving 15 percent in
national polls to be included. Nader contends the threshold is
ridiculously high and plans to recruit Buchanan to protest the
process. And he said that if he prevails he hopes to raise the kind
of questions that will spark interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates are asked, What is your position on welfare, what
is your position on crime?' '' Nader said. That's not the right
question. It needs an adjective. What is your position on corporate
welfare? What is your position on corporate crime? We're going to
open this up. We're going to provide adjectives to these issues.''

EDITORIAL: A RUSSIAN AFFIRMATION OF ARMS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   The belated ratification of the landmark 1993 nuclear arms
reduction treaty by Russia's lower house of Parliament on Friday
marks a decisive step in reversing the Cold War weapons spiral.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, approved by the U.S. Senate in 1996 and now expected
to be endorsed by Russia's upper house, will slice the number of
nuclear warheads on both sides nearly in half from current levels.
Its ratification should spur Washington and Moscow to intensify
their efforts to negotiate substantial further cuts in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should approve the new weapons destruction timetables
and missile defense clarifications negotiated three years ago so
that the 1993 treaty's provisions can be put into effect. Moscow's
ratification vote came with one important condition. Parliament and
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, warned that if America
withdraws from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, Moscow's
adherence to other arms control treaties would lapse.
</P>
<P>
   That need never happen. American and Russian negotiators are
trying to work out amendments that would allow both countries to
build limited missile defense systems against unpredictable smaller
states, like North Korea, Iraq and Iran. Time remains for further
discussions, since America has not yet perfected the technology
needed to build such a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Finding agreement on missile defenses might come easier in the
context of accelerated negotiations toward further nuclear weapons
reductions. Putin is eager to reach agreement on additional cuts,
bringing each side's arsenal down to levels as low as 1,500
warheads. Such cuts would save Russia the cost of replacing
multiple-warhead missiles with single-warhead models and leave more
money for conventional forces and social needs at home.
</P>
<P>
   America's target for a new treaty is somewhat higher. But the
history of post-Cold War reductions is that they can develop a
momentum of their own. With Putin now firmly in command and working
with a new, moderate legislature, progress may once again be
possible. The Clinton administration should make a concerted effort
to find out.

 &HT;    MIAMI RELATIVES OF ELIAN LEVEL NEW CHARGES AGAINST HIS FATHER
 &HT;    EDS: New top with fresh material; picks up in 15th graf with:
``Torrential rains. . .''
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A day after a tense showdown and a surprise reprieve,
the fight over Elian Gonzalez boiled Friday with a new legal attack
and an escalation of the increasingly nasty war of accusations
traded between the warring factions of the boy's family.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Elian's Miami relatives leveled new charges that
Elian's father had abused his mother and the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed by the family with court papers, Orlando
Rodriguez, described as a family friend from Cuba, said that Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, mistreated the boy's mother,
Elizabeth Brotons, ``hitting Elizabeth to the point that she went
to the hospital for injuries caused by Juan Miguel.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the affidavit, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez
quoted Rodriguez saying that ``Juan Miguel is of a violent nature,
an impulsive nature. . .which I saw him inflict on his own son
Elian.'' Gutierrez did not elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Elian and a woman, Rodriguez was one of three
survivors of the ill-fated voyage from Cuba last November during
which Elian's mother and 10 other people drowned after their boat
sank.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic accusations were not the Florida family's only
legal salvo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, their lawyers filed a motion in a Washington,
D.C. federal court seeking to block Elian's return to Cuba until
the government certifies that the communist island nation is in
compliance with the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor is returned to Cuba, he
``would face the risk of being persecuted for having sought asylum
in the United States,'' lawyers for Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, wrote in their pleadings. A hearing on the matter was set
for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for the Justice Department also made new legal
moves in a different court Friday, asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to order the Miami family to turn the
boy over to his father until the court rules in a lawsuit stemming
from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers told the court that Juan Miguel Gonzalez has
promised not to return with his son to Cuba until a hearing in the
family's legal appeal, which is set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the Atlanta court would rule on the matter
over the weekend or wait until early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family responded to the government's arguments in a
brief filed late Friday with the Atlanta court. The document
included Rodriguez's affidavit accusing Elian's father of abuse.
Gutierrez released the contents of the affidavit to the media
shortly after the papers were filed.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent a stir through a crowd of protestors gathered
outside the Little Havana home where Elian has been living with his
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had been quiet Friday, a marked contrast to Thursday
when the Miami relatives defied an order by Attorney General Janet
Reno to hand the boy over to be reunited with his father. Fears
that federal marshals would come for Elian prompted thousands of
Cuban exiles to pack the Little Havana neighborhood near the
Florida family's house, with many vowing to form a human chain to
stop the removal of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains on Friday kept the crowds much smaller,
although more than 100 people huddled under a large blue tarp and
dozens of umbrellas late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father remained in the Washington area Friday, where he
has been living at the home of a top Cuban diplomat since arriving
in the United States April 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National
Council of Churches and a key supporter, told reporters that
Gonzalez has been unable to speak with his son for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami family has complete control over access to his son
and that's real hard for him to take,'' she said. ``He has tried to
talk to Elian by telephone numerous times, three times in my
presence. He gets an answering machine that's full.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez reportedly was seething with anger over a videotape
made by his Miami relatives showing his son defiantly telling his
father he doesn't want to return to Cuba. The family released the
tape to a Spanish-language television network early Thursday, and
it quickly became a hot topic of conversation on television and
radio programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on NBC's ``Today'' program Friday, Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner called the tape ``deeply
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., also interviewed on the show,
was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconscionable that they would use that child in this
way,'' she said. ``The child was brainwashed. They're doing to him
what they're accusing Castro of planning to do to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A family attorney, Spencer Eig, denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family was tired, frightened and insulted by the constant
badgering and threats of INS,'' Eig said. ``How is that exploiting
him?''
</P>
<P>
   The escalating rhetoric seemed to dim hopes that a compromise
might be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to take the boy without the family's cooperation, Reno
has offered to take both sides to a secure, neutral location where
they could live in separate quarters for one or two weeks, sharing
custody of Elian while they work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides can't agree on who would have custody of Elian
at the start _ and the end _ of such a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports on Friday that the government has
prepared a plan to extract the boy from the Little Havana home if
the Miami relatives don't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take action in a way that's appropriate when we're
ready,'' Meissner said, noting that the family is now in violation
of the law by ignoring Reno's order.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Eig responded that the family would stand aside and not
interfere if the government takes Elian, but they also would not
assist in the act or take the boy elsewhere to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family will not be the deportation officers for the
INS,'' he said. ``They won't relieve INS of its moral
responsibility in enforcing this order.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ With his collarless black shirt,
close-cropped hair and wire-rim glasses, Gil Shwed looks like a
20-something denizen of the local coffeehouse scene. But he says he
doesn't get out of the office much, unless he is traveling to one
of his other offices _ in California, Singapore, Germany, Japan,
France or Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is a cappuccino machine just down the hall, next
to the treadmills and stair machines that Shwed provides for his
headquarters staff, now almost 300 strong and expanding daily.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, this intense, fidgety Wunderkind runs Check Point
Software, which is by stock market reckoning the biggest company
that Israel has ever seen. With its capitalization bouncing between
$11 billion and $20 billion, this Nasdaq-traded but Israeli-based
company is worth much more than the phone monopoly and leading bank
_ the two next-largest public companies here _ combined.
</P>
<P>
   In an ascent that shocked the tightly knit Israeli business
world, Shwed took Check Point to these heights in just its fourth
year on the market. And he did so while keeping his global company
openly and proudly Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   The boyish Shwed, who started his first software consulting firm
at 15 as the computer-prodigy son of a Jerusalem civil servant, is
now deferentially courted by business leaders who are decades
older. And he is lionized in the popular press in terms once
reserved for war heroes and Zionist pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   His success has opened doors for dozens of other young companies
that are now prospering internationally with Israeli technology and
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gil Shwed is a role model in Israel today,'' said Nir Barkat,
the eternally grateful chairman of BRM, an investment capital firm
in Jerusalem. Back in 1993, when BRM was a small software
developer, it gave Shwed $300,000 in 1993 and got half of his new
company in return. (That stake has since been reduced to 4 percent,
worth a mere $434 million or so.) ``He did something extraordinary,
coming out of nowhere and creating this giant.''
</P>
<P>
   More significant than Shwed's individual accomplishment, though,
is his place in a phenomenon that many Israelis say is reshaping
not just the business landscape, but also the very contours of
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Israel is witnessing an explosion of private
wealth generated by foreign markets and foreign investment. The
surge raises tantalizing visions of new cyber-empires operating
locally but competing globally _ and, some people say, troubling
prospects of new economic schisms in a society that was once
proudly egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's technology boom also has knit a volatile country into
the most volatile part of the global economy. Recent plunges in the
Nasdaq have pulled the Tel Aviv exchange down, too, as an economy
once based on self-defense and self-sufficiency now finds its
fortunes more affected by a stock sell-off on Wall Street than by
the paralysis of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes published its global billionaires survey last year,
it could identify only three Israeli candidates: Ted Arison, the
since-deceased cruise ship magnate, whose diversified empire was
worth an estimated $5.6 billion, and Yuli and Sammy Ofer, whose
local Ofer Brothers industrial conglomerate was valued at $1.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Nasdaq, Check Point alone has produced three
billionaires: Shwed and his two partners, who each own 10 percent
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Others are suddenly halfway there, like Kobi Anderson of
Comverse and Aryeh Feingold of Mercury Interactive, whose
American-based companies both more than tripled in value since the
beginning of last year, despite the Nasdaq's recent meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two are bidding jointly for Maccabi Tel Aviv, the
country's European championship-contending basketball team, in one
of the first Paul Allen-like manifestations here of the new
economy. Another Israeli demi-billionaire is Daniel Lewin, 29, an
MIT algorithms whiz with 10 percent of Akamai Technologies, of
which he was a co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and Israel waited 2,000 years for each other,''
exulted Yossi Vardi, another leading high-technology entrepreneur,
who recently concluded his second $400 million sale of an Internet
start-up to American buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Silicon Valley or Fairfax County, Va., such
overnight empires are no longer news. But it is difficult to
overstate the significance of this sudden accumulation of corporate
power for Israel, a $100 billion economy that until recently was
dominated by a cluster of state-controlled banks, utilities and
military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale and speed of what is going on here has, I think,
shocked everybody,'' said Jonathan Medved of Israel Seed Partners,
a venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   After almost four years of stagnation, the Israeli economy
started expanding briskly in late 1999, posting a 5 percent growth
rate that was propelled by high-technology exports and a record
$1.3 billion invested in new electronics and software ventures last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the full impact of this new wealth has not yet been felt, as
paper profits from fast-rising stock prices are only now being used
to finance corporate acquisitions and international expansion.
High-technology job growth still isn't fast enough to dent the 9
percent unemployment rate, though the sector's earnings are rising
fast enough to make income disparities plainly visible. Thousands
of young Israelis are holding millions in unredeemed stock options,
many of them still well above water.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even business leaders driving this technology boom have some
trepidations about the way it is transforming Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have is high tech,'' said Alexander, the
chairman of Comverse, which makes voice mail and messaging systems.
``We have no choice. But what is not that good is that most of the
wealth is going to 35 percent of the population. A lot of people
are being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis who have not been left behind are, like Alexander,
relocating abroad, at least temporarily. In an age and an industry
that encourages transcontinental mobility, Israel's high-technology
entrepreneurs are torn between business ambitions and loyalties to
a homeland that was predicated on attracting and retaining
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   With technology stocks swooning over the last few weeks,
Israelis are discovering another downside of globalization. Shwed's
net worth, for example, fell from $2 billion to $1 billion in the
space of a few days. But he shrugs off the fluctuations. ``We are
in this for the long term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Check Point reported a record $40 million profit and revenues of
$78 million in the latest quarter, up nearly 80 percent from the
corresponding quarter of 1999. Shwed said he expects continuing
annual earnings growth of 30 percent to 40 percent, a projection
that industry analysts call conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Check Point is the archetypal Israeli high-technology success
story: Three army buddies, working as computer-wise draftees in
military intelligence agencies, leave the service with what Shwed
calls ``a pretty good idea'' for a commercial software product.
Their now-patented firewall program, based on an improvised
solution to the army's need for security in disparate
interconnected computer networks, quickly becomes a global industry
standard.
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, there is a kind of delighted astonishment
that their military survival skills and national ingenuity _ like
entrusting teen-agers with the development of top-secret computer
programs _ have proved so unexpectedly transferable to the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the way the Romanians produced a Nadia Comanici, or the
Russians produced chess masters, Israel produced electronic systems
engineers,'' Vardi said. ``Their army training gave them a kind of
commando mentality _ you move fast, you improvise _ that is ideal
for dealing with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Their success at finding civilian applications for military
hardware and software is hailed as a plowshares paradigm for this
military-obsessed nation, which is just beginning to anticipate the
possibility of a different and peaceful future. ``It is part of our
culture: They shall beat their swords into Sony Playstations,''
Vardi proclaimed. ``It is right there in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Their shared military origins may also better protect Israeli
companies from a high-technology market implosion, some analysts
say. These are not highflying Web portals or e-tailers; they are
mostly back-office, inside-the-network mechanics, relying on the
corporate market for secure communications and business-to-business
computer transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Others are data transmission specialists. Most are reporting
real profits and rising sales; one indicator is the record $2
billion that Israel earned from software exports last year, almost
double the 1998 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the Internet companies which people associate
with losing lots of money in return for market share,'' said
Clifford A. Goldstein, the American founder of Amdidex35, a
Nasdaq-listed index fund of the 35 largest Israeli-run public
corporations. ``These are companies shipping product.''
</P>
<P>
   (Still, Akamai, the Internet systems maker that was one of last
year's hottest Nasdaq stocks, has lost a stunning 80 percent of its
market value since Jan. 1.)
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 Israelis now work for high-technology companies
here, of whom perhaps one-third are highly-paid managers and
engineers, estimated Shali Tshuva, an investor and analyst who has
supervised government studies of the sector. Salaries in that upper
tier have doubled in the last three years, company recruiters say.
Yet wages elsewhere in the economy have remained stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me is that it might create an upstairs-downstairs
environment here,'' Tshuva said. ``There is such an enormous
difference in income between old-economy employees and new-economy
employees, you might end up with two economies in the same
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Or two societies. Israel's new entrepreneurial class is highly
educated, fluently multilingual and politically unrooted, with
leftish support for peace pacts matched by free-market scorn for
business regulations. It is internationally transient, moving
confidently through Manhattan and London and Silicon Valley from
its staunchly secular base in northern Tel Aviv. It is ethnically
European, including Russian and North American immigrants. It has
little contact with Arabs or Orthodox Jews, Israel's two large,
poor minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that disdains ostentation, there are few
conspicuous displays of new money. Israeli techies appear to be
working constantly _ ``like crazy people,'' said Barkat, admiringly
_ online and by telephone, across several time zones, late into the
evening, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend 14 hours in the office, half of it not even in
Israel,'' Shwed remarked, shifting in a leather chair in the 24th
floor of a skyscraper in Tel Aviv's diamond district _ the center
of what used to be the country's only global civilian business.
``We care about what is going on here, but our focus has been
looking outside of Israel, rather than looking inside. It is a very
strange situation. You are very attached to something, but you are
also detached from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 5 or 10 years, Shwed predicted, he and his peers will be
devoting much of their time and money to private philanthropy,
especially in education, now almost wholly financed by the
government and by Jewish donors overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, he said, they are concentrating on
``building their businesses'' _ and, in a new experience for
wealthy entrepreneurs here, they are being cheered on from the
sidelines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historically, from its kibbutznik grass roots to its avowedly
Socialist leadership, this was a culture that cherished communal
endeavor and frowned on individualism. Patriotism, not profit, was
the incentive.
</P>
<P>
   The business community _ despite the wealth concentrated in a
few family conglomerates _ was devoted mostly to state enterprises
judged essential to the survival of the young nation. Tax policies,
social mores and limited investment opportunities made
entrepreneurial fortunes exceedingly rare _ and entrepreneurs
themselves the frequent object of envy and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the success of the new high-technology rich ``inspires
fear as well as admiration,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a prominent social
commentator. ``Because the scale of the wealth these people have
attained is almost surrealistic, and because it comes out of a
market that is partly incomprehensible, this new elite looks in
some ways like an undeserving elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Overriding such misgivings, though, is a powerful surge of
national pride in the idea of young Israelis triumphing in world
markets ``on the basis of their brains alone,'' Ezrahi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making it globally, and we are proud of them,'' he
added, ``like we are proud of our soccer and basketball players
when they make it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a turning point in Israeli attitudes toward
business, it was the development in late 1996 of an
instant-messaging system by four army friends in their early 20s
who distributed their software free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their tiny company, Mirabilis, with the real-time e-mail system
they called ICQ, was soon serving an Internet following in the
millions.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, America Online snapped up the
19-month-old company for $380 million in cash and stock, then the
largest foreign purchase of a local company in Israeli history. The
sale not only made the young founders very rich; it also
transformed them into local media stars, with commentators
comparing them to the Israeli commando heroes of Entebbe and the
Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 19 months, starting from zero, they created $400 million in
value,'' said Vardi, who as the father of Arik Vardi, one of the
founders, became the company's first business manager. ``It
galvanized the whole country and made us all a little insane. The
whole country got into a frenzy of Internet projects. Everybody
wanted to be an entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much and how quickly expectations and
ambitions have changed that the Mirabilis founders are now
criticized as having sold out too soon, and for too little. They
and their company are now merely a small, Israeli-based division of
the expanding AOL empire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one immediate result of the ``Mirabilis effect,'' as it
was called on Israel's business pages, was that hundreds of
affluent Israelis were suddenly willing to bankroll their brilliant
nephews' computer doodlings; scores of professional investors
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has since become one of the most prolific incubators of
technology companies in the world. Hundreds were founded last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of 10 industrialized countries by Babson College
and the London Business School showed that Israel is surpassed by
only the United States and Canada on several measures of
entrepreneurial initiative, from the prevalence of independent
start-up companies to the share of the adult population _ 5.4
percent _ reporting direct involvement in new business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant, the researchers found a big change in
attitudes towards business here _ a shift that many people
attribute to Mirabilis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social norms now stress individualism, materialism and
independence,'' they reported. ``The entrepreneur has become
Israel's newest cultural hero and role model, a figure to be
respected and emulated by large parts of the younger generation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israeli entrepreneurs are enjoying not only local social
acceptance, but also unprecedented foreign financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank reported that Israeli companies raised
two-thirds of their funds abroad last year, largely from American
stock offerings; a decade ago, barely 10 percent of private-sector
capital was from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, American venture capitalists alone pumped $1
billion into new Israeli businesses in 1999, outpacing the $900
million in official United States economic aid that Israel
received. This month, in just one sign of growing investor
interest, the American Internet pioneers Marc Andreeson (formerly
of Netscape Communications), Jerry Yang (Yahoo), and Pierre Omidyar
(eBay) helped bankroll a new $180 million seed fund for Israeli
Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the money comes with a condition. Almost all venture
capitalists _ Israeli and foreign alike _ are requiring new
companies to establish their headquarters in the United States, as
a prelude to a Nasdaq offering or a takeover by an American
multinational.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the high-technology expatriates is Amdocs, a
voice mail and telephone billing specialist now allied with SBC
Communications, the former Southwestern Bell. Once a small Israeli
software developer, Amdocs is now worth about $13 billion. It
employs more than 3,000 technicians and engineers here, but has its
headquarters in Chesterfield, Mo.; it has also hired American
senior managers.
</P>
<P>
   Comverse, valued at more than $11 billion, has also lost much of
its Israeli identity. ``Comverse is not an Israeli company; it is
an international company with a strong presence in Israel,'' said
Alexander, pointing to its Woodbury, N.Y., headquarters and its
recent inclusion in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. But, he quickly
added, ``the heart and soul of the company is in Israel'' _
including the vital research and development division.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is accelerating. By one common estimate, some 10,000
Israelis now work in Silicon Valley, many in companies that also
originated in Israel _ including surging innovators like the DSP
Group, a $1.2 billion software designer, and Vyyo, a wireless
Internet broadcaster that is the latest venture of Davidi Gilo, a
Tel Aviv entrepreneur who sold his previous company to Intel for
$1.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   An American corporate identity is a better global sales
strategy, many people contend, while the taint of political risk
still associated with the Middle East is believed to depress stock
values of companies registered here. Moreover, Vardi argued,
integration into the American marketplace, with its technological
ferment, is an inevitable and even desirable consequence of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole success of the Israeli high-tech sector has been
based on an alliance with the major American players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Israeli taxes and regulations are a disincentive
for incorporating at home. Irked entrepreneurs cite what they see
as archaic restraints on their management freedom; an Israeli
public company sometimes cannot buy another business or give new
employees stock options without convening a shareholders meeting,
they complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are forcing every Israeli company with any brains to
set up shop overseas,'' said Medved, the venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Check Point, with its headquarters here even though most of its
800 employees are stationed abroad, remains the most prominent
exception _ one reason that Shwed, a vocal champion of Israeli
registry, has such a following here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is who we are,'' Shwed said. ``We are a global company
that operates from both Israel and the United States, and the fact
that we are Israelis is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Check Point, like other companies here in the computer security
trade, occupies a business niche where being identifiably Israeli
may be an advantage. Even the company's name (unconsciously, Shwed
says) evokes its Israeli military heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Shwed says Check Point proves that young Israeli companies are
wrong when they contend that they have to leave home to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't think it is good for Israel,'' he said.
``But I also think it is not good for these companies. I think some
of these companies are doing it because they don't look at building
a real business as their goal. The idea is to be sexy for two years
and sell out for a lot of money. I don't believe in that business
model.''
</P>
<P>
   A better model, he suggested, would be Nokia of Finland or
Ericsson of Sweden _ global companies competing successfully from
small countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some American industry leaders concur.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a government adviser, I would devote a lot of
attention to ensuring that the success stories stay here,'' said
Charles B. Wang, the chairman of Computer Associates International,
on a visit to Israel earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is no detached bystander. He recently paid $600 million for
three Israeli companies _ all of them Internet security specialists
_ and added their 250 employees to his global work force of 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Israel ``has all the technological know-how to become a major
player,'' he said, but it needs comparable marketing expertise _
something best developed by building its own multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' Wang warned, ``you become a minor league
system,'' developing talent and technology for others.

FORD RESTRUCTURING TO STRENGTHEN FAMILY'S CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes numbers in 3rd-last graf) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford Motor Co. on Friday announced a complex
revamping of its ownership structure, including the payment of a
$10 billion special dividend _ the largest ever by a U.S. company _
and the issuance of additional stock to the Ford family, cementing
its grip on the world's second-largest industrial corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to let Ford distribute nearly half of its
$24 billion cash hoard, one of the largest of any company in the
world, while minimizing taxes for its shareholders and giving the
Ford family greater financial flexibility, particularly for estate
planning.
</P>
<P>
   But the big cash disbursement could leave Ford somewhat more
vulnerable in a recession, although the company will still have as
much cash after the special dividend as General Motors has now.
</P>
<P>
   The dividend may limit somewhat Ford's ability to undertake
further large acquisitions; Ford bought Volvo Cars a year ago and
agreed last month to buy Land Rover from BMW. But Jacques A.
Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that the company would not
rule out further deals.
</P>
<P>
   The recapitalization plan unveiled Friday is a delicate balance
between the interests of Ford Motor's public shareholders and the
interests of Henry Ford's descendants. Big institutional
shareholders and Wall Street analysts have been urging Ford Motor
since the mid-1990s to disburse some of its enormous cash hoard by
buying back stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ford family has always resisted share buybacks,
insisting on dividends instead because of the special class of
stock that the family holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford family holds all 71 million shares of the company's
Class B stock, along with a small number of the company's 1.1
billion common shares. Under rules that were designed to preserve
family control and were drafted when the company went public in
1956, the family holds 40 percent of the voting power at the
company as long as it continues to own at least 60.7 million shares
of the Class B stock _ even though the Class B shares make up only
6 percent of the company's overall equity.
</P>
<P>
   If the family sells too many shares of its Class B stock,
whether to pay estate taxes, cover personal expenses or simply
participate in a stock buyback, then the family's influence
shrinks. If the family's holdings fall to between 33.7 million and
60.7 million shares of Class B stock, the family wields only 30
percent of the voting power. And if the family's holdings fall
below 33.7 million shares then all special voting privileges are
lost.
</P>
<P>
   When Class B shares are sold outside the family, they revert to
common stock. Under Friday's plan, each holder of Ford's common or
Class B stock will be given a choice of receiving $20 a share in
cash or additional common stock.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and one of Henry Ford's 13
great-grandchildren, said that the members of the Ford family would
take additional stock for all of their Class B stock. Most if not
all family members would put the additional distribution into the
family's voting trust, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The extended family faces the problem of covering estate taxes
while preserving family control of the company upon the eventual
deaths of Henry Ford's two surviving grandchildren, Josephine F.
Ford and William C. Ford Sr., who are in their mid-70s. Friday's
arrangement will give the family $1.42 billion worth of common
stock to sell without touching their Class B stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor is reissuing its common and Class B stock as part of
the recapitalization, allowing the $20 special dividend for other
shareholders to be taxed at the lower rates for capital gains
instead of the higher rates for income taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford Motor said that after the recapitalization, it would also
spin off its wholly owned auto-parts subsidiary, Visteon Corp., by
distributing all of the shares to all holders of common and Class B
stock. Visteon has $19 billion a year in sales, of which $17
billion are to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr. said that he would definitely retain the
Visteon shares he received, and other family members were also
likely to keep them, providing another big asset for the family to
sell someday while safeguarding the Class B shares.
</P>
<P>
   The family had partially addressed the estate-tax problem in
1998, when Ford distributed to shareholders its 80 percent stake in
Associates First Capital Corp., a consumer lending business.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that their plan would not require special
approval by the Internal Revenue Service or the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers not involved in
putting the deal together, agreed with that assessment. He said
that the special dividend would easily be the largest ever paid,
and that the overall deal did not appear to favor the Ford family
at the expense of other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said that the distribution of common stock to the Ford family would
also align the family's interests more closely with those of other
shareholders in the future. The family will henceforth have common
shares to tender in any future stock buybacks by Ford Motor, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market welcomed Ford's plan, bidding up its stock
immediately after the morning announcement even as the rest of the
market plunged, although Ford shares also began to fall by early
afternoon and closed at $53.1875, down $1.25. But Standard &AMP;
Poor's, the credit-rating agency, lowered the rating on Ford's
long-term debt to A from A-plus, saying that Ford would have less
of a cash cushion for making bond payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has talked frequently in interviews over the years about
his desire to pass on the family's leading role at Ford Motor to
his children and grandchildren someday. Although hostile or
friendly approaches by potential merger candidates have sometimes
forced special dividends and share buybacks at other companies,
Ford said that the company was not under outside pressure and that
the family's role would continue to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has always been, and will be as long as there is a
Ford family, to keep Ford an independent entity,'' he said.

ACHING FOR A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ On Wednesday, it was an allergic reaction
that caused red spots to pop up on his body. A day later, he was in
bed most of the day after catching a cold.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it might sound, there is no better way for Adrian
Fernandez to attack a CART FedEx Championship Series race weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time I feel sick, I do something good on
the track,'' said the 34-year-old Patrick Racing competitor from
Mexico City. ``Right now, my body is aching.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even with the aching body, Fernandez managed a big
smile after winning the provisional pole position for the 26th
running of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is some work to be done, Fernandez is the
quickest driver after posting a best-lap time of 68.636 seconds at
an average speed of 103.223 miles per hour on the revamped 11-turn,
1.968-mile circuit on the streets of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a special moment for me,'' said Fernandez,
whose only previous pole position was in 1998 at the U.S. 500 at
Michigan Speedway. ``I'm happy to get the (provisional) pole
position and think we can hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who was also the fastest in a morning practice
session, will lead the fastest drivers from Friday's session in the
final qualifying today at 2:30 p.m. The slower drivers from Friday
will begin their final qualifying effort at 1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the track is better than it's ever been,'' Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new section, which comes after the drivers circle the
parking garage adjacent to the Aquarium of the Pacific and proceed
east on Shoreline Ave. before darting on to Pine Ave., should
create some more excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track gives you more time to enjoy the circuit,'' said Max
Papis, the third-fastest qualifier who pilots the Ford-powered Team
Rahal Reynard and is the early points leader after winning the
season-opener in Miami. ``Last year's circuit was too many twists
and turns and a little place to pass. Passing is going to be better
in the race.''

FOXSPORTS.COM OFFERS NIFTY BASEBALL SEARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a time to be a fantasy baseball geek.
</P>
<P>
   By launching its handy Sports Geniuses Sports Search this week,
FoxSports.com has provided virtual nirvana for the fantasy-baseball
enthusiasts or trivia buffs who hound the newspaper sports desk.
</P>
<P>
   Users accessing the search (sportssearch.foxsports.com) can
simply type in a question about a major-league team or player from
1876 to the present and get an instant answer.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, ask it anything. It has millions of answers.
</P>
<P>
   What was the Rangers' wins and losses for 1996? Up pops the
answer with links to the team's pitching statistics for '95-96. Of
course, it can be stumped. It can't give you former Rangers general
manager Tom Grieve's nickname (answer: Tag).
</P>
<P>
   The search is programmed to find such data as a player's uniform
number, the park surface he plays on, detailed pitching information
_ everything except what he thinks about riding on a New York
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Geniuses Sports Search might remind online users of Ask
Jeeves (ask.com), the all-purpose search site that accesses
hyperlinks to specific questions. But because it actually gives
answers instead of a list of links related to the question,
FoxSports.com's newest feature is better than Ask Jeeves.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ziering, president and founder of Waltham, Mass.-based Fact
City, developed the search feature because he was frustrated that
he couldn't get quick answers to simple questions on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, you can get answers back without spending a lot of
time looking,'' Ziering said.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint news release, the two companies cited an analyst's
opinion that a fact-finding search engine kept users on the site of
origin. It beats the ``traditional way of where you go to a page,
go to another page and on and on,'' said Danny Greenberg,
FoxSports.com senior vice president. ``With this, you simply type
in the keywords.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Geniuses Sports Search is part of FoxSports.com's
continuing upgrade of baseball content. News Digital Media,
FoxSports.com's parent company in New York, recently acquired Stats
Inc., a company in Chicago that manages and provides sports
information content and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   With Stats Inc. on board, FoxSports.com is carving a big niche
with baseball content, taking on rivals TotalBaseball, ESPN.com and
CBS SportsLine. And it should get even better with FoxSports.com's
plan to release an online baseball almanac in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also means the development of search sites for
other sports, such as college basketball, college football and
professional golf, by the fall, Ziering said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be geek heaven.
</P>
<P>
   BYTES: SportsYA! (www.sportsya.com), an interactive Spanish- and
Portuguese-language sports portal based in Miami, has signed Clyde
Drexler, Nadia Comaneci, Mark Spitz and Janet Evans _ all former
Olympians _ to provide online commentary. ... As if Charles Barkley
didn't get enough air time, his Internet-only talk show debuted
last week on Nike's Web site (www.nike.com//cbn). Once you get
through all the necessary video plug-ins, users can watch Barkley
interview guests in front of a live audience in Las Vegas. ... The
San Francisco Giants obviously benefit from Silicon Valley. Nearly
half of all the Giants' single-game tickets were sold on their site
(www.sfgiants.com).

<P>
   COOL CONTEST: Here's a way to keep track of bonuses in
major-league baseball: TodaysSports.com Auction Prize Program. Fans
bid on baseball memorabilia and can earn cash bonuses if the player
associated with that item reaches a predetermined goal. For
example, the winning bidder on the Rafael Palmeiro-autographed bat
will win $50,000 if the Rangers first baseman wins the 2000
American League batting title.

   CHATTING ON THE RUN: Jerry Dunn, a 54-year-old runner from
Spearfish, S.D., who plans to run 200 marathons in 2000, is
scheduled to chat live from noon to 1 p.m. Monday on Active.com
while he runs the Boston Marathon. nn

   BAM -- Ex-Kansas City Chiefs running back Bam Morris appeared on
marijuana trafficking charges Friday in U.S. District Court.
Records say Chiefs kick returner Tamarick Vanover personally
financed bringing 200 pounds of marijuana from Texas to Kansas
City. Two other men also were charged. Records mention some
familiar names in the most recent case, including Greg Burns and
Chad Pollard. Both were charged in a previous drug case. By Mark

   BANK -- When Bob Wood &AMP; Associates Inc. Realty Co. bought the
former Metropolitan Bank in Kansas City, Mo., last year they

tenants. The system worked well, until five reliable paying renters
complained that their checks were evaporating somehow from the drop
box. When they ripped apart the drop box they discovered checks
that had fallen in cracks in the box, including bank deposits
dating back to 1971. By Lee Hill Kavanaugh. Story will move in the

TIGER TIME NO BONANZA FOR SPORT OF GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Wall Street
Journal used this week's post-Masters tournament lull to explore an
irony discussed occasionally in this space since golf's Tiger era
began.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tigermania has made golf more popular as a spectator sport, but
the emergence of Tiger Woods as the game's supernova is not
translating into a playing boom or a business bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   The particulars of my columns on the subject were in the same
vein as those analyzed by The Journal story. Of the 26 million
Americans who last year played 530 million rounds, only 5.4 million
golfers played more than 25 times. These avid golfers were
responsible for about 60 percent of the industry's $30 billion
annual revenue. The 1999 numbers aren't much different from 1998's,
or 1988's for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders say the lack of growth is due to a failure to
do a better job of marketing the game to potential golfers who need
schmoozing and coaxing. The industry's lagging fortunes are
especially discouraging given the high expectations generated by
the arrival of the charismatic Woods in 1996 and his
record-shattering Masters triumph the following spring.
</P>
<P>
   A Fortune magazine headline proclaimed, ``Tiger! Now the Sky's
the Limit for Golf _ the Game and the Business.'' If anything, it
has been just the opposite for the business end of the game. Many
equipment companies have failed, and the survivors have seen sales
plummet along with their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Nothing really. Golf is as difficult as it is
enchanting. The Scots invented the game many centuries ago. It's
been said of these dour people that they're born expecting very
little comfort during their passage through this vale of tears and
are seldom disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem golf faces is an apparent obsession by course
developers and their financial backers with pricey layouts amenable
to promoting residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Although golf in the Kansas City area seems to be faring
reasonably well, signs of this problem abound locally. My
perception is shaped by two factors. One is a golf fanaticism that
leads me to play 85 to 100 rounds a year. More recently, however,
has been the experience of writing a book about public golf in
Kansas City, to be published by The Star in six weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   My ``research,'' as my colleagues snickeringly characterize it,
involves playing all publicly accessible area courses. Too many of
the recently developed courses, even those undertaken by
municipalities, have been conceived as high-end, high-cost
operations. They're inordinately expensive and intimidating for
average golfers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, most of Kansas City's older courses, publicly
and privately owned alike, are unpretentious, highly playable
layouts affordable by the working-class and seniors with limited
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward cities pushing pricey golf layouts to encourage
developers to do the heavy financial lifting is antithetical to the
interest of most community residents. Part of it is ego and part
economics, and it works against the interests of the local golfing
community as well as the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's inherent difficulty works against its becoming a game for
the masses, but course development trends guarantee its stasis.

KENTUCKY LAW FIRM FILES OBJECTIONS TO WATER HEATER SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kentucky law firm
is challenging a settlement to fix millions of defective water
heaters, claiming that it falls short of protecting the consumers
it is supposed to help.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop and Wilson, a Louisville law firm, filed its objections
at the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, where a hearing is
planned for next week on whether the settlement should receive
final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm, according to the court filing, plans to argue that
the settlement fails to meet the standards of fairness and adequacy
for a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have ``not been adequately represented by the present
class counsel,'' according to the Bishop and Wilson filing.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Phalen, co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, said Thursday that
a reply to the Bishop and Wilson allegations would be filed with
the court Friday. A copy of the document, however, was not
available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which received preliminary approval in November,
involves about 14 million water heaters made by the country's
largest water heater manufacturers. It spelled out a campaign to
notify consumers about the problem and a system to reimburse them
for repair costs.
</P>
<P>
   The water heaters contain a defective plastic pipe called a dip
tube, which can break apart, causing diminished supplies of hot
water. As the tube disintegrates, it can also plug faucets and
plumbing with plastic chips. The defective tubes were made by
Perfection Corp., which then sold them to the water heater
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's hearing in Kansas City comes as 24 state attorneys
general appear near their own settlement with the water heater
manufacturers and Perfection Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the very final stages,'' said Chris DeWitt, a
spokesman for the Michigan attorney general, whose office is
leading the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Details of what might be in the settlement were not disclosed.
But it is assumed it will focus more on any alleged violations of
consumer protection laws and any penalties or fines that should be
assessed against the companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the settlement of the class-action lawsuit dwells
on repairing the water heaters. U.S. District Court Judge Howard
Sachs in Kansas City gave his preliminary approval to the
settlement last November, which allowed the repairs to begin. He
now must decide whether the settlement should get final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The firm of Bishop and Wilson claims that it shouldn't. Among
the settlement's deficiencies, it says, is that not enough has been
done to notify consumers who have to request the repairs. About $3
million was spent publishing notices about the settlement in
various publications, but the Kentucky law firm claims that more
needs to be done to directly notify consumers who have the
defective water heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and Wilson also claims that since no estimates are made
about the total value of the settlement, there is no way to
determine whether the $5.6 million in fees being sought by lawyers
representing consumers in the case is justified.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of the settlement's repair program has not
been without its glitches since it began in November. Consumers had
difficulty receiving claim forms and delays in receiving the
repairs. Those problems, administrators said, were fixed.
</P>
<P>
   But many consumers say various problems still exist. Rex Newbold
of Shawnee, Kan., for instance, recently received a letter from the
settlement's administrators that said his water heater had been
bought at Home Depot, which supposedly didn't sell water heaters
with the defective dip tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter puzzles Newbold. His water heater isn't the brand
that was sold by Home Depot. The water heater also was in his home
before 1997, when Home Depot entered the Kansas City area market.
Only the builder of Newbold's home, however, can say where the
water heater was purchased, and he hasn't returned Newbold's
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all I can do is wait,'' he said.
</P>

KINGS INTEND TO GET MORE OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Los Angeles Kings spent nearly an entire workout
Friday on drills designed to attack the Red Wings zone.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit dominated between the blue lines in Thursday's 2-0 loss
and Kings coach Andy Murray said that would not happen this
afternoon in the second game of the best-of-seven first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be much better there,'' he said. ``What we need to do
right now is simple. Score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though top forwards Ziggy Palffy and Bryan Smolinski were
playing their first game after serious injuries, the Red Wings
limited the Kings' two top lines to just one shot in the first two
periods and none by Glen Murray for the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille probably had the Kings' best scoring chance with
a blast from the point at the 13 minute mark of the third period.
Palffy also had a good chance late but was pulled down by Sergei
Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray said there would be no lineup changes, instead
working the players in three-on-two drills for almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep the pressure on,'' said Ian Laperriere. ``Just
like we did all season.''
</P>
<P>
   During the year, the Kings went 2-2-1 against Detroit and used
their size and mobility to cause matchup problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Red Wings bottled up the Kings and made it
difficult to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our toughest first-round opponent,'' said Steve
Yzerman, who is expected back after missing Thursday's game with
the flu and a tender knee. ``They're a better team than their
record indicates. You watch their team closely and they're a big,
strong team, well organized and well coached.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Quick whistles: The Kings will fly back to L.A. immediately
following today's game. The players switched hotels on Friday after
loud construction made it difficult to sleep before Thursday's
game.... Jim Nill, assistant GM for the Red Wings, has been
mentioned as a candidate for the vacant Calgary job.

NETS' NEWMAN PUTS ON A SHOW, BUT MAGIC IS NOT UNDONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Johnny Newman did practically everything
imaginable in the second half on Friday night to help the New
Jersey Nets end their season-long losing streak at eight games. He
hit 3-pointers while hands blocked his vision, short jumpers while
being hounded by opponents, and driving layups while under duress.
</P>
<P>
   But Newman's 27 points in the second half were not enough to
lift the injury-depleted Nets over the Orlando Magic. Getting 45
points from its starting backcourt of Darrell Armstrong (23) and
Ron Mercer (22), the Magic prevailed, 96-88, handing the Nets their
12th loss in their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 15 straight points for the Nets, the 36-year-old Newman
cut a 77-68 deficit to 84-83 with four minutes 17 seconds
remaining. After the Magic answered, the Nets' Keith Van Horn
scored on a runner to cut the lead to one point again. But the
Magic, behind two jumpers by Armstrong, scored six straight points
to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn scored 25 points, including 18 in the first half, and
had 17 rebounds for the Nets, who never led. In a dominating
performance, Ben Wallace grabbed 20 rebounds for the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Nets, the Magic did not have to search for
motivation. With four games remaining at the start of the night, it
was tied with the Milwaukee Bucks for the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee, which played Charlotte
on Friday night, owns the tie breaker, having whipped the Magic by
a combined 41 points in their three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey did not try to sell his team on the spoiler's
role, though. Instead, he reminded them that the Nets had not won
since the Magic all but ended their faint playoff hopes with a
103-97 victory on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we lost to them, we've lost eight in a row,'' Casey
said before the game. ``So there might be a little revenge, get
even, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But returning the favor would be difficult with Stephon Marbury
and Kerry Kittles on the sideline for their sixth and fifth
straight games, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn did his best to help the Nets overcome early on,
carrying the Nets in the first quarter with 10 points and seven
rebounds. The Nets were fortunate that he was on target, because
the rest of the team combined to make only five of 18 shots in the
first quarter. Behind Van Horn, the Nets trailed by 24-20 heading
into the second quarter, despite allowing the Magic to secure an
outrageous 22 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn received some help in the second, as Elliot Perry
scored six points and Lucious Harris added eight to keep the Magic
from pulling away. Though the Nets never took the lead, the deficit
never swelled past six points, and the Magic led by 45-39 at
intermission.

MONEY LOST FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS FOUND IN FORMER BANK'S NIGHT DEPOSIT
BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For almost three
decades, David Haake's $45 cash deposit hid from human eyes,
trapped inside the metallic guts of a night deposit drop box at the
former Metropolitan Bank at 75th Street and Troost Avenue.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evening of Nov. 21, 1971, Haake slipped his cash into an
envelope, pulled the drop box open and dropped the money in. At the
time, he was 17 years old and working at a pet store for $1 an
hour. The $45 was for 45 hours of cleaning cages, stocking pet food
and sweeping floors.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was his girlfriend's birthday, so he was in a hurry
to celebrate with her. He didn't notice that he'd put the envelope
in the wrong place _ instead of dropping it in the check drop slot,
he had put it in the night deposit drop. One was made for
envelopes; the other for money bags.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later bank officials didn't believe the teen-ager
when he complained that his cash deposit was missing. Eventually,
he forgot all about it.
</P>
<P>
   A few other checks disappeared, too: a check for $1,000 from the
pet store, the Menagerie Inc., dated May 27, 1974; a check for $125
from Carol Edelman, written March 13, 1974; and a $1,050 check from
Harry's Supermarket, dated Jan. 12, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And the years passed. Haake wouldn't see his money again until
this week _ almost 29 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Bank moved. Other banks moved into the building at
7530 Troost Ave. The last bank moved out in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Bob Wood &AMP; Associates Inc. Realty bought the
colonial style building and moved in.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in September, the company decided to use the
drive-through teller window during the day and the check deposit
night slot as a convenience for its tenants after hours. In March,
they switched to the bottom night drop box because the slot wasn't
big enough for keys or contracts. The system seemed to work well,
until a few tenants began complaining that they dropped off their
checks but weren't credited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't believe the first one,'' said Brian Bucksner, vice
president of the company. ``But when the number of tenants grew to
five and a few of those were very good paying tenants, I knew
something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bucksner investigated by peering inside the drop box.
He spied the corner of a white envelope peeking from underneath the
gray metal plate _ the same inner plate that lifts and pushes
whatever is inside the box every time the drop box is closed.
</P>
<P>
   He called a safe company, which dismantled the drop box hours
later. That's when the mystery of the disappearing rent checks was
solved.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, only a few know what dramas were played out
when the checks first disappeared so many years ago. The checks are
now worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Only one check's owner was found: Fred Ausdenmore, 70, the
co-owner of the Menagerie, who had written the $1,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   Ausdenmore, now retired from his pet store, laughed when told
about the found check and about his former employee, David Haake,
who also lost a deposit. But he couldn't recall if the store's lost
check caused any of his employees' paychecks to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We transferred money from our business account into the
payroll account,'' he said. ``But I sure don't remember losing
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksner contacted the five rental clients whose recent checks
were found. And for now, the night drawer is still dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanism plate was strictly designed for bags of money,''
he said, ``but the safe company is going to redesign it so that it
will accept checks and money orders safely. But no, we never accept
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Haake, now 46, of Olathe, Kan., getting back his $45
makes for a nice story for him and his wife, the girlfriend whose
birthday it was that fateful evening.
</P>
<P>
   Haake plans to give the money to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ends up with most of my money anyway,'' he said.

FORMER CHIEFS RUNNING BACK, TWO OTHERS ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and RANDY COVITZ  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former Kansas City Chiefs running back Bam
Morris and two others operated a marijuana trafficking ring
financed in part by the team's kick returner, Tamarick Vanover,
according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Chiefs President Carl Peterson announced the team
had cut Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday charged Morris and two associates
with conspiring to transport more than 200 pounds of marijuana from
Texas into Missouri and Kansas. Morris appeared in U.S. District
Court in Kansas City on Friday to face the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' agent predicted his client would be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   The records allege that before Vanover pleaded guilty to a car
theft charge in a related case last February, he admitted to an FBI
agent that he had given Morris $40,000 to buy marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Vanover's cooperation, prosecutors agreed not to
charge him with further crimes arising out of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson announced Vanover's release in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, I indicated that I would continue to weigh the
facts as they became known to me as a federal case involving
Tamarick Vanover continued to evolve,'' Peterson stated.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said he had reviewed the federal records and ``found it
necessary to terminate him as a member of the Kansas City Chiefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Peterson announced his decision, Vanover's lawyer,
Michael Yonke, had declined to comment on the charges against
Morris and his client's cooperation with authorities. Yonke could
not be reached for comment Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged with Morris, 28, of Cooper, Texas, were Dewayne
Calvin Bryant, 28, of Dallas, and Robert Corey Myers, 22, of
Warrensburg, Mo. They were charged with one count each of
conspiring to obtain and distribute marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is in custody in Texas, while Myers remains a fugitive,
said FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, each of the defendants could face up to 40 years
in prison and $2 million in fines. Morris' case
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who retired from the Chiefs after last season, made a
brief court appearance Friday morning after FBI agents arrested him
about 5 p.m. Thursday at the Overland Park, Kan., home of a friend.
U.S. Magistrate Judge John T. Maughmer ordered Morris held in
federal custody until a bond hearing next week.
</P>
<P>
   Shackled at his hands and feet, Morris said nothing during the
hearing. Afterward, Morris' lawyer declined to comment on the
charge, saying he had not yet reviewed the government's evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lavenstein, Morris' Baltimore-based agent, said he thought
Morris would be exonerated and pointed at Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very obvious on the face of this affidavit that Tamarick
Vanover is not only attempting to save his (rear) from going to
jail, he's trying to save his NFL career,'' Lavenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. acknowledged that Vanover's
cooperation has been helpful. But he declined to comment on the
disparity between the charge to which Vanover pleaded and the
conduct cited in Friday's records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied with Mr. Vanover's cooperation at this time,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest allegations are part of a federal drug-trafficking
and stolen-car investigation that has resulted in charges against
at least 26 persons in California, Missouri, Tennessee, Florida,
North Carolina and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover's former personal assistant, Gregory D. Burns, also is
facing drug trafficking charges. Court records show he, too, is
cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Morris offered new insights into Vanover's
role in the alleged conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the records, Vanover acknowledged in three
interviews with FBI agent Larry Tongate that he wrote Morris a
$70,000 check on April 2, 1999. Most of that money was to be used
to buy marijuana in Texas, Vanover said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanover stated that $30,000 of this money was a personal loan
to Morris,'' Tongate wrote in an affidavit. ``Vanover stated that
Morris was to use the remaining $40,000 to purchase 100 pounds of
marijuana at $400 per pound.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanover also said he had been in telephone contact with Morris
and Bryant to arrange the shipment of marijuana from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When the dope arrived, however, Burns complained that the
shipment did not weigh 100 pounds and was of poor quality. Burns
told FBI agents later that he eventually sold the marijuana to
Myers and a partner in Warrensburg, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns also said he had misappropriated money that Vanover had
intended for drug purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Once, investigators said, Vanover had transferred $35,000 to
Burns' bank account for a drug purchase. But instead of using the
money to buy marijuana, Burns spent it on legal fees related to a
March 1999 Louisiana arrest for cocaine possession, records said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the complaint alleges that Morris and the others
conspired to distribute more than 200 pounds of marijuana. Morris'
past
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Morris was convicted for possession of at least five
pounds of marijuana in Rockwall County, Texas. Though Morris did
not serve any jail time for that conviction, he served three months
in prison in 1998 for missing probation meetings related to the
drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sumrow, criminal district attorney for Rockwall County, said
his office already has moved to revoke Morris' probation. He said
he also would ask the federal courts in Missouri to hold him in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A warrant has been issued,'' Sumrow said. ``We will formally
file our motion to revoke on Monday. He is not eligible for bond in
Texas, and we will ask the court (in Missouri) to honor our
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is a two-time offender of the NFL's substance abuse
policy, which led to four-week suspensions at the beginning of the
1996 and 1997 seasons. After signing with the Chiefs in 1998,
Morris underwent weekly drug tests by the NFL and monthly tests by
the authorities in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges stem from an April 1999 traffic stop in Leawood,
Kan., in which Morris and Bryant were found in a stolen Ford
Expedition that contained marijuana residue, court records said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no drug charges were filed, and Rockwall County
authorities decided not to revoke Morris' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover, who signed a restructured contract on Feb. 29, had been
a regular participant in the Chiefs' off-season conditioning
program that began two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though cut from the Chiefs, Vanover could be picked up by
another team.
</P>
<P>
   The league has been following developments involving Vanover,
said Greg Aiello, vice president of public relations for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello could not comment on Vanover's specific situation, but he
said players could face discipline for drug-related violations of
law, according to the NFL's substance-abuse program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players being involved in drug-related incidents can trigger
the mandatory evaluation and treatment phase,'' Aiello said. ``You
don't have to wait for a conviction. That is not a punitive action.
That's an attempt to address a problem...for reasonable cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't assume he's not already in the program.''

THE MOLTING OF A BOY BAND: 'N SYNC SPREADS ITS WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ko) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until last month 'N Sync was the second-banana boy band, seen
almost universally as a Backstreet Boys knockoff. They had followed
an accelerated version of the Boys' game plan: grooming by Trans
Continental Management in Orlando, Fla., material from the same pop
factories that serve the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears and an
album released first in Germany, yielding European hits and then a
big American payoff. A 1998 Christmas album, ``Home for
Christmas,'' garnered additional sales but not much more respect.
</P>
<P>
   Then 'N Sync's third album, ``No Strings Attached'' (Jive), sold
1.1 million copies in the United States the day it was released,
March 21. Within a week it had sold 1.3 million more, and it has
now passed 3.8 million. The group's entire national tour, which
reaches Madison Square Garden on July 25, is already sold out.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync is, for the moment, the biggest thing in pop: the
people's choice at the cash register. This time, 'N Sync is after
more than popularity. It has reached that inevitable career moment
when, believe it or not, it hopes to be taken seriously for its
artistic ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The sales statistics are a tribute to Jive Records' skill at
building anticipation for ``No Strings Attached.'' The first
million fans bought the album on the strength of a single (``Bye
Bye Bye'') and its video, along with Internet song previews and
mostly 'N Sync brand recognition: the expectation that ``No Strings
Attached'' would not be very different from the band's 1998 album,
`` 'N Sync,'' which has sold 7.9 million copies in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Fans awaited more sweetly harmonized ballads, chiming uptempo
pop tunes and shy but ardent promises of love. In its marketing 'N
Sync retained the pop-pinup style that got the group this far.
What's in the package, however, is a little different. ``No Strings
Attached'' is, for one thing, the first boy-band album with a song
about video cybersex, ``Digital Get Down,'' a clear indicator of
post-pubescent consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync has developed artistic aspirations right on schedule.
Three albums into their career, in 1967, the Monkees demanded to
choose what they sang and a chance to play their own instruments.
After two albums, the Spice Girls started to release solo projects.
A.J. McLean of the Backstreet Boys has lately taken to performing
with his own band as Johnny No Name.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, maybe impossible, for teen-age idols to be
content with mere fame and wealth; they want recognition on their
own. No matter how lucrative a fabricated pop product is, rock's
mythology insists that performers can't simply be mouthpieces for
shadowy control-room authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Stars are supposed to mean what they sing, to be expressing
themselves, not following orders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the egos of young men who hear thousands of girls
screaming their names can't help expanding. Inevitably they want to
unleash their own grand concepts.
</P>
<P>
   So 'N Sync made a break. In legal wrangling that ended with an
undisclosed settlement last year, 'N Sync severed its contract with
Trans Continental Management and switched labels, leaving RCA for
Jive. 'N Sync didn't stray very far; it held on to its manager and
mentor from Trans Continental, Johnny Wright, and moved to the
label that also releases the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up was enough for 'N Sync to proclaim its newfound
self-determination; the cover of ``No Strings Attached'' shows five
cute young men who don't want to be puppets any more.
</P>

<P>
   Which is not to say that they're unassisted. On ``No Strings
Attached,'' 'N Sync still draws on Swedish and German songwriters
that they share with the Backstreet Boys. This time, however, Veit
Renn collaborates with JC Chasez of 'N Sync, while the group's main
lead singer, Justin Timberlake, helped write and produce ``I'll Be
Good for You.'' In interviews, 'N Sync's members have insisted that
they chose the album's producers and songwriters themselves.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   They are clearly determined not to simper so much. `` 'N Sync''
and ``Home for Christmas'' were split between smoothly pumping
synthesizer tracks and the style of Babyface Edmonds, with an
acoustic guitar wafting across gently swaying rhythms. The ballads
soothed adults while cozying up to teen-agers, and they landed 'N
Sync on so-called adult contemporary radio stations as well as Top
40 outlets. It's the key to long-running pop sales; young fans rush
out to buy the album immediately while older ones wait for it to
sink in.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync hasn't entirely jettisoned that approach _ what, and
give up a potential market? _ but its quieter songs don't arrive
until halfway through ``No Strings Attached,'' and there aren't
many of them. 'N Sync now wants to punch up its sound, moving
closer to the staccato impact of hip-hop. If parents don't like it,
they can skip to ballads like the a cappella ``I Thought She
Knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with artistic freedom, 'N Sync heads straight for the
past: specifically the 1980's rhythm-and-blues that sought to
balance pretty melody atop hip-hop's street-level beat. Like the
Rolling Stones discovering 1950s Chicago blues, 'N Sync has latched
onto the highly synthesized, jigsaw rhythms of 1980s phenomena like
Michael Jackson, New Edition and Zapp. In a direct tribute to the
new jack swing of the 1980s, 'N Sync remakes Johnny Kemp's 1988 hit
``Just Got Paid'' with its original producer, Teddy Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye Bye Bye,'' is the opening salvo of 'N Sync's new
pugnacity. Though the vocal harmonies could have been set to a
ballad, the song gives a girlfriend the heave-ho amid choppy
double-time drums and whooshing electronic chords gleaned from
``Thriller.'' Not that the group stays angry; most of the album is
full of the usual boy-band come-ons, as 'N Sync vows to provide
endless love and heal broken hearts.
</P>
<P>
   To be up to date, it borrow's TLC's songwriter and producer,
She'kspere, for ``It Makes Me Ill,'' a put-down of a rival. But
there's also a would-be wedding song in the group's old
sticky-sweet style: ``This I Promise You,'' by the 1980s pop
hitmaker Richard Marx.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly rampant creativity, and 'N Sync's voices are
pallid compared with those of Boyz II Men, Jodeci or Dru Hill. But
at least Chasez's collaborations show glimmers of nuttiness. The
cyberleer of ``Digital Get Down'' arrives with the vocoder-filtered
voices that Cher revived in ``Believe.'' And in ``Space Cowboy,''
amid sputtering electronics and a chorus stolen from George
Clinton's ``Atomic Dog,'' 'N Sync sings about ignoring millennial
prophecies and heading for ``heavenly bodies'' in space instead.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In its own cautious, mild-mannered way, 'N Sync is straining at
the limitations of the boy-band format, trying to add acceptable
levels of personality to its pop commodity without offending too
many consumers. It didn't turn the Monkees into geniuses, either,
but you can't blame a boy band for trying. Next: public squabbles,
tabloid exploits, solo albums, obscure years and a reunion tour
where old fans can bring their children.
